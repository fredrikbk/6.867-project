raising women to be leaders the four sullivan sisters learned to work early aim high and try again denise sullivan was nine years old and her sister maggie was eight when they organized their first carnival to raise money for muscular dystrophy they mobilized friends on their block to build game booths in their backyard in elberon n j they rode their bikes to other neighborhoods to post signs advertising the carnival and collected used toys for prizes one year they raised &# charging a penny a game "we discovered we liked handling money and liked being in charge " says maggie they have been bouncing business ideas off one another ever since handling more and more money as they have taken charge of bigger and bigger enterprises denise sullivan morrison years old is president of campbell usa at campbell soup co having advanced through a variety of high octane jobs at nestle sa nabisco kraft foods inc and other food giants maggie sullivan wilderotter is chairman and ceo of citizens communications co a &# billion telecommunications company their two younger sisters also are executives colleen bastkowski is a regional vice president of sales at expedia inc s expedia corporate travel andrea doelling a champion horse jumper now devoting time to equestrian competition most recently was senior vice president of sales at at&amp t wireless it is rare for four brothers to achieve such levels of success the fact that they are sisters is striking half of all managers in the u s are female but most are stuck in midlevel staff jobs in senior posts men outnumber women by almost six to one the sullivan sisters as they were known growing up beat these odds in large part because of their upbringing their father an at&amp t inc executive wanted to share everything he knew about business with his girls including talking to them while they were still in grade school about setting profit margin goals their mother taught them that ambition is a part of femininity dennis sullivan a korean war veteran who started his career at new jersey bell expected to raise at least one son when he had four daughters he imbued them with his intense work ethic and encouraged them to be independent and determined and to cultivate big goals "he didnt have sons to mentor so he was stuck teaching us " says maggie he brought home models of the princess trimline phone when it was being developed and talked about marketing he took the girls to his office decades before the launch of "bring your daughters to work day " and he showed through his own climb how getting ahead requires changing jobs frequently to gain broad experience from new jersey bell he moved to new york telephone then to at&amp t back to new york telephone and at&amp t to ohio bell to at&amp t again and finally to cincinnati bell where he was chief financial officer "i tried to inculcate them with what the business world is like how products get launched customers sampled and about all the interesting people i met and how they could be part of that " says mr sullivan "id ask them what their goals were and when they told me id add a few more to their list " mr sullivan told each of his daughters to read at least one book a week and then write a report about it he also expected them to get as in school when president kennedy promoted the royal canadian air force fitness regimen he woke his family at a m to exercise together "rise and shine hed shout to us and wed all have to do leg lifts " says denise connie sullivan his wife of years was equally disciplined a self professed perfectionist who still wakes up at every morning she designed her daughters halloween costumes by august each year dressed stylishly and enjoyed decorating her home but she wasnt a traditional housewife she became a realtor when her youngest daughter started school and soon earned a spot in her employers million dollar club selling &# homes "money was tight then " she says and she was able to boost her familys income the sullivans expected their daughters to choose activities they liked and to figure out on their own how to excel at them aim high they said and if you dont get what you want analyze what went wrong and try again when denise the eldest sister didnt make her high school cheerleading team at she quickly set her sights on becoming a baton twirler in the marching band a teacher tried to dissuade her saying she didnt walk gracefully but denise talked to her mother and concluded "i think what the teacher is saying is im a little pigeon toed " recalls connie sullivan denise worked to correct the problem by taking long walks she became captain of the team and the first twirler in her school to perform with a fire lit baton her mother worried she might get hurt but instead of stopping her sewed her a fireproof twirling outfit maggie "the one who was always pushing the envelope " she says was elected to student government and raised money for community causes in ninth grade she was summoned to the principals office to take a call from the white house an assistant to president nixon told her the president appreciated her invitation to a local benefit for vietnam veterans but couldnt attend "isnt he at least going to pay for the dinner tickets i sent " maggie asked the presidents check arrived the next week several years later when andrea asked her parents to buy her a horse her father who was being transferred from cleveland back to new jersey told her to figure out what that would cost andrea who was called horse breeders trainers and moving companies and concluded it would be most economical to buy a horse in ohio and transport it east in a van owned by a cleveland race track she showed her father her cost analysis and got the horse by then their father was being transferred frequently for work colleen attended three high schools and learned to make new friends quickly by developing a unique sense of humor she created her own stand up comedy routine "i learned to not get upset or bothered by change and to be able to adapt to new situations " she says wherever they were the sisters had to earn their allowance every saturday each chose a slip of paper from a big glass jar their parents called "the job jar " on which was written a chore washing and drying the dishes for example or shoveling snow they could negotiate with one another and swap chores but had to do something as teenagers they also found paying jobs the teamwork their parents expected at home evolved into a support network despite their competitiveness with each other at times "sure we fought sometimes like cats and dogs but we didnt float in the same circles so we could give each other a different perspective " says maggie when their younger sisters started working denise and maggie encouraged them to take jobs in sales where individual performance is quantifiable colleen and andrea both advanced in sales at at&amp t and at&amp t wireless colleen sought her sisters advice about her compensation contract when she was hired at expedia "we call ourselves the network because we each have different skills that we draw on " says colleen who calls andrea every day and usually talks with her older sisters once a week "denise is the strategist maggie the networker andrea the communicator and im the competitive one " says colleen she started out as a secretary at at&amp t when given a chance in sales she brought in so many new accounts she was promoted to management denise and maggie were "the pioneers who paved the way for us " says andrea they were among the first generation of women to seek management jobs both went to jesuit colleges denise to boston college and maggie to holy cross both worked part time to help pay their tuition and married soon after they graduated they chose different business paths denise took a sales job at procter &amp gamble co s paper products division in boston and maggie accepted an accounting job at a start up in california both were often the only women at business meetings in the late s when denise became the first woman in her p&amp g division to become pregnant her boss warned her she would be fired if she didnt return from maternity leave in six weeks she tried to humor him saying "just pretend i broke a leg and cant walk around the stores for a while " she never tolerated being held back when her husband got a job in new york denise asked for a transfer within p&amp g and was told she would have to take a lower level position even though she was leading her divisions top sales team she declined and found a better job at pepsico inc "i learned then to manage my own career and that loyalty to people counts more than loyalty to any one company " maggie had an easier start in silicon valleys start up culture she followed her husband an air force pilot to sacramento and joined cable data a software company with employees founder bob matthews went out of his way to advance and retain women offering friday night baby sitting services free dry cleaning and other perks in her years there maggie held different jobs including a stint as manager of regional operations the job gave her profit and loss responsibility "something a lot of women never get " she says always pushing to expand her business network maggie went after a seat on the national cable television associations board ten board seats were held by ceos of the top cable companies her biggest customers two seats were reserved for vendor companies such as cable data maggie called every vendor to try to get votes just as she had done in high school when she called every attorney in her local phone book until she found one willing to hire her as a typist she lost her first attempt to get on the board but made a successful bid the following year her fellow directors were shocked she says "i was a vice president of a tiny company and this was a ceo club " she says she and denise supported one anothers decision to keep working after they had children agreeing they didnt want to quit careers they loved when maggie was nine months pregnant with her first child she jumped on a plane because a customer refused to sign a contract unless she was there in person when her two sons were young she and her husband who bought a vineyard after retiring from the air force agreed he would be the one to stay close to home denise divorced and remarried in her early s she and her second husband who also has a daughter blended families and shared parenting all the while she analyzed her career moves to see what experience she needed to advance she kept a chart recording her tenure in each job how much money she was responsible for how many people she supervised and what she had accomplished when her husband told her he wanted to run a fruit farm in bakersfield calif denise who had joined nestle told her boss "the good news is i want to stay at nestle and the bad news is i have to move to bakersfield " "wheres bakersfield " he asked she reminded him that carnation which nestle had just acquired had an ice cream plant in bakersfield she set up her office there and made it nestles national sales office for frozen chilled foods but it took close to years before denise became general manager in charge of a business and she had to create the business she ran a top sales executive at nabisco by then she wrote a business plan proposing a single serve line of snacks former nabisco ceo jim kilts liked the plan and put denise in charge of what became known as the down the street devision this single serve snack division is now run by kraft which acquired nabisco while denise preferred the reach of big corporations maggie felt less pigeonholed and able to advance faster in smaller companies "i didnt get stuck in any one area like finance or sales which would have driven me crazy and i could skip a few rungs at a time " says maggie so in the late s she became ceo of wink a small start up that was owned by microsoft corp but when wink was sold she was recruited by microsoft ceo steve ballmer to expand the computer giants government and educational markets she stayed just two years then in once again was helped by her contacts to jump to the corner office at citizens based in stamford conn she knew five of citizens directors because she had served on a board with them a decade earlier since taking charge she has helped to recruit five women and an african american to what had been an all white all male board "so it better reflects our customers " she says she and her husband now keep homes on both coasts the sullivan sisters all are married to men who accommodate their wives careers and dont seem threatened by their spouses achievements or job demands denise followed her husband to california but he followed her back to the east coast when she joined nabisco colleens and andreas spouses also moved with their wives as promotions took them around the country neither couple has children when the sisters are traveling for business they sometimes stay at each others homes denise is based in new jersey maggie commutes between connecticut and northern california where colleen also lives and andrea is in denver in the workplace the sisters have had to outperform men take jobs men didnt want and draw on the perseverance they learned as children andreas chance to be a regional sales manager took her to birmingham ala when it was at&amp t wirelesss worst performing region three prior male managers had failed there she went on sales calls with employees and purchased a ship captains bell for the office "anytime anyone sold something they rang the bell and even though it seemed hokey at first it made people feel like winners " she says in months the region went from last to first place the sisters continue to make their own opportunities another lesson learned from their parents when denise was recruited to campbell soup in camden n j four years ago as head of global sales she wouldnt sign on until she was assured she would soon be in line to head a big division denise is now in charge of campbells &# billion soup sauces and beverage division in the u s the companys largest business and her challenge is to revitalize old brands she has reshuffled her senior team and is rolling out shopping carts of new products known by some employees for having "an iron fist in a velvet glove " she never ends a meeting until her managers agree on a plan and deadlines "i want to see volume growth in the next few weeks " she told the head of sales at a recent meeting what she really wants is to be ceo of a fortune company it is a job just women currently hold and one that would put her a notch ahead of maggie one of women heading fortune companies "ive been preparing to run a big company all my life " says denise
