politics &amp economics north korea snarls efforts to end nuclear standoff beijing the latest effort by the u s china and three other countries to talk north korea into giving up its pursuit of nuclear weapons is at risk of failure because of disagreement over one major point the energy incentives they will provide pyongyang the snag spoiled what was expected to be quick approval of a sweeping deal that was largely arranged by the u s in a two way discussion with north korea last month negotiators last night said they will continue working on the problem for just one more day then will end the current round of talks with or without an agreement "there is a point in which you set a deadline and lay out your position and hope the other side is interested in trying to cut a deal " said christopher hill the u s envoy to the talks the problem emerged on the first day of the talks on thursday as north korea insisted the energy assistance it is being offered in stages occur all at once mr hill said rather than in phases delegates from other countries in the talks said over the weekend that north koreas request was excessive north korea envoy kim kye gwan doesnt usually talk to reporters until the end of a round of talks the u s and other participants in the talks want to phase in energy assistance increasing it each time north korea takes another step toward getting rid of nuclear weapons "were not interested in just stopping at initial steps " mr hill said "were interested in completing the journey to denuclearization " the stakes are high for the u s which since the norths test of a nuclear device in october has stepped up its diplomatic efforts to reverse pyongyangs desire for such weapons success with north korea might help the u s persuade another budding nuclear power iran to give up its work too a failure to reach a deal would again raise questions about north koreas willingness to compromise which has appeared low from the first round of talks in august the viability of the six party negotiating process also is in jeopardy japan south korea and russia are other members of the six party talks the six countries failed to reach a deal the last time they met in mid december diplomats entered that round with high hopes also but north koreas delegates said they werent able to negotiate mr hill subsequently held three days of meetings with the norths mr kim in berlin last month resolved several disputes and formed the framework of a deal under it north korea would shut down its sole nuclear plant which provides spent fuel that can be reprocessed into weapons material and begin to take other disarmament steps it also would take steps toward friendlier relations with the u s japan and south korea in return the five countries would provide north korea with economic assistance chiefly in the form of free fuel oil and electricity the u s would resolve a portion of a banking dispute with north korea the countries planned to set up five working groups to implement the various parts of the deal and schedule regular meetings as often as every month late last night mr hill said "i think we have a real problem if we cant reach an agreement on this "
