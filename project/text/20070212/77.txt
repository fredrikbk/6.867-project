private funds show interest in wtc site a move that could bolster development the port authority of new york and new jersey the owner of the world trade center has begun discussions to shop the freedom tower hoping to lure private equity or hedge funds into owning all or part the &# billion skyscraper people familiar with the situation said separately the agency is in talks to sell development rights to one of the five planned skyscrapers there to j p morgan chase &amp co the people said taken together the interest by private sector money in the site would represent a major advance for the much maligned development which has thus far relied almost completely on government support and insurance proceeds steve coleman a port authority spokesman said "we dont comment on discussions we may or may not be having " a spokesman for j p morgan new york declined to comment jones lang lasalle inc is representing the port authority as broker in the negotiations david lichtenstein chief executive of lightstone group a lakewood n j real estate investment firm said he thinks that depending on the price and conditions any number of private investors including his own firm would be interested in equity in the freedom tower whose foundation is under construction "in this market i think anything in manhattan would generate interest " he said "thats a no brainer isnt it " mr lichtenstein said he didnt think private investors would necessarily shy away from the tower just because of the sites legacy or the towers potential as a new terrorist target "thats what you have insurance for " he said robert sammons director of research for the real estate services firm colliers abr inc said a flood of investors from private equity firms to pension firms to foreign interests are looking to own a piece of manhattan driving prices to record levels "certainly youre not going to find a better time to try to sell that equity interest " he said designed as the signature skyscraper at ground zero the freedom tower will rise a symbolic feet the structure which has been redesigned several times including a complete overhaul to better protect it from terrorist attacks is set to be completed in the tower has lease commitments from the federal and new york state governments to take one million of the million square feet critics have decried the tower as an obvious terrorist target and a financial white elephant that private sector tenants will shun the first stories of the tower will be taken up by a mostly unoccupied concrete structure to protect the building from possible truck bombs the concrete will be covered with thousands of pieces of decorative glass to minimize any bunkerlike effect say the architects any deal for the freedom tower is unlikely to occur right away people familiar with the matter said a move on tower by j p morgan on the other hand could take place as soon as a month though people familiar with the matter stress the firm is also exploring sites in midtown manhattan or could choose to do nothing if a deal is made j p morgan would purchase a long term ground lease from the port authority for what is known on plans as tower j p morgan would build and occupy a story million square foot office building housing its trading and analyst operations such a move would be a major shot in the arm for the trade center site which has so far failed to land private sector tenants because the tower cant be ready for occupancy before the move reflects the panic new york firms are in to secure office space for the future as the cost of new buildings skyrockets investors have raced in the past year to pay record prices for manhattan office real estate if j p morgan goes ahead with tower it would be a disappointment to private developer larry silverstein who is building three other office towers on the world trade center site he unveiled fanciful architectural designs for his towers with great fanfare last year hoping to lure financial firms to make an early commitment mr silversteins towers are scheduled to be completed at least a year in advance of tower in a deal struck last year the port authority took responsibility for the freedom tower and tower mr silverstein would build towers and a silverstein spokesman declined to comment the tower site however has its own problems the plot is currently occupied by the building that formerly housed offices of deutsche bank ag and was heavily damaged when the twin towers collapsed across the street the razing of that building at liberty street has been stymied for more than three years because of environmental concerns and the discovery of human remains from the attacks on its roof also as currently configured in plans tower is too small to accommodate a floor plan large enough for trading operations to expand its footprint would involve encroaching on adjacent land currently reserved for a park and to rebuild a greek orthodox church destroyed in the attacks the port authority has presented the option of creating enough space by building a cantilevered trading floor that would overhang the adjacent land a j p morgan move to tower would reflect a broader change in the value of residential real estate compared with office buildings last year the port authority with the encouragement of new york mayor michael bloomberg indicated tower would likely be built as a condominium or hotel given the then strong demand for anything with a bed in it since then the residential market has slowed while demand for office space keeps rising real estate has been an important issue for j p morgan as the bank cuts costs under chief executive james dimon mr dimon said in october that the bank had trimmed its real estate portfolio by million square feet in the past two years to million square feet furthermore mr dimon is a fan of state of the art technology so he would likely embrace a facility with the latest tools j p morgan has other ties to the redevelopment of downtown manhattan charles maikish executive director of the lower manhattan construction command center which coordinates the construction is a former j p morgan real estate executive robin sidel contributed to this article
