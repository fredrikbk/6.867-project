politics &amp economics obamas improbable quest after official entry his task is to conquer questions of experience ames iowa illinois sen barack obama formally opened what he calls his "improbable quest" for the presidency styling his campaign as a crusade in which americans biggest enemy is cynicism "the belief that we cant change things anymore " his own challenge is battling cynicism that he has the experience and ideas to make such change after two years in the u s senate and eight in the illinois senate the year old mr obama remains relatively untested as he seeks to make history as the first african american president his sudden fame owes to his charismatic style and eloquence in two best selling books and a memorable address at the democratic convention so now perhaps more than any other candidate in the crowded race he is under pressure to show some policy substance as well mr obama knows that in a weekend tour of iowa site of the first presidential contest after announcing his candidacy saturday in abraham lincolns springfield ill the senator offered a few specifics to iowans questions he said he opposed defense spending cuts for example and called for direct u s talks with north korea on nuclear weapons mostly he kept up an audience stirring diagnosis of the nations ills and offered promises chiefly to provide universal health care by the end of a first term but no specific remedies by yesterday sensitive to critics calling for details he took the offensive during a news conference at the university of iowa "one of the narratives thats established itself in the mainstream media is this notion that well you know obama has a pretty good style he can deliver a pretty good speech but he seems to prioritize rhetoric over substance now factually thats incorrect " mr obama said he said he has "the most specific plan" on leaving iraq gave major speeches on health education and energy in the two years before he decided to run for president and has two books giving more "insights into how i think and how i feel about the issues facing america than any candidate in the field " as for the press he teased "youve been reporting how i look in a bathing suit" referring to a photo taken while he visited hawaii over the holidays he and top campaign aides promised specifics will come noting that the campaign has only begun meanwhile as mr obamas announcement confirmed he will seek to turn his inexperience to advantage positioning himself as a washington outsider "i recognize that there is a certain presumptuousness a certain audacity to this announcement " he told the thousands braving frigid temperatures for his announcement in the square before illinois old state capitol in springfield "i know that i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change " by that message he separates himself from new york sen hillary clinton though he remains significantly behind her in polls organization and money but among the rest of the democratic field he is a top competitor for what amounts to a spot as the clinton alternative against former north carolina sen john edwards while mr edwards is ahead in iowa polls mr obama poses a fresh faced challenge after mr obamas packed townhall meeting saturday in cedar rapids year old bonnie young of marion iowa and her year old daughter claudia young both of whom worked for mr edwards presidential bid said they have been torn between the two men the mother left favoring mr obama mr edwards added to the pressure on mr obama to be more specific with his recent unveiling of a health plan but democrats say mr obama provoked the style versus substance talk himself by his recent address to local democratic party leaders meeting in washington in which he seemed dismissive of "white papers" of policy specifics "weve had a lot of plans democrats what weve had is a shortage of hope " as a committee chairman in the illinois senate mr obama tried to get consensus for universal health care but could only pass a measure calling for a study of coverage options now at each campaign stop he calls not only for universal health care but more resources for education and an effort akin to the apollo project to develop alternative fuels to end u s reliance on mideast oil and help arrest global warming but no such progress is possible he adds "until we bring this ill conceived war in iraq to a close " the applause for that line from the mostly democratic crowds made plain that the war is the issue most on voters minds mr obama reminds them to more applause "i was against this war from the start" which distinguishes him as many iowa democrats know from mrs clinton and mr edwards and he outlines his iraq plan a phased withdrawal of all u s combat troops starting in may and ending by the end of march next year allowing for enough u s forces to keep training iraqi forces mr obama didnt always give the answers his inquisitors may have liked in cedar rapids to a question from a man associated with a group that espouses reduced military spending the senator said that because the iraq war "has depleted our military theres probably going to be a bump under an obama presidency in initial spending just to get back to where we were " to a public school teacher he reiterated his call for teachers to be paid significantly more "i have to say though theres got to be a bargain " he added in which teachers in turn accept greater accountability for performance corrections &amp amplifications democratic
