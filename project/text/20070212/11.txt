buzz on bristol myers bid could spur share selloff sanofi buyout talk might have raised stock near its peak bristol myers squibb co s days as an independent drug company may be numbered the smartest bet to place on a possible takeover however might be to sell the companys shares now bristol myerss pipeline of promising new drugs has made the new york company an attractive target moreover problems that had kept bidders at bay appear to be lifting a federal patent trial on the popular anticlotting drug plavix appears to be breaking bristol myers squibbs way and strict federal oversight of the company in the wake of an accounting scandal several years ago is on the verge of ending analysts also note the companys interim chief executive has a reputation for making deals still some investors say the bulk of any transaction premium already is priced into the stock bristol myers shares recently rose about after a report in the french media said sanofi aventis sa of france may be taking steps to make a deal bristol myers which has a market value of about &# billion has been trading just below &# on the new york stock exchange for nearly two weeks bristol myers shares fell cents to &# in p m composite trading friday on the big board the company trades at about times estimated per share earnings for richer than sanofis price earnings ratio of the value of bristol myers based on its pipeline and current products is about &# a share some analysts estimate an acquisition by sanofi might take bristol myerss stock into the low &# s they say short of a bidding war some investors figure there isnt much room for bristol myers to move a lot higher and there is downside risk "the stock has had a huge move in the last two weeks on takeout speculation not on fundamentals " says jami rubin a pharmaceuticals analyst at morgan stanley which counts both bristol myers and sanofi as investment banking clients and owns shares of both companies "what if bristol announces a new ceo in the next month " ms rubin asks "that means the likelihood of a deal coming down is reduced and then the market starts to view bristol from a purely fundamental perspective " she rates bristol myers "equal weight " or a "hold " bristol myers and sanofi aventis both declined to comment on the potential for a takeover speculation about sanofi as a possible acquirer is likely to continue the companies are partners in the marketing of plavix and avapro a blood pressure pill other companies would likely balk at buying bristol myers before knowing the verdict of the plavix patent case that was brought against a company that wants to sell a generic version of the drug that uncertainty leaves sanofi with a clear shot at a takeover bid shares of sanofi and bristol myers would likely rise or fall in tandem however the trial is decided franz humer chief executive of swiss drug maker roche holding ag observed last week that sanofi is a logical bidder for bristol myers because it has the most information on the plavix agreement including the drugs fate in a change of control mr humer said roche isnt interested in such a deal also fueling speculation is bristol myerss loss of ceo peter dolan last year after canadian generics maker apotex inc outfoxed bristol myers in negotiations to protect plavix apotex briefly sold a generic version of the drug cutting deeply into bristol myerss sales bristol myerss interim chief executive james cornelius is seen as a deal maker and steered medical device maker guidant corp where he also served as interim chief through a &# billion sale to boston scientific corp last year even optimists about a bristol myers takeover dont think a sale is necessarily imminent the company is on a short leash with federal prosecutors it is bound by a deferred prosecution agreement with the u s attorney in new jersey over a previous accounting scandal that could deter suitors including sanofi at least for now the agreement is set to expire in june if bristol myers stays out of trouble a recent deal bristol myers made with astrazeneca plc over development and marketing of two diabetes drugs has perplexed bristol myers watchers the drugs called saxagliptin and dapagliflozin are major items in bristol myerss pipeline but the revenue sharing pact for them with astrazeneca diminishes bristol myerss value to potential acquirers some analysts say the move may have created an incentive for sanofi to get moving with an offer before bristol myers makes other deals like it another reason sanofi might hold off a little longer is a decision by the food and drug administration due in late april on sanofis weight loss treatment acomplia approval which many analysts expect after a delay early last year could boost sanofis share price providing a richer currency to use to buy bristol myers an outcome either way would help the company determine whether it really needs to make a big acquisition patient investors who hang on to bristol myers shares might ultimately profit from a bidding war for the company or simply from the potential for growth from its pipeline and newly launched products bear stearns &amp co drug analyst john boris said competitive bids could emerge for bristol myers after an outcome in the plavix suit bristol myers might fetch &# a share he wrote in a note to investors last week mr boris rates bristol myers shares "peer perform " or hold bristol myers and sanofi are noninvestment banking clients of the bear stearns cos unit some investors arent sure that they want to wait around dayle malone a senior portfolio manager at old second wealth management a unit of old second bancorp inc says his aurora ill firm which has &# billion in assets reduced its stake in bristol myers as the plavix debacle unfolded last summer now he is considering unloading the firms remaining shares while mr malone thinks the chances of a loss in the plavix trial are low he says "i dont think i really would get paid enough on the upside here to take that risk "
