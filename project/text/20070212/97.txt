abc news correspondent deborah roberts and they have three children mr roker struggled for many years with his weight attempting diets like atkins and weight watchers only to lose pounds and gain them back in he decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery the procedure divides the stomach into two compartments food is rerouted to bypass the lower compartment and the amount of food a person can eat in

about pounds now mr roker weighs pounds he works out with a trainer three days a week the workout about a year and a half ago mr roker noticed he was starting to gain back some of the weight he lost after his gastric bypass procedure he called up a trainer who he had worked with sporadically over the past ten years "thirty pounds crept back on and i wanted to get rid of it " says mr roker "i know myself im one of those people who will pick up the weights at the gym and i dont know what to do with them i need someone there to push me or i wont do it " mr roker takes a taxi to casa spa and fitness at the regency hotel on park ave three mornings a week he meets his trainer by a m in order to fit in an hour long workout before he has to be at the studio mr roker warms up at a moderate level of intensity on the bike and then transitions into a hill program where his trainer will increase the speed and resistance after about to minutes he does some stretches and then about to minutes of strength training he finishes with a cool down mr rokers trainer has him use the power plate an oscillating platform on which various exercises can be performed the vibrating platform creates an unstable environment the vibrations apply impact to his body without compromising his joints little waves of impact are sent through his body as he does a push up or squat on the platform as the platform pushes up against the body it increases the bodys perceived mass up to three times so the person gets the benefit of bearing extra weight in momentary intervals rather than holding a heavy load of weight for a long period of time mr roker began using the power plate to improve his stability and balance but has now progressed to focusing on improving his strength and endurance a typical full body routine incorporates both strength and flexibility mr roker will start with a basic squat then a lunge followed by bicep curls lateral shoulder raises upper back and mid back pulls instead of sets and repetitions his strength exercises are all time based usually lasting for a duration of between to seconds per set some exercises are static on weekends mr roker tries to run two to three miles at the central park reservoir and sometimes hell fit in a run when he gets home from work around or p m "im not a world class runner " admits mr roker "im not even a halfway decent runner " while mr roker admits to loathing the gym he does enjoy getting out on his bike "i was a new york kid so i used to ride my bike around queens " he says "and i have bad knees so cycling is a good non impact exercise for me " he has participated in the new york five boro bike tour several times and this summer hopes to ride in the montauk century a mile ride "riding lets me clear my head and its somewhat solitary " he says "and if you get tired you can coast unlike running " the diet "i used to eat huge amounts of food " says mr roker "if i had ribs id eat a rack or a rack and a half and all of the sides but now ill have two or three ribs and a spoonful of collards and potato salad " after his gastric bypass surgery mr roker was forced to limit his portion sizes mr roker will eat a banana

which also included a basic orientation of the gym personal training packages cost from &# to &# an hour the most recent model of the gary fisher zebrano bike he bought years ago retails for around &# the effort "you need to stop whining and just do it " says mr roker "i hate it all except biking i hate every minute of it but the goal is to get good enough so that i can beat up my trainer and walk away " he jokes he tries to pack sneakers and workout clothes when hes on the road but "life is too short to stress over this stuff " he says the benefit mr roker was lucky that he never had high cholesterol or high blood pressure but says that was probably in his near future if he didnt make the changes he has made to his diet and exercise habits overall he thinks his efforts will help him
