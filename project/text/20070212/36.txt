for lumber producers a new source of pressure orlando fla many of the people who attended last weeks international builders show focused on the latest faucet window and insulation designs on display in the massive convention center here but one small group convened behind closed doors to discuss an issue weighing on the future of u s home building lumber the top brass of the national association of home builders which hosts the annual convention and u s lumber dealers met with wood producers and builders from sweden and russia hoping to entice those countries to export more lumber to the u s the builders and the dealers who supply them want to increase the sources of supply in a market dominated by canadian and american companies at this point they may have trouble making their case the cooling u s housing market has sent lumber prices plummeting a benchmark for the price of framing lumber dropped roughly last year to &# a board feet still the builders and lumber dealers say they want to start working more closely with the russians whose country has an estimated of the worlds timber resources and the swedes well in advance of a rebound in u s home construction the builders effort which has produced few tangible results so far also appears intended to send a message to the u s and canadian governments the two neighbors recently signed an agreement that calls for canada to impose a system of fees and quotas on its softwood lumber exports to the u s when prices fall below a certain threshold jerry howard chief executive of the national association of home builders says the agreement will unfairly raise prices and add volatility to supply and it is forcing his industry to look for new sources of lumber "if i dont get the price of milk at one store that i want i go to another store " says mr howard who traveled to sweden and russia last fall to begin courting lumber suppliers there the groups initiative is the latest salvo in a decades long dispute in past years the trade group had pushed for an end to u s import duties on canadian wood and urged canada to continue fighting those duties after the u s and canada signed their lumber accord last year mr howard says the builders "were upset that the canadians caved in we supported them the best we could we continue to tell them we prefer to do business with our neighbors to the north but we also want to put our members in the best possible business climate " when the dispute flared up in the past mr howard said the group responded by encouraging members to use alternative framing materials such as steel the latest strategy is to try to diversify their sources of lumber supporters of the u s canadian lumber deal say it is less costly and onerous than the import duties the u s previously levied on canadian wood some canadians moreover say they want to put the longstanding dispute to rest "the price of wood is low the builders are happy so whats the problem " says pauline rochefort president of the canadian wood council a trade group canada supplies about a third of the u s s consumption of softwood lumber such as spruce pine and fir most of the rest is produced domestically other countries including germany and sweden supplied about of u s lumber in economists say imports are necessary because u s producers cant always keep up with demand kevin binam chief economist at the western wood products association which represents lumber manufacturers in the western u s says increased imports from russia sweden and other european producers could drive down lumber prices even when demand picks up and thus could hurt producers in the u s and canada many builders say they like canadian lumber because it is strong but lighter to handle than much of the wood grown in the southern u s like canadian softwood lumber from sweden and russia grows slowly in a cold climate and it may have the qualities that appeal to u s builders in the short term with the u s housing market and the dollar both comparatively weak sweden may have more incentive to sell its wood in europe than the u s "at the same time we need a long term strategy " says stefan bergstrom the swedish trade commissioner in chicago "the pure volume of the u s market makes it interesting " doing business in russia is potentially more complicated although russia has a vast supply of timber poor roads sometimes make it difficult to transport the wood out of remote forests another hurdle is that russia has found large and closer markets for its timber products in china and europe it also is gearing up for a potential building boom at home the russian government says it wants to encourage construction of new housing to replace crowded soviet era structures how much of this new housing will be built from wood isnt clear a group of russian home builders spent the week in orlando studying technologies and meeting with u s counterparts given russias planned housing push u s builders might think about what they could export to russia not just what they might import from it
