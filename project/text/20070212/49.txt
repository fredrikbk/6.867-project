internets ubiquity multiplies venues to try web crimes nathan littlefield a year old father of two in methuen mass had never set foot in buffalo n y but that didnt stop prosecutors there from charging him with downloading child pornography david carruthers a british citizen ran a company based in costa rica yet he was charged in an internet gambling case in st louis and rob zicari and his wife janet romano owners of a california based pornography company were indicted for distribution of obscenity across state lines in pittsburgh unlike many crimes with relatively limited geographic scope internet abuses cross every border giving the government enormous leeway these days to pick jurisdictions where it brings cases the sixth amendment of the u s constitution holds that federal criminal cases should be tried in the state and district in which an offense was committed and venues count pittsburgh and st louis for example are viewed by lawyers as much more legally conservative than say boston and san francisco to some critics the process smacks of "forum shopping " a once common practice by plaintiffs attorneys seeking the most hospitable venues to bring civil suits "the big concern is that the government can pick a jurisdiction where the jury will be most sympathetic " says orin kerr a computer crime expert at george washington universitys law school because the internet is everywhere he says "federal law allows the government to pick whatever jurisdiction it wants in an internet crime case " the government denies it is seeking a home court advantage prosecutors may pick venues based on the locale of the federal bureau of investigation office that initiates a case says bureau spokesman paul bresson "in situations where a buffalo agent is talking to a subject in florida " he says the case would likely be brought in buffalo in internet child pornography cases he says the fbi often originates cases against far flung defendants "it is very easy to establish venue if a subject from new mexico sends an image to" maryland "we would have venue" in maryland mr bresson says what is indisputable is that internet crime complaints are rising in the most recent year for which numbers are available there were complaints about alleged internet crimes an increase from according to the fbi and a nearly fivefold increase over while not all of those complaints turn into criminal cases "theres been a pretty exponential increase from year to year" in cybercrime cases says mr bresson the fbi spokesman whatever the statistics ellen podgor a law professor at stetson university in florida is against trying cases far from a defendants home "the government can get jurisdiction everywhere " she says "all they have to show is that there was a person often an fbi agent who uploaded documents" far away from the defendant ms podgor maintains that jurisdiction ought to be based on the locale of alleged perpetrators to make it more convenient for them to go to trial but "inconvenience isnt a defense " says miami lawyer frank rubino who says he has represented about eight defendants in the past months in internet cases brought far from their homes "people are being brought to areas where theyve never been in their lives " he says last julys indictment of mr carruthers of costa rica and other defendants in internet gambling company betonsports plc was brought in st louis new york attorney robert katzberg representing one of the defendants recently told a st louis federal court in a filing that the locale of the federal prosecution has "no real significance other than the fact that the undercover fbi agents decided to conduct their sting" there mr katzberg has asked that the case be moved to miami where most of the defendants reside the court hasnt yet ruled on the request a spokeswoman for the u s attorneys office in st louis says the betonsports indictment "was the result of illegal activity that occurred in our district " in the past courts have often denied defendants motions to transfer cases because of inconvenience in what is believed to be the first case to make such a challenge a federal appeals court ruled in that a california couple who ran an electronic bulletin board there could be charged in tennessee because "venue lies in any district in which the offense was committed " in an internet child pornography case in new york a federal appeals court similarly ruled in that the defendant larry rowe who lived in pikeville ky was properly tried in manhattan but last april a federal judge in alexandria va said defendants in a criminal securities fraud case involving american international group inc could have their case tried in connecticut where most of them lived to avoid inconvenience to them the government had argued that the case should remain in alexandria because that is home to the securities and exchange commissions "edgar" computer server which the defendants allegedly used to commit their crime in the case of mr zicari and ms romano the californians tried in pittsburgh mary beth buchanan u s attorney in that city says the case was brought there because it was where the product pornography was sold "the case could have been brought in any district in which the product was sold " said ms buchanan she acknowledged that her district "may be considered by some to be more conservative" than some others but that the case was her idea of the several men indicted in buffalo last september on charges of downloading child pornography one resides in california another in north carolina and another in ohio mr littlefield for his part was indicted last july in massachusetts of charges of "destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure " federal authorities allege that he fled his home with his computer which he smashed after an fbi agent left him alone to find a lightbulb the buffalo child pornography case came later and the government is seeking to dismiss the property destruction case in his home state and to try him instead in buffalo william fick the boston public defender representing mr littlefield there recently told the court that "the only connection" between mr littlefields conduct and buffalo is "that the agent happened to be sitting in buffalo " the agent could "just as easily have been sitting in alaska or guam " the government has opposed his motion to keep the case in massachusetts
