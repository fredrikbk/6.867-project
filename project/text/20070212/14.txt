coming attractions nbas hoop dreams in d league set to pursue fresh way of watching games in theaters during this weekends all star game in las vegas the national basketball association will hold an invitation only screening party at the mandalay bay hotel to unveil the first broadcast of league games in d high definition but more than the technological feat what is notable about this is that it allows the nba to find a fresh way to bring its sport to fans in movie theaters a few decades ago certain sports events not available on tv would appear in movie theaters such as world cup soccer matches and closed circuit boxing matches but now with hundreds of sports channels and high definition flat screen tv sets getting fans to buy theater tickets requires something extra movie theaters eager to fill empty seats in the face of dvds and movies on demand have begun to try new ways to get consumers out of their homes and some have the digital technology to air live events in december new yorks metropolitan opera showed julie taymors production of mozarts "the magic flute" in u s theaters in high definition it was a sellout now the nba wants next it aims to have games filmed with new d technology developed by vince pace a longtime collaborator with "titanic" director james cameron available in markets hosting junes nba finals the idea is to snag fans wanting a more communal experience but unable to get to the game because it is sold out or in another city instead they can head to the local cineplex equipped with a satellite dish and digital projector and watch a d hd feed among fellow fanatics empty arenas might also handle large crowds twelve nba teams out of were playing at or above capacity through late last week a hoops hungry market like san antonio where of spurs home games have sold out so far this season seems like a natural fit for these presentations moreover the games hurt the local movie business "any day of the week the spurs are playing our attendance drops " says richard cieplechowicz director of operations for san antonio based santikos theatres ltd he expects to see a presentation of the technology today "this is a natural thing for us to do for our business " many of the details including potential ticket costs have yet to be worked out theaters that showed the mets operas charged &# for adults and &# for kids national amusements inc charged as much &# for the boston red sox regular season baseball games it showed in new england theaters in the rival new york yankees always brought the highest price though the technology does elicit a depth of field not seen in the game on a flat screen before especially from low camera angles no one watching will mistakenly think lebron james is about to land in their laps after a dunk if d broadcasts catch on however the league hopes to enhance its boast that fans of their sport get closer to the action than any others along with providing another reason to head to the theater this would represent a new step for sports neither major league baseball games nor nascar races have played live in d though nascar released a d imax movie in the national football league is giving them the brushoff sticking to its long held policy of keeping mass out of home viewing to the bare minimum though commissioner roger goodell did discuss the concept with national amusements president shari redstone ms redstone says the five yankees games her theaters showed in were sellouts and the company also has had success showing ncaa mens basketball tournament games she says her company has received especially positive feedback from families looking to watch games in a group setting but wanting to avoid bars although some of her newest theaters offer alcohol she also called the nbas new idea "visionary " the nba games will differ in presentation from the baseball broadcasts the red sox games are simply simulcasts of the games television broadcasts but because the nba games would be in d a separate set of cameras and production equipment and staff become necessary and at least initially the games will have no play by play announcers and only ten cameras the games will be shot using pairs of cameras that take in images at slightly different angles like a pair of human eyes the double images are projected onto a screen users watch the broadcasts with a pair of special large round glasses not the red and blue lensed cardboard specs known to b movie fans and each of the lenses filters out one of the projected images giving the viewer a sense of depth time warner inc s tnt plans to have cameras during its all star broadcast sunday while a typical regular season game has about mr pace says he has learned through early experimentation that with his cameras staying with each shot longer aids the production in its attempts to simulate an in game experience "dont chase the ball as much " he says in exploring this new area the nba must also take care not to cannibalize its television partners the nba expects to reach extensions of its deals with tnt and walt disney co s espn which expire in though national tv ratings are uninspiring halfway through this season league executives dont expect six figure audience totals in theaters yet but they do think the project will help increase the sports fan base asked how the league would keep its tv networks happy should this arrangement catch on steve hellmuth senior vice president of operations and technology for nba entertainment replied "wed find a way to include them and include the sponsors of the telecast thats to be worked out down the line but i dont see that as a hurdle " a spokesman for espn which will produce the nba finals on abc said that network executives were aware of the all star presentation but not of the leagues june plans nfl spokesman brian mccarthy suggested his league would hesitate to risk upsetting its tv partners in this way saying "a mass viewing of an nfl game could dramatically affect ratings across the country every game counts in the nfl " jeffrey logsdon an industry analyst for bank of montreals bmo capital markets corp doesnt anticipate special programs like this making or breaking the movie theater industry he says the costs involved are low though not all presentations have drawn well still he says "giving the consumer a better experience can never be a bad thing "
