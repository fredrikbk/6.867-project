media firms say google benefited from film piracy accusations cloud talks on copyright licensing imposing new controls a group of major media companies has accused internet giant google inc of benefiting from the sale of pirated movies and providing business support to two web sites suspected of offering access to illegal film downloads according to several people familiar with the matter the allegations are an embarrassment for google which assured the companies on friday it would take measures to prevent a recurrence of the episode the flare up comes amid what have been often tense negotiations between google and the big film and tv studios over the unauthorized use of copyrighted programming by youtube a free video web site google bought last year after the site quickly became a cultural phenomenon media companies regard internet piracy the unauthorized online transfer of movies music and other copyrighted content as a major threat to their businesses and claim that it has already cost them billions of dollars yet they acknowledge that consumers want the convenience of downloads and the companies dont want to miss out on a potential business opportunity or try to block downloads completely as the music industry for a time unsuccessfully sought to do despite months of talks first with youtube and then with google none of the big tv and film companies have secured broad licensing agreements for their content excerpts from some tv shows such as "the daily show with jon stewart" and "south park " both from viacom inc s comedy central have been huge draws on youtube at the core of the media companies dispute with google which isnt a defendant in the piracy case is their claim that google deliberately directed traffic to web sites that were engaged in fostering piracy although people familiar with the situation say the incident doesnt involve large sums of money several media executives say it has led them to question googles internal controls google told the studios on friday it would implement new procedures to prevent recurrences meanwhile talks among several of the media companies about creating a service to rival youtube have heated up again according to company executives involved in the discussions in a move that could also step up pressure on youtube myspace the social networking web site owned by news corp is expected to announce today a video filtering system it hopes will make it easier to bar copyrighted videos from its site the media companies including news corp viacom sony corp general electric co s nbc universal time warner inc and walt disney co based their claims against google on sworn statements made late last year as part of a civil lawsuit brought by hollywood studios against two men accused of operating web sites that allegedly helped users illegally access copyrighted material these statements indicated that google representatives sold ads to these two sites knowing they were doing this and had a close relationship with the two defendants according to people familiar with the matter some of the documents in the case have been sealed and others are inaccessible executives and lawyers for the media companies recently complained directly to google and demanded that it end its support of such sites if any more exist google hasnt been accused of engaging in any illegal activity on friday google responded to the complaints by agreeing to implement a series of measures it believes will help thwart piracy in an afternoon conference call with studio representatives lawyers for google said the company would remove certain ads the companies objected to create a list of approved advertisers and refrain from selling keywords used by rogue sites to lure users to pirated material in addition the google lawyers said the company would introduce internal guidelines on monitoring keywords and train its ad sales force about how to avoid selling such ads a spokesman for google declined to comment on the call or the specific allegations the media companies have leveled against it in a written statement google said it prohibits advertisers from promoting "the sale of copyright infringing materials " it also said "we are continually improving our systems to screen out ads that violate these policies " a spokesman for sony corp s sony pictures said "discussions with google have been ongoing for a while and theres hope it can result in a mutually satisfactory arrangement whereby google will not give support to pirate sites " he declined to comment further google whose informal corporate motto is "dont be evil " generates much of its income by selling ads linked to words or phrases users submit to its search engine it says it doesnt accept ads for counterfeit designer goods for example or certain weapons including firearms most ads are sold through googles automated system but in this case the operators of the movie downloading sites generated enough revenue to win the attention of a google account representative said a person familiar with the case the media companies allegations highlight a major challenge for google how to keep its advertising business flourishing in the often unruly world of internet commerce while also courting big corporations that say some of googles clients are trying to undermine their businesses the defendants in the case brandon drury and luke sample said in sworn statements that google representatives offered them credit to buy advertising on googles search engine they also said google supplied them with keywords including terms such as "bootleg movie download " "pirated " and "download harry potter movie " which boosted traffic to their sites according to people familiar with the case in court filings both men deny any wrongdoing a google employee deposed in the case largely corroborated the defendants accounts these people said the google deposition has been sealed by the court of the &# million in revenue the two sites easydownloadcenter com and thedownloadplace com generated from to &# was paid to google for advertising the people said the sites have since been shut down messrs drury and sample both years old and residents of missouri stand accused of inducing and helping others to infringe on copyrights which like piracy itself is illegal neither man returned repeated phone calls seeking comment the two are representing themselves in the lawsuit which was filed in u s district court for the southern district of new york in october plaintiffs include the major hollywood studios the motion picture association of america an industry lobbying group is coordinating the litigation the two sites offered users a "download manager " for &# a year the software package enabled users to search for movies on the internet and then download them onto their hard drives yet the sites themselves didnt host any illicit material rather they searched free peer to peer file sharing networks such as kazaa limewire and grokster to find the requested material the sites represented themselves as offering legal downloads but often the sites promoted movies that were still showing in theaters which werent available legally online at the time movies the plaintiffs claim were illegally downloaded using the sites include "the incredibles " "lost in translation" and "spiderman " instead of relying on spam emails to drive traffic to their sites the two men decided to rely on google advertising the high volume of traffic on easydownloadcenter com and thedownloadcenter com caught googles attention according to people familiar with the two mens statements to help stoke the traffic further google assigned the sites account representatives who suggested keywords they could bid on google also offered messrs drury and sample credit so they didnt have to use their credit cards to pay googles fees it isnt clear if the offer was accepted google is paid each time a user clicks on ads like those the two men placed on its service the google deposition which was taken late last year suggested that the ties between the internet company and the defendants were close and that google was fully aware of the nature of their business according to people with knowledge of the deposition kevin j delaney and merissa marr contributed to this article
