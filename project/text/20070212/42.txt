if the big six want to talk about co emissions california will listen in response to your feb editorial "legal hot air" the worlds six largest automakers are crying foul about a recent case filed by california seeking redress for co induced damage they argue that courts are not the proper place for this kind of "global" issue this sudden aversion to litigation is perplexing given that these same companies have sued states repeatedly in numerous jurisdictions insisting that the courts must overturn all state laws dealing with greenhouse gas emissions the companies hew to this path of complete resistance despite the fact that the vast majority of climate scientists believe that the world is facing a potential catastrophe let me be clear i also would prefer to reach solutions outside of the courthouse litigation can be expensive and time consuming that is why i asked for a meeting with each of the ceos of the car companies to find practical solutions to global warming if they want to sideline the lawyers and talk about solutions i am all for it meantime they shouldnt call californias lawsuit "frivolous" while maintaining so many lawsuits of their own californias public nuisance case is well grounded in precedent for more than years the supreme court has allowed states to take legal action to prevent the destruction of their air and natural resources in a case called georgia v tennessee copper justice oliver wendell holmes not a man known for indulging frivolous claims wrote "it is a fair and reasonable demand on the part of a sovereign that the air over its territory should not be polluted on a great scale or threatened by the act of persons beyond its control " more recently the supreme court declared "air pollution is of course one of the most notorious types of public nuisance in modern experience " the big six automakers generate of all of the human made carbon dioxide emissions in the u s and at least of such emissions in california yet they oppose any federal action to curtail greenhouse gases to date their intense lobbying has been very successful congress has not improved fuel efficiency standards in years president bush steadfastly refuses to consider caps on greenhouse gases and the environmental protection agency says that the clean air act does not apply to co meanwhile california with more than one thousand miles of coastline and a sierra snow pack containing one third of the states annual water supply faces rising sea levels and rapidly melting snow this threatens levees flood control systems and californias irrigated agriculture already spring snow melt occurs a week earlier with greater flooding than it did years ago the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change just warned us again that the threats from global warming are mounting it is time to act under our tripartite system of government courts have an essential role to play even in issues as complex as global warming justice holmes could be speaking directly to the automakers when he wrote "this is a suit by a state for an injury to it in its capacity of quasi sovereign in that capacity the state has an interest independent of its citizens in all the earth and air within its domain it has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air " and we can add whether emissions of greenhouse gases can harm its economy and environment global warming is a serious unavoidable challenge and we need to face it the path of litigation first taken up by the auto companies is not my preference but a legal cease fire requires that both sides lay down their arms we should use our considerable joint resources to help fashion a common sense and practical approach i stand ready to do so edmund g brown jr attorney general of california sacramento
