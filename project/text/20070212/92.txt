tribune likely to forgo bids and set self help plan in the end nobody is helping tribune co it is going to have to help itself more than four months after tribune put itself on the auction block the newspaper and television concern is leaning away from accepting any of the offers made by outside bidders and instead opting for a restructuring it would do on its own billed as a self help plan by the board members and advisers working on it the plan is widely expected to involve spinning off the companys broadcast division and borrowing money to pay out a one time cash dividend to shareholders said people familiar with the situation tribunes board is expected to discuss the structure of the plan at a meeting early this week these people said a final decision hasnt yet been made and it is possible the company will choose a different option a self help plan would represent an underwhelming conclusion to what has been a public tussle between tribune and its biggest shareholder the chandler family it would highlight the limited choices for newspaper companies facing restive shareholders and difficult business conditions with readers and advertisers defecting from print to online media under pressure from the chandlers which own of tribune and were unhappy with the companys stagnant stock price tribune put itself up for auction in september since then it has considered an all out sale a piecemeal breakup a capital infusion from los angeles moguls and a bid for its newspapers from the chandlers themselves tribunes newspapers include the los angeles times and the chicago tribune the company also owns a string of tv stations none of the offers from outside bidders offered a premium over the current market price hopes that a bidder would improve its offer have dwindled since tribune presented bidders with lackluster results for january and a lowered internal forecast for according to people familiar with the situation the company hopes the self help option which has been on the table for months but has gained traction in recent weeks will appease shareholders frustrated with tribunes stock performance for tribune management an advantage of the plan is that they could remain in charge of the existing newspaper company while the spun off tv company becomes a separate entity the idea of borrowing money to pay a dividend is similar to the proposal put forth by real estate investor eli broad and supermarket magnate ron burkle that proposal which didnt involve spinning off tribunes broadcast side involved taking on more debt than under the companys proposal with the self help deal tribune could transfer some of the debt from the dividend borrowing onto the new tv company limiting the amount of debt left on tribunes balance sheet one swing factor in the outcome has been determining the value of the companys tv stations private equity firm carlyle group made an offer to buy the tv stations for about &# billion but talks between tribune and carlyle stalled as the two sides couldnt agree on price according to a person familiar with the matter tribune eventually determined spinning off the stations was a better option because it could do such a transaction tax free and avoid paying the taxes that would be involved in a sale to carlyle this person said the chandler offer which involved a bid for tribunes newspapers simultaneous with a spin off of its tv stations is unpopular with tribune partly because the company feels it treats the chandlers favorably versus other shareholders while the chandler family has spent the past several weeks trying to drum up new investors to increase the value of its bid it appears increasingly unlikely to succeed according to people familiar with the matter
