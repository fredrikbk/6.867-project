matrix reloaded doctors try new techniques to regrow human tissue researchers plan test on iraq war wounded a model plane mishap five soldiers at a military base in texas are about to participate in a remarkable test to see if they can regrow portions of fingers they lost in the war in iraq doctors plan to treat them with a fine powder called extracellular matrix harvested from pig bladders the material found in all animals is the scaffolding that cells latch onto as they divide and grow into tissue and body parts in the human body it was long thought to be inert but scientists have discovered that it appears to activate latent biological processes that spur healing and regenerate tissue medical researchers have been making intriguing progress in the field of regenerative medicine the pilot test in texas shows how doctors are trying to apply their recent discoveries to a pressing challenge helping thousands of americans returning from iraq to recover from wounds that would have killed soldiers a generation ago scientists have long been enthralled by the ability of animals such as salamanders starfish and deer to regrow body parts lost due to injury or other causes cut off a salamanders leg and a new one grows back within weeks a deer sheds its antlers annually then regenerates another set adding a new "point" each year but in humans and most other complex life forms healing is primarily about survival not regeneration serious wounds produce scar tissue which besides being unsightly doesnt function as well as normal tissue in the womb though humans have a remarkable ability to develop and grow new parts and to recover from injury or fetal surgery a prevailing theory is that this ability begins to wane in humans about weeks into gestation when the immune system and its infection fighting apparatus kick in and that it eventually goes dormant after birth advances in stem cell research genetics and tissue engineering are convincing scientists that it may be possible to reignite this capacity "fetuses can regenerate just about everything " says stephen badylak a researcher at university of pittsburghs mcgowan institute for regenerative medicine "if those signals are there how can we turn them back on " extracellular matrix which scientists say harbors signaling molecules that help direct the development of cells into tissue may hold part of the answer in the s while working as a researcher at purdue university dr badylak stumbled onto the importance of matrix during an experiment in which he used a portion of a dogs intestine to fashion a makeshift aorta for its heart not only was the dogs tail wagging the morning after the surgery but months later an examination revealed that the transplanted intestine part had morphed into a vessel that looked much like an aorta somehow it had sensed where it was in the body and had remodeled itself to take on the structural traits of an aorta there was hardly any scarring "weve been spending the last years trying to understand how that happened " dr badylak says the quest led initially to a layer of intestinal lining called the submucosa a form of extracellular matrix dr badylaks team found that extracting the submucosa from the intestine and putting patches of it at injury sites triggered a novel healing response as the implanted matrix material broke down healthy living tissue not scar tissue repaired the damage matrix from bladders liver and other organs induced a similar reaction "when cells die they release their contents into surrounding tissue and the body responds with inflammation and scar tissue " dr badylak explains by contrast as matrix degrades it "instructs cells to divide migrate and organize the way they do in a developing fetus " in the process stem cells move to the site of the injury the same type of cells responsible for structural development of the fetus the inflammatory response retreats the research revealed an added benefit wounds healed with the help of matrix almost never got infected and instead of rejecting matrix as foreign the immune systems of animals accommodated the treatment a phenomenon dr badylak attributes to the lack of cells in the material the work has resulted in some peer reviewed journal articles and more than patents in which dr badylak is a primary or co inventor most of the patents are held by purdue in the early s depuy inc now a unit of johnson &amp johnson licensed the technology from purdue for orthopedic uses in a stanford university surgeon implanted the first matrix patch in a patient to help repair a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder the material considered a medical device by the food and drug administration is now commonly used in rotator cuff procedures and achilles tendon repairs other orthopedic products companies have developed similar technology that they market as an alternative or adjunct to conventional orthopedic procedures in closely held cook group inc of bloomington ind formed a biotech unit to pursue other uses of intestinal matrix using licenses under dr badylaks patents the unit now markets more than products to treat problems ranging from urinary incontinence to chronic wounds to repair hernias for example patches of matrix can be placed internally against a torn muscle wall to promote the formation of new tissue more than people world wide have had matrix based treatments since according to johnson &amp johnson and cook other potential uses are in development no significant side effects have been linked to the treatment dr badylak says that a single substance can be used to treat such different conditions reflects matrixs capacity to adapt to its environment in the shoulder for example it promotes the formation of tendon tissue in the lower urinary tract the formation of bladder or urine channel tissue and in a diabetic ulcer of normal skin "people used to think it was buck rogers science to talk about regenerating tissues " says scott bruder world wide vice president of a newly formed johnson &amp johnson unit regenerative therapeutics llc "this is the new wave " how did fingers come into the picture as an undergraduate at kenyon college in the s alan spievack did a research project on the salamanders regenerative powers that helped him win a fulbright scholarship and admission to harvard medical school he didnt realize until many years later when he heard dr badylak give a lecture on tissue engineering in that what hed learned might apply to other animals that insight spurred him to look in the bladders of mammals for a form of extracellular matrix called epithelial basement membranes he found it just a couple of layers above the submucosa in his first human test of the membrane he spread it on a poison ivy rash on his own leg he says it quickly healed the experience led to an informal research collaboration with dr badylak dr spievack was more interested in commercializing the technology than in doing academic research on it and in he launched a company called acell inc with so much science already behind dr badylaks inventions he talked to purdue about licensing some of the badylak patents related to matrix from sources other than the intestine initially he says purdue encouraged his interest but no agreement was reached dr spievack then filed a patent on his basement membrane matrix by late his closely held company was making matrix patches and powder from pig bladders veterinarians began using it to treat problems such as tendon injuries in horses and urinary incontinence in dogs the following year the fda cleared a human grade version when purdue learned about dr spievacks patent application it argued that dr badylak and his laboratory had had a role in the invention and that the patent should be assigned to the university that kicked off a complex dispute in which purdue faulted dr badylak for his handling of the work with dr spievack purdue fired dr badylak ending his year career there and disbanding his person lab dr badylak subsequently accepted a post at pittsburghs regenerative medicine program purdue and cook sued the two doctors and acell for patent infringement in u s district court in lafayette ind a jury ruled in favor of purdue and cook but last august a federal appellate court overturned the verdict and upheld the validity of dr spievacks patent mark bleyer president of cooks biotech unit declines to discuss the matter except to say details about what happened remain in dispute and that some litigation is ongoing joseph l bennett vice president for university relations at purdue says dr badylak was terminated "for multiple causes that had accumulated over an extended period " he wouldnt elaborate he says purdues tissue engineering researchers remain productive and he says purdue is pursuing a case with the u s patent office claiming that dr spievacks patent should include inventors from dr badylaks laboratory in dr spievacks brother lee who runs a hobby shop in cincinnati accidentally lopped about three eighths of an inch off the top of his middle finger on the propeller of a model airplane he decided against the skin graft recommended by a hand surgeon and consulted his brother dr spievack sent him a vial of matrix powder lee spievack applied it every other day for days until he ran out by that time he recalls "i could already see the finger was starting to regenerate itself " in four weeks the wound was healed in four months he says except for a tiny scar "it was like the finger i always had " winter he says has revealed one difference "the finger is only about years old whereas the rest of me is in the cold weather all my finger tips have cracked except this one " back at the mcgowan institute in pittsburgh dr badylak and others are collaborating with the military on a variety of tissue engineering projects one of them funded by a multimillion dollar grant from the pentagons defense advanced research projects agency or darpa has a long term goal of enabling soldiers to regenerate lost limbs as a first step dr badylak has assembled a team of five other scientists from around the u s to attempt to induce a mouse to form the same kind of stem cell rich structure that forms when a salamander loses its leg in the salamander that structure called a blastema forms at the site of the missing leg and orchestrates the formation of a new one one aim is to understand the role of extracellular matrix in the process the project reflects growing interest by labs around the world in seeing if humans can be induced to form blastemas that would lead to regrowth of lost limbs the research is in its early stages with a host of unanswered questions and any success could be many years away dr badylak says military officials learned of the episode involving mr spievacks finger and saw before and after pictures of the digit that coupled with dr badylaks matrix research led to the upcoming pilot test which will use acells product "this isnt fly by night " says col john b holcomb commander of the u s army institute of surgical research at fort sam houston in san antonio where the test will take place the army institute is both a research enterprise and the principal burn treatment unit for the entire defense department part of its mission is to improve battlefield medicine to enhance soldiers chances of surviving serious wounds surgeons from col holcombs unit rotate in and out of iraq to help provide emergency treatment and to speed the transfer of badly injured soldiers back to the bed brooke army medical center in san antonio during the vietnam war it often took a few weeks for a wounded soldier to make it from the battlefield to that hospital says col holcomb from iraq it typically takes three days many of the gravest wounds involve severe burns caused by booby traps grenades and other so called improvised explosive devices doctors are also starting a test of whether acells matrix will speed the healing of parts of the body from which healthy skin is removed for grafting onto burn wounds severe hand burns often cost soldiers parts of their fingers while losing fingers might not seem as debilitating as losing an arm or a leg "if you cant grab anything if you cant pick up a pen or a toothbrush the world is a pretty difficult place " says david baer manager of the army units bone and soft tissue program mr baer says the research unit hasnt yet told potential candidates for the finger test about the project in part for fear of raising false hopes among soldiers desperate for good news in the test which is expected to begin late this spring surgeons will reopen the skin around whats left of the soldiers fingers matrix will be applied three times a week for at least two weeks during each application researchers will look for new tissue and for complications if any fingers get longer researchers will measure them for sensitivity test hand function and x ray them to check for bone growth if no problems arise in the first five soldiers the doctors will treat five more then assess the procedure thoroughly they hope to know within a couple of months after treatment begins whether it works no one expects the treatment will regrow complete fingers with joints knuckles and fingernails "wed love to see bone " says mr baer "but we dont know " the hope is for maybe an inch of soft tissue with blood vessels and nerves that soldiers can pinch their thumbs against and restore some function mr spievacks experience is one anecdote injuries to the soldiers fingers are much more severe there is no guarantee it will work dr badylak says but without any new tissue the hands of some injured soldiers are like paddles they cant write with a pencil zip their pants or eat with a fork "the opposable thumb is what makes us human " says col holcomb "to an year old with no fingers this would be a life changing event "
