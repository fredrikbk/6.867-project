energy a special report the bottom line utilities typically have had little incentive to reduce demand for their product states are trying to change the math in the power business the more electricity you sell the more money you make now state officials and electric utilities backed by environmental groups have begun to change that equation faced with growing demand for electricity and the environmental consequences of generating it states and utilities are considering new regulatory regimes that remove the incentive for selling more power and give utilities a financial stake in saving energy the ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for new power plants many energy experts predict the u s will need hundreds of new plants in coming years to satisfy demand state and industry officials increasingly believe that by changing the financial incentives for utilities they can significantly increase the efficiency of the grid and make many of these power plants unnecessary saving billions of dollars in the process massachusetts for instance is considering new incentives for utilities coupled with tough new efficiency standards state officials recently proposed a sweeping measure to eliminate all electricity demand growth through increased spending on energy efficiency the spending would cover customers that arent served by competitive suppliers which is of the states total electricity load "if you could do this universally with all customers you would theoretically not have to build any more power plants until the existing ones wear out " says david oconnor commissioner of the massachusetts division of energy resources states are considering two major regulatory remedies the first is "decoupling " in which utilities receive a predetermined profit each year thereby separating their earnings from the volume of electricity they deliver heres how it works a utility and state regulators hammer out how much profit the company will be allowed to earn at the end of the year if the utilitys actual profit is lower than that amount the company charges customers to make up the difference if the actual profit is higher customers get a rebate all of which means a utilitys profits wont suffer if it decreases the amount of electricity it delivers through increased efficiency of course if extreme weather boosts the delivery of electricity the utility doesnt benefit either decoupling is currently more popular for natural gas utilities with about seven programs nationwide but washington idaho new mexico and new york are considering it for their electric companies as well california the state that has most aggressively advocated energy efficiency is the only one that has put the mechanism into effect "decoupling is probably the single biggest thing to promote energy efficiency " says sean gallagher director of the energy division at the california public utility commission "otherwise youre trying to tell the utilities to cut into their profits to make less sales " still decoupling doesnt actually give utilities a financial incentive to cut energy use thats where the second proposed regulatory change comes in making efficiency spending as lucrative as infrastructure spending regulators allow utilities to earn a return on their infrastructure spending by raising rates so utilities can earn money by investing in power plants transmission and distribution infrastructure but under current rules in most states utilities cant earn a return on their efficiency spending they can only recover the cost a proposal being considered in california texas and several other states would change that under such a system "the people running the energy efficiency departments in these utilities will become on a par with those running the transmission and distribution departments " predicts mr gallagher "there will be more of a corporate focus on energy efficiency " texas is considering implementing the new system in conjunction with ambitious new efficiency standards the states utilities are now required to account for of annual demand growth through energy efficiency but the state may increase that figure significantly as part of a regulatory proceeding begun in late january "if the utilities are voluntarily achieving more than theyre required what can texas truly do " says theresa gross manager of energy efficiency programs at the texas public utility commission in massachusetts meanwhile the administration of newly elected governor deval patrick is eager to consider measures that would encourage utilities to promote energy efficiency says ian bowles the states new secretary of energy and environmental affairs "well be exploring the full range issue around rate design and decoupling " mr bowles says "historically our rate design doesnt create as many overt incentives for additional efficiency and thats something well be looking at " indeed promoting efficiency will be difficult if the utilities can increase their profits by delivering more power says mr oconnor of the massachusetts division of energy resources "it does require kind of an uphill struggle for utilities to work against their natural interests " he says environmental groups across the country have signed on to these proposed changes in texas for instance the local sierra club plans to lobby the legislature to provide financial incentives for utilities along with mandating more efficiency spending the consumer group public citizen is also active in the efforts "were very interested in coming up with ways for rewarding utilities that run aggressive efficiency programs " says tom smith director of public citizens texas office utilities have also supported changing financial incentives in june more than a dozen of the nations largest utilities including exelon corp duke energy corp southern co and american electric power co signed on to a "national action plan for energy efficiency " which calls for new regulatory policies to encourage reduced power use "decoupling and incentives often lead to increased energy efficiency investments by utilities increasing customer and societal benefits " according to the plan duke energy chief executive jim rogers who co chaired the group that wrote the action plan has advanced the idea that utilities should adjust their business models to become "energy efficiency providers " but to do that he says utilities must be able to earn a return on the money they spend to make their grids more efficient duke has asked state regulators to allow this in north carolina where duke energy carolinas has proposed to spend of its annual revenue or &# million on energy efficiency programs the state is considering this request as part of dukes plan to add megawatts of coal burning capacity at a plant near the south carolina border these new proposals come amid a nationwide push to increase utilities spending on energy efficiency states are realizing that a dollar invested in energy efficiency typically yields a dollar or often much more in energy savings in many states utilities put a small charge on customers bills to finance a hodgepodge of efficiency programs often these involve subsidies to consumers who buy energy efficient air conditioners and other appliances upgrade their electrical systems or install "smart meters" that show what theyre spending on electricity in real time by far the biggest of these programs is in california where utilities are planning to invest &# billion between and on improving the grids efficiency the states regulators estimate the plan will reduce peak electricity demand by megawatts about the capacity of three medium size power plants mr gallagher of the california public utility commission says the cost of bringing that much new supply to the market through new power plant construction is about &# billion making energy efficiency one of the cheapest energy resources available in all utilities nationwide spent &# billion on energy efficiency programs in according to martin kushler director of utility programs at the american council for an energy efficient economy he says that figure could double in the coming years as state interest increases "and theres no engineering or economical reason why you couldnt do much more than that " mr kushler says "its a political compromise not a technical or economic limit " mr dalton is a staff reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at matthew dalton dowjones com
