senator seeks to focus the war on al qaeda kimberley a strassels feb potomac watch column "senator feingolds sin" was right to single out the senators "honesty" and "backbone" for his effort to require that u s troops be redeployed from iraq but to say that "the wisconsin pacifist might not understand the importance of winning in iraq" misunderstands sen feingold and his effort which is based on strengthening u s national security above all else the senator called for redeploying our troops from iraq because our massive indefinite presence there is weakening our ability to fight the terrorist networks that threaten this country around the world he voted to go to war in afghanistan precisely because he wanted u s forces to eliminate the taliban and destroy a safe haven for terrorist networks that threaten our country as your editorial noted congress has the power to end a war sen feingold wants congress to use that power to end u s involvement in this disastrous war in iraq so that we can fight al qaeda and other global threats more aggressively and effectively that doesnt sound like a pacifist does it kitty thomas communications director office of sen russ feingold washington
