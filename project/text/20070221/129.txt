whats aiding buyout boom toggle notes an innovative means to structure debt helps defaults remain low in the fall of when texas pacific group and warburg pincus llc bought luxury retailer neiman marcus group inc jim coulter tpgs co founder was nervous said people familiar with the deal what if there was another terrorist attack or a sharp economic downturn what if neimans management got fashion trends all wrong to protect against an unexpected turn tpg came up with an unusual structure for some of the debt it put on neiman marcus to help pay for the purchase if the retailer experienced unexpected head winds it could stop paying cash interest on &# million in debt and instead agree to pay back much more when the bonds mature in "if the company hits a speed bump it gives it liquidity and a cushion " said kewsong lee a partner at warburg pincus who worked on the deal "this innovation was one factor enabling us to pay a more aggressive price " the bond formally known as a payment in kind toggle note is becoming an increasingly important part of the arsenal of private equity firms as they pile debt on their corporate trophies these "pik toggle" securities allow borrowers to make a choice they can keep paying interest on a bond or they can defer paying interest until the bond matures and in the process agree to pay an interest rate that is effectively higher in the case of neiman marcus the interest rate on its debt with this feature will rise from to if it decides to defer payments which it hasnt done the increased use of these bonds is one of the latest examples of the easy lending terms that dominate the corporate borrowing market these days and have helped fuel the historic buyout boom it also is a sign the boom could keep going for some time corporate default rates are at record lows less than that has investors clamoring for corporate bonds and loans because they dont seem very risky in companies issued &# billion in speculative grade bonds and loans up from &# billion in easy lending terms such as those of pik toggle bonds make it possible for even companies with strained cash flows to stay afloat longer than they otherwise would by putting off interest payments the downside is that borrowers and investors in the end could find they have even more debt than expected if the credit cycle turns "cheap debt is the rocket fuel " said bill conway a co founder of carlyle group at a january conference "we try to get as much as we can as cheaply as we can and as flexibly as we can " the health of the debt market matters hugely to private equity firms which have used massive dollops of debt to go after ever larger prey and reap higher returns on their investments nearly every tpg deal since neiman marcus includes debt with the pik toggle feature all the megadeals including freescale semiconductor inc hca inc and ballpark concessionaire aramark corp do as well a similar feature that allowed companies to defer interest payments was popular during the late s buyout boom but fell out of favor in the s although default rates are low and easy lending terms make it easier to stay solvent the credit quality of some companies show some signs of deteriorating some of companies issuing debt in carry "junk" credit ratings of "b plus" or below compared with in according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data group in many cases the debt itself isnt going to fund new investments rather it is used to finance takeovers or to pay new owners a special dividend many companies have been able to issue debt without the usual terms known as covenants that require them to meet certain performance metrics to avoid defaulting last year there was about &# billion in such debt ten times the amount in this is another factor that is making it easier for companies to avoid defaulting in the past when companies fell short of financial performance targets "banks would take over the company at the worst possible time or we would have to put more money in " said tony james president of blackstone group at a conference at harvard business school "now we can live to fight another day " to many analysts such "covenant lite" loans or pik toggle notes are glaring signs of the bull market in debt and underscore the power of bond issuers at a time when investors are flush with cash and willing to take chances for high returns some bond issuers said the new features are in the interest of investors because the features help companies avoid default and complex bankruptcy proceedings proponents have said the high interest rates attached to pik toggle notes give borrowers an incentive to keep making interest payments unless times turn dire others are less sure s&amp ps leveraged commentary &amp data group noted in a commentary for example that pik toggle bonds could be risky because they have the potential to saddle investors with more debt in companies and less cash from them just as the companies are beginning to struggle "because there is so much cash around lenders are being pushed to give up more and more " said howard gellis who runs the debt capital markets group at blackstone group so far this cycle none of the issuers have taken advantage of their option and ceased paying interest it remains unclear how investors will react if companies do start exercising this right "since the message is that a company cant afford to pay cash it is hard to see how the market wont be spooked " said steven shapiro a partner at goldentree asset management which has &# billion to invest out of its hedge fund operations "for the most part we dont invest in them "
