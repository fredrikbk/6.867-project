government pays growing share of health costs washington as pressure grows for the government to pick up more of the nations health care tab new data show its contribution is already at and is expected to approach within years the governments widening role in financing health care stems from the recent expansion of medicare to include prescription drugs the growth of relatively new initiatives like the state childrens health insurance program increased spending by enrollees in programs like medicaid which covers many of the sickest patients and cutbacks in employer sponsored health coverage overall health spending in the u s is expected to double to &# trillion by consuming of the nations gross domestic product up from the current according to a new federal study by then the study predicts the government will be paying of the nations health care bill up from in and in the stark projections come amid increasing ferment over health care in the states and washington they could bolster the argument of some analysts that the u s is creeping toward a single payer system in a disorganized piecemeal way under such a system the government essentially pays for health care and covers the cost by collecting taxes and premiums in any case the changing landscape has already prompted some insurers to rethink their growth strategies at least in the short term focusing more on the government end of the market "we are moving incrementally away from traditional sources of insurance such as employer based coverage to a system comprising more federal and state government provided health care " said the studys authors who work for the agency that runs medicare the federal health program for the elderly and disabled their projections are being published today in the journal health affairs health care has moved to the fore of public debate recently as several states have followed massachusettss lead in fashioning plans to cover uninsured residents through a combination of subsidies and new state pools designed to make it easier for individuals to buy insurance in washington meanwhile lawmakers across the political spectrum are discussing the importance of expanding coverage for children and many democratic lawmakers as well as diverse coalitions of businesses insurers and health care advocates are talking up the need for universal coverage but there are sharp differences about how to get to universal coverage and especially how to pay for it some advocates of a free market approach warn that the u s is nearing a tipping point in the debate between publicly financed and privately financed health care and urge the white house to press its market friendly approach now before the elections they fear a new democratic president might press for more government centered solutions indeed democratic presidential contenders have pledged to make helping the uninsured a focal point of their campaigns medicares drug benefit introduced in january increased the programs share of the nations prescription drug spending to last year from in the drug benefit though subsidized by the federal government is offered through private insurers those private plans come in two types stand alone prescription drug plans which supplement traditional medicare and managed care plans called medicare advantage which cover other benefits as well as drugs humana inc one of the biggest providers of the new drug benefit has made no bones about becoming more government focused in the run up to the drug benefits launch chief executive michael mccallister declared that humana would "get very heavily weighted toward the government space in terms of earnings over the next couple of years " humana threw itself into the new market by manning its own kiosks in wal mart stores across the country hiring an army of sales agents and contracting with state farm insurance co to help sell the drug plans by the end of last year million medicare beneficiaries were getting their drug benefits through humana that includes one million people who signed up for humanas medicare advantage plans which are even more profitable for the company earlier this month humana said its heavy bet on medicare helped its fourth quarter net income more than double to &# million its pretax profit from government business alone more than tripled robert berenson senior fellow at the urban institutes health care center said the projected rise in health spending in coming years means that the government should organize various parties including public and private payers employers workers providers and consumers to discuss ways to curb costs and reform the system "we need some kind of comprehensive approach to control costs" that goes beyond merely shifting costs among the payers dr berenson said among the reform options he said should be discussed are a single payer government run system an expansion of medicare to cover younger people starting with to year olds and new limits on the use of high tech medical equipment joseph antos a health analyst at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank said the new pressures facing the government "translate into a big political question can we continue on with the program the way it is now given continuing demand by the baby boomer generation " with medicare covering more people the current public private health system will eventually be primarily a public health system and "at some point medicare will be the largest system " mr antos said a lot of "volatility" underlies the overall growth rate in health care spending including shifts in whether public or private sources are paying the bills said john poisal who wrote the report with colleagues at the office of the actuary at the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services "we will continue to face tough questions about how we finance our health care bill " he said americans out of pocket spending is expected to grow to &# billion by from &# billion last year according to the studys projections medicare spending grew by to &# billion in up from &# billion in the study said the growth would slow to this year due to scheduled cuts in payments to physicians and smaller payment increases to medicare advantage plans but because congress has already reversed the cuts in physician payments for this year the actual growth rate will likely be higher the authors also assume that by of those eligible will be enrolled in medicare advantage plans up from in federal and state spending on medicaid last year was estimated at &# billion roughly the same as in medicare now provides drug benefits for low income medicaid enrollees resulting in a decrease in medicaid drug spending in medicaid spending in several other areas such as hospitals and physicians is also expected to grow at a slower pace because of slower enrollment and state cost cutting but spending on some categories will grow sharply the growth rate for home health spending for example was an estimated for compared with in meanwhile spending growth by private insurance was estimated to have slowed from a peak of in to a low of in with little overall growth in commercial or private health insurance other insurers have sought to tap the market for government financed health care that strategy has driven some of unitedhealth group inc s biggest deals in recent years in unitedhealth bought americhoice corp a big medicaid plan provider for &# million to become one of the biggest players in that market in it purchased pacificare health systems inc one of the biggest medicare players for &# billion just ahead of the launch of the new drug benefit it also campaigned hard to win a deal to sell aarp branded drug plans unitedhealth currently has million medicare drug plan members more than any other insurer drug companies also have profited from the drug benefit in the first seven months of prescriptions funded by medicare drug plans accounted for nearly of medicines bought in retail pharmacies according to verispan llc a yardley pa firm that collects prescription data one of the biggest winners was bristol myers squibb co nearly of u s retail prescriptions for its drugs particularly the popular blood thinner plavix were financed by the medicare drug benefit during that period according to verispan medicare funded prescriptions accounted for more than of astrazeneca plcs and merck &amp co s retail prescriptions as well
