internet shops fuel m&amp a boom big fish buy talent as web ads surge buzz on guerrillas the ad business is back to its consolidating ways this time it is the burgeoning young internet ad shops that are up for grabs in just the past two months two high profile digital ad firms digitas and akqa have been acquired the mergers and acquisitions boom in digital marketing is likely to continue in according to a new survey by admedia partners a new york boutique investment bank specializing in advertising and marketing transactions this years m&amp a activity is likely to focus on sectors such as search marketing mobile marketing and buzz marketing according to the web based survey of ad and marketing executives and private equity investors during the s big ad holding companies went on expensive and lengthy shopping sprees as they sought to grow and keep wall street happy this time rather than seeking to grow by buying revenue the big fish are seeking talent and skills in a fast moving landscape buying them can be easier than growing your own there is also new competition in the search for deals holding companies face increased competition from private equity firms which have become very active in buying digital and marketing services firms akqa for example recently sold a majority stake to a private equity firm even media companies such as meredith corp have begun to buy marketing assets abbott "abe" jones and seth alpert two managing partners at investment bank admedia partners talked with the wall street journal about the new environment and its immediate future wall street journal the rate of online ad firm acquisitions has begun to heat up lately given the fast growth of online advertising over the past few years why was there a delay on m&amp a mr alpert clearly there is acceleration in deals but i dont think there was a delay what has happened recently is that bigger companies are being acquired and the deals have bigger profiles wsj how much is the acquisition rate in this area increasing mr jones we have anecdotal evidence of our own of the last deals we completed six of them were companies that derived the majority or all of their income from internet activities that is simply a huge increase wsj whats driving the market mr alpert several things one the sellers the companies in the &# million to &# million range in revenue are starting to realize that it is going to become increasingly difficult to go it alone major brand assignments now require scale and it is going to be difficult for these firms to get scale on their own on the buy side the advertising and marketing agencies are seeing client demand increasing many cant keep up with it through hiring we were at one of the major business units at one of the holding companies a few weeks ago and the interactive unit in new york had open positions i dont know how you fill those mr jones its a buy vs build situation right now the larger ad firms are facing that every day they are asking themselves do we go it alone and recruit or do we go out and buy the talent revenue and clients wsj where are valuations on these deals have they reached a peak mr jones according to our survey the prices on interactive agencies have moved up from seven times to eight times annual operating profits marketing services have moved from six to six and half but these are just ballpark figures and in practice we have seen very high quality firms selling at much higher multiples an example is digitas the publicly traded company that sold to publicis groupe for times estimated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization mr alpert i think we are at or near a peak they arent going to go up much more from where they are but the real question is how much longer will they hold up wsj why arent the holding companies more active on m&amp a mr jones there is more competition for deals today there are other buyers out there many of the public ad companies have become risk averse they are not willing to stretch as far as they might have several years ago boards of directors at some of these firms are more careful in signing off on deals nowadays they are doing more homework wsj do you think some of the ad holding companies waited too long to ramp up acquisitions in the digital area mr alpert yes some have publicis groupe did until it bought digitas mr jones i think havas has been actively working to catch up they are probably still looking to build their capabilities one reason some have waited is that theyve tried to build units from within as ddb did with building tribal ddb ddb is part of omnicom group but the recent growth in online ad spending has forced a lot of the traditional ad agencies to recognize that if they dont have the capabilities in this area there are other companies who are willing to come in and take the money from clients who are willing to pay wsj what is attracting private equity firms to these deals what sectors are they most interested in mr alpert digital part of the reason they are looking at firms such as valueclick and akqa is that they are seeing very successful companies with high profits and earnings many of these private equity firms see there is an opportunity to build a new generation of digital companies and take them public if you look at general atlantics recent investment in akqa i think that is what is behind it mr jones they are also interested in other offline marketing companies private equity firms are looking at categories like direct marketing and deciding that the market is fragmented there are a lot of smaller players that can be pulled together they can then build a larger company that can be taken public or sold to someone bigger wsj according to your survey of those polled expected m&amp a activity in the buzz and guerrilla marketing areas in why mr jones this started in the world of politics with grass roots causes a lot of what you see in viral marketing today whether offline or online started there today its morphed into new media strategies companies we think it will continue because its based on a sound premise that you are more likely to buy something if someone you trust has recommended the product or advocated the service mr alpert clearly the internet the ability to reach a huge audience very fast and have measurable results has heightened the opportunities in this sector wsj what is one sector that you think is starting to heat up mr jones mobile is going to become more of a factor its going to eventually get a bigger chunk of the marketing dollars about of those we polled say they are considering entering or expanding their presence in mobile marketing many of those polled were very bullish on mobile about expect strong m&amp a in the mobile area
