the evening wrap the patient fed online edition consumer inflation nudged higher last month as it got more expensive to have a meal a cigarette or an x ray but such pressures are unlikely to send a patient federal reserve scrambling to increase interest rates the consumer price index climbed during january and increased on the closely watched core basis excluding food and energy readings that were a hair higher than economists expected when they rolled out of bed this morning driving the surprise was a jump in medical costs the largest advance in that category in more than years food and tobacco prices also surged few observers were acutely troubled though sensing no change to the landscape as relates to interest rates sure core price increases are above the feds so called comfort zone they came in higher than a year ago and policy makers generally prefer annual increases more in the neighborhood of to but chairman ben bernanke just got done telling lawmakers that current borrowing costs are likely to encourage sustained growth and a gradual easing in inflation lehman brothers economist john shin thinks the fed will keep its hands off of rates this year while core inflation will stay "slightly but stubbornly elevated " thats not to say that the fed isnt mindful of inflation indeed as the minutes of the central banks latest policy meeting make clear rising prices are still very high on the list of preoccupations among the countrys central bankers the bankers last month weighed whether they should change their assessment of risks and change their bias toward raising rates following several months in a row of weak readings on core inflation but ultimately they decided to stand their ground as "all meeting participants" expressed "some concern" about price trends policy makers think core inflation is likely to wane over time but they argued that any slackening brought on by falling energy costs or decelerating rents could prove fleeting and they "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established " the inflation numbers today made them look prescient federal reserve president of san francisco janet yellen said today that core inflation is still on the "high side " though she posited that it has begun to "ebb modestly " while keeping their fingers resting gently on inflations arteries policy makers are scanning the horizon for other hazards vice chairman donald kohn said in a speech today that global markets appear "very settled" at the moment but the possibility of a crisis cant be ruled out "narrow risk spreads and low expected market volatility coexist with unprecedented current account imbalances" and low interest rates by historical standards mr kohn said but he noted that the relative calm in the aftermath of episodes like the enron scandal and the collapse of hedge fund amaranth advisors suggests markets are able to take a punch without taking a dive risks are spread more widely around the market mr kohn said and developments have "given them the tools to better manage those risks " but as ever there are potential crises looming some economists believe that a crash up derby in the subprime mortgage sector could have wider and worrying consequences others think the yen carry trade could eventually leave investors in tears as japans central bank acknowledged today the boj and the carry trade after months of guessing by economists that an increase would be coming at any time and months of having such guesses punctured by policy makers inertia the bank of japan finally boosted its benchmark short term interest rate by a quarter percentage point to two factors had weighed against a rate increase at recent meetings in december and january one japans central bank doesnt enjoy the same sort of political autonomy as the federal reserve and some lawmakers had noisily lobbied for the bank to leave rates in neutral two policy makers worried that the expansion was too fragile to withstand any more tightening those fears eased a bit when data revealed robust consumer spending in the final months of the year however and the central bank seized the opening to raise rates the boj also seemed eager to stamp out the notion that the countrys low rates would last forever japan has the lowest interest rates among the worlds major economies benchmark rates are in the u s and in europe and investors have used the spread to play the "carry trade " where they borrow at japans rock bottom rates and use the borrowed funds to pursue higher returns elsewhere boj governor toshihiko fukui warned that a sudden unwinding of that strategy could present a hazard to global economic stability but with the central bank moving along so glacially today marked the second time japan has raised rates in almost seven years and economists think it could be months before another increase the carry trade seems ensured of living on for some time the yen rose sharply as the meeting was
