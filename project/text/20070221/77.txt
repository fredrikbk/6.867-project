mitsubishi restarts u s profit engine rebound poses threat to other car makers but challenges loom tokyo mitsubishi motors corp is on track to swing back to a full year profit in the u s for the first time in four years thats bad news for other players in the crowded car market helped by popular new models such as the midsized outlander suv a less lenient consumer financing program and aggressive efforts to win back dealers trust mitsubishi which just two years ago was rescued by a hefty bailout is expected to post a full year operating profit in the competitive u s market in the fiscal year ending march the turnaround by mitsubishi japans no car maker by volume poses an extra threat to other asian rivals such as japans nissan motor co and south koreas hyundai motor co both of which have seen their sales drop recently in the key u s market it also adds more competition to detroits big three which have been reporting heavy losses mitsubishis recovery in the u s is a surprise considering it was losing more than &# billion a year ago and some had speculated it might pull out of the north american market that would have created welcome consolidation in the auto industry which is already suffering from too much production many industry experts predict that global overcapacity will exceed in its performance also lies in stark contrast to that of daimlerchrysler ag which acquired of mitsubishi in and boosted its stake to in with ambitions to expand globally daimler stopped investing in mitsubishi in amid heavy losses and sold its remaining shares in and is now mulling selling or spinning off another of its ailing units the chrysler group improvement in the u s helped mitsubishi report an overall net profit of billion yen &# million in the third quarter ended in december rebounding from a year earlier net loss of billion yen but the car maker still has problems to confront world wide vehicle sales in the quarter totaled down from in the year earlier period due mostly to slowing demand in japan and other parts of asia after reaching a week high of yen in april mitsubishis shares fell during the summer and have been hovering around yen recently but many analysts say the price may still be too high yesterday mitsubishis shares closed unchanged at yen on the tokyo stock exchange the positive changes at mitsubishi are the result of a revitalization plan announced after its bailout back then mitsubishi was losing billions of dollars and reeling from a scandal in japan involving a coverup of vehicle defects that had crippled the companys domestic sales meanwhile u s operations suffered from piles of bad consumer loans the result of a "zero zero zero" financing incentive that gave people with poor credit records the chance to buy a car with no money down and no payments for a year many u s dealers wondered if mitsubishi would pull out of the tough north american market they stopped carrying mitsubishi vehicles leaving the company with an overflow of inventory from its plant in normal ill but the car maker received nearly &# billion in financing from the mitsubishi group and vowed to remain in north america its most important market now new models are helping mitsubishi improve its performance in the u s even though sales of gas guzzling suvs have slowed in the u s as americans opt for more fuel efficient cars the outlander suv a crossover model that is more fuel efficient than larger suvs has sold well since its november launch the convertible eclipse spyder sports car launched in april has also sold fairly well mitsubishi has also changed its core target customer in the late s it showered twenty something drivers with hefty incentives only to get stuck with outstanding debt when many couldnt pay their loans the company says the outlander is a "family car" designed for baby boomers and young families in their s who tend to be more financially secure in addition mitsubishi has tied up with merrill lynch &amp co in the u s to fund mitsubishis loans to car buyers rather than finance its own loans a move that has helped improve the ratio of loans that are paid back one key u s strategy has been to regain trust among dealers in the u s in january the company launched a th anniversary advertising campaign that declared its intention to stay committed to the u s market "its been years since we made our first mark in america the next years begin today " said the ads which were largely aimed at dealers in addition hiroshi harunari who became chief executive of the north american unit in january met with several big dealers to emphasize the company was here to stay analysts say the effort worked the number of u s dealers selling mitsubishi vehicles or more a month increased to in september from in january according to nomura in a sign of renewed focus on the u s market mitsubishi is planning to introduce the lancer in the u s next month before other markets in the past mitsubishi has launched global products in japan first "we want everyone to know that the u s is vital and well never give up on our operation there " says yoshikazu nakamura a spokesman for mitsubishi
