fiscally fit putting care back in health care a good hospital experience makes terri wonder why are most health care providers so aggravating online edition its rare that i walk away from one of my familys doctor appointments or dental visits with a good feeling its not that my family is in poor health or that were not receiving proper treatment rather its feeling that our health care providers just dont have time to care about my family hours spent cooling our heels in waiting rooms rude or indifferent health care workers and billing problems all of this had left me wondering where the "care" in health care has gone it didnt occur to me how much id come to expect bad customer service from my health care providers until we had an experience that was overwhelmingly good two weeks ago our seven year old son gerald had surgery to correct a blocked ear canal my husband gerry and i were nervous as we faced the most invasive medical procedure of our sons life to add to our jitters the surgery was to take place at a hospital we werent familiar with we were so anxious that the night before geralds surgery we did a "dry run" so we wouldnt get lost on the way to the hospital arriving at the hospital that evening i told the desk clerk why we were there she handed us a copy of the hospitals floor plan and showed us where we should go the following morning she also gave us a number to call if we had any more questions and urged gerald to wear his comfiest pajamas "she was nice " gerald said on the drive home "helpful too " i said "thats something different " gerry said turns out it wasnt something different at least not at that hospital from the moment we arrived on the morning of geralds surgery gerry and i were struck by the hospitals pleasant and helpful staff after we filled out forms in the waiting room a nurse stopped by to explain the pre operative and post op procedures i had some questions all of which she answered and i didnt feel she was rushing me through it the nurse then playfully admired geralds pajamas and asked him if he had any questions "will it hurt " he asked softly "not one bit " she replied and her confident tone made him smile as a matter of fact nearly everyone we came in contact with at the hospital made a point of talking to gerald too often when i speak with my sons doctors we end up talking about him as if hes not even there i thought back to one doctor visit where his pediatrician was so clearly pressed for time that she worked on gerald like she was part of a race car pit crew as she quickly poked and prodded she said barely a dozen words to me and nothing at all to gerald weve since switched pediatricians back at the hospital we were taken in to the pre op area promptly after i finished filling out the forms no waiting and staffers checked on us frequently as we waited for geralds pre op medication to kick in when he became woozy and agitated and we became slightly alarmed a nurse quickly stepped in and kept him entertained by comparing her heartbeat to his with a fingertip heart rate monitor as they wheeled gerald away toward the operating room the same nurse squeezed my arm reassuringly and said "well take good care of him mom " i appreciated the nurses words but even more i appreciated that she respected my anxiety a nurse at our own hospital once said something similar to me during an emergency room visit but her tone came across more like "hell be fine drama queen " after geralds surgery his doctor saw us right away again no waiting we got good news the blockage was cleared and bad news he may need more surgery the doctor stayed to answer our questions and then called in a nurse to explain what we needed to do for geralds post op care the following morning the same nurse called our home to see how gerald was feeling and to answer any follow up questions we might have gerry and i are still marveling at how well we were treated that said we received treatment under almost ideal conditions gerald had a scheduled relatively minor outpatient procedure that was handled by one doctor if our son had been seriously ill with a lengthy hospital stay that required a number of doctors specialists and procedures we might not have walked away with the same warm fuzzy glow still the experience highlighted just how much we put up with from our other health care providers annual doctor visits regularly result in my having to wait an hour or more past my scheduled appointment time its gotten so that im willing to wait months for a doctors visit to ensure that i get the earliest possible appointment to cut down on waiting time what really galls me is the health care providers ive dealt with no longer even bother to apologize its a given that my time will be wasted waiting for my "appointment " at a recent doctor visit i pointed out my hour plus long wait to the nurse who managed a curt "yeah were a little backed up " irritation at long hours spent in the waiting room is just the tip of the iceberg i can recount many times health care workers on the front lines the clerical desks have responded to my calls or concerns with condescending or matter of fact responses others have been downright rude my husband gerrys so aggravated by one of the clerks in our sons dentist office that he wants us to find a new dentist even though i spent weeks trying to find a dentist in our network that gerald would be comfortable with and theres part of the problem wed gladly voice our dissatisfaction with shoddy customer service by choosing another health care provider but changing doctors isnt always an attractive option for example i prefer dealing with female doctors for my routine health care visits but there are few women physicians to be found in a number of specialties in my husbands health insurance provider network i drive an hour each way to get to one of my doctors for this reason and after making such a substantial investment of time to get there im not going to leave over a frustratingly long wait i could go out of network and pay hundreds of dollars more for a female doctor closer to home but ive tried that route and the hour plus waiting times gall me even more knowing that im paying extra for it how did things get so bad inefficiencies in the way practices are managed are primarily to blame says l gordon moore a family doctor in rochester n y dr moore is a pioneer of the ideal micro practice a program designed to reduce or eliminate support staff "practices have grown their staff but theyve done it in a way that isnt efficient " he says "as overhead soars practices have to crank up the volume of patients to pay for it all " ideal micro practice relies on electronic health records and software to handle administrative tasks now handled by a number of individuals by streamlining staff doctors can schedule fewer patients and engage patients more actively than they have time to do now dr moore says potential good news the health care industry and the federal government recognize growing patient dissatisfaction and there are efforts to address it as my print journal colleague laura landro recently reported some hospitals including the one where gerald had his surgery have begun to adopt so called family centered care working with consumer oriented companies and using information found in patient satisfaction surveys to identify and correct problems that patients commonly complain about in part theyre doing so out of necessity this year hospitals for the first time will be required to participate in the federal governments national patient satisfaction survey program to receive full reimbursement from medicare the move toward improving patient care and customer satisfaction is also albeit more slowly making its way into individual practices you can find out more about that here choosing the right health care provider and facility for your condition can help you get better care the governments medicare web site offers a hospital comparison tool that lets you compare hospitals by location and specialty unfortunately there arent a lot of resources for patients who want to find reliable information about patient satisfaction at least not yet later this year the results of the patient satisfaction survey should be posted on medicares web site so patients can compare ratings of hospitals in their area finding out how well patients are treated by doctors at the practice level is more difficult one place to start is your health insurance plan says doug henley executive director of the american academy of family physicians many plans list health care providers in their networks according to cost effectiveness and other data that said dr henley notes the data are often based on claims information alone which can be misleading for a fee of &# healthgrades com publishes a report detailing a doctors education license and certification background any disciplinary actions and how the doctor compares in patient satisfaction surveys for &# more you can also search malpractice records for settlements in states finally web sites such as ratemds com and physiciansreports com allow patients to rate their own doctors and see other patients ratings for free i was able to rate my doctors and see how other patients rated them though granted for most doctors there were only a handful of ratings to compare how would you put the care back in health care what changes would you like to see health care providers make to make your life easier write to

column about kids and their excessive valentines day goody bags most readers who emailed me agreed that were bombarding our kids with too many gifts and trinkets for no good reason read on for some of their thoughts as always letters have been edited thank you for speaking out about the gross excess of unnecessary junk lavished on our children ive often thought i was the lone scrooge in town when it comes to these obligatory gift giving events im saddened by the effects all this junk have on my children in contrast to the more elaborate goody bags and party favors my kids receive the meager gifts grandpa is able to share are looked upon as trifles im also tired of buying junk for my kids to give ill never be at the top of the latest "giving trend" the class moms almost always overdo raising the standard again and again for us less enthusiastic participants stop the madness karen newlin i couldnt agree with you more about the valentines day gifts when we were kids we just exchanged cards and were excited about them i wish the teachers would politely ask that kids exchange cards then they could spend time actually reading them the amount of candy that arrived home today from my preschooler and second grader rivals halloween for several years i resisted valentines day gift giving and my kids just gave cards last year my then first grader came home and said "mom im the only one who just gave a card " so this year i relented and we too attached a small candy to the card jill goldsmith in my opinion the gift giving creep started years ago and has been steadily escalating it seems in the past five years that the trend has accelerated my twin granddaughters get so many gifts now that my daughter and son in law put some away to bring out later theres just too much overload for them to enjoy and appreciate what they get on all these holiday birthday gift giving occasions john porath my husband and i were just talking about this last night i went to my seven year old daughters school valentines day party and was disturbed by the number of flower vases being distributed down the hall to various children one child received three very large gift bags full of stuffed animals and toys sent to the school by her parents why couldnt they have opened these gifts at home and i agree children whose parents cant afford luxury gifts are hurt i think the school should limit the size and cost of the gifts katherine lee like you i watched valentines day gift giving escalate as my daughter grew but it never got to actual "gifts " each year she came home with a bag of valentines day cards and we went through each one together talking about who gave it and why we liked it or not some years there were cheap little drugstore cards she kept around for months my daughter is in seventh grade now and when i picked her up from school this valentines day she was sad that although she handed out homemade cards she didnt receive one in return she really missed the fun of valentines and wanted to be "little" again maybe it depends on the child whether they appreciate or value these things sue thomas write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
