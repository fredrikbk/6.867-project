table talk iran faces a deadline today to suspend its enrichment of uranium or according to the terms of a u n security council resolution unanimously adopted last december face further sanctions while it is only proper that the world wait for the deadline to pass before responding tehrans answer is already clear gholam reza aghzadeh head of irans atomic energy organization has said that "iran will not comply with the united nations security council resolution " how will the west respond earlier this month sir richard dalton until recently britains ambassador in tehran called for direct talks between u s and iranian officials and suggested the west modify demands that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment unfortunately his eagerness for dialogue is being echoed and amplified elsewhere especially in the wake of the bush administrations deal to pay north korea for similar disarmament needless to say former luminaries such as ex secretary of state madeleine albright and president jimmy carter think sitting down with the mullahs is a very good idea security council resolutions notwithstanding why not talk the logic of engagement sounds good but experience shows that engagement means something different in iran than in the west in may for example then german foreign minister klaus kinkel launched a "critical dialogue" with tehran berlin sought to use trade and incentives to encourage the islamic republic to alter its behavior and indeed it did but not in the way mr kinkel expected on sept iranian hit men assassinated three iranian dissidents and their translator in a berlin restaurant the subsequent german investigation determined that iranian supreme leader ali khamenei president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani and foreign minister ali velayati ordered the murders what about the dialogue "we dont give a damn about your ending the critical dialogue " said supreme leader khamenei upon hearing the german court ruling "we never sought such a dialogue " neither irans terrorism nor intelligence indications of an accelerating nuclear weapons program dampened european enthusiasm for engagement however especially after the election of president muhammad khatami and his subsequent call for a "dialogue of civilizations " "there is more to be said for trying to engage and to draw these societies into the international community than to cut them off " eu external affairs commissioner chris patten explained in february and engage they did between and eu trade with iran almost tripled officials from both sides of the atlantic fawned on the "reformist" mr khatami but the rapprochement including an embarrassing "apology" for past american sins against iran from ms albright did not stop mr khatami from flying to moscow in march to sign a &# billion arms and nuclear technology deal indeed under mr khatami tehran spent more on arms than it had under hashemi rafsanjani irans exploitation of engagement to advance its agenda is the rule rather than the exception in december in the midst of what many cite as the heyday of iran u s cooperation in afghanistan iranian forces dispatched tons of weaponry to palestinian militiamen to derail a u s and european brokered ceasefire between israeli and palestinian forces on june three days after a palestinian islamic jihad suicide bus bomber killed israelis the islamic republic announced a increase in that groups funding western efforts to game the iranian system in short misunderstand the nature of politics in the islamic republic politicians rise and fall but the supreme leaders authority remains supreme rhetoric notwithstanding the president is more figurehead than commander factional differences add color to the iranian scene and there are nuances in economic and social policies but politicians do not alter the regimes ideological underpinnings upon his accession to supreme leader analysts labeled mr khamenei a weak compromise candidate they underestimated him and all who have attempted to encroach upon his power have found themselves marginalized iranians once speculated upon tehran mayor gholamhossein karbaschis meteoric rise a stint in prison ended that in mr khamenei rigged elections to teach frontrunner mr rafsanjani a lesson the result was mahmoud ahmadinejad and as mr ahmadinejad himself has proven obstreperous mr khamenei has built alternative institutions to undercut him still the iranian government is not monolithic and many academics argue that outreach to more pragmatic factions might encourage them at the hardliners expense this is american mirror imaging at its worst mr ahmadinejad may be a bad guy but that doesnt make mr rafsanjani a pragmatist or mr khatami a reformer on key issues relating to nuclear enrichment and terror sponsorship their differences are rhetorical not substantive thus the "pragmatic" mr rafsanjani on feb dismissing u n demands to throttle back nuclear enrichment "we will break the international consensus through wisdom and bravery and foil u s conspiracies against iran " despite the iranian governments unified commitment to forge ahead with the nuclear program some western observers persist in their belief that the islamic republic is searching for a graceful way back from the brink they point to mounting economic hardship inside iran and a backlash against president ahmadinejads demagoguery couldnt engagement empower his critics this makes no sense dialogue and the attendant relaxation of u n sanctions will strengthen and validate the ahmadinejad regime far from being susceptible to western machinations the iranians have proven adept at manipulating us consider that since the beginning of the current tensions the west has retreated from demands that iran cease conversion of yellowcake to uranium gas and end enrichment entirely to the current demand for nothing more than a temporary suspension of uranium enrichment activities and all this while iran funneled weapons to hezbollah shipped explosives into iraq and defied security council resolutions proposals for renewed engagement may be well intentioned but they are naive and dangerous and indeed will undercut any possibility of a diplomatic solution lets review the current situation on sept the international atomic energy agency determined that iran was in violation of its nuclear non proliferation safeguards agreement still the iaea deferred referral to the u n security council to give diplomacy a chance after consulting with her european partners on may secretary of state condoleezza rice offered tehran two ways forward either iran could defy its international commitments and "incur only great costs " or it could suspend enrichment and enjoy "real benefit and longer term security " the iranian regime chose to forego the benefit on dec the u n security council unanimously imposed sanctions the day deadline to comply with u n demands is up so what next those eager to sit down with tehran say that dialogue does not mean abandoning sanctions this is hardly serious washington has already offered and delivered inducements to the regime a clear path to world trade organization accession and spare aircraft parts in exchange for behavior modification in response tehran has offered no confidence building measures all that remains are direct talks and even there washington has dropped the price from ending irans nuclear program to a temporary suspension of enrichment the security council has spoken to change course now would signal the impotence of international institutions and multilateral diplomacy history shows that when the supreme leader believes western resolve is faltering iran will be more defiant and dangerous now is not the time to talk if washington and europe truly believe in the primacy of multilateralism and diplomacy now is the time to ratchet up the pressure ms pletka and mr rubin are respectively vice president for
