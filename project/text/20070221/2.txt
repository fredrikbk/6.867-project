apple iphone faces price hurdle if the &# and &# price tags of apple inc s new iphone are giving you pause you arent alone a recent survey by changewave research of rockville md found that nearly a third of people not interested in purchasing the sleek touch screen device cite the high prices while the expected price of the phone that marries internet access and the playback of music and video from apples itunes online store may not drop soon several analysts who have estimated the cost of making the iphone say the company has the flexibility to lower its prices their estimates also suggest the cupertino calif company could generate substantial profits at the present price of the product which is scheduled for release in june one observer projects an iphone gross margin as high as well ahead of the recent company average of other estimates suggest solid profits from the sale of each device even if at a lower gross margin and even the lower margin estimates suggest substantial profit from the sale of each device apple hasnt said whether less expensive models are in its plans the company acknowledges privately that lower prices are possible over time but has shown a determination in the past not to cut its product prices too quickly apple spokeswoman natalie kerris declined to discuss the gross margin the company expects on the product the costs of making the iphone future pricing plans or the gross margin apple receives on other products anticipation about the iphone has run high since apple chief executive steve jobs unveiled the device at the macworld show in early january investors have been eager to know whether it represents a broad new product category for the computer and ipod maker and whether apple will meet its goal of selling million iphones in many analysts believe this target of of the cellphone market is achievable if price becomes a hurdle the company appears to have room to move it lower says andrew rassweiler a senior analyst at the research firm isuppli corp of el segundo calif mr rassweiler analyzed the components he expects to see in the phone and says the cost of making the &# iphone is &# and the cost of the &# iphone is &# "i think if anything weve been fairly conservative and maybe overestimated" whats needed in the phone he says there does appear to be "enough wiggle room in the design of the phone " agrees richard doherty research director of envisoneering group a seaford n y research firm given apples ability to negotiate component contracts with suppliers the phone could cost &# less than the isuppli estimate says mr doherty who predicts apple will roll out lower priced models within months some suggest at&amp t inc s cingular which has an exclusive distribution deal in the u s could offer a reduced price at macworld apple said the iphones present price would require a two year service contract but apple now insists the contract details havent been announced and cingular spokesman mark siegel says his company isnt ready to disclose its pricing plans the reticence suggests cingular may have special offers for people who sign up for various service offerings some analysts say in addition other carriers will push rival phones to keep cingular from getting a traffic boost from the iphone says rob enderle principal analyst at the enderle group a san jose calif research firm samsung electronics co and lg electronics inc have announced touch screen models and speculation has surfaced that microsoft corp may be interested in testing phone technology for its zune music player as a result mr enderle says there may be "some price erosion" in the iphone "i would not be surprised to see the price get lowered" whether by apple or cingular says jonathan hoopes an analyst at thinkequity partners who doesnt own apple shares and whose firm doesnt conduct banking for the company some analysts are less convinced and they question how much margin apple has priced in the product according to isupplis component estimate the iphones presently come with gross margins ranging from to says mr rassweiler this is well above apples average in the fiscal first quarter ended in december apple reported a companywide gross margin of and analysts say its macintosh computers and ipods sell with lower gross margins of about software services and peripherals help bring up the total the big difference between the ipod macintosh and iphone margins has some analysts questioning the isuppli breakdown andy hargreaves an analyst at pacific crest securities says he anticipates the iphone gross margin to be to not that much different from the macintosh margin as apple gets more efficient at producing the phone and as negotiations with component suppliers bring volume discounts the margin will rise but not right away says mr hargreaves who owns apple stock but whose firm doesnt conduct banking business for the company john jacobs director of notebook research at displaysearch an austin texas research firm focused on flat panel displays also takes exception the isuppli breakdown didnt include a liquid crystal display screen with enough resolution or touch screen technology responsive to satisfy apple mr jacobs says both add cost displaysearch estimates the cost of the &# iphone to be more than &# suggesting a gross margin with a percentage in the mid s apple could eventually produce a lower cost phone but not for some time mr jacobs says "i see them staying at the high end for at least quite some time " mr jacobs said if so the strategy would closely mirror the way apple has marketed the ipod as new generations of ipods came out apple often added more memory and new features to high end models but held their price steady after several years it began introducing lower priced models
