assessing the latest in tax return software sales of tax preparation software are expected to rise briskly again this year thanks in large measure to our tax systems stunning complexity because of recent tax law changes taxpayers have to navigate even more tricky new turns for example congress waited to extend three major tax deductions until december after the irs had gone to press with its forms and instructions thus taxpayers have to follow special instructions to claim them tax prep programs do the work for you tax software is big business and getting bigger each year revenue from intuit inc s turbotax surged last year to more than &# million and the company is forecasting strong gains this year in second place is h&amp r block inc s taxcut both intuit and h&amp r block are scheduled to announce their latest financial results tomorrow recently i have been testing high end versions of turbotax and taxcut once again the software makers have made their products easier to use theyve improved the clarity of their questionnaires and offered helpful new advice however one of the biggest attractions of tax software is also one of its biggest dangers software has improved so much that it can give you a false sense of confidence veteran tax preparers say some people race through the process too quickly make mistakes and overlook valuable tax saving opportunities as good as these products are many people with complex tax situations still need a human hand to guide them through the internal revenue code labyrinth that is particularly true for people with major life changes who own their own businesses have stakes in partnerships or have to file several state tax returns "unless you have a reasonably straightforward situation youve got a financial risk in doing it yourself even with the help of consumer software " says claudia hill owner of tax mam inc a tax preparation and planning firm in cupertino calif and an enrolled agent which means she is licensed to practice before the irs which program is best for you that depends on many factors such as how complex your tax situation is how much you know about taxes whether youre up to date on all the latest changes how much your tax situation has changed since last year and how comfortable you are with computers i found both programs i tested to be impressive and remarkably easy to navigate while neither can handle every question they each do a fine job with the basics and even with a few curve balls i threw at them both companies also offer free helpful tips and calculators on their web sites turbotax turbotax intuit com and h&amp r block hrblock com here are a few things to consider before buying any tax prep program if your income is &# or less and you have a fairly simple tax situation such as claiming the standard deduction consider not buying either brand you can get free federal tax preparation and electronic filing services online through the "free file alliance " a partnership between a group of software makers and the irs go to the irs web site www irs gov and click on " free file " at press time there were free products to choose from including taxact taxslayer com and liberty tax online the irs estimates about million taxpayers or about of all individual filers can take advantage of free file watch out for special restrictions though such as age or geographic limits if your income is more than &# but your tax situation is fairly simple taxcut should be fine and its generally less expensive than turbotax this year all versions of taxcut are pc and mac compatible last year h&amp r block didnt offer a mac version you dont have to buy a tax prep package in a store look into web based online tax prep products which are less expensive if you have a more complex tax situation i recommend turbotax one aspect of turbotax that i find especially useful i was able to download electronically the information on the w form from my employer into turbotax taxcut doesnt offer this feature you can also import electronically large amounts of investment information such as dividends and interest income from numerous financial institutions that saves time aggravation and errors but not all employers and financial institutions participate for example i wasnt able to download the form showing my wages from yale university where i taught a course last year separately i like turbotaxs handy "itsdeductible" feature that estimates the value of used clothing and other noncash items donated to charity taxcut has a similar feature but turbotax generally was more helpful especially for high end items if youve decided to buy tax prep software and have also been thinking about buying personal finance software such as quicken or microsoft money do both at the same time you can save money through packaged deals if something doesnt look right dont always assume the software is perfect wes bushman who lives in the tampa bay fla area and is a longtime taxcut user recently discovered a problem with taxcut involving calculation of an underpayment penalty on form and alerted the company a block spokeswoman says block did recently become "aware of an issue" regarding that form "through our own research " and that "a fix is already in the works " she adds that "less than of taxcut filers have been affected " despite the glitch mr bushman says hell probably buy taxcut again next year even if you think you know everything about taxes be careful about zipping through the interviews even if the questions seem irrelevant there have been several important tax law changes and theyre easy to miss also be sure to download all updates the suspense continues in a high profile tax battle over municipal bonds the u s supreme court was expected to announce yesterday whether it would agree to hear an appeal by the state of kentucky but it didnt the issue in the case is whether kentucky can tax interest received by a kentucky couple on their out
