business bookshelf the tough choices are the important ones the three tensions by dominic dodd and ken favaro jossey bass pages &# in "the three tensions " dominic dodd and ken favaro draw on their backgrounds as management consultants to look at the basic problems that senior managers face their readers may feel some tension as well faced with the task of digging the books useful insights out of its padded prose still it is a solvable problem unlike so many in the businesses they discuss managers according to messrs dodd and favaro often feel as if they must choose between profit and growth between short term results and long term between the separate success of individual business units and their integration into the whole company typically such choices oscillate managers may focus on growth at all costs for instance then inefficiencies appear and they shift to making the business as profitable as possible but then revenue stagnates and growth is the new mantra and so on there has to be a better way messrs dodd and favaro think there is they say that the way to profitable growth for example is to focus on "customer benefit " in other words stop obsessing about the chocolate you make and start thinking about what the customer gets out of it a treat a hostess gift or something else this isnt a new concept of course marketers have reminded themselves for ages that customers dont want a inch drill they want a inch hole but "the three tensions" updates the idea by detailing how the current emphasis on "customer focus" can lead companies astray in the name of the customer companies may add features or introduce slight variations on products raising costs while not increasing the customers interest in the slightest companies may also enter markets where growth is rapid but where they have no chance of success the book says that companies can avoid the "customer focus trap" by among other things figuring out how to grow the whole market not just their share cadbury schweppes for instance is increasing the market for chewing gum by thinking of it as a delivery mechanism for dental care products and perhaps eventually medications the book is less persuasive on the short vs long term problem messrs dodd and favaro say that executives need to stop trying to maximize the stock price because the effort distorts their judgment causing them to miss out on long term gains this may be right but it wont happen not in this bonus driven world where hedge funds pounce at any sign of weakness the authors also urge executives who are deciding how much to invest in their different operations to do so based on the long term prospects in their industry not on short term swings in profit but they concede that there is no way of knowing whether the long term view is accurate still "the three tensions" offers one interesting test of whether earnings are sustainable if earnings growth comes primarily from profit margins or primarily from revenue it is less reliable in the long term earnings growth the authors say needs to come from both sources in a roughly equal way if it is to be sustained they sensibly recommend "post earnings" reviews an attempt to break down the numbers and determine for example how much of recent earnings came from new customers and how much from old how much from growth in the market and how much from growth in market share the books treatment of the whole vs the parts problem is its knottiest section considering the wide array of corporate structures and the challenges that each may present the subject is really too complicated for quick treatment messrs dodd and favaro offer suggestions on how to centralize and decentralize simultaneously for example by creating a central group to handle logistics and then giving business units considerable authority to decide whether to use that group or hire an outside vendor they also say that businesses should consider "commonizing" that is standardizing procedures for something like procurement without having a central function to handle all of it to anyone who read the authors december harvard business review article on the three tensions many of these arguments will feel familiar there is nothing wrong in that but the book stretches out the business review piece to many more words while providing very little information or analysis that is new thus it is easy to bog down in verbiage and repetition the fifth chapter in this six chapter book merely rehearses much that has gone before and the final chapter is a digression into the cyclical nature of management theories even within chapters the padding is extraordinary in the section on the whole vs the parts the authors take six pages to explain the difference between vertical and horizontal relationships in a company it can be done in one at the end of these six pages there is a word box that repeats yet again the obvious distinction arguing in favor of "diagonal" assets assets that dont really belong to the corporate center or to the business units the authors write "diagonal assets are a companys best source for making the whole worth more than the sum of the parts " five sentences later they write "it is these diagonal assets that are central to the ability of a company to meet the daunting challenge of being more than simply the sum of its parts " so heres my solution to the tension that messrs dodd and favaro create read the harvard business review article you may profit in the short term and the long mr carroll is writing with chunka mui "the devils advocate avoiding the eight strategy mistakes that cost companies billions "
