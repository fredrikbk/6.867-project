how sirius xm deal would affect listeners unified satellite radio service would combine best of both but proposal raises questions about compatibility and pricing many consumers have delayed purchasing a satellite radio subscription because of confusion over the blizzard of choices involving which service to buy xm or sirius and where to have it installed car desktop or portable device but while the proposed merger of sirius satellite radio inc and xm satellite radio holdings inc is supposed to ease uncertainty consumers in the near term may find themselves more baffled than ever sirius and xm have been playing up the benefits of their proposed deal as an end to confusion in the marketplace rather than having to pick between howard stern on sirius or oprah winfrey on xm listeners would have all the big stars available through one service the same applies with sports broadcasts where sirius now offers the national football league and national basketball association and xm counters with major league baseball consumers currently are left only to guess as to which service offers the best music programming the merger would combine the best of both in addition the two companies now offer a wide array of competing radios which all seem to have slightly different features or functionality forcing consumers to gamble on whether for example the sirius stiletto portable device is superior to xms inno special antennas for cars create additional consumer inertia as does the need to buy a separate subscription for each device such concerns are among the reasons that subscription growth rates for both xm and sirius have slowed down recently the proposed merger would seem to offer a vast simplification and one stop shopping but for all of the possible benefits the proposed deal may cause even greater hesitation until its finally completed many months from now if ever consumers may be wary that radios they purchase during the long transition period during which the companies are seeking regulatory approval could one day become obsolete similarly some may put off purchases on the theory the government approval will be hard to win and therefore the benefits of the combined sirius xm will never materialize a big concern is pricing "a monopoly satellite radio provider would be able to raise prices and cut programming to a growing number of consumers that have come to rely on satellite radio for news and entertainment " fumed chris reale founder of the washington based consumer coalition for competition in satellite radio the companies say that their biggest competitor regular broadcast radio is free and hinders steep price increases for now the satellite radio companies are taking care to reassure consumers that service will continue as usual in messages each company sent to subscribers tuesday they promised that they would operate independently until a merger was finalized which sirius said would come by the end of and xm said could take until early some million people currently subscribe to either sirius or xm even after that both companies promise that existing radios will continue to work since they wont be altering the underlying satellite technology although they dont assert that the radios will work forever "we have millions and millions of radios out there " gary parsons xm chairman told analysts in a conference call "we have to continue to have a backwards compatibility and serve that very large customer base " each company has different and incompatible systems for beaming programming to consumers each company has a group of satellites that send signals in different parts of the satellite radio spectrum modifying existing satellites to serve all of the radios out there would be an unlikely solution engineers say instead the companies are likely to accelerate existing plans to roll out a radio that can pull in signals from both groups of satellites a team of engineers in boca raton fla has been working on such a solution for years because the federal communications commission mandated the companies work toward a dual format radio when it awarded them their licenses in the engineers have found a technical solution but havent yet reached the point where the equipment can fit neatly into the small receivers consumers are used to the merger "is not going to help their subscribership " says jimmy schaeffler senior analyst at consultancy the carmel group "they should be doing whatever they can to clarify consumer confusion " he says the companies should consider promising a free upgraded dual format radio to anyone who joins either service this year subject to merger approval millions of consumers have satellite radio because it came installed in a new car but getting a new feature like a radio into cars requires years of planning in the event of a merger some car makers run the risk that factory installed radios may be already out of date as their latest models roll off production lines conversely merging satellite operations could entice even more car buyers to sign up for satellite on tuesday many car companies seemed unsure about how a merger would affect them "this is news to us " says jon bucci corporate manager for advanced technology at toyota motor sales usa which has a deal with xm to install radios on its cars at the factory and with sirius to install radios at the dealership at delphi corp which makes radios for both xm and sirius "its really too early to tell what the impact will be " a spokeswoman says at general motors corp xms biggest auto maker partner a spokeswoman for onstar its in car communication service says gm would work closely with xm to ensure uninterrupted service a merger would allow the companies to eliminate duplication for example each company offers rock music stations catering to specific eras such as the s a combined company could offer just one set of the time frame targeted programming saving the extra bandwidth for other niches like special interest talk shows alternatively they could allocate more bandwidth to channels where they wanted to improve sound quality such as classical music and the companies may allow tiers of service where customers could pay for the programming they want some customers look forward to a potential merger gary bradt a psychologist in summerfield n c and an xm subscriber says he hopes the deal goes through so he can get nfl games that are currently available only on sirius "im not worried about them jacking the prices too much at least right away " he says "if they were stupid enough to do that they would fail and good riddance " dueling services some of the different programming now offered by competing satellite radio
