glaxos adversary is also an ally are glaxosmithkline plc and ranbaxy laboratories ltd friends or foes both it turns out glaxosmithkline the second largest drug company in the world by sales after pfizer inc earlier this month expanded a four year old partnership to develop new drugs with ranbaxy an indian generic drug maker but the same two companies are locked in a legal dispute because ranbaxy wants to sell a cheaper copycat version of a glaxosmithkline antiherpes drug before its patent expires which the united kingdoms glaxosmithkline opposes executives with both companies take their dichotomous relationship in stride glaxosmithkline chief executive jean pierre garnier this week praised ranbaxys chemists but in the next breath vowed to fight ranbaxys generic drugs unit "both friend and foe of the same company thats exactly right " ranbaxy spokesman charles caprariello said this love hate relationship embodies some paradoxical trends in the industry and could signal a greater melding of branded and generic business models "the opportunity for reinventing the relationship between branded pharmaceutical and generics companies which has historically been very adversarial is there " said hussain mooraj life sciences research director with amr research competition from cheaper generic drugs has squeezed profits at the big pharmaceutical companies that market brand name drugs generics makers are increasingly aggressive about trying to sell copycat versions of blockbuster medications years before patents expire marketers of brand name drugs try to fend off challenges by filing patent infringement lawsuits hoping to preserve market exclusivity for the entire life of a patent at the same time generics makers are dipping their toes into the branded drug market and performing innovative research two of the largest generics makers teva pharmaceutical industries ltd and barr pharmaceuticals inc also sell top selling branded drugs for multiple sclerosis and birth control respectively ironically the branded drugs sold by generic companies sometimes face generic competition from their rivals a classic case of getting a taste of your own medicine meanwhile big pharma companies are under pressure to cut costs and one way to do this is to use more research scientists in low cost nations such as india and china ranbaxy has its own stable of scientists in india which has proved attractive to a big pharma company like glaxosmithkline "while we compete with big pharma there is a large opportunity to cooperate and partner " ranbaxy chief executive malvinder mohan singh said in an interview shortly before the expanded alliance with glaxosmithkline was announced he said the scientific talent in india could be "leveraged" by large drug makers to lower their costs glaxosmithklines mr garnier agrees "in india they have some of the best chemists in the world " he said at a meeting with journalists from the wall street journal and dow jones newswires big pharma companies can provide these chemists with additional expertise and resources so it is natural for companies like glaxosmithkline and ranbaxy to work together on research he added it is ranbaxys other mission that irks mr garnier "next to that is the generic division whose sole purpose in life is to beat us up on patents and so were going to fight them " mr garnier said for its part ranbaxy makes no apologies for taking on blockbuster drug patents "our job is to challenge patents we feel are potentially superfluous or not well grounded " mr caprariello said "thats part of our business " the patent dispute centers on the glaxosmithkline drug valtrex which went on sale in the u s in and is approved to treat genital herpes cold sores and shingles sales in were about &# billion and glaxosmithkline says a u s patent for the drug expires in june in ranbaxy filed for u s food and drug administration approval to sell generic valtrex arguing glaxosmithklines patent was either invalid or not infringed glaxosmithkline filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ranbaxy in federal court in new jersey seeking to prevent the launch of a generic valtrex before the patent expires in early february ranbaxy received fda approval for generic valtrex and notified glaxosmithkline that it planned to market the drug in the u s glaxosmithkline said feb it would request a preliminary injunction to stop ranbaxy under the terms of an earlier agreement in the litigation if glaxosmithkline requests the injunction within days ranbaxy wont launch generic valtrex until the court either rules on the injunction or decides the pending court case the valtrex patent dispute is fairly typical ranbaxy has challenged patents for many blockbuster brand name drugs most notably it has tried with some success to knock down pfizers patents for the top selling lipitor anticholesterol pill what is less common is that glaxosmithkline and ranbaxy are also partners the alliance blossomed in when the companies said that ranbaxy would perform early studies of potential drugs and that glaxosmithkline would generally complete development once promising compounds were selected glaxosmithkline would then lead the commercialization of any successful compounds under the recently announced expanded partnership ranbaxy would stay involved in the drug development process longer although glaxosmithkline would generally still complete the studies also ranbaxy could receive more than &# million in potential milestone payments for a product developed by ranbaxy and launched by glaxosmithkline for multiple uses the collaboration includes work on compounds to potentially treat infections cancer and metabolic and respiratory conditions
