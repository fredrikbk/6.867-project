making radio waves as the federal communications commission ponders the merits of allowing satellite radio companies sirius and xm to combine lets hope the ghost of another proposed merger haunts the proceedings in the fcc blocked satellite television rivals echostar and directv from joining forces on the grounds that allowing the merger would decrease competition and lead to higher prices michael powell the fcc chairman at the time said the deal would create a satellite monopoly in the event regulatory intervention based on an overly narrow definition of the market has only led to unfulfilled promise in satellite broadband five years later the cable and phone companies are by and large eating satellites lunch in attracting subscribers rupert murdoch is in the process of selling his stake in directv and consumers who want one provider for television internet and phone service have fewer options than they might otherwise if the regulators had stayed out of the way which brings us to the proposed merger of xm and sirius on news of the deal fcc chairman kevin martin remarked that the regulatory hurdles "would be high " if so the agency might want to write more up to date regulations the current "digital audio radio service" rules date to the late s before high definition radio ipods pandora com music file sharing and other options existed the media landscape has changed a bit since the police split up beltway critics of the deal see a media monopolist around every corner scheming to limit the publics access to content and its true that the merger would create a lone satellite radio company but a pure monopoly is one that exists in a market where there are no close substitutes by contrast a combined sirius xm would have to compete not only with free broadcast radio but also with mp players online radio and even music channels offered by cable providers heaven only knows what the cellular companies will bring to the party theyre already gearing up to provide more video options but theres nothing stopping verizon or cingular from coming up with a device that includes a couple of dozen radio stations to compete with satellite which is why the real danger here isnt the creation of a "monopoly " unless you define the market in a way that has no resemblance to the real world the bigger concern is that regulators will repeat the satellite television mistake and in the process reduce consumer choice "the reason for this merger is not to exclude others from the market " says adam thierer who follows telecom issues at the progress &amp freedom foundation "its to make sure they can compete in the broader market against the various players they face serious competitors that have satellite radio providers scrambling for their lives " the most vocal opponents will be traditional radio broadcasters who will want the deal scotched outright or at least conditioned on satellite operators being prohibited from offering local services news weather traffic that would compete with their own offerings legislation to this effect has been floating around for the last couple of congresses courtesy of republican representative charles pickering of mississippi we hope mr martin will resist any push for industrial protectionism if this deal or subscription based satellite radio in general turns out to be a bust the marketplace will let us know in due time see related letter "letters to the editor xm and sirius" wsj march
