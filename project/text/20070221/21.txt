content will always be king in the old days the kind of broadside viacom fired at google demanding it take down more than clips being distributed illegally on youtube would have carried a bone crunching thud instead it fizzled many dismissed it as a negotiating tactic at best media pundit and web acolyte jeff jarvis was succinct in his appraisal "fools " the internet so thoroughly thrashed the music industry that most people assume the same unfair fight will break out over the distribution of video its the "im a mac im a pc" conflict on a large scale with the media conglomerates cast as the helpless nerd youtube don tapscott recently wrote on this editorial page "has reinvented the television ballpark " but the studios dont need to kowtow to the internet evangelizers because there are significant differences between audio and video distribution web sites like youtube wont be able to topple the networks as easily as file swappers wracked the music moguls and viacoms move yesterday to license its programming through the startup joost com may be a broadside that does find its target "viacom and other legacy media companies should not overrate youtube as anything more than what it is an online on demand video delivery system for short snappy clips most of which are not watched by anyone other than the poster " notes rich hanley director of graduate programs in the school of communications at quinnipiac university in hamden conn file swapping crippled the music industry almost overnight but for all its popularity youtube still doesnt have a proven revenue model its widely assumed google will graft its advertising model onto youtube what will emerge will be a distribution platform where viewers watch video for free with the profits coming from advertising sound familiar media conglomerates have been doing that for decades through tv the revenue model isnt going to change the value proposition for the studios will actually get better as more programming drifts online they can offer "" and its audience plus targeted ads because of that ad dollars will continue to flow to the programs that draw the most viewers the video of two guys dropping mentos into coke bottles and setting off a symphony of exploding soda is brilliant and shows how creative user generated content can be but shows like "lost" and "the office" which cant be produced out of someones garage bring in millions of viewers week after week year after year advertisers pay handsomely for access to those audiences and that wont change what you can see from viacoms recent moves is a studio trying to set a value for its programming in the online marketplace mr hanley says through an outlet like youtube that programming is literally worthless because its not generating any revenue instead he argues the studios should focus on long form distribution systems like joost com which aims to more or less replicate a revenue generating television type platform on the web combined with the webs on demand advantages youtube will still have some value but mainly as a marketing platform of course the studios will have to compete in the online marketplace with user generated video but even that will be a good thing because it will spur the studios into creating more quality shows and less dreck with any luck the next "flavor of love" wont even get made so anybody who thinks videos of cats flushing toilets is going to also flush away the networks the scores of programs they show and millions of viewers they attract is missing the point advertisers need a platform like tv and theyll spend real money to keep it around in one form or another shows like "the simpsons" and events like the super bowl may attract fewer viewers as the marketplace expands but dont expect the cost of an ad to go down the ability to cobble together millions of viewers consistently will only become more valuable not less and the networks know how to do that youtube does not and for all its innovation youtube with its grainy short clips cant compete with television and wasnt really designed to eventually somebody will develop a platform that transmits video across the internet with the quality consistency and ease of use that boring old television does it may even be google or joost until then most people will continue to watch tv and most advertisers will continue to advertise there the studios have time to devise their game plans theres no need to abdicate the crown to google just yet for now the studios ought to focus on what they do best in the end its not really about the distribution platform or the revenue model viewers wont care about those things they just want to see jack bauer beat the bad guys content will always be king mr vigna writes and edits the market talk column at dow jones newswires
