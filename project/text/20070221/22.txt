corporate focus business jetblue now just another airline in a lousy business according to his biographers at age he already has two jetblue founder and chief executive david neeleman has suffered all his life from attention deficit disorder for which he refuses medication that could explain why he got into the airline industry had he stopped long to think about it he might have directed his talents elsewhere airlines are a lousy business fixed costs are high while the marginal cost of selling one more seat is low and barriers to new entrants at least in the u s are scant the result is ruinous competition with companies bidding prices too low for anyone to make money airlines are left scrambling to find passengers willing to pay above market prices and praying they wont be hit by one of the periodic events beyond their control that destroys the business recessions terror attacks oil price spikes or as mr neeleman discovered last week an ill timed snowstorm its a testament to the indomitability of the human spirit or perhaps the obdurateness of the human ego that hardy entrepreneurs keep venturing into this morass since the airlines were deregulated in close to u s airlines have come and gone meanwhile most of the big survivors have done a turn in bankruptcy court its that sad history that prompted investor warren buffett to quip that capitalism would have been better served if someone had shot down the wright brothers over kitty hawk or virgin atlantic owner richard branson to say the best way to become a millionaire is to "start as a billionaire and then buy an airline " once upon a time a week ago to be precise mr neeleman was regarded as a different breed his vow to "bring humanity back to air travel" was more than an empty slogan it was backed by action business school professors praised his egalitarian vision and the companys unique culture in which all passengers were treated as "customers" capitalized to emphasize their importance and all employees treated as "crew members " a harvard business school case study in approvingly quoted ann rhoades then the companys "executive vice president for people " as saying "to me the most important element was caring i want jetblue to care about our people from end to end " employees who were treated well the company believed would treat customers well for a while that formula worked the airline grew rapidly and earned the loyalty of passengers and investors alike then in late and early rapidly rising costs pushed the company into the red in response jetblue launched a program it called "rtp" return to profitability the company found some &# million in cost savings and cut employee head count per airplane by in response the stock price soared to nearly &# a share in mid january from just above &# in early october then came the valentines day massacre hour waits on the runway a string of last minute cancellations and a general systems breakdown that turned "customers" into a screaming mob and caused teary eyed "crew members" to call security for their own safety in five days some flights were canceled and when it was over jetblue was just another airline or worse jetblues meltdown lasted days after the snow had stopped falling mr neelemans promise to bring "humanity back to air travel" went into reverse late night television comic david letterman joked that passengers who were forced to sit on a runway for hours in new york would be compensated by getting "a free voucher to sit on a runway for hours in miami " yesterday mr neeleman argued in a flurry of media appearances that there was an "easy fix" to the airlines problems i doubt it the cost of reimbursing displaced people will pass and disgruntled passengers will in time return but my guess is efforts to implement the airlines new "customer bill of rights" will put a crimp in its cost cutting preparing for the unexpected after all involves redundancy at some point theres a trade off between low costs and customer service as a result jetblue is likely to float in and out of profitability like its elder brethren leaving it to yet another hearty pioneer to try and finally discover an airline business model that works alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
