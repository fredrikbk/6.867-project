mobile banking shifts into higher gear moving money paying bills by cellphone is getting easier what about dropped calls mobile banking has been around for awhile but only lately has it begun to live up to its promise while banks tried to offer some rudimentary services via mobile devices during the dot com boom in the late s those earlier versions were difficult to use and customers largely ignored them now banks are rolling out upgraded services that allow users to do their basic banking fairly easily paying bills from a commuter train for example or checking a bank balance from a store checkout line and moving funds to cover the purchase last week bank of america corp introduced a service that lets customers check balances pay bills and transfer money between their accounts on their mobile devices it comes on the heels of a similar service that wachovia corp kicked off last year later this year citigroup inc s citibank plans to introduce a mobile banking application that customers can download to their cellphones wells fargo &amp co has been pilot testing three different approaches to mobile banking and it expects to fine tune its strategy later this year while the banks are offering the services for free there are some potential downsides it can mean larger cellphone bills a dropped connection could leave you wondering if a banking transaction was completed or not moreover the number of viruses that are attacking mobile devices such as blackberrys is on the rise making it riskier to conduct financial transactions over them also there are some banking activities that users generally cant do on their mobile devices you may not be able to open new accounts or add new bill payees for example financial institutions which stand to save a bundle since transactions over a mobile phone cost a fraction of face to face transactions have big hopes for mobile banking in the u s yet fewer than of americans use mobile banking services compared with in western europe and japan dan schatt an analyst at boston based consultant celent llc says he expects that by the end of this year of people who currently bank online will use mobile banking "its the young folks that are going to drive this forward because they are already using their mobile phones for so much more than just conversation " he says wachovia says its mobile banking service attracts between and users a day jonathan swatts a year old marketing representative from mobile ala says he stumbled across wachovias mobile banking service last fall when he visited the banks web site on his cellphone mr swatts who frequently travels prefers to check his banking activity on his mobile phone when hes on the road "i just check my account and make sure things have been debited and credited correctly " he says "i dont have to go through the fuss of hooking up my computer " earlier generations of mobile banking were fairly unwieldy to use surfing the web was slow and tedious and relied on browsers that werent configured for easy reading on tiny screens now some three quarters of americans own a cellphone network connections are faster and more reliable and larger mobile screens are making mobile banking more similar to banking online requiring users to log in and pass various security barriers to get access to their accounts what customers see when they bank over their phone will depend on their bank with bank of america and wachovias mobile banking offerings users can surf to the banks web sites because the browsers are designed to fit the smaller screens customers will be able to move through the sites in much the same way they bank online others will be able to punch a short text code into their cellphone and get a text message back from their bank with their account balance for example within seconds customers can also request to have their bank send them a text message if their account balance falls below specified levels or if the bank notices any questionable activity and customers can message back still other banks are working on new downloadable applications that are designed to be easier and faster to use than web browsers or text messaging services citibanks mobile banking application which is developed by mfoundry inc works much like an ipod instead of scrolling through a web site users click through a menu of options some experts say text messaging is less secure than browsing or applications since the data that are being transmitted arent always encrypted but joseph salesky chief executive of clairmail inc which provides financial services firms with two way text messaging and web software for mobile banking points out that the information that users include in their text messages doesnt include any confidential data "theres less information in that message than there is on an atm receipt so theres nothing that could really be compromised " says jim smith an executive vice president of wells fargos internet services group which is testing the text messaging technology another consideration in a text message service paying bills or transferring funds above a specified amount could also trigger an additional security step such as a call from the bank prompting customers to enter another security code to approve the transaction to get started consumers need to check with their mobile carriers to see if and how they will be charged for these services all new phones today allow consumers to send and receive text messages and most new handsets now come with access to the web but consumers have to pay for such services in addition to the monthly voice plans some carriers charge a few cents per message sent or received while some offer unlimited text messaging plans for several dollars per month its not just the big banks that are jumping in in recent months many of the companies that run online banking services for smaller banks and credit unions such as checkfree corp online resources corp and yodlee inc have launched their own mobile banking services cingular wireless a unit of at&amp t inc recently announced plans to launch a mobile banking service that will be available on cingular handsets as part of a deal between the carrier and firethorn holdings llc a closely held company that specializes in mobile banking washington state employees credit union of olympia wash has been testing an application offered by access softek inc in addition to the standard features offered by other mobile banking applications users also get quicken like features on their phones such as charts detailing their spending history when jason kraft a year old information technology analyst in milpitas calif heard about citibanks upcoming mobile banking service he had initially hoped that the service would allow him to pay for items using his cellphone after finding out that the application was similar to what he could already do online he was less than excited "personally i dont see a need to have constant access to online banking or bill pay when im on the go " he says "its not like i need to pay my utility bill right now it could wait a few hours until i get home " amol sharma
