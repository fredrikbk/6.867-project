ahead of the tape is inflation view from fed worth taking to bank federal reserve policy makers dont see inflation heating up this year but be careful banking on that forecast todays consumer price report from the labor department will probably show inflation is on the warm side of what fed officials want economists estimate the consumer price index was just higher in january than it was in december contained by lower fuel prices but the "core" cpi which excludes food and energy prices could be a trouble spot it is expected to be reported up for january that would put it above last years levels not far below the decade high yearly change it hit in september the fed pays close attention to such core measures of inflation because theyre less volatile than measures with food and energy statistical quirks make the core index hard to read when energy prices fall it can push up the housing rental piece of the core price index thats because of how the government accounts for changes in utility costs still traders would view any outsize increase in the core cpi as trouble for the fed and the markets recent economic data have been mixed and the housing downturn could still slow growth so inflation is unlikely to become a front burner issue now but bruce kasman j p morgan chase head of economic research sees a pickup in the economy later this year potentially changing that mr kasman also sees little economic slack around the world companies are using up more capacity and the pool of skilled labor is tightening yet he says interest rates are lower than they have been in the past when slack was just as tight mr kasman says central banks will raise rates quickly before letting inflation return reason enough to keep investors on guard for now organic price pressures could hurt whole foods one small slice of the economy is seeing its own version of price pressures organic food that could mean trouble for organic food specialist whole foods markets which reports fiscal first quarter earnings today analysts polled by thomson financial estimate the company earned cents a share including stock option expenses unchanged from last year grocery chains such as safeway and kroger have been elbowing into whole foods bread and butter organic food business wal mart stores has also beefed up its organic offerings thats boosting some food prices as organic farmers charge more for products such as apples and lettuce global organic sales rose about in to nearly &# billion from the previous year according to organic monitor an industry trade group which says higher demand is causing supply shortages the trouble for whole foods is that its having a hard time passing on these higher costs because of the increased competition in november whole foods shares plunged after the company cut its same store sales forecast citing tougher competition since then shares have been treading water if sales weakened further in the latest quarter or profit margins slid investors who hung on hoping for good news may cut and run if whole foods posts better than expected results it means it has more pricing power than investors thought scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
