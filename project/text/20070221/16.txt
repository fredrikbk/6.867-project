cable tvs new aim free us from tangle of boxes and remotes when it comes to innovation the cable tv industry has been long on talk but slow on action for years cable executives have promised viewers theyd soon be using remotes to shop play games interact with advertisers and vote contestants off the island but these and many other features for the most part havent been delivered meanwhile innovations appear daily on the internet some prognosticators predict the internet eventually will beat cable in the battle for the living room with most of the entertainment americans consume piped over the web to television sets that would leave cable operators with the unglamorous and less lucrative job of providing the pipes but now something is happening that may tilt the playing field more to the cable guys advantage after more than six years of development by cablelabs the industrys research and development arm cable operators are rolling out technology that could facilitate new applications and help cable tv maintain its dominant position in home entertainment the technology addresses an age old problem at the root of the cable industry because the industry grew up as thousands of separate systems there was little consistency in the technology used making service upgrades difficult this remained true even though many systems were consolidated by giants such as comcast and time warner just to add a feature like a news ticker on the bottom of the screen for example software has to be modified many times to fit different set top boxes and network gear in a multitude of systems the new technology with the cumbersome name of ocap for open cable application platform is software that behaves like an operating system that runs on digital cable set top boxes and other devices ocap then is to set top boxes what microsoft windows is to computers adding a new feature like the ticker is an easy task regardless of the cable system that ease is expected to spark a flurry of creativity among software companies as new applications will no longer have to be tailored to fit separate cable systems even better manufacturers such as panasonic samsung and lg already have designed ocap tv sets that will eliminate the need for set top boxes the scourge of many a home entertainment center with ocap tvs scheduled to be available as early as this year users just have to attach a cable and the set will get video on demand advanced program guides and other interactive features from cable ocap also enables manufacturers to design a unit combining dvd players digital video recorders and other devices within a set top box so cable subscribers wont need to lease boxes from their operators income hardly worth the capital outlay to get all of the interactive features any ocap device they buy from an electronics retailer will do the trick as long as the cable system has been upgraded for it some manufacturers predict a slew of new devices to follow such as one that could pipe in cable tv while grabbing photos music and videos off home computers some see ocap even helping to solve that other curse multiple remotes but be patient like any new technology ocap still faces significant obstacles and uncertainty it will have an impact only if its used in enough cable systems to attract the attention of software companies and device makers who need to sell in large volumes the good news is that a few of the largest cable operators are moving quickly to deploy ocap hoping to head off growing competition from phone companies satellite tv and the internet time warner plans to install its first ocap set top boxes in subscribers homes in may and is scheduled to have all of its systems ocap ready by july time warner cable subscribers will first see the benefit of this later this year when the company uses ocap to enhance its program guide other cable operators arent far behind comcast the largest cable company with more than million subscribers plans to deploy ocap in two markets before years end cox communications another large operator hopes to be able to begin trials for ocap devices in a half dozen markets this year but no matter how fast cable operators move their progress in deploying ocap is going to be limited by the tens of millions of digital cable boxes already in place most of those boxes dont have the memory or the processing power to run ocap for ocap to reach critical mass cable operators must offer enough advanced features at a good price to convince consumers to order the new devices cable companies dont have a luxury of time while some consumer electronics companies are working with ocap others like sony hewlett packard and apple are developing devices that bypass cable operators altogether by routing movies tv shows and other content from the internet to the tv the race is on send email to peter grant wsj com
