politics &amp economics palestinian factions labor to sustain truce rice leaves mideast without endorsing rejecting their deal gaza city gaza strip abu mujahad and yasser said are trying to hold together a fragile palestinian peace here via cellphone mr mujahad is loyal to the executive force led by hamas while mr said reports to its rival faction fatah the two groups responsible for fighting that has left hundreds of palestinians dead in the past year are coordinating a peace accord reached feb in the muslim holy city of mecca saudi arabia through what they call a "joint operations center " in reality it is more like a speed dial list as rival commanders ensconced in their separate redoubts keep in near constant contact when the smallest trouble flares in the gaza strip an estimated million palestinians share the patch of land spanning about square miles both sides acknowledged in separate interviews yesterday that tensions remain high and that there have been multiple breaches of their accord still they said their fears about open warfare erupting anew were based on political and diplomatic processes far beyond the streets where their men maintain a tense standoff "we are sure we will have problems in the future but cooperation between all the parties to solve them will be much easier if they have an agreement at the top " mr said said secretary of state condoleezza rice left the middle east yesterday without openly accepting or rejecting the mecca deal that brought the tentative peace her departure followed three days of talks including the first three way summit since featuring american israeli and palestinian leaders there were few tangible results and no one wants to predict how long after her departure the agreement will last in addition to ending the fighting the mecca accord calls for the formation of a unity government between hamas the islamist movement that won u s backed elections in the palestinian territories a year ago and the secular fatah movement which is headed by the separately elected palestinian president mahmoud abbas fatah which was founded by the late yasser arafat had controlled the palestinian territories since the oslo peace accords of the s since hamass rise to power fighting between the two sides has left more than palestinians dead the vast majority of them in gaza where hamas is generally believed to be stronger while there were no breakthroughs during ms rices visit mr abbas who is trying to navigate between hamas on one side and israel and the u s on the other in some ways walked away victorious by maintaining his diplomatic relevance at least for now but israel and the u s are deeply troubled by the unity government plan because hamas still hasnt openly endorsed their demands that any government including the islamist movement abide by previous peace agreements reject violence and accept israels right to exist so far hamas has only acceded to giving its tacit backing to prior peace accords senior u s officials said mr abbas now has a little more time probably no longer than six months to make something happen they envision three possible scenarios in the most optimistic mr abbas can continue to gain slow progress in nudging hamas closer to a more overt acceptance of the international communitys conditions the second scenario would be maintenance of the status quo the u s continues to shun the hamas dominated government even though mr abbass party is now part of that government but continues dealing on a personal level with mr abbas his presidential office is still separate from the hamas fatah government that would be formed under the mecca accord this scenario includes continuing military support to mr abbas and his chief strongmen in order to keep pressure on hamas the third scenario amounts to giving mr abbas and hamas enough space to allow their own internal differences to bring about the collapse of the mecca deal and the unity government one key factor which remains unclear is whether saudi arabia will abide by its pledge to supply &# billion to the new unity government if it does it is possible mr abbas could continue to press ahead with hamas even if the u s and israel shun the palestinian government u s officials also have declined to say whether they are pressuring the saudi regime to freeze that pledge ms rice is in a precarious position if she pushes too hard she could create an even greater backlash across the region and beyond since the deal has brought an end to palestinian bloodshed mr mujahad the deputy commander of the executive force in northern gaza left little doubt whom he would blame if fighting begins anew "we hold israel and the americans responsible for the tensions between palestinians " he said he is based in an armed executive force camp on the edge of jabalya he sits behind a desk within a small office building behind freshly erected cinderblock walls and mounds of earth plowed high like barricades the camp is directly across the street from a pile of rubble that used to be the headquarters of the fatah dominated military intelligence command in this part of gaza a sign of how powerful the executive force became here in the days leading up to the mecca accord mr mujahad said the mechanism for maintaining the peace having commanders from the warring sides stay in constant contact is so far holding "we work day and night with those who have intentions in fatah to make this agreement stick " he said mr said who works from inside his home a few miles away is the key coordinator for fatah he said there are few rules beyond talking for breaches of the peace which both sides acknowledge occur nearly every day there are no proscribed punishments creating a stronger deal with a better chance of holding will depend on the quick creation of a unity government he said but he fears the political differences between the factions within the factions themselves and from the u s and israel dont give them much time no matter how hard they work to keep the peace "its not enough to have good intentions " he said
