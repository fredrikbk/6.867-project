sirius xms fate hinges on definitions if satellite radio is part of a broader market deal may pass muster washington federal approval of the proposed &# billion merger of xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc will hinge on how regulators define the companies market if justice department antitrust enforcers find a distinct market for satellite radio the deal could be dead because it would create a monopoly but if the market instead includes the traditional radio industry ipods and internet radio as the companies argue the deal could win approval though not without conditions in a preview of the battle that will play out in washington in months to come consumer advocates and some lawmakers said yesterday that the deal will stifle competition and may need to be stopped sirius and xm countered that they need the deal to compete with other forms of audio entertainment they say they face stiff competition from am and fm radio with million listeners as well as the hot new digital music market with more than million ipods already sold they even cite rising competition from music enabled mobile phones and internet radio history doesnt offer much encouragement for this argument a similar merger between two satellite television companies hughes electronics corp and echostar communications corp was shot down in at the time the satellite tv companies argued that the &# billion deal was needed to combine efforts to fight off strong competition from cable companies but the federal communications commission rejected the deal even before the justice department could act saying it raised the risk of "immediate and substantial" harm to consumers through higher prices and less competition particularly in rural areas that arent served by cable companies in contrast xm and sirius are arguing satellite radio competes with all forms of audio entertainment in meetings with the regulators and on capitol hill the companies will press this sweeping market definition the broader the market the more likely a deal will be approved when coca cola co sought to buy dr pepper in the mid s its experts argued in court that their market should include not just soft drinks but all potable liquids sold in north america including water the approach was dubbed the "lake erie defense " the deal was opposed by regulators and eventually scotched sirius and xm are getting support for their view of the market from an unlikely source the radio industry has loudly opposed the deal since it was announced and broadcasters cite satellite radio operators as major competitors in securities filings that is confirmation that these market segments compete the companies say sirius and xm also insist they couldnt increase rates substantially and still keep growing citing as one example the low retention rate of drivers who end up paying for a subscription to the service when their cars come equipped with satellite radio "the issue here is taking two competitive companies and making them into one historically the government has looked skeptically at endorsing a monopoly " said dennis wharton a spokesman for the national association of broadcasters sirius and xm are also counting on the more relaxed merger review standards that have emerged in the bush administration regulators have challenged few deals and blessed such once unthinkable deals as a reuniting of at&amp t with its former bell offspring and the merger of whirlpool corp and maytag in the wake of those deals an anything goes view is emerging among some practitioners in the antitrust bar even without an easing of merger review standards enforcers have long been reluctant to meddle in emerging markets where technology and competition are still developing and where the real economic rivalry could be another technology in another market the companies hope to close the deal by years end but even that could be optimistic justice department investigators led by antitrust chief thomas barnett will work under a formal timetable to review the deal but that framework is often cast aside in big or controversial deals the government is likely to ask for more information cartons of data and scores of interviews then strike a deal with the companies to push off any closing while it conducts its review across town the fcc a fractious five member commission could easily take more than six months to complete its review its chairman kevin martin has already said the deal faces a "high bar" to overcome in order to be found in the public interest the standard under fcc rules the agency also could seek the eventual return of some of the fcc awarded radio spectrum held by the companies which would require extensive negotiations and may be a possible deal killer xm and sirius will also need to address what might be called the howard stern problem the foul mouthed radio host is among several edgy radio personalities that decamped to satellite radio where regulators have no jurisdiction to enforce federal indecency rules the fcc can only enforce indecency rules on free over the air broadcasts requiring xm sirius to voluntarily abide by federal indecency standards could be one condition that is placed on the deal the companies appear to be trying to address that issue by allowing consumers great flexibility in programming that might include allowing consumers to purchase a tier of service that didnt include mr stern and other radio personalities whose shows might be considered inappropriate for children "anytime you go from two competitors in a market to one a big red flag goes up " says gene kimmelman vice president for federal affairs at consumers union which plans to lobby for consumer protections to be included in the deal including channel set asides for noncommercial stations and pricing flexibility for consumers
