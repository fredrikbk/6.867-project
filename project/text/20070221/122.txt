traders fret algorithmic systems london the biggest trader in one of europes main futures contracts isnt a person it is a machine so is the second and the third trading systems that use complex mathematical codes to quickly weigh a huge number of possible trades and execute them faster than a human are squeezing the independent trader as they change the way futures contracts are traded these trading strategies are based on algorithmic trading systems which have become hot properties for hedge funds and banks proprietary trading desks during the past few years they are lifting exchanges trading volume and revenue and reducing swings in prices they are causing some locals as independent traders are called to abandon dealing in certain contracts because they cant compete locals are trying to fight back by using their own automated trading systems these traders who tend to trade in smaller amounts are important to futures markets because they are more willing to take the opposite side of trades that reflect investors long term view figuring they can profit from short term swings that helps keep trading liquid on euronext liffe the london derivatives exchange owned by pan european stock exchange operator euronext nv some of the locals contend these systems are reducing the exchanges overall efficiency because they can exploit exchange rules that reward bigger trades euronext liffe the second biggest futures exchange in europe by volume of contracts traded says the top three traders in its flagship euro interbank offered rate or euribor three month interest rate futures contract are machines and algorithmic trading accounts for of turnover in the contract it doesnt have comparable figures for a few years ago but a spokesman said there has been "tremendous growth" in this area german swiss exchange eurex ag owned by deutsche boerse ag and swx ag estimates algorithmic trading makes up to of its overall business u s futures exchanges said they are experiencing big growth in model trading the chicago mercantile exchange said activity from models is increasing on its exchange but it cant track the amount some locals trading on euronext liffe say algorithmic models are exploiting the way the exchanges computers match buy and sell orders for short term interest rate futures which gives a larger share of incoming business to the biggest orders in the market this largely pro rata system avoids having orders held up at the back of a queue because they were placed later and is designed to spread business across a range of orders in the queue eurex uses the same methodology for its euribor futures but euronext liffe has the bulk of business in this contract both exchanges use a price time methodology for longer term bond and stock contracts which focus largely on a first come first served system a euronext liffe executive said the exchange is reviewing its rules in response to complaints from some market participants one example of how euronext liffes order matching system can work an algorithmic trading model places an order to buy contracts of a short term interest rate contract at a set price on euronext liffe that order represents the bulk of the orders at that price a local also wants to buy contracts at that price but neither of these orders was the first to be entered in the market at that price when a third trader offers to sell contracts at that price the exchange usually automatically allocates most of that order against the contract order even if the locals order was placed before the larger trade the big buyers trading program then quickly pulls the balance of the order the trading strategy doesnt violate euronext liffes rules or those of deutsche boerse because the algorithmic systems could theoretically be hit on their entire order because euronext liffes own matching system is so complex smaller traders arent always disadvantaged because of the size of their orders the strategy makes it difficult for locals to get their trades completed it also can leave them with partially filled orders which in turn makes it difficult for them to trade on the relationship between contracts with different expiration dates known as spread trades as many locals do many computer models are competing with locals in a strategy known as scalping which involves making small profits from the gap between the bid and offer prices the speed at which these systems operate and their sizable orders means locals are finding it harder to compete many observers say locals need to develop new trading strategies and adopt fast automated trading tools to compete more effectively "the growth of algorithmic trading is inevitable and locals need to adapt to it and develop programs to complement their own trading " said peter green chief executive of kyte group ltd a company that provides services for independent traders known as a trading arcade some locals say the systems activity of entering large orders and then pulling the bulk of each one also creates a false impression of how much interest there is to buy or sell contracts which is known as liquidity "the quality of the liffe market has been depreciating because of the growth of the machines " said todd van hees a local at futures spread trading a trading arcade a euronext liffe executive said the exchange is reassessing the impact of its pro rata matching algorithm to see whether it treats all customers fairly "we know there are some concerns about the algorithm " said amanda sudworth euronext liffes director of interest rate product management "we are exploring enhancements to our algorithms to make trading more attractive to all traders taking the changing dynamics of the market into account we will be making announcements when we have finished our consultations " some locals have complained to the exchange about the activity of the algorithmic trading models according to an active trader of the euroswiss future one of the exchanges smaller interest rate contracts the exchange management recognized that a new algorithmic trading system was having an impact on price action in that contract and this was discouraging locals from trading the euroswiss is a three month swiss interest rate future ms sudworth said there hasnt been a particular problem with that contract those locals who remain on euronext liffe said they are having to enter bigger orders in order to compete with the trading systems that means they are taking on more risk and can end up trading more contracts than they want to they said this is making it harder for new locals to start trading in the market because they dont have the leverage to compete with the size of the systems orders the exchange said locals make up of its euribor futures trading and this has remained broadly stable in the past couple of years the exchange declined to comment on the figures for euroswiss futures trading
