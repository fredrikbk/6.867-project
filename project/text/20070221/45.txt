heir search firms help to keep it in the family companies track down lost beneficiaries on behalf of estates harvey e morse recently visited a man in an iowa trailer park to give him a very important message the mans brother had died in germany and left him over a half million dollars if the heir signed a contract mr morse would help recover the money while taking a percentage of the bounty for his services the man was incredulous thinking it may have been a joke or a scam or that he would somehow lose his trailer home in the process but mr morse wasnt kidding or trying to bilk the man instead such encounters are par for the course for his south daytona fla business harvey e morse pa www probate com a family firm that has been around since the company specializes in locating missing heirs who may be unaware that they are entitled to money from an estate in many cases the firm is contacted by estate lawyers executors or trust companies when a person either dies without a will or names a beneficiary in a will or trust document who cant be located that generally happens when people dont update their wills for many years and heirs move marry divorce or change their names sometimes the firm will initiate searches on its own by scouring probate records for cases where there is no will or there dont appear to be known heirs estates with missing heirs dont happen very frequently "the average attorney may only get three or four types of these cases in their lifetime " estimates mr morse but such cases have kept the business alive four generations there are a handful of other players including blake &amp blake genealogists in braintree mass international genealogical search inc in seattle and american research bureau in salt lake city heir search firms have been criticized for taking hefty fees some services have raked in as much as half of the inheritance the industry generally isnt regulated and fees are often agreed to in private contracts rather than set by probate courts some firms however may charge flat or hourly fees instead of a percentage of the inheritance there have also been complaints when heir search services contact heirs directly after going through records and initiating searches on their own thus heirs may wonder whether they would eventually have ended up with their inheritances through other means without contracting with a firm to help procure the windfall mr morse and his staff of more than a dozen researchers and genealogists scour courthouses libraries and other sources across the world for birth death adoption marriage divorce and census records to find missing heirs and to definitively prove that they are related to the deceased sometimes finding a missing heir takes only a few days but complex international cases with little information to go by can take several years about a quarter of the companys cases involve overseas searches in rare cases the heir cant be found and the money or assets typically go to the state government the firm doesnt do searches on behalf of people who think they may be missing heirs or by families hoping to seek out deadbeat debtors one of the hardest parts mr morse acknowledges is that some heirs at first think he is a scam artist "we help people recover funds that they would otherwise not be able to receive and not know existed " he says the work has gotten easier with the advent of the internet but missing heirs still need original documents to prove claims in court concerns about privacy and identity theft however have made such documents tougher to obtain without a court order depending on the case the company charges its clients in one of two ways it will either bill the estate by the hour or work on contingency meaning that if the missing heir agrees the company will pay legal fees to prove the individuals claim to the estate for a cut of the heirs inheritance if recovered the percentage ranges from to about a third of the windfall based on the complexity of the case said the company several years ago mike goschka received a letter stating that he was likely eligible for an inheritance from a relative whom he had never heard of "every once in a while you hear about this happening but i never would dream of it happening to me " says mr goschka of brant mich and a former state senator he agreed to a contract with harvey morse to give the firm a cut if the company did the legwork to procure the inheritance "one day just like magic a check came in the mail" for about &# says mr goschka "had they not contacted me i would never have known that i was eligible for such an amount of money " harry mcconnell a daytona beach fla estate lawyer and litigator has worked with mr morses firm several times to help clients estates track down missing relatives "i might eventually be able to track the person down " he says but it would be expensive to bill a client to do so working with search experts ends up being faster and more economical for his clients he says in one case a clients brother had an adopted son who had never even met his adoptive uncle "he was a laughing heir " says mr mcconnell referring to someone who receives an inheritance but doesnt have emotional ties to the person who died if the estate didnt use a search firm "this person would never have known he was left something from his uncle "
