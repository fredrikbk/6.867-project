winning streak end against vanderbilt the new associated press no wisconsin was beaten by michigan state that removes some of the luster from the badgers matchup saturday against ohio state no in the coaches poll it also removes all the luster from the fixs comment yesterday that the badgers might not stay at the top for longbecause of that game saturday as fix reader bob rosenberg pointed out before last nights upset we overlooked michigan state did the badgers do the same two detroit columnists say no michigan state was simply very very good "michigan state was the better team tuesday night " michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "it was that simple and that insane if you are a true basketball fan you watch a game like this and want to elope with these spartans they really had no business beating wisconsin " detroit news columnist rob parker says the victory was "magical " he adds "it was hard to tell who was the best team in the country on this night yes it was college basketball at its best but there were times when you thought it was wisconsin and there were times when you thought it was michigan state but when it mattered most when the game was close and the seconds continued to disappear it was michigan state that did everything necessary namely applying a tourniquet defense to make it unforgettable " beckham can still bend it in the first leg of the final champions league match against bayern munich real madrids free kick specialist david beckham with one foot out the door in the direction of los angeles had his other foot in all three goals in the win that sparked speculation that beckham might regain his spot on the national team including from the guardians simon talbot before the game madrid manager fabio capello had been criticized for his preference for veterans including lately beckham over youngsters and was seen as at risk of being fired meanwhile bayern had its own coaching turnover just three weeks ago "out of this panic and munichs similar disarray came a mini classic of a match " rob hughes writes in the international herald tribune meanwhile in lens france a game between host lille and manchester united descended into ugliness first man u fans rebelled against fencing by pelting police with coins and were met with tear gas then lille supporters enraged by man u s deciding goal on a quick free kick while the defense was still preparing tossed objects at the visitors as the home team left the field "on the field and in the stands the game played under a haze of mist smoke from flares and tear gas showed just how little the europeans still understand each other " peter berlin writes in the international herald tribune barry bonds arrived in san francisco giants training camp with a message for federal investigators "let them investigate let em theyve been doing it this long " later he said that talk of the inquiry didnt concern him because it was just a media conversation "boy with what bonds pays his personal publicist youd think she couldve come up with a better talking point than that " jeff passan writes on yahoo sports "never seen a journalist throw a citizen into federal prison of course none of this is new this world of delusion and conceit bonds inhabits they seem to drive bonds as he begins his quest for henry aarons all time home run record " "none of this is new" is the angle seized upon by the san francisco chronicles ray ratto "can bonds inexorable hunt for the th home run keep casual fans and moralists amused for the four months it will take for him to reach the big number can the nation be sustained by another walks are the giants interesting enough at the other eight positions to captivate a jaded nation and more to the point is this bondsian ennui a permanent condition " bonds himself doesnt seem to be that bored as tim sullivan notes in the san diego union tribune the year old slugger managed to crack up dave roberts some joke about a metal folding chair and san jose mercury news columnist tim kawakami captures a scripted yet funny moment between bonds and fellow barry teammate zito formerly of the oakland as speaking of old hitters new met moises alou has lockered himself next to fellow somethings julio franco and ruben sierra the three average years on this earth and together have home runs or more than bonds "it was inevitable yesterday that the prevailing conversation should be about nutrition fitness and survival " bill madden writes in the new york daily news mr alou hobbled by injuries last season told mr madden "i really dont do anything special and i dont take care of my body like julio although i do drink light beer " the putrid nba all star game was played in las vegas a city that hopes to land an nba franchise based on two columnists accounts theres no chance in hell in fact si coms jack mccallum says hell would be a better location for future exhibition events "hell has that eternal damnation thing stacked against it which tempts me to give the overall edge to vegas " mr mccallum writes "however in terms of eternal damnation it is also next to impossible to escape from a casino once you are inside plus its more expensive all in all then i give a slight advantage to hell and after commissioner david stern took in the lung choking traffic the too small arena and the rome right before the fall ambience of the strip he would probably handicap vegas chances of another all star weekend thusly snowballs chance in hell " for equal time the fix turned to noted vegas fan bill simmons of espn com only the time isnt really equal because his column would take about times as long to read as mr mccallums even the sports gambling guy doesnt exactly rave about vegas last weekend "now that its over im relieved that we finished the weekend without a single riot that i made it home alive that im still married that i still have my wallet that i spent hours playing blackjack in each of four consecutive days and escaped dead even that im coherent enough to write with the stale smell of weed still trapped in my nostril hairs and my body battling the effects of hours without a single rem cycle say what you want about the hip hop woodstock but it was definitely memorable then again so is an appendectomy " until a couple of years ago "covering the nfls annual scouting combine was like being dropped out of an unmarked cargo plane behind the iron curtain in the s " phil sheridan writes in the philadelphia inquirer the league used to remove hotel chairs from the lobby "because the nfl didnt want to encourage snooping reporters to hang around there " according to the columnist now the nfl has its own network and a newfound love for the media as long as the primary coverage comes from its own media mr sheridan caught some of the combine on the nfl network last year and writes "man was it boring not just bad sitcom boring but poke out your own eyes with a pen boring this is what the league was hiding the nfl draft the dullest event on the annual tv sports calendar looks like tom bradys love life compared to the combine " matty kauffman a senior at fairmont high in kettering ohio has down syndrome he also has a priceless sporting memory from friday night his last night as manager of the basketball team coaches teammates and opponents conspired to help matty score a basket in the final
