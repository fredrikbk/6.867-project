daimlerchrysler the divorce daimlerchrysler last week hung a big "for sale" sign on the chrysler part of its corporate corpus it seems likely now that the deal hailed nine years ago as the harbinger of a new age of transnational industrialism now will be regarded as just another failed mega merger whether the marriage of daimler benz ag and chrysler corp was a flawed idea based on phantom synergies or whether it was a brilliant concept whose execution was horribly botched will be debated within the auto industry and in business schools for years to come its likely that both are true the synergies were overestimated and the clash of cultures made things much worse one year after the merger such were the departures and disaffections of senior chrysler people that veteran automotive journalist jerry flint dubbed the american company "occupied chrysler " meanwhile the germans even though they proposed the merger and dominated it never got over the fear that transferring too much technology from mercedes to chrysler would sully one of their national icons daimlerchryslers statement that its considering "all options" for its american subsidiary which will cut employees and shutter a u s assembly plant is prompting much speculation on chryslers future will general motors buy it will another foreign car company even a chinese player take it off daimlers hands will private equity firms who are flush with cash step forward just as theyre already doing with major u s auto parts makers amid the speculation to which well return below this much is clear chryslers woes are just the latest chapter in the historic implosion of detroits big three that has unfolded with stunning speed since early consider that in daimler paid more than &# billion for chrysler which had about of the u s auto market and a few international sales ironically today the combined market capitalization of general motors and ford which despite their troubles still have a combined u s market share of about is about the same &# billion so the "big two" now are worth only what daimler paid for chrysler alone nine years ago today daimler will be lucky to get a fourth of what it paid for chrysler added evidence of detroits devaluation comes in the bond ratings of general motors and ford now generally at single b minus thats just one notch above the dreaded triple c rating that defines debt as "highly speculative " thus gm and ford bonds are deemed safer than ecuadors which are rated triple c but riskier than venezuelas which has petro wealth but also has loco lefty president hugo chavez the detroit companies get the same debt ratings as argentina which is still recovering from the largest sovereign debt default in history a few years ago how did things go so wrong so quickly gm ford and chrysler all entered as profitable companies and chrysler was coming off a period when its robust earnings offset a deep slump at mercedes benz but the detroit companies product lineups and their profits were far too dependent on big gas thirsty vehicles which is precisely the same exposure the big three had when the first oil crisis hit in chryslers temporary resurgence in for example was led by the c sedan and its bruising v hemi engine on the hemi the cylinder that holds each piston is shaped like the top half of a globe thus the hemisphere or "hemi" to expand displacement and boost horsepower the regular hemi boasts horsepower while a massive liter version produces horses more than the basic chevy corvette the c hemi was developed under dieter zetsche a daimler veteran installed to run chrysler after daimler ceo jurgen schremp had sacked a succession of american chiefs the first was bob eaton with whom mr schremp had forged a "merger of equals" that the german chief later acknowledged was never intended to be anything of the sort mr zetsche rode the hemis success to the ceos job at daimlerchrysler in september when the companys supervisory board akin to an american board of directors tired of mr schremps imperious style and showed him the door the review of the c on car buying site edmunds com gushes that theres "plenty of mercedes benz technology in this one " not exactly the way the burghers of benz want any chrysler product portrayed with the basic hemi engine the c gets miles a gallon in city driving according to the often generous epa ratings and just mpg in the city with the bigger hemi which didnt matter until hurricane katrina struck in august gas prices soared and c sales plunged along with those of many other chrysler models the company produced cars and trucks it couldnt sell and even shipped some to dealers who didnt order them the dealers revolted gas prices have since come down some and there is a slight resurgence in sales of big cars and suvs but the outlook on gas prices remains uncertain and detroit is still exposed chrysler last week posted a &# million fourth quarter loss bringing its total deficit to &# billion more losses including restructuring charges will follow this year meanwhile ford posted an astounding &# billion loss posted for last year and now says it doesnt foresee any profits until last years losses at ford which stood as a classic american success story years ago eclipsed even gms then record &# billion loss in all these losses occurred during a healthy u s economy and historically strong car sales the big three emphasized gas thirsty suvs pickup trucks and large sedans for a simple reason their cost structures have been such that they couldnt make money on smaller vehicles these cost structures largely but not entirely driven by the united auto workers union first emerged during the decades when detroit had a monopoly on american car sales ironically they got more burdensome even as the big three faced ever tougher foreign competition over the past quarter century and the uaw pressed harder for job security general motors for example first agreed in to the jobs bank program that pays workers for not working and it enriched the program in well after the threat from foreign competition was obvious ford and chrysler were forced to follow the jobs bank remains in place foreign based competitors bear no such burden their continued rapid expansion in the u s means america will have a healthy auto industry despite detroits decline crisis is starting to force change however belatedly general motors has gotten uaw workers about one third of gms total to accept a buyout plan gms stock which closed yesterday at &# a share on the big board has doubled from its nadir in late gm is expected to be profitable this year but has told investors that cash flow will remain negative and the companys recent disappointing sales down last month excluding low profit fleet sales are worrisome despite approving health care concessions at general motors and barely at ford the uaw has so far denied them to chrysler the reason is that chrysler has a rich parent unlike the other two now the union might get the message albeit belatedly the auto industry has a way of producing surprises chrysler was virtually dead in and until lee iacocca and his colleagues pulled off one of historys great comebacks the same thing happened seven years ago at nissan motor led by carlos ghosn so chrysler as well as gm and ford could somehow defy the odds and rebound again though all three surely will be much smaller entities its likely that the u s auto industry will look sort of like europes with no dominant company and half a dozen players each holding between and of the market unless of course gm gets bigger by buying chrysler various press reports say exploratory talks have occurred though an actual deal has to rank somewhere between unlikely and foolhardy gm despite recent progress has huge problems of its own and doesnt need to boost its exposure to the uaw and the north american market what about a foreign buyer hoping to succeed where daimler has failed nissans mr ghosn rhymes with phone who also heads renault last year didnt manage to bring general motors into his orbit but he professes still to want a u s partner for his japanese french alliance possibly the most intriguing scenario is that a consortium of private equity firms might buy chrysler or a real long shot buyer multibillionaire kirk kerkorian who was gms largest individual shareholder last year until he sold his shares after gm rejected entering the nissan renault alliance mr kerkorians auto industry strategist jerome b york once was chryslers chief financial officer and the two helped deliver chrysler into the hands of daimler a decade ago a transaction on which mr kerkorian made billions but mr york presumably knows chryslers pitfalls as well as its potential so mr kerkorian is a less likely buyer than deal hungry private equity firms private equity buyers of course would need an exit strategy a few years hence but its not hard to envision that they might sell chrysler in pieces jeep could go to honda which isnt big in suvs chryslers dodge ram truck line might go to nissan which is weak in trucks and the chrysler brand along with its dealer network in the u s and canada might attract a chinese car company seeking a jump start in the u s what seems most unlikely is that daimlerchrysler will stay together the shares jumped last week to a seven year high on the prospect that daimler will sell its american subsidiary and return to its pure luxury car roots the shareholders have voted and ceo zetsche can read the returns mr ingrassia a
