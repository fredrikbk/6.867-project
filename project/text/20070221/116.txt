the evening wrap damages not done online edition jurors looking to make an example out of misbehaving companies got reined in a little by the nations highest court but if todays ruling is a victory for those who say punitive payouts have ballooned beyond reason it also seems likely to leave reform advocates hungry for more the supreme court in a ruling for altria groups philip morris threw out a &# million punitive damages award granted to a smokers widow by a jury in oregon writing for the majority justice stephen breyer held that the award must be overturned because the jury hadnt been instructed that it could punish philip morris only for the harm done to the plaintiff in the case and not for the broader harm the company might have caused to the general population of smokers justice breyer said that punitive damages awards driven by a desire to punish a corporation for harm to individuals not involved in a particular lawsuit amounts to a taking of property that flouts due process "to permit punishment for injuring a non party victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation " he wrote "the fundamental due process concerns to which our punitive damages cases refer risks of arbitrariness uncertainty and lack of notice will be magnified " william s ohlemeyer philip morris vice president and associate general counsel said the ruling gives the company "an opportunity to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases " the opinion stacks up as a victory for businesses and other advocates who have been campaigning for what they say is a desperately needed cold shower when it comes to jury awards critics complain outsized punitive damages awards are frequently arbitrary meaning they have little basis in law or in the facts of any given case and are like a gigantic magnetic field which attract nuisance suits like so many iron shavings the justices last took up punitive damages in when they ruled in a case involving the insurance giant state farm that punitive damages should be scrutinized through three filters how reprehensible the defendants behavior was the gulf between the actual or potential harm inflicted on the plaintiff and the damages award and the difference between the award and civil penalties in comparable cases lawyers for the plaintiff in the latest case argued that jurors should consider the harm done to other smokers not to provide them with some kind of redress but to ascertain just how reprehensibly philip morris was behaving in its marketing of tobacco with the ruling damages critics received some of the clarity they have craved since the state farm case but their triumph appears incomplete the justices stopped short of declaring the award excessive as philip morris had requested writing that since they had found the punishment standard employed in the case to be incorrect they had no avenue to consider the awards size justice breyer said use of the right standard by the oregon supreme court could lead to a new trial or a change in the level of the punitive damages award hardly the sort of news that might have tobacco investors firing up a celebratory smoke indeed altria shares hardly budged the ruling also splintered the justices in a manner that crisscrossed its ideological divisions and could make handicapping future damages cases difficult joining justice
