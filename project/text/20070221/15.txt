business world whos afraid of toyota edmunds com for years reviewed the toyota echo the companys entry level vehicle by describing it as the cheapest car in america and still overpriced even after the echo was finally dropped last year from the u s market the authoritative auto site couldnt resist reminding shoppers it had once whispered in their ears "friends dont let friends drive echos " and edmunds offers only marginally more favorable comment on the toyota yaris the vehicle that took the echos place calling it a "decent subcompact" but advising shoppers to "keep an open mind" about competing vehicles including the chevy aveo or take the prius the car that made toyota a star in certain circles and perhaps even began to redress its reputation for bloodless uninteresting vehicles the prius has hardly been burning up the sales charts lately with a ridiculous federal tax giveaway expiring toyota has been reduced to dangling incentives even in front of california buyers all this transpires while the epa is still putting finishing touches on new mileage ratings that will sharply downgrade the priuss gas performance what toyota really proved with the prius ironically is that americans have little appetite for high mileage vehicles in fact are willing to buy one only when the stars align briefly and inexplicably to turn a car into a hollywood accredited emblem of personal enlightenment to put it baldly toyota got lucky any motorist truly intent on burning less gasoline and saving the planet could have found a vehicle that produces mileage as good or better than the priuss without paying toyota a premium for its busy "hybrid" technology designing a car that uses less gas after all is a snap in the mid s honda marketed a version of its sporty crx that got an honest plus miles to the gallon in gm and suzuki built the geo metro xfi good for in the city but customers have to be willing to buy it detroit would have been only too glad to soak consumers for a high tech fuel saving vehicle had consumers declared their willingness to be soaked but apart from a few statesiders who might embrace such a car as a fad it makes enduring sense only in markets where taxes keep gasoline prices in the stratosphere and forget the guff about toyota investing long term for the end of oil hybrid technology is a mere fuel extender and a heavy mechanically complex one for so modest a return in gasoline savings it shrieks technological dead end we offer these thoughts as corrective to the tendency to slobber over toyota on track to become the worlds biggest car maker especially given the rumored unraveling of daimlerchrysler though the real culprit there was the german sides consistent knack for screwing up a good thing yes toyota is an excellent company its commitment to disciplined manufacturing explains why in some developing countries the streets are jammed with toyotas especially its ubiquitous hiace minivan toyotas often seem the only vehicles on the road or perhaps the only vehicles still on the road thanks to their sturdiness but if being the biggest were such an asset gm would be a world beater today in fact gm is shrinking on purpose sacrificing market share for profitability lessening its reliance on sales to rental fleets which depress the value and image of all gm vehicles as edmunds recites in chapter and verse toyotas are far from being in a class by themselves in quality or value a buyer who carefully unemotionally weighs the trade offs does not automatically end up owning a toyota or even a japanese car though shoppers whose perceptions are a lagging indicator still treat detroit products as automatically inferior and toyota has some disadvantages while u s auto makers have advantages having tradition and heritage to draw upon is an advantage toyota is singularly weak in this regard few signature cars come to mind through the decades thats why toyotas new fj cruiser has earned unprecedented gushing from the automotive press toyota ransacked its past for visual cues and for once was able to make a customer feel something for one of its vehicles profits are not assured by economies of scale thats one lesson of the daimlerchrysler merger which was supposed to shave a couple nickels off the cost of every component by spreading their development over a larger vehicle output as important and becoming more important in a crowded marketplace is a knack for turning out cars with ineffable cultural appeal toyotas world wide success so far has come without being strong in this department and toyota knows it hence its constant invocation of the word "emotion" in how it approaches marketing its important new tundra pickup cars are transportation buyers interested in a low risk investment in transportation can seldom go wrong by buying toyota but car companies are profit seeking organizations though its popular to sneer at the big three they raked in many billions correctly judging a consumer appetite for large suvs and pickups including millions of pickups purchased by cosmetic cowboys who drive them to their office jobs these were and remain impressive feats in consumer design as befitting products in which the big three were willing to invest precious capital as distinct from the workaday sedans they churn out just to break even on their uaw labor contracts and unlike toyota with its prius the big three produce and sell their fashion statements at a profit a goal that still reportedly eludes the toyota hybrid the big three are far from incompetent car makers or incompetent users of capital their big problem is that thanks to their legacy labor issues the financial markets simply will not afford them the leeway to make large capital investments in sedan styling and technology these labor legacies are a product of history and a set of political and market arrangements fix that problem and any detroit car maker thats still around has plenty of potential to compete successfully with toyota or anyone else see related letters "letters to the editor toyota is winning because it is toyotaf" wsj march
