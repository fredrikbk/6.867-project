huntingtons treament hope jane mervar is hopeful about a cure for huntingtons disease that is quite a wish given her situation the lanse mich residents husband is in the late stages of the disease two of her four daughters are also afflicted with huntingtons a fatal neurological disease in which a single mutant gene causes nerve cells in the brain to waste away creating uncontrollable movements and mental deterioration including dementia over a period that can last years huntingtons is relatively rare about people in north america have it but it is the most common neurological disease to come from strictly genetic reasons important discoveries have been made but there is still no certain way to slow progression and a cure is likely to be years away there is strong interest that the same treatments for huntingtons could possibly work with more common neurological ailments in which environmental factors also may play a role such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers while nonprofits and universities are taking the lead in research there is potential for drug makers to reap profits for treatments in spite of the relatively small number of afflicted people merck &amp co biogen idec inc novartis ag and others are providing compounds for early stage huntingtons research there are at least compounds being studied observers say any treatments in the pipeline would be marketed to neurologists who would prescribe the drugs said christine ambrose principal scientist for biogen idec as well merck acquired a company last year that is developing treatments from ribonucleic acid interference or rnai a method to synthesize molecules targeted to a specific gene huntingtons is among the diseases on which rnai could possibly work merck considers huntingtons research important and is active in it according to a company spokeswoman other huntingtons treatments in trials include nutritional compounds coenzyme q or coq and creatine which are being tested for use in slowing progression or onset said dr ira shoulson chair of the huntington study group executive committee and professor of neurology at the university of rochester today huntingtons sufferers have only limited treatment for symptoms which include drugs that can help control movements and medications to deal with the emotional problems said dr katrina a gwinn program director in neurogenetics for the national institutes of health if the nutritional supplement treatments such as coq require prescriptions because they need to be modified that could appeal to a pharmaceutical company said dr christopher ross of johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore some of the research for coq was at doses of milligrams which would make the costs about &# a month at wholesale prices that could mean more than double at the retail level a huntingtons "treatment itself could generate revenue since any treatment would be started early in life and continue for duration " said dr robert pacifici chief scientific officer of chdi inc a nonprofit research organization for huntingtons treatments for neurological diseases are becoming more critical as the u s population ages huntingtons symptoms generally dont show up before middle age so the mervars situation with the two daughters is unusual research for neurological diseases is about years behind cancer but more focus has been placed on it since "the brain is an incredibly complex organ " and it cant be replaced in the manner that if you have heart disease you can get a heart transplant said dr jim gusella a researcher from massachusetts general hospital in boston doing research on the brain is like taking "a car and trying to fix it without opening the hood " the only way to get huntingtons is for one parent to carry the mutated gene that means that a parent with the disease has a chance of passing it on to each child about people in the u s are at risk perhaps the biggest progress was the discovery years ago of the huntingtons gene but only between to of those who have a chance of getting huntingtons take the test to see if they have the gene before symptoms appear the test for the huntingtons gene can be given in the womb but many wait until symptoms appear as there is so little in terms of treatment the potential for discrimination in getting health insurance employment and other areas is another drawback to taking the test identification of the gene was huge progress the most famous huntingtons sufferer folk singer woody guthrie was misdiagnosed for years and even placed in a mental institution before it was discovered he had the disease and it is the hope of further developments that helps year old karen milek of orlando she was diagnosed nine years ago but is only showing mild symptoms "research is what makes it totally livable without it theres totally nothing " she said
