common sense patience may pay buying opportunity is likely this year smartmoney theres a constant paradox in investing every decision is in some sense a bet on the future which is inherently unknowable we buy a stock with the expectation that its value will rise a bond with the expectation that its issuer will make interest payments these expectations in turn rest on myriad assumptions that the economy will remain strong but not overheat that the federal reserve wont raise interest rates that oil prices will subside or rise or that the geopolitical landscape will accommodate economic growth all of these are assumptions about which there can be no certainty the best we can hope for is a probability that these events will occur these thoughts came to mind recently as i pondered the cboe volatility index a measure of market volatility that has been bouncing off its historic lows there hasnt been a one day decline in the s&amp p stock index since july its been even longer since the broad market experienced a decline that would qualify as a correction let alone a bear market even people who kept insisting were in the midst of a "bear market rally" have fallen silent like many people they were victims of assumptions that turned out to be wrong even though they held them with a high degree of certainty a goal of this column is to minimize that kind of misplaced certainty about the future of course it cant be avoided entirely my system of buying and selling looks to where the market has been something that is knowable rather than predicting the future yet even this rests on the assumption that there will be rallies and corrections of sufficient magnitude to generate buying and selling opportunities i feel pretty comfortable with the probability of this happening in the future since it always has with the dow jones industrial average hitting new highs nearly every day and with practically no declines of any significance youd think investors would be happy as clams im sure most are but lately ive been getting questions from some readers who are growing increasingly impatient with the discipline required by my approach most of them have cash and they want to put it to work in a rising market a few are wondering why im not taking profits in this extended rally in a word theyre bored as ive often said there are worse things than boredom but theres nothing boring about markets just because theyre not volatile there were significant buying and selling opportunities last year signaled in this column last april the market reached a significant buying point and i urged readers to act that was less than a year ago is that such a long time to wait its true that the pace of the rally has cooled significantly since the fall despite all the talk of new highs on the dow we still havent reached my next selling target which is on the nasdaq stock market we were so close last november that i urged you to have a selling list prepared but we never reached that threshold with the nasdaq at this week were a mere points from my selling threshold so if youre really itching to do something its ok to take some profits my rules arent etched in stone ten points here and there arent going to matter much but if youve waited this long why not wait a little longer my favorite time to sell is in the midst of a big rally with investor enthusiasm rampant for all the bullish sentiment thats not quite the mood at the moment for those of you with cash to deploy who are eager to buy i counsel patience markets dont rise forever ill go out on a limb and say theres a high degree of probability that there will be a buying opportunity this year meanwhile count your blessings with money market funds paying in the neighborhood of its not like that cash isnt working for you when a correction finally comes that no risk return will look good james b stewart a columnist for smart money magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
