the afternoon report healthy increase online edition u s consumer prices for last month came in a touch hotter than expected but if that news isnt generating much excitement about the future of interest rates it could aggravate growing concerns about the nations health care tab the consumer price index climbed during january and increased on the closely watched core basis excluding food and energy readings that were a hair higher than economists expected when they rolled out of bed this morning few observers seemed acutely troubled by the upside surprise though sensing little change to the landscape as relates to interest rates sure core price increases are north of the feds so called comfort zone they came in higher than a year ago and policy makers generally prefer annual increases more in the neighborhood of to but chairman ben bernanke just got done telling lawmakers that core inflation pressure has been easing and it would likely take a few more elevated inflation readings before policy makers might decide to tighten credit in response lehman brothers economist john shin wrote that on balance he still thinks the fed will keep its hands off of interest rates through this year and that core inflation will stay "slightly but stubbornly elevated " if rates chatter was subdued the news that may get tongues wagging was word that health care costs in the report bounced higher by the richest increase since an identical advance in august the data underlined a fresh federal study that projects u s health spending will double to &# trillion by at that level health outlays would suck up of gross domestic product now health spending consumes about of total economic output the study says the government currently picks up about of the tab but by uncle sam will be footing about half of the bill traces of the cost spiral were also evident in some corporate earnings reported this morning medco health solutions the big pharmacy benefits manager said its earnings surged thanks at least in part to steep price inflation on brand name drugs as the federal study might suggest medco doesnt think its good times will end soon it raised its earnings forecast to between &# and &# a share compared with an earlier range of &# to &# a share some economists argued that the big jump in medical costs during january may be something of an outlier john ryding of bear stearns noted that it came after below trend readings in the two months prior others believe that january inflation statistics are especially prone to distortion since companies frequently choose the earliest days of the new year to try and ram through price increases dean baker co director of the center for economic and policy research said that the large surge in medical prices wont be repeated but "it suggests that the moderation in medical care inflation reported in prior months price data was an anomaly " indeed alongside the persistent health cost inflation projected by the government for years down the road the higher medical costs on display in the report hardly seem like a one time puzzler inflation h p weigh on stocks that stronger than expected inflation data combined with worry that computer giant hewlett packard could be facing some margin pressure to trip up stocks the dow jones industrial average sank by about points to around by midday while the nasdaq composite index and standard &amp poors index lost about five points each h p shares came under pressure despite a report of strong quarterly profits late yesterday after it also said earnings

stronger against the yen despite the bank of japans decision to boost interest rates and also gained against the euro crude oil prices moved above &# a barrel weaker commodities stocks put european markets under pressure while asia shares were mixed after the bojs move the boj and the carry trade after months of guessing by economists that an increase would be coming at any time and months of having such guesses punctured by policy makers inertia the bank of japan finally boosted its benchmark short term interest rate by a quarter percentage point to two factors had weighed against a rate increase at recent meetings in december and january one japans central bank doesnt enjoy the same sort of political autonomy as the federal reserve and some lawmakers had noisily lobbied for the bank to leave rates in neutral second policy makers worried that the expansion was too fragile to withstand any additional tightening those fears were assuaged a bit when data revealed strong consumer spending in the final months of the year however and policy makers seized their opening to raise rates the boj also seemed eager to stamp out the notion that the countrys low rates would last forever japan has the lowest interest rates among the worlds major economies benchmark rates are in the u s and in europe and investors have used the spread to play the "carry trade " where they borrow at japans rock bottom rates and use the borrowed funds to pursue higher returns elsewhere boj governor toshihiko fukui warned that a sudden unwinding of that strategy could present a hazard to global economic stability but with the central bank moving along so glacially today marked the second time japan has raised rates in almost seven years and economists think it could be months before another increase the carry trade seems ensured of living on for some time the yen rose sharply as the meeting was taking place but traders quickly took profits later in the day blair sets withdrawal from iraq british prime minister tony blair announced his country will withdraw about of its troops from iraq in the coming months in an effort to get its force below troops by late summer if iraqis can secure the southern part of the country "the actual reduction in forces will be from the present itself down from over two years ago and at the time of the conflict to roughly " mr blair said adding that "increasingly our role will be support and training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly " depending on iraqi capability britain would draw down further "possibly to below " once a base in basra is transferred to iraqi hands this summer mr blair said "what all of this means is not that basra is how we want it to be but it does mean that the next chapter in basras history can be written by iraqis " he said iran uranium and sanctions the international atomic energy agency is preparing a report that is expected to confirm that iran continues to enrich uranium in violation of a u n security council resolution the security council imposed economic sanctions and set a day deadline on dec for iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program and said continued defiance past that
