golden fleece seeking edge fashion firm bets on rare furry animals loro piana has lock on soft vicuna wool new competitors loom a few months ago pier luigi loro piana co owner of the loro piana spa fashion label climbed the andean plains to watch a vicuna mating ritual the vicuna is a goat size relative of the llama whose fleece is spun into one of the worlds most valuable wools as a farmer wearing a multicolored poncho played a flute a group of men pushed the heads of two vicunas together to simulate a kiss loro piana has snagged most of the worlds supply of vicuna fleece cementing its reputation as one of the worlds most exclusive brands as a result the numbers of this once endangered animal have surged so has mr loro pianas business his italian fashion house uses vicuna wool the incas called it "the fiber of the gods" for its best products suits made from vicuna cost &# compared with &# for those made from merino which comes from sheep in this search for exclusivity loro piana is trying to tackle one of the thorniest problems in fashion how do you keep drawing customers to expensive merchandise when mass market retailers are aping designs and fabrics used by top tier labels cashmere a once high end fabric has been diminished in recent years as inexpensive goods made in china flood the market crocodile skin for years was used by leather goods companies to add an aura of exclusivity but now industrial scale crocodile farms have made the skin relatively commonplace the commoditization of materials that once defined luxury has prompted fashion brands to scour the world for new ones milan fashion house ermenegildo zegna spa holds an annual contest in tasmania australia in which wool growers compete to produce the finest fleece and rival fashion houses are following loro piana to the andes scouring for vicuna supplies as the herds recover james sugden managing director of united kingdom woolens maker johnstons of elgin ltd concedes that loro piana has been "faster off the mark " but he says the race is far from over "were the tortoise and theyre the hare " he says mr sugden is planning to visit the region this spring to procure his second helping of fleece this increasing competition is loro pianas biggest worry so far its vicuna products have been immune to pricing pressure for a simple reason it controls most of the worlds supply of the wool the bulk of which comes from peru "there is no way that vicuna can be a cheap item " mr loro piana says but with other buyers coming into the market this dominance is likely to dissipate loro piana buys about to of perus supply of vicuna fleece a couple of years ago a loro piana consortium bought through a contract with the government as products made with vicuna proliferate loro piana may find itself banking on a material of diminishing exclusivity exactly the problem it was looking to avoid vicuna fiber is scarce and painstaking to harvest vicunas need lots of space two and a half acres per animal or they wont breed forcing farmers to fence off vast swaths of territory to manage their herds in earlier decades cash strapped farmers found it simpler to hunt vicuna and sell the pelts to corrupt middlemen unlike cashmere goats vicunas can be sheared only once every two years and even then dont yield much fleece a ready to wear &# overcoat requires vicuna shearings the loro piana family which hails from italys northern piedmont region has been in the textile business for six generations mr loro piana and his brother sergio took over in the s the two set about transforming the firm into a manufacturer of high quality cashmere and wool today it sells wool directly to some of the biggest names in fashion such as giorgio armani and hermes and also makes finished goods that are sold to consumers through a chain of boutiques mr loro pianas father imported vicuna fleece from peru in the s and s limiting his production mainly to overcoats an item that had become a status symbol vicuna had a moment of notoriety in when president eisenhowers chief of staff was forced to resign for accepting a vicuna overcoat from a favor seeking businessman soon after that vicunas all but disappeared from the market hunters looking to sell the pelts had driven the animal to the brink of extinction in the peruvian government banned the trade of vicuna fleece poaching however continued as armed bands of the maoist guerrilla group shining path unloaded pelts on the black market by the s the cachet of cashmere loro pianas most profitable fiber was falling in vicuna despite its problems mr loro piana sensed an opportunity he began scouting flocks during visits to a vicuna reserve in pampa galeras a hour drive south of lima in his first encounter on the windswept highlands mr loro piana realized hed found in the long necked animal a potential new business partner "it was like a dog " he says "it looked into my eyes and seemed like it really wanted to talk to me " in mr loro piana approached the peruvian government and suggested it sell the exclusive right to buy of the countrys annual vicuna production the peruvian government had been exploring ways to use the vicuna as a resource for the regions peasant farming communities but was wary of putting it back on the open market for fear of sparking another wave of poaching mr loro pianas idea solved the governments quandary it would guarantee farmers a steady income while allowing authorities to monitor the trade several leading cashmere producers including the u k s dawson international plc and johnstons of elgin entered negotiations after the offer was announced they had manufactured vicuna prior to its ban and felt they needed a role in supplying one of the worlds most exclusive fibers "its like having a store on via montenapoleone in milan " says karl spilhaus president of the cashmere and camel hair manufacturers institute based in boston "youve got to be there " loro piana formed a consortium that included condortips a textile producer from the southern peruvian city of arequipa and lanerie agnona spa a northern italian producer of knitwear the consortium agreed to pay around &# a kilogram about two pounds of vicuna fleece at the time about times the price of cashmere loro piana says it also pledged to finance an association of vicuna herders to help improve breeding and conservation techniques during a recent interview at his villa in the foothills of the italian alps mr loro piana dipped his fingers into a sack of billowing vicuna fleece that was sitting on the coffee table "for us vicuna has been a kind of mission " he said in mr loro piana sat next to perus then president alberto fujimori at a glitzy ceremony in lima to officially ink the deal a pair of vicunas on leashes stood nearby the arrangement fueled a comeback for perus vicunas with sales of fleece generating income for farmers the herds became a valuable resource prompting the peruvian government to send troops into the pampa galeras to defend the animals from guerrillas about vicunas now roam the andean highlands more than double the number when the trade ban was relaxed mr loro piana thinks the herd could top one million within a decade "a large large part of the increase in numbers is a result of the economic incentive " says jane wheeler a researcher with conopa a lima research institute that monitors perus vicuna populations "people were suddenly more interested in having them alive than killing them for their pelts " bringing the vicuna back to the market however turned out to be as tricky as restoring the herds its hard to pitch a product to a generation of consumers unaware of its existence let alone its exclusivity vicunas status as an animal in danger of extinction also created regulatory hurdles peru had cleared the fleece for export but the u s fish and wildlife service kept a trade ban in place until "fifty percent of our market was lost so i was really discouraged for a while " mr loro piana recalls to get the word out mr loro piana began organizing "vicuna conferences" for retailers and the media in fashion capitals such as paris london milan and tokyo where he touted the fibers exclusivity over cocktails and antipasti vicuna items are displayed prominently in the companys boutiques which hand out hardcover booklets chronicling the vicunas recovery from the brink of extinction as well as certificates guaranteeing that the fleece is "legally sheared " jim gold chief executive of bergdorf goodman says loro piana sends stacks of reading material to the department store to familiarize sales staff with vicunas strongest selling point its softness in recent years mr loro piana has rolled out a new line of vicuna goods including outdoor jackets for &# and crew neck sweaters for &# loro piana ruled out blending vicuna with other fibers in its ready to wear line a move that would have made the fabric more affordable but less exclusive sales of vicuna wool and vicuna products are worth more than &# million to loro piana while thats a fraction of the companys total revenues of about &# million loro pianas status as one of the few vicuna suppliers has added to the mystique of its products loro pianas deal with the peruvian government expired two years ago prompting the influx of competitors into the andean high plains mr loro piana says he has to embrace in part the inevitable commoditization process which for years he managed to avoid hes pressing suppliers to increase the size of their herds and improve their yield if loro piana can process vicuna fleece in larger volume it could lower manufacturing costs and the price of finished goods in the meantime mr loro piana is leveraging his current dominance of the market as best he can he has rejected attempts from perus farmers to charge higher prices loro piana currently pays between &# and &# for a kilogram of raw fleece roughly the same amount it paid in even though the vicuna market is open to new players only a handful of textile makers have the expertise to manufacture and market a large amount of vicuna that limits farmers pricing power mr loro pianas refusal to budge on price has left perus farmers with little choice but to raise revenue by increasing the size of their herds the italian is looking farther afield as well he has met with government officials in neighboring argentina chile and bolivia to try to persuade them to follow in perus footsteps and develop their own vicuna populations loro piana is also marketing a fleece called "baby cashmere " it comes from an infant goat found in china and mongolia
