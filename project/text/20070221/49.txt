high court denies altria damages sets no formula washington the supreme courts move to throw out a &# million award against altria group inc s philip morris usa was another boon for corporate defendants but it wasnt the knockout blow against punitive damages that business had sought the ruling turned on the courts finding defendants cant be punished for harms suffered by consumers who arent party to a lawsuit but the justices refused to impose a formula sought by business groups that would limit punitive damage awards the ruling extended a string of recent decisions reining in the penalties juries can impose on corporate wrongdoers judges now will be more likely to instruct jurors to avoid simply multiplying the harm done to a single plaintiff to reach a punitive damage award "if there are widgets sold " a jury cant mechanically fix punitive damages by multiplying compensatory damages times said sherman joyce president of the american tort reform association an industry group that filed a friend of the court brief siding with philip morris the original case turned on a jury award to mayola williams who was awarded &# in compensatory damages and nearly times that amount in punitive damages in a lawsuit after the death of her husband jesse in the state court jury in oregon found his death was caused by cigarettes writing for the five member majority justice stephen breyer found that punitive awards partly based on harm to nonparties "amount to a taking of property from the defendant without due process " at the same time recognizing that punitive damages are intended to punish wrongdoing and deter its recurrence the court observed "that conduct that risks harm to many is likely more reprehensible than conduct that risks harm only to a few " so juries may take such factors into account when awarding damages "this nuance eludes me " wrote dissenting justice john paul stevens he argued there was no practical difference between directly punishing the defendant for harming third parties and increasing the punishment because harm to a single plaintiff was more "reprehensible" given its potential harm to others an immediate beneficiary of the ruling could be merck &amp co which now faces some lawsuits over its painkiller vioxx trying each complaint separately merck has won eight liability trials to date and lost four one verdict in mercks favor later was tossed out by a state court judge while two los angeles state court cases resulted in mistrials jan in all four losses meanwhile juries awarded plaintiffs punitive damages ranging from &# million to &# million two of the damage awards were later automatically reduced under texas state law though the u s constitution makes no mention of punitive damages the court in recent years has found that some awards are so high as to violate due process in the justices threw out a &# million punitive award won by a consumer who learned that his car salesman had concealed the fact that a new bmw had been damaged and repainted before sale a court in an opinion by justice stevens found the amount "grossly excessive" after considering the actual damages the plaintiff suffered civil penalties for similar misconduct and the defendants "degree of reprehensibility " in in a opinion by justice anthony kennedy the court rejected a to punitive to compensatory damage ratio a utah court had awarded the damages to a policyholder who contended state farm mutual automobile insurance co had misled her into believing it would cover her liability for a car accident the court suggested that "single digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process" than larger ones industry groups were hoping the court would follow that ruling with an ironclad rule against double or triple digit multipliers but the court said it need not reach that issue bob peck the lawyer who represented mrs williams suggested the impact of the ruling would be muted jurors rarely multiply the victims to reach punitive awards he said the &# million award in his case he said could be understood as "precisely weeks profit" for philip morris at the supreme court philip morris argued that the original oregon trial judge failed to instruct the jury in the proper way to consider harm to third parties the judge declined to issue the companys proposed jury instruction which would have advised that "although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others" in assessing a proper penalty for mr williamss death "you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who may bring lawsuits of their own " justice breyer found that this jury instruction would have set the proper balance imposing damages for harm to nonparties would violate the constitutions due process clause because the defendant would have no chance to defend against the charges he wrote moreover permitting such factors "would add a near standardless factor to the punitive damages equation " the decision was notable as well for the split it signaled between justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas who have held that the constitution didnt contemplate any limits on punitive damages and the courts two newest members chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito the chief justice and justice alito joined the majority along with justices anthony kennedy and david souter justices scalia and thomas joined the dissent by justice ruth bader ginsburg who wrote that the oregon jury had properly considered "the extent of harm suffered by others as a measure of reprehensibility " the case returns to the oregon supreme court which could order a new trial or issue a new opinion comporting with yesterdays decision the decision is unlikely to have an impact on class action litigation because in such lawsuits mass numbers of plaintiffs are formally represented punitive damages are alleged in a majority of the pending cases against philip morris which as of year end faced pending suits brought by individual smokers class actions concerning smoking and health claims and class action lawsuits concerning its "light" cigarettes among other litigation in a number of states where antitobacco suits are pending punitive damages dont exist or are limited tobacco lawyers note heather won tesoriero contributed to this article
