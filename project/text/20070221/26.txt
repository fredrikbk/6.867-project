delicate surgery on greys anatomy abc explores a spinoff in a now uncommon move to exploit hit shows power abc is surgically removing part of "greys anatomy" to see if it can survive on its own in a bold move that could bring in millions of dollars in new advertising income if its successful abc has decided to pursue a spinoff of the hugely successful medical drama departing "greys anatomy" to anchor the new show would be one of its most popular characters dr addison montgomery shepherd a sexy neonatal surgeon played by kate walsh the general plot is still a work in progress and "greys anatomy" creator shonda rhimes hasnt settled on a title says a spokeswoman for abc a unit of walt disney co but ms rhimes recently told the cast about the project and agreed to write a special two hour episode that will serve as a pilot for the new series this type of old fashioned character spinoff is increasingly rare in the risk averse tv business abc is likely to air the special in may in time for the network to decide whether to pick up the spinoff before unveiling its fall schedule to advertisers and media buyers abc president of entertainment stephen mcpherson declined to comment a spokeswoman for the abc television studio which produces the series confirmed it has inked a deal with ms walsh but said ms rhimes and ms walsh both were unavailable no new show is a safe bet in the fast and fickle tv business but a spinoff is a safer bet rather than launching cold spinoffs come with a built in audience already invested in the concept or character theres a strong marketing hook a crucial element as networks battle an expanding array of entertainment options for viewer attention and some of tvs most popular shows have been spinoffs including "the jeffersons " spawned by "all in the family " and "frasier " a spinoff of "cheers " although mr mcpherson has dramatically transformed abc over the past two years from the last place broadcaster to a contender for no the network still has holes on its schedule that would benefit from a new hit wednesday night has started to struggle the castaways drama "lost" is down among adults age to this season compared with last and the network has been keeping some friday time slots warm by airing reruns in many ways spinning off a show from "greys anatomy" would mark a departure for the modern tv industry true spinoffs where ancillary characters leave an established show to become the leads of a new one are less common today than in decades past a big reason there are fewer smash hits particularly comedies to spin off the tv schedule is replete with strong dramas but shows such as "csi crime scene investigation" tend to spawn new franchises with entirely new casts of characters notes tv historian tim brooks author of "the complete guide to prime time " indeed networks rarely have the confidence to pursue a character spinoff of an hour long drama one of the few successes was in when gary and valene ewing departed "dallas" to launch "knots landing " more often attempts have been spectacular flops such as the bid to spin off "hill street blues" by sending detective norman buntz played by dennis franz and his snitch sid played by peter jurasik to california "beverly hills buntz" failed within a season although mr franz went on to greater things in "nypd blue" but with "greys anatomy " abc has a white hot hit fueled by complex story lines and charismatic characters despite moving to highly competitive thursday from sunday last fall "greys anatomy" is notching some of its best ratings ever last week million people tuned in to watch the doctors and medical students at seattle grace hospital cope with the fallout of a ferry crash at the same time the ensemble show now in its third season has an abundance of strong characters including ellen pompeo as dr meredith grey and patrick dempsey as dr derek shepherd indeed ms rhimes recently told a gathering of tv critics that it was difficult fitting all "greys anatomy" regulars into storylines she wants to be intimately involved in the potential spinoff and to free up her schedule has tabled another pilot about a group of female journalists says a person familiar with the matter ms walshs dr montgomery shepherd joined the show in may appearing in the last few minutes of the season one finale she abruptly shows up at the seattle hospital looking for her estranged neurosurgeon husband dr shepherd and discovers he has a girlfriend ms walsh confronts her with a pointed and explicit remark although ms rhimes and abc executives think ms walshs character can continue evolving on "greys anatomy " it became clear in recent months that her position in the show was changing say people familiar with the matter after all now divorced from the neurosurgeon and friendly with the girlfriend dr montgomery shepherd has had fewer spats to keep her busy and fewer fireworks to entertain viewers abc is approaching the spinoff in a smart way says norman lear the tv producer who refined the art of the spinoff in the s when his "all in the family" spawned a record five new shows too often networks try to force audiences to embrace a character just because they have an actor amenable to a spinoff nbcs ill fated "friends" spinoff "joey " starring matt leblanc for instance instead networks should "see whos popping and try to build something" around them he says "sometimes you cast somebody in a lesser role and once you see them on screen you say to yourself oh my god this person shouldnt be in the outfield this person could be a great pitcher " says mr lear his advice to ms rhimes "trust your instincts and dont force anything " he also notes that successfully juggling monster sized egos particularly those of the cast members who are not getting their own show is a crucial part of the spinoff process if the "greys anatomy" special episode doesnt lead to a new series for abcs fall schedule the network has several high profile projects in the pipeline to fall back on one of them is "life on mars " a remake of a british broadcasting corp drama about a modern day detective who finds himself transported
