the mossberg solution latest blackberry is flashy familiar cramped keyboard mars an otherwise handsome device blackberry users are a stubborn bunch almost as fond of their devices familiar features scroll wheel full minikeyboard and big screen as they are of constantly checking email so when i directed all of my work and personal email from my current blackberry to the newest blackberry for this columns testing i did so with trepidation at&amp t inc introduced research in motion ltd s blackberry last week as a sort of grown up version of the blackberry pearl released in september the pearl marked the hippest thing to come out of rim a slender model that used a pearl like white trackball for navigation instead of the classic side scroll wheel but devoted blackberry users admired its style only from afar scoffing at its squished keyboard and smaller screen the which costs &# with a two year at&amp t contract meshes the newer pearl features with the traditional traits of older if duller blackberrys these improvements are well done overall producing the thinnest blackberry with the longest lasting battery email menus were comfortingly familiar and its phone worked well i even surprised myself by adjusting to and liking the s most glaring change its use of a trackball instead of a side scroll wheel but this devices keyboard a highly important feature left me frustrated no matter how many emails i typed unlike the pearls reduced keyboard this one is full size with the traditional blackberry layout but its keys are packed in side by side rather than spaced out instead of using essentially flat keys like those on older blackberrys each key on the has a slight distinguishing ridge that i found annoyingly restrictive my thumbs had to be in exactly the right positions to type well keys on the older keyboards can be tapped from any direction or angle the blackberry is striking with a bright screen and dark blue coloring that looks closer to black i dropped it by accident several times and it seemed sturdy a good sign for a device that will be used often shiny silver markings accent its sides top edge and main navigational buttons its shape is a neat thin rectangle a welcome change from the bulgingly wide older devices even friends who dont use blackberrys commented on its attractiveness when i pulled it out setting up personal email accounts to work with the was easy on www cingular com blackberrystart or right on the device itself i needed only to enter my cingular account log in and password along with my personal email addresses and passwords personal email plans including web browsing start at &# a month not including a voice contact similar corporate accounts start at &# monthly the trackball is better for navigating than the scroll wheel for a couple of reasons its location beneath the screen and above the keyboard makes it more accessible than the side hugging scroll wheel enabling navigation within an email as you type without moving your thumbs too far the trackball also lets you move up or down and left to right without having to press any other buttons to do the latter this comes in handy when composing an email if you make a mistake you can simply scroll back or forward in a line older blackberrys required holding the alt key while using the scroll wheel but it took my thumbs quite a bit of retraining to be convinced of the trackballs benefits i was more familiar with my blackberrys scroll wheel and at first i kept touching the top right edge of the to find this and the back button volume buttons are positioned there instead in place of the traditional escape button which is below the scroll wheel on older blackberrys an escape button to the right of the trackball performs the same functions a menu key to the left of the trackball opened detailed options the trackball can be pressed too to make selections i read and sent many emails on my corporate and personal accounts incoming emails were signaled with the devices blinking red light some things thankfully never change but i just couldnt get used to the keyboard rim claims that the keyboards keys are slightly wider than those of its predecessor the but each keys shape and raised ledge made it hard to use accurately it takes time to adjust to any mobile keyboard but this one seemed especially difficult the web browser wasnt bad though its hampered by the fact that this new blackberry runs on at&amp ts pokey edge network which is only one seventh as fast as the speediest networks available i found the easy to hold against my ear for phone calls due to its narrower width and slimmer thickness media can be dragged and dropped onto your blackberrys megabytes of built in memory or memory card not included using media manager a program that comes with the devices software if you prefer taking your memory card out to load content youll have a tougher time i had to slide off the blackberrys back panel open a small metal flap and pull the microsd from its position i did this a few different times and had a lot of trouble getting this card back in making me hesitant to use it often loading and transferring the actual data onto the worked without a hitch i played norah jones tunes loud and clear on the relatively good speaker watched a video on the screen and passed the blackberry around to show friends digital photos of me trying on a bridesmaids dress i zoomed in on and rotated these photos using the trackball i wish the blackberry had a built in camera and easy access memory card slot two features that digitally savvy consumers will want to use often the hip pearl includes a built in camera but its memory card slot is buried in an even more inconvenient place beneath the battery a gps system from telenav inc comes loaded on the when it worked i saw detailed maps of my location but it failed twice while driving along two different highways saying that the gps wasnt able to pick up a clear signal overall the blackberry is a handsome device that looks good and functions well as long as you rely on it for reading more and responding less the keyboard has a steeper learning curve than the trackball a useful new addition that youll learn quickly forgetting the scroll wheel edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
