opera critics sing jonas kaufmanns praises the london music critics are seldom unanimous they are just too many for that their reports on a new "carmen" at the royal opera house in december the first there since ran the gamut the director francesca zambello the conductor antonio pappano the soprano anna caterina antonacci as bizets gypsy siren all took some heavy brickbats to balance their bravos not however the german tenor jonas kaufmann yo nahss kowf mahn in his role debut as don jose the homicidally jealous dragoon for him it was hearts and flowers all the way some of the reviews were content simply to extol describing mr kaufmann as "great" or "superb " others ranked him with such legendary predecessors as jon vickers and jose carreras the financial times asked "could he be domingos heir " and to think that don jose had previously been entrusted to roberto alagna who canceled for the sake of the ill fated "aida" at la scala where boos for his opening aria struck him he later told the press "like a death blow " as widely reported mr alagna fled the stage in midscene was barred from later performances and is now threatening legal action don jose is a tormented fellow with eloquent music to sing in moods that range from nostalgia to desperation from shame and self pity to blind rage not only did mr kaufmann strike all these chords he also found ways to blend them a high point as one hopes against hope that it will be was the flower song don joses abashed declaration of a humiliating love sung in tones of unconditional emotional surrender as an actor mr kaufmann used his lanky physique and fallen angel countenance framed by curls that tumble to his shoulders as expressively as his voice and when ms zambello asked him to enter a scene rappelling down the side of a cliff he could do that too with a panthers stealthy grace mr kaufmann saw his first opera at the age of "it was madama butterfly at the bavarian state opera in munich " he recalled over a late dinner after his penultimate don jose "we were sitting in the first row right by the conductor " he recalled "the one thing that disappointed me was cio cio sans curtain call id just seen her kill herself with my own eyes how could she come out for a bow after that " pro that he is he has learned to live with that little paradox without losing his belief in the truthfulness of the stage the way other boys decide to be pilots or firemen little jonas knew right away that he wanted to be an opera singer not that he was in any hurry talent scouts from the regensburger domspatzen the "sparrows of regensburg cathedral " rivals of the vienna choir boys heard him in a childrens chorus and invited him to join but he kept the news to himself until years later "i was happy at home " mr kaufmann says "i liked being with my family i didnt want to go to boarding school " his formal study of voice began when he was in his mid teens and ended when he completed his training at the hochschule fur musik in munich just as mr kaufmann all of was finding his way into work with regional german opera companies the italian master director giorgio strehler put out a casting call for "cosi fan tutte " the production of mozarts dark comedy of romantic disillusionment was to be strehlers last some hopeful tenors sent in videos for his personal review at a live audition in milan strehler told mr kaufmann to his face that he was too old yet in the end a panicky last minute offer came through and mr kaufmann was on his way to an international career in the intervening decade mr kaufmann has proved hard to classify he has sung nero the depraved roman emperor of monteverdis scintillating "incoronazione di poppea" titus the preternaturally forgiving roman emperor in mozarts "clemenza di tito" beethovens freedom fighter florestan in "fidelio " hallucinating in his dungeon as well as such title roles as verdis don carlos doomed infante of spain and wagners holy fool parsifal "i dont think of myself as a german tenor or an italian tenor or a french tenor " mr kaufmann says "i try to do it all i think im able to and i think its healthy for me working in different styles you learn things that you can take to other repertoire the last thing id want right now would be to make a cd called jonas kaufmann italian tenor id rather present a program that includes a little of everything which used to be a perfectly ordinary thing to do " in fact his discography to date has been somewhat catch as catch can the cds to look for are webers "oberon " sung in english and conducted by john eliot gardiner which mr kaufmanns youthful ardor sets ablaze philips and a revelatory recital of lieder by richard strauss normally the province of seraphic sopranos harmonia mundi in addition mr kaufmann may be seen in full theatrical cry on dvds from the zurich opera house naxos distributes paisiellos th century hit "nina " in which mr kaufmann partners cecilia bartolis lovelorn heroine on the arthaus musik label and "fidelio " documenting his visionary heart rending florestan on tdk next month emi adds "la clemenza di tito" to the list showcasing mr kaufmann not only as a mozartean of distinction but also as operas answer to jude law its an impressive body of work but under an exclusive contract with decca to be announced next week mr kaufmann hopes to develop a steadier stream of recording projects first up is schuberts song cycle "die schoene mullerin" the fair maid of the mill ideally suited to his vibrant lyricism the song repertoire is a special interest of mr kaufmanns and in future cds he means to explore it further but with rare exceptions a classical singers reputation is made on the opera stage somewhat to some colleagues surprise mr kaufmann continues to make his home base at the zurich opera house the company suits him on many counts its uncompromising artistic standards knowledgeable audiences generous fees proximity to his home wife and three children and its modest scale seats "there are things i can sing in zurich that i cant yet sing in bigger houses " mr kaufmann said "you can make a lot of music with a little voice " a little voice for now the instrument sounds intrinsically lyric rather than heroic true but it projects with ease theres an edge of metal there the timbre is noble and if it boasts no single color of a splendor that simply takes the breath away as pavarottis golden tone could do mr kaufmanns imaginative shadings give him a palette of seductive variety and nuance his sterling talents are not lost in the vastness of the metropolitan opera where he made his debut last year opposite the glamorous angela gheorghiu in verdis "la traviata " in march he returns to the met for further performances of that opera in the fall he also parachuted in for three outings as mozarts prince tamino in the julie taymor production of "the magic flute " rather than the conventional stiff paragon of virtue mr kaufmann played a well born dimwit more than a little out of his depth in the cosmic power struggle between the tempestuous queen of the night and sarastro high priest of the enlightenment doctrine that father knows best the result was graceful droll and subtly touching "a purely heroic tamino doesnt work " mr kaufmann remarks "and honestly how bright can he be " fairy tale or tragedy for him its real mr gurewitsch
