screening for unions democrats figure they owe big labor for helping them take congress and now comes the payback tucked away in house and senate bills that purport to implement the recommendations of the commission is a provision that the commission most assuredly did not recommend collective bargaining rights for the transportation safety administrations airport screeners congress created tsa in without union rights on common sense grounds that the agency overseeing airport security was more like the defense department than say agriculture unionization with its myriad work rules would make it harder for the executive branch to hire fire train and reassign workers to best meet changing terrorist threats democrats havent stopped trying to overturn that decision and in they forced a showdown with president bush over union rights as part of creating the department of homeland security mr bush opposed the effort by senate democrats who were then in the majority and the dispute helped the gop gain senate seats that november this may explain why democrats are now trying to unionize tsa sotto voce under the cover of commission "reforms " and so far the press corps has barely noticed the bush administration has caught on however and opposes the change in tsa rules democrats are betting the white house wont have the nerve to veto an otherwise popular if ill understood bill over this single provision our guess is that if mr bush did veto such a bill hed find public sympathy for an argument that he was protecting a vital national security function from being corrupted by union politics
