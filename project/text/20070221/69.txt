me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i live in new york city and am shopping for a new car in the &# range is the suspension system on a small suv like the toyota rav or honda cr v better than that of a sedan for the punishing roads and potholes of city driving paul goldfarb new york a small suvs are especially well suited to city driving mainly because they usually have significantly more ground clearance than a typical sedan the honda cr v and toyota rav have about inches between their undersides and the pavement about two inches more than a honda civic hybrid sedan suvs also tend to have higher more upright seating that gives the driver a more comfortable and commanding view of the road their sturdy suspensions and tires with higher sidewalls are more resistant to damage than those found on many cars q i own a cadillac allante with miles and its original tires should they be considered for replacement even though there is no appreciable tread wear also does engine oil need to be replaced more than once a year on a car used strictly for pleasure driving like this henry b lampe sawyer mich a even though they may appear to be in fine shape your tires are overdue for replacement because rubber deteriorates as the result of exposure to the elements once the rubber hardens it becomes cracked and brittle and sudden tire failure could happen anytime its safe to assume that after more than years its time to replace them even if theyre barely used opinions vary on oil change intervals for cars that are driven infrequently however i think changing the allantes oil once a year should be sufficient q the lease on our mercedes c matic will be up this summer and i am considering buying it we put miles on a year have had all the scheduled maintenance performed by mercedes and so far have not had any issues would buying this car be a good move and what would its life expectancy be joseph nemeth edison n j a it may sound terribly unscientific but getting a "good" car instead of a troublesome one has a lot to do with luck and drivers often know after a year which type they have since your mercedes has performed well and been trouble free i think you should keep it you could easily drive it for another decade without needing anything beyond scheduled maintenance questions can be emailed to mecar wsj com
