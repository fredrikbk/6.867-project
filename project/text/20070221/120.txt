the neurological nightmare of jaundice in newborn infants your page one article "baby has jaundice is that a problem " feb doesnt present a complete picture of the american academy of pediatrics aggressive efforts to protect children from jaundice and its neurologic complications in the aap recognized the dangers that undetected and untreated jaundice poses to infants and pioneered the publication of the first evidence based practice guideline on managing jaundice this publication set the standard for the health care system in managing newborn jaundice the aap will continue its efforts by educating its pediatrician members other child health clinicians and families on managing jaundice as part of its safe and healthy beginnings campaign which is expected to be distributed to pediatricians and hospital nursery personnel in this comprehensive provider and public education initiative developed to ensure a healthy start for every newborn will stress the importance of a newborn checkup at three to five days of age when jaundice usually peaks and support for breastfeeding in addition to assessing the risk of jaundice before hospital discharge the article also suggests the aap doesnt support sue sheridans group parents of infants and children with kernicterus and the u s centers for disease controls jaundice awareness campaign the aap was one of the founding members of the kernicterus prevention partnership campaign while we find the messages suggested in the campaigns posters to be inaccurate and inappropriate for expectant parents the aap has never formally withdrawn from the group my heart goes out to ms sheridan and her son i applaud her efforts to improve the health care system to ensure children are protected from complications of jaundice jay e berkelhamer m d president american academy of pediatrics chicago my four year old daughter lexi is beautiful and bright eyed she was reading at age two and has a quick wry wit by all accounts her potential indicates a bright future but lexi may never know life outside her wheelchair nor communication other than by computer thanks to jaundice she was born after hospitals were alerted that kernicterus was staging a comeback but despite the fact that lexi had several risk factors that could result in this neurological nightmare despite the fact that her doctor examined her within three days of her delivery despite the fact that i repeatedly asked her doctor if her jaundice was a health risk lexi never had a bilirubin test instead i was told to stop being a nervous mother how does the aap decide where to draw the line between alert and alarm lexi was my fifth child yet i had never been told that jaundice could be dangerous had i known lexi would be a normal preschooler today because i wouldnt have asked about a bilirubin test i would have insisted on a bilirubin test susan haas charlotte n c the "kernicterus problem" has concerned physicians and families for more than years fortunately it has almost become a non problem in terms of its decreased occurrence ms sheridans proposal is a most understandable one but times have changed so that many mothers stay in hospital for less than hours and many more deliver at home therefore a universal hospital based test on the second day of life would be of limited impact and it might send the wrong message to a number of less than well informed parties im sure the aap would welcome such a simple solution but the academys experiences say it is simply not enough newborn jaundice looks like it will continue to haunt us for at least a few more years when hopefully a chemical antidote will supervene william o robertson m d aap member professor emeritus university of washington school of medicine seattle to professional staff at a hospital "risk management" never means what it says the correct term is "risk deferral " as in deferring it elsewhere and off their plate the hospital staff defers jaundice and any other high risk problems instead telling patients to "call your babys doctor " all parents need to be advised to see and be seen by the doctor within hours of discharge we tell them that but they never come in risk management not risk deferral would increase the likelihood of a good outcome in those rare cases of jaundice and would protect doctors nurses hospital administrators and hospital owners from malpractice suits and bad publicity somebody isnt stepping up to the plate on this issue and it sure looks like the american academy of pediatrics is more a part of the problem than the solution i hate to say that because i am a member and they are really good people with the best interest of americas children at heart ronald s haxton m d san juan capistrano calif
