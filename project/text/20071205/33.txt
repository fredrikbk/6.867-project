common sense buying opportunities are certain to return smartmoney just a week ago the nasdaq composite index dropped through my latest buying threshold of which was below the indexs high for the year reached in october i woke up tuesday of last week headlines proclaiming the simultaneous correction in all three major stock market indexes and questioning whether we were in the early stages of a bear market but by the time i got to the office the "correction" was over that day the dow jones industrial average soared more than points within four days it had rallied nearly it was the best week for the markets all year we have now had two designated common sense buying opportunities in the first in august lasted about four hours last weeks was even shorter the nasdaq dipped below my threshold monday afternoon and opened above it tuesday morning whats going on here first let me reassure investors who missed these fleeting opportunities i have often counseled that its good to be prepared but also that life shouldnt be spent glued to a computer screen watching stock movements as i reported in august i was able to take advantage of the first correction because i spent some time the night before preparing my shopping list last week offered no such luxury you either moved monday afternoon or you were left out this time i was left out true the market had been falling sharply all month the nasdaq was moving into a range where you could argue i should have been gearing up to buy two weeks ago i pointed this out and urged investors to be prepared its always embarrassing to be found ignoring ones own advice still i expected another buying opportunity to last at least a day or two the goal of the common sense system isnt to pick market "bottoms " a task which is inherently futile it is simply to buy stocks when theyre cheaper and to sell when theyve gained to buy lower and sell higher it is thus rather eerie that two times in a row my buying target has also turned out to be very close to an interim market bottom perhaps there are other systems out there that also call for buying on corrections but theres an easy way to stay ahead of copycats which is to change the formula slightly theres no law that says the thresholds need to be declines and gains as in the common sense system if you want to trade a little more often make the thresholds smaller such as buying on declines and selling on gains if you want to trade less increase the thresholds the beauty of such a simple approach is you can customize it to your own circumstances bear in mind there are consequences shrinking the thresholds will increase your trading activity and may also reduce returns slightly you will capture more buying opportunities but will also find yourself buying too soon more often you will similarly have more selling opportunities but in big bull markets will be forgoing some gains if you expand the thresholds the opposite occurs then again you can stick to my original system which is what i plan to do this week investors seem to have returned to a bearish mood which is a reminder that as long as theres volatility there will always be more buying and selling opportunities in august i predicted investors would get another chance and they did ill make a similar prediction now james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
