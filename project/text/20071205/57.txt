europes pugilists pack a punch professional boxing began in britain but for most of the th century the fight game was dominated by americans now the focus seems to be shifting back across the atlantic for example there were an astonishing plus fans at the nov joe calzhege vs mikkel kessler supermiddleweight championship in cardiff wales while the u s still boasts the richest pay per view market it has been decades since big boxing events played to stadium size live audiences more significantly boxing itself is no longer commanded by fighters from cities like philadelphia detroit and new york max kellerman hbo boxing analyst explained "the shift has a lot to do with the fact that in europe they dont have the competition for sports entertainment that we have we have major league baseball ncaa football and basketball and the nfl they just have soccer " but make no mistake about it the surge of pugilistic passion in europe is also a reflection of the brilliant constellation of boxing stars that have emerged there in the states the winds of boxing popularity are largely determined by the heavyweights today however there is not a single american in the higher echelon of that division which is dominated by wladimir klitschko ukraine sultan ibragimov russia samuel peter nigeria oleg maskaev russia and ruslan chagaev uzbekistan in the lighter weights europe boasts among others mr calzaghe wales mr kessler denmark arthur abraham armenia germany amer khan england and also from england the light welterweight world champion ricky "the hitman" hatton on dec in a contest co promoted by golden boy and mayweather promotions mr hatton will face off with world welterweight champion floyd mayweather at the mgm grand in las vegas when i discussed the issue of european dominance with mr mayweather he smiled slyly and observed "but we still have me dont we and right now everyone recognizes me as the best pound for pound boxer in the world " the grand rapids mich native is right not even mr hatton denies that his rival is the current champion of champions the mayweather hatton bout which sold out almost immediately and will be shown on pay per view is a compelling boxer versus puncher match up an athlete who is now drawing comparisons with the likes of sugar ray robinson and willy pep mr mayweather is as hard to hit squarely as anyone in recent fistic history nicknamed "pretty boy floyd " he fights in flurries of hypersonically delivered combinations placed with pinpoint accuracy at mr mayweather has been seriously challenged only twice in his career once in his initial meeting with jose luis castillo and most recently in his may battle with oscar de la hoya in both cases his adversaries lost but at least enjoyed limited success by temporarily overwhelming mr mayweathers defenses with high volume punching a super charged fighter in the mold of smokin joe frazier the year old mr hatton has the energy and power to apply the pressure that everyone agrees is necessary to defeat mr mayweather in the so called hit man outworked the spartan and seemingly indomitable kostya tszyu to win the light welterweight title mr hatton promises "i will press floyd like no one he has ever seen ill be all over him from the first to the last bell " and yet getting close to mr mayweather in the ring is no easy task a recent contestant on "dancing with the stars " mr mayweather has no problem pivoting and quick stepping out of a corner one of the ingredients of mr mayweathers extraordinary technique is his ability to use his punches to persuade his opponents to give up the most important weapon in boxing the left jab in response to a jab the former olympian will often strike with a surgical but potent counter right hand after that blow lands a few times his foes become much more reluctant to lead with their left however once they give up their jab mr mayweather is well on the way to victory because no one is likely to bull this matador of a pugilist with wide and wild punches mr hatton who is not one to wilt when hit insists that he is not going to surrender any weapons the power puncher with knockouts emphasizes that "the key to beating floyd is to get inside and punch at him from different angles " mr hatton who was an elite soccer player is highly coordinated and light enough on his feet to move quickly from side to side and find those angles before sparring mr mayweather recently confided "im bored with boxing tired of the sport im and have been boxing as long as i can remember " for all of his perhaps feigned insouciance and genuine weariness of the stress of big time boxing mr mayweather cares deeply about his craft and legacy his more than two hour nonstop workouts are astonishing to behold and yet it was clear to me in talking with him that he does not believe that mr hatton is a serious threat to remove the "" from his won lost ledger after all unlike some of mr mayweathers recent oversized opponents mr hatton is two inches shorter and has a seven inch reach disadvantage the champion and his boxing braintrust believe that the man from manchester will be as easy to hit as his punches are to avoid whether his hand is raised at the end or not mr hatton will not be without his supporters in las vegas an estimated of his countrymen will be making the trek to cheer on their very personable hero talking about his fervent following mr hatton said "my fans just see me as a regular lad like them and that is just what i am i havent changed a bit with success on thursday night you can still find me playing darts in the same pub that i have been going to for years " the sense of camaraderie that mr hatton enjoys with his admirers is not uncommon these days with some big name european fighters perhaps this speaks to the fact that the center of boxing has moved eastward in europe working people can relate to boxers such as messrs hatton calzaghe and kessler much as their american counterparts in the early to mid th century could relate to fighters in the u s back then boxing was the second most popular american professional sport baseball was no also while amateur boxing clubs are common in europe most americans today have never climbed the stairs to a boxing gym so they find it a stretch to identify with the men who make their daily bread with glove covered fists mr marino writes on boxing for the journal correction in the dec leisure &amp arts article "europes pugilists pack a punch " the names of joe calzaghe amir khan and willie pep were misspelled and the age of ricky hatton was misstated he is wsj dec
