tax report states finances are feeling the pinch tax revenues grow more sluggishly blame the economy a sluggish economy and housing market woes are taking a toll on state government coffers and that is expected to mean further slowing in spending programs and tax relief thats the picture that emerges from interviews with state government representatives and a joint semi annual report to be issued today by the national association of state budget officers and national governors association the overall state budget picture has undergone "continued deterioration" in recent months says ray scheppach executive director of the national governors association slower economic growth hits state governments in various ways including declining revenue from sales taxes as consumers rein in spending on everything from new cars to home furnishings but officials worry that state budget headaches likely will continue to be significant for years to come because of intense spending pressures from such areas as healthcare infrastructure needs and under funded pensions "we now expect revenue growth in at least to states to come in below projections" over the next six months or so says scott pattison executive director of the national association of state budget officers the report shows that based on enacted budgets for fiscal which for most states ends june states expect revenues from personal income sales and corporate income taxes will be about higher than those collected in fiscal a growth rate mr pattison calls "relatively sluggish " in fiscal revenues rose from the previous year but even the latest projections are seen as overly optimistic because of "reports of continued softness in the fiscal situation of many states since the data was collected for the report " mr pattison says state and local taxes have attracted growing attention in recent years in part because of the rapid growth of the alternative minimum tax which has different rules than the regular federal income tax system taxpayers ensnared by the amt for instance cant deduct state or local taxes about four million taxpayers were subject to the amt last year and unless congress acts to keep it from spreading an estimated million taxpayers will be ensnared by the amt for state tax revenues generally are expanding at a "substantially slower rate" than earlier this year says harley duncan executive director of the federation of tax administrators which represents tax and revenue agencies that includes a "significant slowdown" in sales tax collections a trend he says is "directly traceable" to the housing situation spending growth by states also is slowing for fiscal states have budgeted spending increases of down sharply from growth in fiscal and below the average spending growth of the past years according to the report last years surge in spending came as a result of states dipping into surpluses from prior years to provide tax cuts and boost spending on programs that had undergone big budget cuts in the last fiscal downturn the report says many states continued to face spending pressures from such areas as medicaid costs and under funded employee pension systems facing budget headaches some states already have begun to reduce spending rhode island gov donald l carcieri recently released a list of around job positions that are being eliminated or are targeted
