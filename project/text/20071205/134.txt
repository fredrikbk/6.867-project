the springtime of frank sinatra frank sinatra a voice in time sony &# in i was and my jazz record collection included the popular big dance band of tommy dorsey because "the sentimental gentleman of swing" as the trombonist leader was called had such sidemen as bunny berigan buddy rich and the silvery clarinetist johnny mince on ballads i was also drawn to dorseys year old vocalist frank sinatra who had just joined the band that year he was not yet a jazz singer but his phrasing which he later said had been influenced by billie holiday and his rhythmic ease flowed into the pop jazz mosaic that tommy dorsey nurtured as sinatra later matured musically and gained life experience his singing added another quality of billie hollidays as carmen mcrae described it "she could make you visualize a song in a way that was just so clear " the evolution of sinatra who himself came to deeply influence both popular singers and jazz instrumentalists is celebrated in a four cd set "frank sinatra a voice in time legacyrecordings com available in stores or at amazon com even as early as his s recordings with tommy dorsey sinatra put me then and now in an autobiographical reverie "ill never smile again" and then feeling like the first day of spring "oh look at me now" in his appearances at new yorks paramount theater in the s thousands of teenagers transformed him into americas first "teen idol " years later as reported in the penguin encyclopedia of popular music sinatra with uncommon immodesty said "it was the war years and there was a great loneliness and i was the boy in every corner drugstore whod gone off drafted in the war that was all " but until as sinatra was focusing on the now largely finished "great american songbook" the core of americas popular music his recordings continued to top the hit charts the lyrics and music of george gershwin cole porter harold arlen rodgers and hart et al were as frank mcconnell wrote in commonweal on frank sinatras birthday in among "the supreme accomplishments of our culture " and sinatra was "the voice of that great tradition " hearing that tradition come alive again in this set as he is framed by such master arrangers as sy oliver and axel stordahl it is also clear what an accomplished musician sinatra had become in his exemplary notes for "frank sinatra a voice in time" will friedwald quotes the producers of this essential legacy didier c deutsch and charles l granata "frank sinatra was a musician who exerted extraordinary control over every facet of his music from song selection and arrangements to his vocal approach and the color of his sound sinatras discriminating taste guided the creation of every record he made " in the late s i was a witness to sinatras demanding control of the music he made at the copacabana in new york i was at his afternoon rehearsal of the orchestra for that nights gig conducting he suddenly stopped a number turned to the brass section and said to a trombonist "you just played an e flat it should have been an e natural " i was surprised his longtime guitarist told me sinatra couldnt read music "he must have perfect pitch " said another musician when i cited that rehearsal in any case as venerable jazz musicians used to say frank sinatra had "big ears " a number of jazz musicians have told me that too and in a long ago down beat interview miles davis said he had studied how to play ballads by listening to sinatras phrasing these recordings of the springtime of frank sinatra are not only "a voice in time " but also in his choice of songs a demonstration of how much this nation has lost with the great american songbook not being even a memory now to most of americas young and maybe to future generations when i was in my early s duke ellington my mentor in music and in life values urged me never to be locked into categories of music or the swirl of fashion "there are only two kinds of music " he said "good and bad " at the time i thought he was being far too simplistic but duke was right of course times and cultures change as do definitions among the young as to what is currently called "cool " but over decades and centuries music is indeed essentially either good or bad for me bach always swings and when im immersed in beethovens late quartets im also reliving scenes some of them newly meaningful from my life a reissue of louis armstrongs hot five and hot seven recordings of the s will never rival in sales those of a "new star" rapper nor will a legacy compilation of bessie smith "the empress of the blues " but such recordings will always have a cluster of listeners here and around the world what is missing however from contemporary american popular music culture are the grace the wit the worldly wise honesty and irony and the expectations of romantic fulfillment in such songs in "frank sinatra a voice in time" as "shes funny that way " "dancing in the dark " "all the things you are " "autumn in new york " "i get a kick out of you " "september song " "as time goes by " "one for my baby and one more for the road " and "these foolish things remind me of you " its possible i suppose that such timeless life stories of dreams and loss will be created in music again after all neither rock nor rap euthanized jazz and a new generation may yet create its own extension of the great american songbook mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal
