the morning brief chinas latest bid to slow lending online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here china is once again trying to rein in its relentless economic growth the government plans to shift its monetary policy "from prudent to tight" next year strictly controlling the volume and pace of new loans "so as to better regulate domestic demand and balance international payments " president hu jintao said in a speech to the countrys central economic work conference according to the state xinhua news agency chinese authorities have repeatedly raised interest rates and taken steps aimed at slowing the gush of money into the countrys juggernaut manufacturing and construction industries but beyond its long held inflation worries beijing is concerned they could be producing a glut of unneeded projects that could produce widespread bank loan defaults the associated press notes chinese banks have already been told by the central bank and banking regulators to "keep their net new loans at the level they reached at the end of october limiting them to lending only what they receive in loan repayments until the end of the year " the financial times adds the government has employed similar tactics each of the last three years but bankers tell the ft the regulators seemed more determined this time "were running around and tearing our hair out because of the difficult conversations we have to have with clients who are coming to us for money " one foreign banker says and yet the flow of funds into china at a time when the economic fortunes of the u s and some other more industrialized countries are looking less attractive seems likely to remain strong for example temasek holdings the state owned singaporean investment company has stepped up to provide half the funding for a new &# billion china focused private equity fund created by goldman sachs groups china partner fang fenglei the wall street journal reports a person familiar with the plan tells the journal the other &# billion for the fund aimed at buying stakes in state owned chinese companies will come from several smaller investors and u s efforts to speed it up the banking problem is the exact opposite in the u s where economic worries have risen to the point that theres little doubt the u s federal reserve will take another policy tack when officials meet next week they will likely deliver what the wall street journal notes would be "their third insurance interest rate cut this year " the federal open market committees oct statement suggested that an even balance of risk between inflation and slowing growth meant the cut it made then would cheapen the cost of borrowed cash enough to insure against more economic trouble but the housing market has continued to crumble amid the far resonating mortgage mess and consumer spending has also begun to falter the fomc will probably have a tough time deciding how to change its policy statement and also how much to cut the journal says since some members may find it hard to justify the larger half point cut many in the market expect "when just a few weeks ago they thought they were finished cutting rates " policy makers are having just as tough a time over in britain where "the financial services authority is warning mortgage lenders to prepare for the credit crisis to get worse as the city regulator acknowledged there may be other casualties of the rout that led to the near collapse of northern rock " as the guardian reports the fsa expects to see a worsening situation "in terms of both liquidity and credit risks " the financial times adds and that bleak warning could increase pressure on the bank of england to cut interest rates as it prepares for its monthly meeting tomorrow back in the u s the regulatory focus continues to target the wall street banks as well people familiar with the matter tell the journal that the office of new york states attorney general andrew cuomo has sent subpoenas to firms that include merrill lynch bear stearns and deutsche bank "seeking information related to the packaging and selling of debt tied to high risk mortgages " the subpoenas related to the securitization of subprime loans are "are broadly written " the journal adds and the review "is examining how adequately the investment banks reviewed the quality of mortgages before packaging them into products that were then sold to investors " mr cuomos prosecutors also want to know more "about how the debt was pooled into securities including the banks relationship with credit rating firms " how the iran nie changed the equation following irans blatant refusal last week to continue negotiating over its nuclear program with the international community china expressed unprecedented willingness to jump on the u s led sanctions wagon yesterday beijings ambassador to the u n said "things have changed " as the bbc reports the difference is the latest u s national intelligence estimate and the picture it paints of american doubts about irans intentions to build nuclear weapons faced with an unrelenting press of questions from reporters at the white house about the report president bush seemed surprised it would so drastically change the diplomatic equation saying "the nie provides an opportunity for us to rally the international community continue to rally the community to pressure the iranian regime to suspend its uranium enrichment program " but as the guardian notes "a major re evaluation of policy towards iran is under way in capitals round the world " russia suggested it can more easily oppose a tightening of sanctions on iran and european diplomats tell the wall street journal it will be harder to build a consensus for tougher action within the european union the nie was also roiling american politics giving the democratic presidential rivals of sen hillary rodham clinton a chance to criticize her for backing a senate resolution that labeled the iranian revolutionary guards a terrorist organization and which "her rivals said encouraged saber rattling rhetoric from president bush toward the middle eastern nation " as the washington post puts it but mr bush was clearly the one taking the most heat "the president of the united states it was like watching a rerun of his statement on iraq five years earlier " sen joseph biden said at a national public radio sponsored debate "iran should be dealt with directly with the rest of the world at our side but weve made it more difficult now because who is going to trust us who in europe who in china who in russia its outrageous " also of note wall street journal opec
