china seeks unusual ways to raise energy reserves beijing chinas list of crude suppliers reads like a whos who of the oil exporting world but the sudden emergence of south africa among the ranks has left many market watchers scratching their heads south africa is sending cargoes of oil to china that rival volumes from the united arab emirates kuwait and libya despite not having enough production to meet its domestic needs according to data from chinas general administration of customs south africa exported million metric tons of crude oil to china in the january october period equivalent to about barrels a day that is up from the tons that africas largest economy dispatched in while the country exported no oil to china the previous year "theres no domestic producer with that much capacity to suddenly draw upon and given its bullish demand profile there is no evidence to suggest the south african markets established supply balance would be able to absorb such a significant redirection of crude " said steven knell an energy analyst at consultancy global insight chinas general administration of customs insists that all crude imports are booked by point of origin meaning that if the oil was produced in saudi arabia then it would be counted as saudi arabian crude even if it was unloaded in a third country before being sent to china chinas oil products trade is broken down by category such as gasoline in the official monthly data and is separate from crude the reliability of chinas energy data has been called into question in the past notably by the international energy agency which said in its latest world energy outlook that "considerable work" was needed before chinese statistics could be entered into its own databases yet figures from south africas department of trade and industry also point to healthy trade according to the departments web site the value of south african petroleum shipments to china in the january july period totaled billion rand &# million or of its oil exports so where is the crude coming from "its an interesting riddle " said trevor houser an energy expert at new york based china strategic advisory south africas oil output in was barrels a day figures from the u s energy information administration show and the country mirrors china in relying on coal for the bulk of its fuel needs more than half of south africas oil consumption of barrels a day last year was imported largely from iran saudi arabia and african exporters nigeria and angola what domestic oil output it does have is mostly in the form of synthetic crude produced by sasol ltd using coal liquefaction technology advanced when the country was internationally isolated in the apartheid era the initial reaction of many analysts including mr knell was that sasol was sending synthetic crude to china to support its coal to liquids projects there but sasol spokesman johann van rheede said the johannesburg based company doesnt export any oil to china petroleum oil &amp gas corp of south africa or petrosa is the only producer of crude oil in south african waters and jopie bosman regional manager for the far east middle east and africa said the state company also hasnt exported any crude to china "sasol and ourselves are importing fuel and i would suspect the other companies operating refineries in south africa are more likely to export to africa and id be surprised if any product went to china " ms bosman said traders said a possible explanation was that storage tanks on the south african coastline were being emptied to take advantage of volatility in crude prices forward prices earlier this year were higher than the current market rate a scenario known as a contango this meant there was a greater incentive for traders to store oil and wait than to sell it immediately recently however this has changed and it has been in the interests of traders to sell their stored oil forward prices are lower than the near &# a barrel cost of crude for front month delivery "what surprises us about these customs numbers is the other buyers part " said a london based official at a major trading firm citing the fact that almost all south african crude exports go to china "it just doesnt look right to us " two individuals familiar with south africas petroleum industry suggested the export figure might reflect an agent or agents in the country that are acting as a go between for an angolan producer or it could even be a case of traders changing country of origin waybills during transit bradley way a beijing based analyst at bnp paribas said blending of different types of crude could also explain the spike in trade chinese refiners are very specific about their crude requirements and may need different crudes to be blended to get a desired sulfur or acid content that fits the way their plants are tooled but whichever view they take the only thing analysts seem able to agree on is that nothing about the nascent trade is certain "its a mystery indeed " said mr knell "id say what we have here is clear evidence of the lengths to which china will go to secure its monthly crude call " renya peng contributed to this
