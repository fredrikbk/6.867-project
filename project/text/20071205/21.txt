calling fannie and freddie congress is now preparing to conduct what may be the most sweeping overhaul of the nations mortgage finance system since countrywide financial corp was founded nearly years ago not all of the reforms coming down the pike take aim at keeping homeowners in their homes legislation that has already passed the house and which has been pushed by financial services committee chairman barney frank would not address problems faced by current borrowers but rather could forestall the kind of market excess that led to our current mess thats a worthy goal but there is a more pressing need the senate should address before considering the merits of mr franks reforms its important to act now on other long pending legislation that will stabilize mortgage markets by expanding credit to current homeowners and prospective buyers here is the problem the federal government now imposes a cap on the size of mortgages that government sponsored enterprises gses and the federal housing administration fha can hold or insure this cap is simply too low to meet the needs of buyers in many communities across the country to mitigate this problem congress needs to temporarily raise the limits it now imposes on fannie mae freddie mac and fha mortgages by to &# this reform should be temporary months ought to be long enough it should be done nationwide homeowners across the country need to be able to take advantage of it and it should be enacted as part of a broader package of reforms to ensure that these linchpins of our mortgage system can aggressively support the housing market in a time of need and that the appropriate controls and oversight are in place to protect taxpayers the lending industry can also play a pivotal role here by reaching out to borrowers at risk of default industry leaders should work with treasury secretary hank paulson and hud secretary alphonso jackson to reduce the number of foreclosures and help where appropriate homeowners stay in their homes countrywide is already working to reduce the number of mortgages that could default by identifying some families who are at risk and helping them refinance or modify their loans these are families who collectively have approximately &# billion in adjustable rate mortgages that are scheduled to reset to higher interest rates within the next year it is in everyones interest for these families to be left with mortgages they can afford once reforms are in place that can help homeowners stay in their homes congress can turn its full attention to rep franks legislation there are several provisions within his bill that countrywide supports chief among them provisions to ensure that all mortgage originators are licensed and registered in a national system creating a more transparent system for consumers and regulators is critical mr franks bill would also make significant progress in setting minimum lending standards and in requiring lenders to determine if a borrower really can repay a loan on a monthly basis and if the loan will provide a tangible benefit to the new homeowner to prevent a recurrence of the crisis and lay the foundation for the return of market liquidity the primary goal of any major mortgage reform has to be to set clear rules and objective standards for all market participants in its current form the frank bill does not go far enough in setting national lending standards without setting those standards and pre empting conflicting or competing state laws his bill would not address the disjointed system of rules that helped create many of the problems we are now cleaning up what the market craves now is certainty as congress moves forward we urge careful and deliberative work to improve the minimum lending standards that govern a borrowers ability to pay and what constitutes a tangible borrower benefit clear objective standards are critical to bring investors back into the mortgage market we urge policy makers to act now on pending legislation to help the housing gses and the fha increase liquidity in the market and preserve homeownership for struggling borrowers by taking aggressive action to increase liquidity in the short term and by establishing clear and objective rules to govern the industry over the long term we are confident that homeownership and the economy will rebound stronger than ever we stand behind sensible mortgage lending reforms and urge congress to move forward on legislation that will serve the interests of borrowers lenders and mortgage investors alike homeownership remains the best tool for building long term household wealth and strengthening communities and neighborhoods across the nation mr mozilo is cofounder chairman and ceo of countrywide financial corp the nations largest mortgage lender see related letters "letters to the editor no sympathy for mozilos bailout pleading" wsj december
