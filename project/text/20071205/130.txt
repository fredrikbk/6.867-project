the huckabee contradiction probably no one is more surprised about mike huckabees sudden promotion to the presidential varsity than mike huckabee the self described "paradoxical republican" says he tends to "take sides of issues that i think people dont expect republicans necessarily to join up with " primary voters will have to decide if the former arkansas governor is more paradox than republican particularly on economic and tax policy theres always been a space for an antiabortion candidate in the gop iowa caucuses and mr huckabee seems to be sliding into that slot this cycle hes a smooth and folksy orator and religious voters like his purity on same sex marriage creationism and so forth the ordained southern baptist preacher also isnt above subtly playing the religion card against mitt romneys mormonism to peel off evangelical protestants asked on sunday by abcs george stephanopoulos if mormons were christians mr huckabee dodged the question some say mr huckabee is the tribune of the "religious left " and that strikes us as about right he exhibits protectionist instincts distancing himself from nafta and saying he would insist on penalties and barriers to countries that dont support his conception of "fair trade " he delivers populist sermons against income inequality but in favor of farm subsidies and an expanded government role in health care he regularly knocks wall street and he borrows from the democratic playbook with digs at "the rich " the irony is that if he ever did win the nomination mr huckabee would be vulnerable to the same sort of attacks from the left if not more so the political contradiction of his economic policy is that even as he campaigns as a populist his signature tax proposal is the most radical reform imaginable the so called "fair tax " the fair tax has been knocking around gop precincts for years and has been heavily promoted by texas millionaire leo linbeck among others weve heard their pitch in our offices and admire their passion their concept is to junk the federal tax code payroll income corporate social security everything and substitute a national retail sales tax on nearly all goods and services but while proponents use that figure as an easier political sell the rate is closer to when its calculated like any other sales tax with the levy on top of the price state sales levies would go on top of that theres a lot to be said for taxing consumption over income and the fair tax would be worth consideration if we were writing a tax code from scratch realistically were not the plan would require repealing the sixteenth amendment that allowed a federal income tax and the chances of that happening are approximately zero the political risk given the nature of government is that wed end up with both an income tax and a national sales tax europe here we come mr huckabee has latched onto the fair tax in part to show his antitax bona fides which is necessary given his mixed tax and spending record during his decade in little rock the club for growth has documented that record with prejudice but the fair tax also fits into mr huckabees populist pitch as a way to "abolish" the hated irs gop audiences love that one and so do we but in the case of the fair tax this boast is also misleading one problem with a national sales tax is that its rate would have to be very high to raise enough money to fund the government a rate of or even is high enough to invite its own major enforcement problems so the tax police would still be very much with us as a political matter the fair tax would offer a bulls eye for democrats who would love to run against a plan that would instantly make most purchases more expensive though the fair tax includes a complicated rebate system to shield the working poor a levy on consumption would nonetheless hit hard the young middle income families that mr huckabee is courting it would also tax medical services and home prices sure to be flashpoints this election season in particular in democrats came from nowhere to nearly beat south carolina senator jim demint by pounding his support for the fair tax his opponent said it would raise taxes on of state residents and mr demint had to disavow his support in the american system such a radical change as the fair tax is possible only in a crisis and we arent living in one now mr huckabee nonetheless writes that "when" his reform is enacted "it will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness " that glib naivete should provide some indication of how seriously the former governor has thought through the political and policy complications of his biggest idea and also explain why until recently mr huckabee was considered an implausible candidate see related letters "letters to the editor fair tax advocates speak up for their plan" wsj dec
