campaign in muted debate rivals jab clinton over iran vote support for resolution on republican guard may come up again des moines iowa seven democratic presidential candidates squared off in a radio debate here trading mild jabs on the issue of irans nuclear ambitions but showing little of the fire that has characterized the campaign in recent weeks in an event traditionally conducted in a lower key than others in the white house race national public radios democratic forum lived up to its reputation and produced few sparks it wasnt televised had no live audience and focused on only three subjects iran iraq the rise of china and immigration the liveliest exchanges were on irans nuclear weapons development and a nonbinding senate resolution recently passed that branded irans republican guard a terrorist organization recommending that economic sanctions be imposed upon its members new york sen hillary clinton has come under criticism from rivals for voting to approve the measure her vote gained new significance following revelations after months of hard talk and saber rattling by the bush administration about irans covert weapons program that u s intelligence agencies have concluded that iran probably shuttered its nuclear weapons research shop in this led to insinuations from several candidates that by casting her vote for economic sanctions mrs clinton was giving the bush administration ammunition to push an unjustified war against tehran sen barak obama missed the vote and sens joseph biden and christopher dodd opposed it leaving mrs clinton the only candidate to support the move the tenor on iran was set by former north carolina sen john edwards who along with mr obama is knotted with mrs clinton in a close race in iowa mr edwards all but cast mrs clinton as a tool of the bush administration saying the sanctions resolution she supported was "eerily similar to what we saw with iraq " when mr bush cited a secret weapons program as the rationale for war but failed to prove the program existed at the time of the invasion "i think its very clear that bush and cheney have been rattling the saber about iran for a very long time " mr edwards said "and i said very clearly when this vote took place on the iranian revolutionary guard that it was important for us to stand up to them " for his part mr obama took a more subtle line saying "we cant keep on giving the bush administration the benefit of the doubt knowing the ways in which they manipulate intelligence " mr obama said iran remains a difficult and dangerous country actively aiding palestinian extremist groups hamas and hezbollah and continuing its activities in iraq but mrs clinton was clearly not in the mood for conciliation accusing mr obama of backing surgical bombing of iraq in mr obama said she took her facts out of context and condemning mr edwards for playing politics on the issue "i understand politics and i understand making outlandish political charges but this really goes way too far " she said "there is absolutely no basis for a rush to war which i oppose and have opposed for two years " the npr format and the freshness of the iran news made it too early to tell how much mrs clinton will be punished for her vote on the resolution by the other candidates let alone voters but it is likely to be brought up again one of mrs clintons biggest political vulnerabilities involves the vote she cast as senator to authorize the iraq war a vote mr edwards cast as well but has since said he regretted political operatives say there is something about the npr radio debate a staple in iowa every four years that damps bare fisted attacks joe trippi who managed the campaign for then front runner howard dean four years ago and now serves as a senior adviser to mr edwards says something about the setting in a studio and unseen with questions asked relatively softly and with no intent to provoke makes it less prone to fireworks "its strange " mr trippi said "you come in eating glass and you go out chewing gum "
