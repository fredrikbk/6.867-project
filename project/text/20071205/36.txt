court weighs medical device liability washington the federal government appearing in support of medtronic inc told the u s supreme court that federally approved medical devices are broadly shielded from product liability lawsuits u s deputy solicitor general edwin kneedler said that when congress passed laws regulating medical devices it meant to bar not only state regulation but also a broad category of product liability lawsuits he said companies are shielded from liability suits even if they continue to sell a device that they discover may be improperly labeled "it would not subject it to state tort liability " mr kneedler told the court suggesting the food and drug administration has primary authority to police medical device compliance the case before the court involves a suit brought by a new york man charles riegel who was injured when a medtronic catheter burst during a angioplasty procedure mr riegel who died in asserted that the catheter had design flaws and that labeling instructions for it were misleading in mr riegels case against medtronic his attorney allison zieve sought to convince the justices that federal law allowed mr riegel to sue medtronic over the catheter which had received so called premarket approval from the fda "it is clear that congress didnt want any additional requirements " justice antonin scalia said indicating that he thinks congress wanted the fda to regulate medical devices without interference from state regulators or courts a majority of the justices appeared to support this view an opinion will be issued by july "every time there is an accident or something bad happens the lawyers assert a design claim and gear up discovery " justice stephen breyer said adding that he wondered if congress intended that when it was trying to create a uniform federal approval process for medical devices several justices including justice anthony kennedy posed questions aimed at testing the limits of fda authority over medical devices justice kennedy asked whether a company can be sued if it sells a device while simultaneously seeking "serious" labeling changes for it at the fda mr kneedler and theodore olson a lawyer representing medtronic said federal law allows product liability lawsuits only when a company fails to report problems with a device and someone is injured or killed because of the flaw in that instance a medical device company would face possible federal charges by the fda that could be paralleled by a civil product liability case otherwise the government said congress meant to shield companies from suits because approved medical devices meet reasonable safety and effectiveness standards that have benefits to some patients even though the device may also have risks ms zieve said this view "is incorrect" because the law doesnt explicitly bar product liability lawsuits in provisions that address limits on state regulation of medical devices in rulings favoring medtronic a trial court and the second u s circuit court of appeals in new york both threw the case out of court several federal appeals court circuits have held that federal law does not allow liability lawsuits in this case the second u s circuit court of appeals affirmed a trial court holding that mr riegel couldnt sue medtronic over the failure of the catheter
