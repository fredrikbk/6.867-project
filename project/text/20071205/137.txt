internet users say they have the core protection recommended by mr teixeira according to a study released in october by the security alliance and online security company mcafee inc the most common reason users didnt have the protection was because they failed to keep their security software up to date he says if youre online click on the periodic update alerts that flash on your screen determine if the store is legit before buying from a company youve never heard of find out as much as you can about it look for the businesss physical address a telephone number and an email address in case you need to contact the company if something goes wrong says steve salter vice president of the better business bureaus bbbonline division if the information isnt on the vendors site that doesnt necessarily mean the site is fraudulent mr salter says but resolving any problems after youve made your purchase will be more difficult you can also find information about a company by checking with the better business bureau web site www bbb org plug the vendors web address into the bureaus database to see if any complaints have been filed shoppers should also check to see if the site is certified by an online security certification company mr salter says network solutions has a certification program called sitesafe www networksolutions com and scanalert runs a program called hacker safe www scanalert com the companies run daily checks on web sites to hunt for vulnerabilities and confirm that transactions are secure web sites vetted by programs like these typically display certification logos on their home page when you visit a new site click on any such logo to make sure its real mr salter says because it is relatively easy to duplicate these images on fraudulent sites when you click on the logo you should see information about the sites certification status while certification programs add a layer of security about a web site they dont guarantee it is hack proof mcafee www mcafee com offers a free add on for your web browser siteadvisor that rates the safety of each web site that turns up in search results next to each result is a colored icon green for safe yellow for suspicious and red for potentially dangerous if you click on a yellow or red icon siteadvisor will provide an explanation for example the site may be known for downloading spyware or adware mcafee cautions though that it cant guarantee it will catch every hazardous site and that siteadvisor users must still exercise caution avoid crazy deals auction and classified ad sites like ebay and craigslist are some of the riskiest places to shop online says susan grant director of the fraud center for the national consumers league complaints about general merchandise which includes classified ad and e commerce sites were the no grievance the league received about internet fraud from january to sept accounting for of the roughly complaints auction sites came in at no making up of the complaints a new scam is advertising purebred puppies for an absurdly low price or free if the buyer pays for the shipping ms grant says the scammers keep the money sent to them and never deliver the dog "if somebody is offering something for way cheaper that it normally costs i would be suspicious of that " ms grant says sometimes scammers will ask for payment via a wire service "there is no reason why somebody would ask you to wire the money to them thats how crooks want money " ms grant says craigslist places antifraud warnings on all of its home pages and at the top of each for sale posting "craigslist users can avoid virtually of fraud attempts by following one very simple rule deal locally with people you can meet in person " says jim buckmaster chief executive for craigslist the site constantly works on new technical measures to deter fraud he says on ebay the advice is to comparison shop not just for prices but for sellers as well says jim griffith dean of ebay education if the seller has poor feedback from other buyers or little feedback at all you should reconsider buying from that seller also check to see if the seller gives refunds or insures items mr griffith says only a small percentage of ebay sellers engage in fraud and once an ebay member is kicked out of the site for fraudulent behavior ebays tracking measures make it "next to impossible" for that person to reregister with the site he says try a temporary card number there are new payment options for users wary of putting their credit card information on the web citi bank of america and discover offer temporary account numbers for their cardholders these services will generate a random number that you can paste into a merchants payment form this limits exposing useful financial information to thieves and hackers the merchant cant tell that youre using a temporary number and the charge appears on your credit card statement like a normal purchase you can request a new number every time you shop or use the temporary number for multiple purchases though each number can be used with only one merchant paypal www paypal com has a free add on tool for your browser that works in a similar way paypal account holders can use this tool to make online payments at any vendor that accepts mastercard the tool will generate a unique mastercard account number for the purchase one drawback is that you probably cant use these offerings for all purchases for example they typically wont work for items like concert tickets you have to pick up in person because the temporary card number will differ from the one on the card you present at the box office for verification verify your banks emails the holiday shopping season "is a fertile time for the phishers to attack" since more shoppers are online says frederick felman the chief marketing officer for markmonitor a brand management company increased shopping also boosts the chance a consumer will respond to a phishing email that appears to come from a bank or credit card company especially if the email comes soon after a purchase mr felman says often a consumer might be multitasking when responding to email and not notice that he has clicked a bogus link if you receive an email about a transaction call the number on your bank statement or credit card rather than clicking on a link or using a phone number in an email charity related phishing also pops up during the holidays in these scams you receive an email with a link to a fake charity soliciting a donation enter your financial information and "that credit card is up for grabs " says bari abdul vice president of worldwide consumer marketing for mcafee "we tell people not to click on those links unless you have signed up to receive those charities newsletters " says sandra miniutti vice president of marketing for charity navigator an online charity evaluator be wary of using search results to find a charitys web site or go to charity navigators web site www charitynavigator org which links to charities she says the better business bureaus web site also has reports on hundreds of charities
