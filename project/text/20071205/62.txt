film review juno comes of age with unusual charm the first thing you should know about "juno" is that its wonderful the second thing is that theres a good reason for the heroines frequent use of highfalutin plus some deliciously lowfalutin language juno macguff a suddenly and unintentionally pregnant high school student played by the phenomenal ellen page fires off words and sentences as if they were smart missiles in order to defend herself from her own feelings not to mention the world around her when her condition grows all too visible she says airily "im a legend they call me the cautionary whale " but this is not a cautionary tale its a comedy of crisp mordant wit and quietly radiating warmth as well as a coming of age story with a lovely twist you cant always spot the best candidates for maturity the main candidate wants people to know that her name came not from the capital of alaska but from zeuss wife "she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean like diana ross " still the gods are slow to smile on this precocious year old who is seen by the rest of her school as a laughingstock and a freak she cant face an abortion she knows shes not ready to be a mother and the father to be a winsome classmate is far less mature than she thats why the solution she settles on seems at first heaven sent find a perfect childless couple and give them her baby when its born though the feelingful word "baby" doesnt figure in her otherwise vast vocabulary she prefers "it" or "the kid" but then the question becomes one of parenthood whos truly fit for the task and who isnt and the movie becomes for almost all concerned a surprising stirring chronicle of growth "juno" was directed by jason reitman from a debut screenplay by diablo cody mr reitmans previous film was "thank you for smoking " a likable satire that for all its amiable notions reminded us of its satiric intent with an insistence i took for stylistic insecurity here however his touch is so sure and yet delicate as to be invisible the effect is that of characters acting naturally or at least according to their singular natures within the bounds of a little universe thats often stylized and always askew as for ms cody were told that she acquired a more conventional name when she was born but lets stay with her screen name here since it so nicely suggests the wicked humor and fertile imaginings of her marvelous script the cinematographer was eric steelberg the production was designed by steve saklad and matt messina did the original music this is not the first time ellen page has given a remarkable performance no one who saw her as the ostensibly innocent victim in a brilliantly nasty thriller called "hard candy" will forget the experience her kitty pryde was a formidable presence in the not so formidable "x men the last stand " but juno macguff stands apart not only from the previous work of a very young actress but as a classic and beautiful comic creation shes a motor mouth with an idling speed thats as silent as a prius yet piercingly expressive shes surely the most articulate heroine since cher horowitz in "clueless " but she isnt clueless at all only clueful in the wrong ways and through it all quite mysteriously ms page manages to portray junos extravagant travails with a precision and economy bordering on parsimony not a moment forced not a word among so many wasted it should be noted that "juno" is not the first good film this year in which abortion is quickly dismissed as a response to unwanted pregnancy similar choices are made albeit with different consequences by women in "waitress" and "knocked up " does that mean the right to life movement is finally having its way with the movie business maybe so but another explanation works as well the long debated subject of abortion no longer lends itself readily to dramatic surprises by contrast keeping a baby means new problems and complexity both of which are indispensable to an interesting plot and the surprises in "juno" extend well beyond its heroines plight indeed two of the films great distinctions are the vividness of its characters and the generosity with which theyre treated everyones got the power to surprise us and to delight us with an eloquent speech that includes three minor characters junos father mac macguff who is played gruffly by j k simmons mac only seems to be homer simpson in the flesh macs manicurist wife bren whos played blithely by allison janney and an endlessly winning performance by michael cera as the downy cheeked paulie bleeker who got juno in the family way but the film would have nowhere to go were it not for the major appeal of the perfect couple in their perfectly bland upscale suburb jason bateman is mark loring who composes music for commercials hes so hip and casually charming that juno needs no convincing she knows shes found the right father after all jennifer garner is vanessa loring an earnest and caring woman but an awfully anxious one i dont want to say anything that will tip the storys resolution but i can tell you that the most exquisite scene in this exceptional movie has vanessa talking baby talk and juno making an unspoken snap decision about her babys future mr morgenstern is the journals film critic
