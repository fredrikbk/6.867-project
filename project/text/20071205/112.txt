its never easy for a business owner to take time off most entrepreneurs say they worry about losing money or customers if they take a break many say they dont trust staff to handle day to day operations in their absence but some like witter have discovered that the traditionally quiet period between christmas and the new year is an opportune time to recharge the battery for the year ahead with many clients and vendors also taking time off for the holidays "you can almost take a guilt free period off without worrying about having your blackberry attached to your waistband or your cellphone in your pocketbook " witter says with the holidays a few weeks away she has begun alerting her clientele that the office will be closed as it usually is for the last weeks of the year although shell be checking phone messages and emails on a regular basis the key to taking time off even during a slow period like the christmas holidays is to give your clients plenty of advance

"faceless" corporation she says most clients or customers will understand that youre taking time off during the holidays usually theyre doing the same thing and will appreciate the advance notice she says before your planned absence send an email or mailing to your clients that they only have two weeks before you will be gone for days for example that way your upcoming holiday also becomes an effective sales strategy "people are naturally procrastinators " weinstein says "it helps people say oh now i really need to make that appointment " its also important in advance of taking time off to

kelly davis owner of strategy tree a danville calif human resources consulting firm many companies will shut down on christmas and new years day and give full time employees the time off with pay for those days davis advises her small business clients to clearly outline a holiday schedule at the beginning of the year so that employees know what days they have off or when they are expected to work that careful organizational planning goes a long way in avoiding bitterness and even employee lawsuits she says as for the business owner davis usually advises her clients to take time off especially if they worked holidays while they were building the business often clients dont realize how much the commitment to the business and all the missed holidays has upset their families she says "people dont realize how much resentment can build " she says "for your health and the health of your family you need to make a commitment to do this " entrepreneurs often struggle with guilt when they take time away from the business one solution for the workaholic is to work "on" rather than "in" the business during the holiday week says weinstein the author dont schedule any client meetings or calls so you can have some uninterrupted vacation time but also use the time off to update your business plan outline sales goals and map out marketing strategies for the year ahead "take off partially for family but partially for business planning " she says for business owners who run seasonal enterprises or retail shops the holidays can be the busiest time of year and for them vacation is not an option but "thats something you knew when you got into that business so thats not a surprise " says kirk the small business consultant "take your christmas in july " "balancing work &amp life " a
