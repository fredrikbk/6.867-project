business bookshelf getting hammered broken buildings busted budgets by barry b lepatner university of chicago press pages &# every now and then a major construction project is completed on time and on budget everyone is amazed barry lepatner a new york lawyer specializing in construction cases thinks this exception should become the rule "broken buildings busted budgets" outlines his proposals for making that possible mr lepatners swift kick to the construction industry comes when it is already down commercial construction is slowing and house building is in a severe slump partly caused by a glut of new homes erected by overly optimistic builders even before the subprime crisis made it harder to find qualified buyers the downturn will apply the wrecking ball to many of the weaker construction companies but that wont be enough according to mr lepatner he argues that the industry will become efficient only when its customers become savvier and more demanding mr lepatner isnt alone in deploring the often hidebound ways of the construction business ara hovnanian chief executive of home builder hovnanian enterprises inc likes to describe the methods commonly used by his industry as " years of tradition unhampered by progress " no one says construction is easy its generally done outdoors in all kinds of weather the work is dangerous no two jobs are exactly alike regulations and building codes are dense and inconsistent from town to town workers dont always speak the same languages and if mr lepatner is to be believed are often hung over even so mr lepatner says these difficulties dont excuse the industrys failures to deliver what it promises for the advertised cost builders of tract homes do generally sell homes for a fixed price lately subject to large discounts but renovators and builders of custom homes or commercial projects often end up charging far more than they originally bid construction firms often make unrealistically low bids to get jobs mr lepatner notes but they can count on finding plenty of reasons later to jack the price up enough to allow for a profit when the building is under way it becomes prohibitively expensive to fire the contractor and start anew the owner has become a hostage "the contractor now becomes a monopolist " mr lepatner writes " in total control over the project its costs its schedule and the manner in which it is run " if your contractor tells you that it will cost &# extra to deal with an electrical wiring flaw he has discovered behind your walls while renovating the kitchen will you have the expertise to prove that he is exaggerating or the desire to provoke a guy with a nail gun who is going to be hanging out in your house for the next few months more likely you will sheepishly pull out the checkbook firms arent really competing to deliver quality for the lowest possible price instead according to mr lepatner "they compete for the future right to increase the initial cost of their agreement " its not that contractors are bad people he says its that we let them get away with these practices such unrigorous standards allow inefficient firms to remain in the game "we end up with many firms " mr lepatner writes "but little head to head competition on the big economic variables of time quality and price " his solutions involve among other things hiring experts who can monitor builders and who have financial incentives to prevent needless overruns tougher contracts should enforce fixed costs or at least severely limit the scope for escalation and thorough background checks looking for lawsuits public complaints and financial troubles may lower the chance of hiring dodgy engineers and construction teams such steps would force out of business weak firms that cant deliver on their promises the survivors mr lepatner thinks would be larger firms that are less reliant on subcontractors and are better able to train employees and invest in technology these tactics may bring down the cost of big projects like airports or shopping malls but they are likely to prove impractical for people who just want a new kitchen and cant afford to hire lawyers and experts to vet the general contractor and keep him honest mr lepatner may also overestimate the benefits of large scale he writes glowingly of how levitt &amp sons thrived after world war ii by pioneering more efficient ways of building row upon row of standardized houses on the potato fields of long island and elsewhere he quotes one of the founding levitt brothers saying "we tried to copy the automobile industry a fellow would come to one house and go bang bang bang and then go over to the next one " the company bought supplies in bulk held its subcontractors to rigid schedules and even made its own nails but scale didnt protect levitt from bad management it went into a long decline and last month filed for bankruptcy true other large home builders have emerged over the past two decades they have crowed about their superior abilities to control costs and anticipate demand yet they still bought far too much land during the boom and built too many houses on spec now they are struggling with plunging profits and in some cases teetering on the brink of collapse building houses will never be like making cars or computers industries in which a few hyper efficient firms can dominate but mr lepatner is right we ought to stand up to those guys with the nail guns mr hagerty is a pittsburgh based journal reporter covering real estate see related letter "letters to the editor its planning not just
