the gulf states and iran the release of the new national intelligence estimate will provide more fodder for those who claim that "neoconservative ideologues" and the "israel lobby" are overly alarmed about the rise of iran in reality some of those most worried about the mullahs wear flowing headdresses not yarmulkes and they have good cause for concern notwithstanding the sanguine tilt many news accounts put on the nie i recently visited the persian gulf region as part of a delegation of american policy wonks organized by the center for strategic and international studies throughout our meetings in the united arab emirates uae and saudi arabia the top issue was irans ambitions to dominate the region evidence of those imperial designs is not hard to find the iranians are aiding extremists who are undermining nascent democracies in afghanistan iraq and lebanon the beneficiaries of tehrans largess include hamas hezbollah and even the evidence indicates al qaeda saudi officials are quietly furious that tehran has given refuge to some suspects in the riyadh attacks iran is building up its military arsenal and has threatened to shut down the persian gulf or as arabs call it the arabian gulf what particularly concerns gulf arabs is the possibility that iran could go nuclear a concern unlikely to be erased by the ambiguous findings of the new nie while this nie claims that iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in in direct contradiction to an nie finding issued just two years ago that "iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons" it concedes that "irans civilian uranium enrichment program is continuing " such a "civilian" program could be converted speedily and stealthily to military use as the new nie notes "iran has the scientific technical and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons if it decides to do so " that thought fills sunni arabs with dread "if we accept iran as a nuclear power that is like accepting hitler in " warned one senior arab official using the kind of analogy that back in washington would get him dismissed as a neocon warmonger on our recent trip to the persian gulf we found no unanimity about how to respond to this threat but many officials and private citizens alike called for a pre emptive military strike king abdullah of saudi arabia reportedly came away from his march summit in riyadh with mahmoud ahmadinejad convinced that the iranian president is dangerous and unstable we also learned that many in the governments of saudi arabia and uae privately favor military action to stop irans nuclear program we were assured by numerous interlocutors in both countries that the consequences of such raids which would probably include iranian backed terrorism would be "manageable " the key word here is "privately " those states are afraid to get into a public spat with the shiite fundamentalists across the straits of hormuz they are even unwilling to impose unilateral economic sanctions that could head off a military confrontation thats particularly significant in the case of the uae which is the leading offshore commercial center for iran the iranian business council estimates that iranians hold &# billion in assets in the uae that iranian companies have offices in the uae and that trade between the two countries was over &# billion last year if the uae were to freeze these operations it would impose real pain on tehran but unlike the u s it refuses to go beyond the weak sanctions approved by the u n security council where russia and china block more significant steps as for the possibility of air strikes on iran much as the arabs may applaud such a move by the u s they do not contemplate doing so on their own yet they easily could according to the international institute for strategic studies in london the air forces of the gulf cooperation council bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the uae match up quite favorably with those of the islamic republic of iran the gcc states boast combat capable aircraft vs only for iran and most of the gcc aircraft are much more advanced the gcc is well supplied with modern american fighter bombers f s f s f s and they are buying more top of the line hardware all the time iran by contrast is still reliant on f s and f s acquired by the shah three decades ago supplemented by a few more modern russian and chinese fighters even though iran has also been acquiring surface to air missiles from russia either the uae or saudi arabia has at least on paper an air force capable of dealing the iranian nuclear program a devastating blow of course a gulf air armada would take heavier casualties than an american one gulf pilots do not have the full panoply of surveillance and electronic warfare systems needed to totally suppress air defenses nor do they have the "bunker buster" munitions needed to take out deep buried facilities but the gulf air forces have had years of training and their pilots do practice alongside those from the u s britain france and other nations in the kinds of elaborate air warfare scenarios pioneered in the "red flag" exercises at nellis air force base in nevada some of the weaknesses of the gulf air forces such as lack of bunker busters could easily be remedied by purchases from the american arsenal the u s is making those very kinds of transfers to help the israeli air force develop its long range strike capacity we take for granted that israel a state of million people with a gdp of &# billion could successfully attack nuclear sites located miles away yet we ignore the possibility that the gcc states with a combined population of million and a gdp of &# billion could do at least as good of a job operating from bases located in some cases less than miles from iran irans population is million its gdp &# billion this is largely because the gcc states for all their economic might have gotten used to thinking of themselves as political and military weaklings as much as they may resent and criticize us they feel utterly dependent on us for their defense the u s has a major stake in defending states with so much oil and they do provide valuable cooperation in basing and logistics but these states can and should do more for a start they should take steps to integrate their armed forces so that they can turn the gcc into a nato like fighting force and if president bush or more likely his successor decides to pre empt iran it will be important as in the gulf war to have participation if only symbolic from arab states so that the conflict cannot be cast as one pitting "zionists" and "crusaders" against innocent muslims we need to tell the gulf arabs that if they expect the u s to stand with them in the future they need to stand with us publicly not just privately at the very least they need to stop kicking us in the shins as king abdullah of saudi arabia did earlier this year by condemning as "illegitimate" the "foreign occupation" of iraq even though he doesnt want us to leave the saudi decision to attend the annapolis meeting is a nice gesture in favor of the bush administrations newfound priorities but it does little to address the most pressing issue confronting the middle east a gulf wide policy of getting tougher with iran diplomatically and economically and if need be militarily would do a lot more good mr boot is a senior fellow
