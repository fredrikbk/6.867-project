billion oppenheimer developing markets fund the fund is now "extraordinarily lean" in exposure to chinese stocks he said mr leverenz said he expects that with chinas domestic a shares having risen nearly over the last two years " will be an incredibly difficult year for chinese equities " other fund managers agree and are pulling money out of chinese shares though a few said they are still finding buys in select h shares those of china registered companies listed on hong kongs stock exchange antoine van agtmael chief investment officer of emerging markets management who is credited with coining the term "emerging markets" in said chinas booming economic story is real but its stock markets have been bought up in a mania he said he reduced his investments in china quite a while ago

markets are in a bubble and "like all bubbles it will end in tears " said mr van agtmael "i believe this is going to be sooner rather than later " uri landesman of ing investment management agreed

government created turbulence in hong kong stocks this year with its announcement that mainland chinese would be able to invest directly in hong kong stocks that plan has been delayed it is part of

trimmed some h share positions and added some hong kong companies doing business in china which are selling at much cheaper valuations mr gao said he still believes that china will eventually allow
