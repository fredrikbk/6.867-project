nielsen to be video cop new services goal is to prevent piracy of clips on the web for years media and technology companies have been ensnarled in a battle over the rights to video posted online now ratings giant nielsen wants to be the policeman nielsen is rolling out a new service that aims to ensure that video is distributed and viewed on the web only in ways sanctioned by its owners it is hoping to offer the service to media companies such as nbc universal or the discovery channel which create content as well as social networks such as news corp s myspace and user generated content sites like googles youtube which are huge repositories for video clips produced by others the announcement of the rollout which could come as early as today is a sign of how pervasive pirated content has become on the web some media companies argue that big tech companies that are hugely dependent on video content dont do enough to scour their sites for unauthorized content tensions between media and tech companies came to a head in march when viacom filed a &# billion suit against google for copyright infringement both media and tech companies hope that better antipiracy enforcement will make video a more reliable revenue generator whether through advertising royalties or straight sales of that content a number of smaller companies have sprouted up to fill the same policing role companies including audible magic vobile and baytsp offer similar kinds of service media and tech companies each pay for these services meanwhile google has been building its own fingerprinting system for youtube one advantage for nielsen is that it says it has already done the legwork of encoding more than of national tv programming for its tv ratings service which it revamped about four years ago by contrast a company such as audible magic still has to get media companies to add their content to its database but nielsen is in some ways at a disadvantage to its rivals which have in many cases already signed up customers something nielsen has yet to do nielsen says it has approached google and media companies including news corp s fox about the new service called digital media manager the service will be available starting in the spring nielsens partner in the venture is digimarc a digital watermarking company that helps to produce authentic drivers licenses heres how the service works say a user wants to load a video clip onto a web site that uses the nielsen digimarc filter while the video is loading the filtering program uses its watermarking or fingerprinting technology to identify the clip once identified the program will check its database for video distribution rules given by the media company that produced the clip for instance the video may be allowed to load or perhaps load only if it is attached to a particular piece of advertising or if the video hasnt been authorized by the media company it wont be allowed to load at all while nielsen is in some ways late to the party its move is symbolic some observers say "the point is the big boys are coming and that signals that this is a field that has reached technological maturity " says rick cotton executive vice president and general counsel of nbc universal "it will achieve widespread commercial adoption and from a content point of view it will contribute dramatically to reducing the easy theft of copyrighted material online " sites like googles youtube take in hundreds of thousands of videos every day from amateur videos of babies taking their first steps to clips of tv shows and movies some of which arent authorized for distribution media companies have been eager to find a way to more tightly control and monitor how their content gets out and have looked to web sites like youtube to take a stronger hand in helping them google has said it will remove any content posted without the copyright holders permission when it gets specific complaints and it has begun testing digital fingerprinting technology to identify clips with some partners and take them down if requested but some media executives say google hasnt gone far enough because it wont block videos from being uploaded nielsen units measure everything from tv ratings to things like book sales and web site traffic nielsens fingerprinting technology uses digitized audio from a video clip and matches it with the companys vast database of tv shows "we have decades of experience working with the tv industry and we have the technology in place " says nielsen executive vice president susan whiting nielsens digital watermarking embeds a code into a piece of content that includes information including the name of a show and the time and date that it aired nielsens fingerprinting technology uses sounds from a video clip and matches it with the companys vast database of tv show frequencies nielsen and digimarc say that starting next year they plan to offer a similar service for dvds movies music and videogames nielsen also is looking at encoding user generated content later in protection plan how nielsens new digital media manager service would work when someone tries to upload video to a web site the filtering program uses its watermarking or fingerprinting technology to identify the clip once identified the program will check its database for video distribution rules given by the media company that produced the clip if the video hasnt been authorized by the media company it will be blocked or in some cases will be allowed onto the site only if certain advertising is attached to it
