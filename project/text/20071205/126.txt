the evening wrap a helping hand online edition a widespread mortgage relief plan is set to be unveiled tomorrow by president bush welcome news to many though believers in the virtues of the invisible hand may wince several sources say mr bush is expected to make public tomorrow afternoon the details of a mortgage relief plan for some imperiled borrowers the plan purportedly includes a five year interest rate freeze on certain subprime loans guidance for "fast tracking" some borrowers into refinanced mortgages and permission for state and local governments to use more tax exempt bond programs to fund refinancings the announcement would cap a series of government discussions with consumer groups lenders and investors about how best to prevent a foreclosure crisis as rates on some million mortgages are expected to reset higher in treasury secretary henry paulson had announced on monday that he was "aggressively pursuing" an agreement with lenders and investor groups to freeze rates on subprime adjustable rate mortgages at their original levels the plan would come at a critical time politically as voters focus increasingly on economic issues ahead of the presidential election the

away from people who knew what was going on onto people who did not " mrs clinton said in a manhattan appearance bailout skeptics say a relief plan would interfere with the proper functioning of the market keep homeowners from being responsible for the loans they incurred and postpone rather than prevent foreclosure in droves according to this thinking bailouts foster an overly lax attitude to assuming risk a concept generally known as moral hazard the concept has appeared frequently in recent discussions of what the fed and government should and shouldnt do to solve the problems of the credit crunch "the bush administration and the fed to a lesser extent have not only pushed moral hazard out the door but kicked it deep into the woods " said charles rotblut senior market analyst at zacks com at the same time he said the problem requires some solution to avoid the housing slump from worsening and triggering a recession although he thinks it should be left to the lenders to tackle a bit longer as for determining who merits outside help "i dont know how you draw the line " he said some say the intervention right or wrong is bound to bring unintended consequences "there are bound to be longer run ramifications on how policies like this affect the allocation of capital in the future " wrote merrill lynch economist david rosenberg "historians in the future are going to have a
