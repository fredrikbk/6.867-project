partner and his night job as a husband and father to three young children david rossmiller blogs about insurance these days hes focused on the scruggs affair in which he has no formal role on the matter he has been cited in publications including the new orleans times picayune the los angeles times and the online magazine slate the blog insurancecoverageblog com began in early as a repository for mr rossmillers thoughts on the insurance industry but earlier this year he says he delved into the coverage battles involving hurricane katrina victims and state farm insurance co which he found "absolutely fascinating " he weighed in on court decisions focusing largely on clauses in many homeowner policies that asserted lawyers for policyholders state farm was using to justify denials in coverage mr rossmiller came down hard on the plaintiffs lawyers many of whom he felt were making misleading assertions about the provisions "the episode caused a lot of people to accuse me of being pro insurer but im really not " he says "on the blog its different than representing a client im not shilling for any particular point of view im just trying to call it like i see it " despite the criticism mr rossmiller "kept plugging away " writing on his blog every weekday often until the wee hours of the morning he says hes put up at least one post every weekday for almost two years "this

product of a merger from earlier this year but even before the hookup lebouef had been making some high profile partner hires chairman steven davis who hails from the leboeuf side says leboeuf had a long tradition of hiring partners from other shops but in the past it focused more on courting people in areas in which the firm was already strong the firm later realized he says that if it wanted to make a mark in a new practice area it had to go after bold faced names the key to landing the big name he says is to find a go between when lebouef lured away securities litigator ralph ferrara from debevoise &amp plimpton llp in for example a leboeuf partner who knew mr ferrara made the introduction "i wouldnt have just picked up the phone and called ralph ferrara " mr davis says as for mr bienenstock he says "we approached him we have people here who are friends of his " will leboeuf announce more hiring news soon the firms executive committee wants to "slow things down a bit " says mr
