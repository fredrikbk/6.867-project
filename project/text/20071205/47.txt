democrats move on tax measure could delay energy bill washington in a move that could delay action on a new energy bill house democrats appear ready to pass a bill that would raise &# billion in taxes mainly from oil companies and impose a new mandate for utilities to use renewable fuels measures that could meet senate resistance the house action could start what congressional staffers call "ping ponging " senate leaders who will likely need votes to overcome potential filibusters could remove some of the unpalatable measures and send the bill back to the house requiring it to pass a third version of a bill that it originally passed in august the two added items a mandate that utilities get of their electricity from renewable sources such as solar power and a year &# billion tax package aimed mainly at removing breaks that congress had earlier given major oil companies also could provoke a veto by president bush the largest element of the tax package would remove tax breaks granted to five major oil companies in allowing them tax deductions to promote the creation of more domestic jobs another section would expose more foreign earned income by oil companies to federal taxes the oil related changes total &# billion the money would be shifted to extend investment tax credits for solar energy and fuel cells it also would be used to finance renewable energy bonds to help new companies market new forms of cleaner energy the new house approach resembles a senate approved mandate requiring refiners to use billion gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuels as gasoline additives by larry goldstein a director of energy policy research inc a washington nonprofit research firm noted that the requirement will likely raise future retail gasoline prices "nobody is watching out for the consumer " advocates of another main provision to raise fuel economy in new vehicles by to miles a gallon also expressed concern "theres considerable risk here " said jason grumet president of the nonprofit bipartisan policy center a group that has been pushing the tighter fuel efficiency standards "this is a strategy that should have required scalpels and we have people wielding baseball bats " house democrats acted as though they felt they had the leverage to push the entire package house speaker nancy pelosi hailed the measure as an "ambitious legislative agenda" leading toward energy independence "if he president bush vetoes it he will be making a big big political mistake " said rep edward markey who heads a select house panel on climate change and is a longtime backer of tougher fuel economy standards a more likely scenario appears to be more delays sen harry reid the senate majority leader has said he can round up votes for the ethanol and fuel efficiency items but they arent from the same people raising the possibility that only the fuel efficiency element may survive it has strong support in congress and the white house the house move however may play to the part of the democrats constituency that wants to target "big oil " house democrats want to bring the measure to a floor vote today and then send it to the senate going into a meeting last night ms pelosi played down the risk of provoking delay in the senate "we dont know that we dont know what the senate will do theyre asking questions about things its a legislative process " she said the &# billion tax package for example is significantly smaller than what had been narrowly blocked in the senate earlier this year the utility provisions have been crafted to try to make the mandate more acceptable to southern senators several senators are campaigning or planning trips to a climate change conference in bali indonesia which will make it more difficult to round up votes to send an altered version back to the house david rogers contributed to this article
