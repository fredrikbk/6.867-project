retailer expects christmas sales will bring cheer questions for michael boylson company j c penney co title chief marketing officer with economists predicting a challenging shopping season for retailers j c penney co is pulling out all the stops to try to salvage some holiday cheer to kick off the shopping season j c penney opened its stores at a m the day after thanksgiving also known as black friday "we anticipated a very challenging christmas " says mike boylson penneys chief marketing officer the company says it posted strong sales of electronic products like gps systems apparel and home accessories like throws and towels the housing crisis rising gas prices and a credit crunch are all weighing on shoppers minds and economists say those factors are likely to dampen consumer spending the national retail federation a washington based trade group expects holiday spending to rise to &# billion this year but thats down from an increase of last year in a sign of that pressure j c penney last month lowered its earnings target for the fourth quarter but the retailer is also taking steps to drive new traffic into its stores it has been running several different tv commercials as part of its christmas ad campaign and is also running ads in movie theatres online and in print part of a plan developed months ago "the closer you get to christmas day it really becomes more in the hands of the stores when you get this close in theres not a lot you can do in marketing that can significantly change your fate " he says below are excerpts from an interview with mr boylson who talks about how the holidays are shaping up retail wise j c penneys ad forecast for next year and the impact of the writers strike on the ad market wall street journal its about two weeks into the shopping season how is it going mr boylson every indication we see is that customers are still shopping its more appointment shopping than discretionary shopping we think well have a good christmas season i think its just going to come really late wsj how have you shifted your marketing spending this season mr boylson our total spending is about the same as last year were still very dominant in print but i would say the fastest growing portion of our advertising is the digital space nationally everything weve seen shows digital sales are still growing double digits were on the industry trend the most dynamic advertising we do in the company is online because you can post items in real time were spending about the same in tv wsj the tv business has been in a whirl this year with the debate over commercial ratings and now the writers strike whats your take on the tv advertising business right now mr boylson i think television is still a really important way to communicate especially your branding efforts but you have to be targeted you have to know who your audience is and you have to carefully pick the networks and the shows then you have to be rigorous about how it performs wsj how is the writers strike affecting j c penneys ad buying strategy mr boylson it doesnt really change the ad buying we keep a tight watch over the ratings if all of a sudden the ratings start suffering because the shows arent new then we go back to the networks and ask for compensation in the form of added spots but i dont think its a huge deal yet wsj so no plans to pull advertising mr boylson no that would be really shortsighted you dont whipsaw your strategy every time something comes up we have a strategy that supports the companys long range plan and one of those ways is to use television to reach new customers thats still fundamentally sound wsj several forecasts for ad spending have come out this week for and beyond how does your future overall spending look mr boylson i think well stay the course now would not be the time to pull back on what youre spending but you also have to understand you cant just pile on a lot more advertising either were tweaking the budget but were not anticipating wholesale changes how we spend it may differ and we will probably spend more in the digital space but in terms of overall spending i dont expect a material change either way
