how blackrock forged a plan to rescue fund firm exits shadows to help florida pool stem a run on the bank last thursday barbara novick a top executive at money management giant blackrock inc got a call from a government official in tallahassee fla seeking help with a crisis at a huge state run investment fund the investment fund basically a money market fund catering to local school districts and city governments was suffering what amounted to a run on the bank investors were yanking money out by the billions amid worries about the quality of underlying investments on friday blackrock officials were on site in florida having won the job and state officials yesterday accepted blackrocks recommendations split the pool in two in order to isolate the most troubled securities investors could resume orderly withdrawals as early as tomorrow but would be charged fees on large redemptions the fund had shrunk to &# billion from &# billion before state officials last week took the unprecedented step of halting redemptions the recovery plans success depends on winning over nervous investors which wont be easy but it highlights the changing public face of blackrock which for most of its history preferred to operate away from the limelight the firms main business was quietly managing giant bond portfolios for institutional investors it was known for its ability to carefully manage risk making it popular with conservative investors but last month it was tapped to play a key role in managing a rescue plan for upward of a &# billion worth of complex securities issued by so called structured investment vehicles or sivs the month before that it was hired by e trade financial corp to help assess its battered portfolio of mortgage backed securities blackrock has been turned to for advice in previous times of turmoil the firm worked with the federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust corp during the savings and loan crisis and in it advised general electric co after its kidder peabody brokerage unit ran into trouble this time around the initial job was designed as a four day stint paying the firm &# it had to be a fast turnaround job because some of the municipalities that had parked cash in the pool were already struggling to pay salaries and bills and meet bond payments the florida pool ran into trouble after a handful of complex securities in the portfolio were downgraded because of their exposure to low quality mortgages but it was only after winning the contract that blackrock officials got a look at the portfolio central to the firms own internal approach to risk control is its set of computer models which are designed to assess risks of portfolios filled with complicated securities the blackrock team ran the holdings through the firms computer models while its credit analysts went over the securities one by one the initial idea shift the troubled securities into another portfolio then reopen the higher quality portfolio that remained but as blackrock officials looked closely at the holdings they realized they had a problem conditions are so bad in the bond market that even selling out the highest quality holdings would probably drive down prices triggering additional losses another option simply letting the short term securities in the fund mature as a way to raise cash wouldnt work either maturing securities would be clustered in december and september so there wouldnt be enough cash generated to meet potential redemptions "it became clear the high quality portfolio wouldnt be able to re open free and clear " says ms novick the solution would be to charge fees to investors withdrawing more than &# million or of their assets held in the fund whichever figure is higher these fees would be structured to prevent massive withdrawals while also compensating the fund for losses caused by having to sell securities to meet those withdrawals but when blackrock presented this initial plan to investors monday morning in a conference room at the headquarters of the florida association of district superintendents they were greeted with anger about the redemption fees blackrock officials were told it wasnt fair to investors who had stayed in the pool to be charged fees to access their money the blackrock team consisting of ms novick simon mendelson chief operating officer of cash management and chris stavrakos co head of cash portfolio management regrouped to brainstorm they settled on the idea of seeking banks that would extend lines of credit to investors in the fund those investors could then borrow against those lines of credit in order to meet emergency cash needs while investors would have to pay interest on the loans the idea was that interest income from the fund would offset most of that cost blackrock officials started working the phones to see if banks were interested in the idea by late monday there were indications that bank of america corp among others might participate a bank of america spokesman said he wasnt able to comment yesterday morning blackrocks proposals were accepted by officials overseeing the state board of administration which includes gov charlie crist while the redemption fee represents an effort to discourage additional withdrawals that could further cripple the fund many investors were nonetheless irate and questions remain about the viability of the plan "i havent heard anything that encourages me to stay in " said hal wilson chief financial officer for the jefferson county school district which has &# million in the frozen fund mr wilson also had to stop payment on checks of &# to vendors last week so that teachers could be paid even with the limited withdrawal soon to be available mr wilson says he isnt sure if the school district will be able to meet all of its financial obligations this week "i still have to decide if its safe to continue putting money into this fund " he says
