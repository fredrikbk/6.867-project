borrowers tap mortgages of last resort hard money products draw those hard pressed enough to pay the steep rates fees some mortgage seekers spurned by banks and other traditional lenders are turning to high cost loans known as "hard money mortgages " once thought of as a last resort for strapped borrowers these products also called "private money mortgages" have different lending standards than traditional mortgages and carry substantially higher interest rates and fees these days however they are attracting a larger more affluent group of consumers no organization tracks statistics in this highly fragmented industry and many loans are made by private investors who report to no one but anecdotally business is booming at miami based yale mortgage corp one of the industrys larger players loan applications so far this year are up as much as from a year earlier translating to between and additional submissions every day at alliance portfolio a much smaller hard money lender in aliso viejo calif submissions have jumped to about a month in the wake of the subprime crisis that erupted over the summer seattle funding group a bellevue wash firm that is one of the largest hard money lenders on the west coast recently installed a new phone system in part to handle the calls now flooding in from consumers desperate to fund new home purchases and cash out refinancings "now that subprime has basically disappeared the hard money lenders are pretty much the only source of capital for many people " says daniel yeh a mortgage industry analyst at the scotsman guide a trade publication based in bothell wash hard money lenders range from individuals and small groups of investors who operate independently to small firms like alliance portfolio that get their capital from individual investors who pool their cash in search of higher returns larger firms such as yale mortgage rely on bank credit to make loans these lenders are easily found on the internet and mortgage brokers will often know where to find lenders locally the industry is lightly regulated though depending on how a mortgage is structured lenders can be subject to state and federal caps on interest rates the federal trade commissions web site www ftc gov has links to consumer publications that explain high rate high fee loans a category into which hard money mortgages fall the agency says it hasnt received many consumer complaints about hard money lenders unlike a traditional mortgage which is defined largely by credit scores and a borrowers ability to repay hard money mortgages are based almost entirely on the value of the underlying asset that means a borrowers income and credit score arent nearly as important as they otherwise might be hard money lenders protect themselves by requiring that borrowers have substantial equity in their collateral either their home investment property or a business of to or more moreover interest rates are generally in the low teens and fees can be as much as of the loans value by comparison the rates on traditional year fixed rate mortgages now average around and fees generally top out at jim perry president and chief executive of alliance portfolio says he recently lent &# on a &# house in lake elsinore calif charging a rate of plus a fee of of the loans value the home appraisal process is more intense as well because hard money lenders base their underwriting on the underlying collateral they analyze property and the local market more intently than do traditional lenders their rationale they want assurances that a home is worth a particular amount so that if they must foreclose they know they will recoup their money by selling the property many hard money borrowers are people of means who have substantial equity in their home investment properties and their own businesses but because they fall into lower credit tiers they are suddenly unattractive to the same lenders that earlier this year would have wooed them with subprime mortgages some are seeking a construction loan to build a house that a bank wont fund in the current market some need to close a real estate deal quickly and dont have time for banks to run their long list of checks others need a short term bridge loan to deal with issues such as a divorce settlement or tax liens jack gaglio who runs a small food business in rancho mirage calif says he opted for a hard money mortgage to pay off other loans on his house and business because "im self employed and a lot of business things end up on your personal record " making him less appealing to a traditional lender he says he has tried banks several times and "at the end of the day its basically a no from them " mr gaglio says he called alliance portfolio "and talked for minutes and they sent out someone to appraise my house the next day " the mortgage was funded within several days the rate in the range "is not terribly higher than i would get from a bank after they start looking at everything" on his credit history he says john odegard president of seattle funding group says the typical client he is seeing these days is "an equity rich borrower with pretty good credit who needs money to close on a property now " afterward most borrowers spend time navigating the credit market to find long term financing that is more affordable hard money lending has been around for decades but has been marginalized for residential borrowers in recent years that is because the rise of credit scores computerized lending systems and the ability of banks to bundle low grade loans and sell them on wall street gave traditional lenders a way to offer mortgages to riskier consumers at interest rates lower than hard money lenders charged the subprime crisis has changed all that and because of the upheaval woody kahn principal at yale mortgage says "theres a void" for borrowers who dont have pristine credit the upshot is that hard money lenders are seeing a better quality of customers come through the door joffrey long president of the california mortgage association and president of southwestern mortgage a grenada hills calif hard money lender says his firm was looking at mortgages a year ago in which the borrower had equity now it is routinely seeing borrowers with equity of or more who still cant qualify for traditional bank financing because of credit or income issues still delinquency and foreclosure rates are high in the hard money industry according to many lenders mr kahn at yale mortgage says between and of customers at any given time are delinquent on their payments by more than days between and slip into foreclosure no national statistics are available "were quick to foreclose " mr kahn says "by the st day in delinquency youre in foreclosure " that is a far more frequent occurrence these days for hard money lenders because of financially strapped homeowners and the flagging home market yale mortgage has taken back about properties in florida georgia tennessee and arizona the company has never had more than homes on its book at any one time though hard money mortgages can stretch to years borrowers tend to use them as a short term tool most are paid off within two or three years as borrowers find lower cost traditional mortgages to replace the hard money loan borrowing at a premium "hard money mortgages" are gaining popularity
