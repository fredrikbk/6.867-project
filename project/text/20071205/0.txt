high confidence games in his press conference yesterday president bush went out of his way to praise the "good work" of the intelligence community whose latest national intelligence estimate claims the mullahs of iran abandoned their nuclear weapons program in "this is heartening news " mr bush said "to me its a way for us to rally our partners " we wish we could be as sanguine both about the quality of u s intelligence and its implications for u s diplomacy for years senior administration officials including condoleezza rice have stressed to us how little the government knows about what goes on inside iran in the bipartisan robb silberman report underscored that "across the board the intelligence community knows disturbingly little about the nuclear programs of many of the worlds most dangerous actors " and as our liberal friends used to remind us you can never trust the cia only later did they figure out the agency was usually on their side as recently as the consensus estimate of our spooks was that "iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons" and do so "despite its international obligations and international pressure " this was a "high confidence" judgment the new nie says iran abandoned its nuclear program in "in response to increasing international scrutiny " this too is a "high confidence" conclusion one of the two conclusions is wrong and casts considerable doubt on the entire process by which these "estimates" the consensus of intelligence bureaucracies are conducted and accorded gospel status our own "confidence" is not heightened by the fact that the nies main authors include three former state department officials with previous reputations as "hyper partisan anti bush officials " according to an intelligence source they are tom fingar formerly of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research vann van diepen the national intelligence officer for wmd and kenneth brill the former u s ambassador to the international atomic energy agency iaea for a flavor of their political outlook former bush administration antiproliferation official john bolton recalls in his recent memoir that then deputy secretary of state richard armitage "described brills efforts in vienna or lack thereof as bull " mr brill was "retired" from the state department by colin powell before being rehired over considerable internal and public protest as head of the national counter proliferation center by then national intelligence director john negroponte no less odd is the nies conclusion that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in in response to "international pressure " the only serious pressure we can recall from that year was the u s invasion of iraq at the time an iranian opposition group revealed the existence of a covert iranian nuclear program to mill and enrich uranium and produce heavy water at sites previously unknown to u s intelligence the bush administrations response was to punt the issue to the europeans who in were just beginning years of fruitless diplomacy before the matter was turned over to the u n security council mr bush implied yesterday that the new estimate was based on "some new information " which remains classified we can only hope so but the indications that the bush administration was surprised by this nie and the way it scrambled yesterday to contain its diplomatic consequences hardly inspire even "medium confidence" that our spooks have achieved some epic breakthrough the truth could as easily be that the administration in its waning days has simply lost any control of its bureaucracy not that it ever had much in any case the real issue is not irans nuclear weapons program but its nuclear program period as the nie acknowledges iran continues to enrich uranium on an industrial scale that is build the capability to make the fuel for a potential bomb and it is doing so in open defiance of binding u n resolutions no less a source than the iaea recently confirmed that iran already has blueprints to cast uranium in the shape of an atomic bomb core the u s also knows that iran has extensive technical information on how to fit a warhead atop a ballistic missile and there is considerable evidence that the iranian revolutionary guards corps has been developing the detonation devices needed to set off a nuclear explosion at the weapons testing facility in parchin even assuming that iran is not seeking a bomb right now it is hardly reassuring that they are developing technologies that could bring them within a screws twist of one mr bushs efforts to further sanction iran at the u n were stalled even before the nies release those efforts will now be on life support the nies judgments also complicate treasurys efforts to persuade foreign companies to divest from iran why should they lose out on lucrative business opportunities when even u s intelligence absolves the iranians of evil intent calls by democrats and their media friends to negotiate with tehran "without preconditions" will surely grow louder the larger worry here is how little we seem to have learned from our previous intelligence failures over the course of a decade our intelligence services badly underestimated saddams nuclear ambitions then overestimated them now they have done a degree turn on iran and in such a way that will contribute to a complacency that will make it easier for iran to build a weapon our intelligence services are supposed to inform the policies of elected officials but increasingly their judgments seem to be setting policy this is dangerous
