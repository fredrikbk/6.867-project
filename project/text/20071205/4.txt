as demand balloons helium is in short supply syracuse university physicist gianfranco vidali spends most of his time studying how molecules are made in outer space but a couple of months ago he abruptly dropped his interstellar research to address an earthly issue the global shortage of helium the airy element best known for floating party balloons and the goodyear blimp is also the lifeblood of a widening world of scientific research mr vidali uses the gas which becomes the coldest liquid on earth when pressurized to recreate conditions similar to outer space without it he cant work so when his helium supplier informed him it was cutting deliveries to his lab mr vidali said "it sent us into a panic mode " helium is found in varying concentrations in the worlds natural gas deposits and is separated out in a special refining process as with oil and natural gas the easiest to get helium supplies have been tapped and are declining meanwhile scientific research has rapidly multiplied the uses of helium in the past years it is needed to make computer microchips flat panel displays fiber optics and to operate magnetic resonance imaging or mri scans and welding machines the technology explosion is sucking up helium supplies at dizzying rates u s helium demand is up more than in the past two decades and is growing at more than annually in developing regions such as asia "weve not seen the supply and demand at this imbalance in the past were running on the edge of the supply demand curve " says jane hoffman global helium director for praxair inc supplies in the worlds largest helium reserve near amarillo texas are expected to run out in eight years finding and developing new helium sources will take years and millions of dollars in investment glitches at some of the worlds biggest helium producing plants have put a further pinch on supplies in the past year as supplies have tightened prices have surged in recent months for one new york laboratory prices have increased to &# a liquid liter from close to &# at the end of the summer the upshot helium users from party planners to welding shops are having to do with less large industrial manufacturers are better able to weather the helium shortage taking steps like installing equipment that can recycle the gas so it is the nations cash strapped scientific community that is getting the worst of the crunch soaring helium expenses could shut the doors of some independent labs many which have produced important research over the years and slow down work at bigger research centers helium is used in research to find cures to deadly diseases create new sources of energy and answer questions about how the universe was formed helium is essential to cool the magnets in nuclear magnetic resonance or nmr instruments used to map the chemical structure of molecules dale ray from the cleveland center for structural biology an association that groups researchers from several institutions says he is considering selling or shutting down two machines at the nmr lab he manages the increase in helium prices is making it unaffordable to run the equipment which is used to study proteins responsible for alzheimers disease among other things physicists are particularly affected by the helium shortage because their equipment requires more frequent helium refills after experiencing interruptions in his helium deliveries moses chan a physicist at penn state launched a poll among his colleagues to find out how widespread the problem was the results the majority of helium users at different institutions experienced canceled deliveries at least once as well as price increases some of them as much as myriam sarachik a physicist at city university of new york might have to shut down her research among other things ms sarachik studies new materials that could bring a quantum leap in computing capabilities helium now absorbs most of her labs budget leaving little extra for everything else "im going to retire thats the handwriting on the wall " says ms sarachik who has been doing experiments with helium for more than years for one project ms sarachik and her students use liters of liquid helium a week to cool the inside of a four feet high metal vessel to temperatures close to zero degree kelvin or about minus fahrenheit inside they place tiny samples of materials mounted on chips and send electric currents to measure their properties without the helium it would be impossible to monitor how the electrons respond because their behavior is masked by heat vibrations the national high magnetic field laboratory home of the worlds strongest magnets also is being affected hundreds of scientists travel from all over the world to tallahassee fla to use its magnets they use the lab free of charge but pay for their helium consumption many of them are on a very tight budget to keep them coming lab director greg boebinger will allocate &# of his own tight budget to offer free helium "they need whatever relief we can provide " he says "if they stop coming were dead in the water " there are a few helium projects scheduled to come on line in the next couple of years but experts predict supplies will remain tight in coming years despite its higher prices helium isnt expensive enough yet to warrant projects devoted to its extraction so it must piggyback on investments made by natural gas producers additionally the biggest helium reserve in the world which is operated by the u s government is in steady decline stored in a depleted natural gas cavern known as the bush dome near amarillo it supplies of the helium consumed in the world the government started the reserve in but by the mid s decided to sell it to pay off debt it incurred from stockpiling helium over the years under law the entire contents of the bush dome should be sold by helium is very expensive to store because like a stranded party balloon it floats up and disappears into the atmosphere as a result there is little storage capacity for the gas virtually all helium is processed and shipped to its final user as soon as it is extracted from the ground once the bush dome reserve is gone there will be no stored helium to supply the market in case of disruptions at production facilities making for even spottier deliveries and higher prices experts predict this situation will eventually price out many helium users who will find substitutes or modify their technology some party balloon businesses are filling balloons with mixtures that contain less helium some welders are using argon industrial users are installing recovery systems in places where helium isnt easily available like india scientists already focus on experiments that can be done using liquid nitrogen says michael cuthbert a sales manager for oxford instruments a company that sells scientific instruments all over the world reem jaafar a researcher at ms sarachiks lab at cuny says she will go into another area of physics if helium prices stay at their current levels "if you have a fixed amount in a grant and you have to spend it all on helium you dont have anything left over " she says corrections &amp amplifications liquid helium is made colder by depressurizing it a marketplace article wednesday incorrectly said liquid helium becomes colder when pressurized wsj dec
