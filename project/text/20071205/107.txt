democracy after months of military rule year old provincial power broker banharn silpa archa will likely determine who gets to be the next prime minister in a country where massage parlor tycoons pop singers and harley riding generals run for public office mr banharn stands out as a stubborn survivor of a less flashy era allegations of corruption and loss of support from coalition partners forced the deal maker to quit as prime minister in after months in office derided by the thai media as a country bumpkin mr banharn retreated to his hometown there he built a waxworks museum in honor of his political achievements and watched while other premiers came and went now with parliamentary elections set for dec mr banharn has returned and is back in the power brokering business "ill talk to anybody about forming a new government " he says taking a break from talks with financiers and envoys from other politicians who are discussing plans for his return last years coup toppled prime minister thaksin shinawatra he was thailands most popular elected leader ever but also one whose populist policies and autocratic manner upset the countrys military and conservative political establishment mr thaksin a billionaire telecom tycoon who served as premier for five years is now in self imposed exile in britain avoiding thai government efforts to try him on corruption charges his thais love thais political party once the countrys largest has been outlawed though some of his followers have formed the smaller people power party that means thailands next civilian government is likely to be a weak coalition patched together from a passel of smaller parties such an outcome would ensure that the behind the scenes influence of thailands traditional elites the military civil service and royalist aristocracy will be preserved a coalition of smaller groups jostling for primacy will also be less likely to quickly change economic policy even throughout the chaotic years of the late s and s successive thai governments have generally been supportive of private business this inadvertent laissez faire approach helped thailand emerge as one of the worlds fastest growing economies and an important link in the global supply chain for companies such as toyota motor corp and ford motor co "a weak government could mean a stronger economy " says andrew stotz head of research at clsa asia pacific markets in bangkok and it opens the doors to the return of old school thai power brokers which is where mr banharn comes in in the voting his thai nation party is likely to win about one quarter of the seats to secure a majority in parliament and form a government mr thaksins followers would need those seats so too would the military backed democrat party and its leader abhisit vejjajiva so far mr banharn isnt saying whom he might side with it isnt in his financial interest to do so old style politics in thailand is often more about business than policy some small businessmen or retired military leaders have a penchant to start their own political parties in hope of getting rich or richer their goal is to be taken over by one of the larger more established political groups political analysts estimate the "transfer fee" of one parliamentary seat from party to party can be nearly &# million sometimes as with mr banharns party smaller political parties agree to form coalitions with their larger competitors in return they collect some of the choicest ministerial portfolios in the government mr banharn has mastered this trick in his years in politics he has served as finance minister commerce minister and industry minister he eventually formed his own short lived government in then in mr thaksin turned thailands political order upside down flush with cash from his telecom empire mr thaksin acquired the backing of many of the smaller parties under the umbrella of his own party in mr thaksin won an outright majority in parliament the first thai politician to do so he didnt need the likes of mr banharn anymore after that mr banharn says he thought he wouldnt see the inside of the prime ministers office again "i thought mr thaksin would be in power for years " mr banharn says seemingly made obsolete by a new breed of politicians who paid more attention to slick marketing than late night horse trading mr banharn began spending more time at home in suphanburi about miles northwest of bangkok last year he began drawing up plans for a roughly yard long concrete dragon to house a museum of chinese history but then came the september coup and the demand for the services of smaller players such as mr banharn has rebounded many educated thais are nervous about the return of mr banharn and other older politicians to critics they represent the excesses and governance problems of thailand in the s that led to asias financial crisis but the people in mr banharns hometown of suphanburi are eager for his return to government over the years mr banharn has channeled millions of dollars to this farming village "oh it would be wonderful if he could be back in government again " says supachai bunsorn a year old butcher in the town market among the gifts mr banharn has bestowed on his constituents are a little traveled six lane highway running through the heart of suphanburi a nearly foot tall banharn observation tower and several schools named for mr banharn and his wife in return the people of suphanburi chipped in to help mr banharn build his waxworks museum on the outskirts of town along with a display of the gifts mr banharn received from foreign leaders and a striking picture of mr banharn dwarfed by former german leader helmut kohl the museum includes lifelike scenes of mr banharns childhood in suphanburi and his steady rise to power in bangkok one exhibit a young mr banharn making calculations on his first abacus
