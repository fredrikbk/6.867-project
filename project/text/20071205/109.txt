pakistans embattled leader embraces maverick partner karachi pakistan president pervez musharrafs struggle to stay in power has an unlikely ally a maverick group once hunted down by pakistans army that now controls this metropolis of million people like many of the political forces swirling through pakistan the muttahida qaumi movement is full of contradictions born from a student revolt mqm which maintains a well armed militia was for decades synonymous with mafia like thuggery and violence but in recent years it has also emerged as one of pakistans most secular parties praised by a western diplomat here as "fairly progressive" for its opposition to radical islam led by a former chicago cab driver mqm has also garnered plaudits from the business community as karachis economy flourished in relative peace with its year record of winning elections in karachi mqm enjoys a formidable stranglehold over pakistans biggest city home to more than a tenth of the nations million citizens and what happens in karachi which accounts for as much as of pakistans economy and is its financial and industrial hub often sets the tone for the rest of the country that gives mqm a prominent role in the unfolding political drama as president musharraf tries to hang onto authority after suspending the constitution stepping down as army chief and calling parliamentary elections for jan the main opposition leaders former prime ministers benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif turned up pressure on him on monday as they threatened a joint boycott of the vote unless president musharraf restores the constitution and reinstates an independent judiciary whether president musharraf survives this crisis and what political forces rise to shape government politics in coming months will determine the extent of pakistans cooperation with the u s in its fight against terrorism as al qaeda and taliban style insurgents increasingly destabilize this nuclear armed nation mqm has behaved throughout this turbulent period as a trusted ally its lawmakers participation in the october presidential election boycotted by the opposition helped legitimize president musharrafs re election to a second five year term the group has also rejected opposition calls for boycotting the coming parliamentary elections a move that helped prod most other parties to field candidates too most importantly mqm which displayed its capacity for deadly violence in may remains a reserve of street power for the embattled president a force that could maintain karachi on his side should the political crisis escalate into street confrontations between the government and the opposition "we have a critical mass here" in karachi says farooq sattar the partys most senior official in pakistan mqms backing may not ultimately be enough to save president musharrafs political hide given widespread outrage over his imposition of emergency measures against pakistans media and the judiciary last month unlike the two main opposition movements mqm hardly exists outside karachi and a handful of other southern cities it captures only about of the national vote still the partys support underscores that the former army chief of staff who seized power in a military coup can still count on influential allies beyond fellow generals in pakistans army once a bitter foe of the military mqm came to embrace president musharraf after years of conflict with past democratically elected regimes headed by ms bhutto and mr sharif "the major political parties always want the transfer of power from a military dictator but weve seen that once they gain power they start to behave in the same manner or even worse " says mr sattar interviewed at the mqm karachi headquarters complex thats manned by gunmen with mqm embossed baseball caps mr sattar adds "any discontinuity instability and chaos will only be to the advantage of the extremists " by any measure mqm is an unusual force it is led via daily conference calls by its revered leader altaf hussain who fled pakistan in and is now living in london as a british citizen for a short time mr hussain who like mr sattar trained as a doctor drove a cab in chicago where he has family unlike ms bhutto and mr sharif who recently returned to pakistan and re entered politics after years in exile mr hussain has stayed away from his homeland he didnt answer requests for an interview born out of a radical student movement in the late s mr hussains party capitalized on the frustrations and aspirations of the so called muhajirs muslims who chose to throw their lot with the new country of pakistan emigrating from what is now india following the subcontinents bloody partition in an ethnic community that includes delhi born president musharraf himself the urdu speaking muhajirs settled predominantly in the cities of sindh the southern province that includes the city of karachi their initial prominence in pakistani bureaucracy and relative wealth aroused particular resentment from the ethnic sindhis the countrys second largest ethnic group which felt marginalized in its own homeland after becoming prime minister in sindhi landlord ali zulfikar bhutto began implementing a policy of quotas that promoted the sindhi language and favored rural sindhis over muhajirs in university admissions and public sector jobs aggrieved young muhajir students led by mr hussain and mr sattar responded by launching a semiclandestine militialike movement that would become mqm as it spread outside university campuses amid rising ethnic tensions this movement became a mighty political force mr sattar then just years old became karachis youngest mayor in in parliamentary elections later that year mqm won by a landslide in sindhs urban centers the same elections also brought benazir bhutto ali zulfikar bhuttos daughter to national power as pakistans prime minister ms bhuttos administration cracked down on mqm almost immediately trying to break the partys stranglehold over this vital city ethnic killings and clashes between muhajirs and police sent pakistans economic nerve center into a tailspin one of mqms favorite methods of protest was a ban on any wheeled transport in the city enforced by militia snipers who would shoot any drivers from rooftops the party also began to fund itself by extorting protection money from businesses and according to ms bhuttos government by running torture chambers where electric drills were applied to enemies kneecaps mr sattar says that whatever violence was committed by his partys members at the time was in self defense mr sharif a conservative politician who followed ms bhutto as pakistani prime minister proved just as reluctant to cooperate with mqm in the year when the partys leader mr hussain fled to london mr sharif deployed the army to karachi for a massive anti mqm operation the city descended into an undeclared civil war with dozens killed every day in ms bhutto who had become prime minister once again launched yet another crackdown mqm says it lost supporters to extrajudicial executions thousands remain missing ms bhuttos government argued at the time that it had to show an iron will in its fight against "terrorists " it is largely because of the escalating human rights abuses in karachi that ms bhuttos government was dismissed in allowing mr sharif to return to power violence in the city only subsided after gen musharraf then head of the army ousted mr sharif and established emergency rule in although a muhajir himself gen musharraf who has always insisted his loyalties lie with the whole of pakistan didnt initially embrace the controversial party shortly after the coup mr sattar the former mayor was jailed by a military run tribunal on corruption charges an angry mqm boycotted local elections and an islamist politician became mayor of karachi then the sept attacks transformed pakistan mqm rushed to condemn the tragedy and to endorse president musharrafs decision to cooperate with the u s against al qaeda and afghanistans taliban rulers who had been long supported by the pakistani establishment as president musharraf cast around for allies mr sattar was released from prison in mqm won throughout urban sindh in national and provincial elections securing out of seats in pakistans parliament it also recaptured the mayoralty of karachi in and is widely expected to do well in the jan elections "mqm is a very popular party in karachi probably more popular at this stage than any other party " says daniel markey a senior fellow at new yorks council on foreign relations who used to deal with pakistan when he was at the u s state department in part this popularity stems from the technocratic business friendly administration that mqm appointed to run karachi a city thats rising from ashes by most accounts the partys once common practice of extorting businesses stopped too "weve tried to appear whiter than white knowing that there is this perception of mqm " mr sattar says frankly seeking to broaden its appeal beyond karachi the party has also reached out to non muhajirs and to non muslim minorities positioning itself as a defender of the secular values and of pakistans burgeoning middle classes "in the past if you didnt belong to mqm you couldnt live in the area they control " says fayez hussein an ethnic sindhi office secretary who moved a year ago to the mqm stronghold of kalaboard "now there is no problem " as pakistans and karachis economy boomed in recent years british educated mqm mayor mustafa kamal launched massive infrastructure projects that brought drinking water to overcrowded slums created verdant playgrounds and eased traffic congestion with new highways and overpass bridges glittering new restaurants and shopping malls mushroomed in karachis upscale neighborhoods across the city photography shops cd stores and barber salons with names like "bollywood style" remain open late into the night in spite of hardline islamic restrictions that have shuttered such businesses in many other parts of the country "karachi has never been a fundamentalist city and our party is the biggest hurdle in the fundamentalists way " mr kamal says the citys improvements in part a result of mqms newfound influence with the federal government have encouraged karachis business community "karachi was not part of a political setup for years it was always in the opposition and so it was left out of the development " says shamim ahmed shamsi president of the karachi chamber of commerce and industry "now it has become part of the mainstream we are being listened to in all the corridors of power " president musharrafs rule has given karachi "years of political freedom " mqms mr sattar adds gratefully now mqm has an opportunity to repay those favors earlier this year president musharrafs move to oust pakistans chief justice iftikhar chaudhry energized the pro democracy opposition on may as a wave of protests erupted in lahore and islamabad pro democracy campaigners hoped to tip the scales with a mass rally in karachi that was to be attended by the popular judge instead following an accord between mr sattar and president musharraf the citys streets were flooded that day with flag waving mqm supporters chanting "you will die if you come here " armed mqm militiamen according to witnesses took positions on karachis main roads including the highway leading from the airport where mr chaudhry was supposed to land the police force was noticeably absent soon mqm and opposition supporters most of them ethnic pashtuns or sindhis began to exchange gunfire by midday these clashes escalated into full fledged fighting reminiscent of the bloodshed of the s leaving the city littered with burned cars and causing dozens of deaths "we were in the middle of the road in the open and suddenly mqm started firing at us " says bashir jan a pashtun politician whose right leg was hit by a bullet that day "mqm claims that karachi is their city and they dont accept anyone else here " mqm officials say they didnt want these gun battles blaming the may incidents on provocateurs among the opposition in any case mr chaudhry never made it into central karachi on may and no mass rally against president musharraf has been attempted here since then apart from a massive suicide bomb in october that marred the return of ms bhutto to pakistan the giant city has remained relatively calm "the only true reliable support that pervez musharraf has is mqm " says mr kamal the karachi mayor mqms loyalty to president musharraf has deepened the rift between it and the main opposition parties that are jostling for power mqm is "a terrorist group that has a political wing and then a military wing which it uses to win elections " scoffs taj haider a senior official in karachi with ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party and a former senator such hardening attitudes mean that should president musharraf be ousted or significantly weakened in coming months karachi could find itself dealing with a hostile federal government once again and this many here worry means that the ethnic violence of the past may return with a vengeance shattering the citys recent recovery "whenever mqm is in government there is relative peace in karachi " says abdul khalique junejo a prominent sindhi columnist and lawyer "whenever theyre out there is no peace "
