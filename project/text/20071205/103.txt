plan for food safety criticized at hearing a pattern of risk would be needed for fda to respond the bush administrations plan to improve food safety would actually do the opposite by making it harder for regulators to mandate measures to prevent food contamination critics told a senate panel the plan requests that congress give the food and drug administration authority to impose preventive controls on "high risk" products specifically these are foods "that have been associated with repeated instances of serious health problems or death to humans or animals from unintentional contamination " the plan would make it more difficult for the fda to impose such rules said mike taylor a food safety expert who worked in the administrations of presidents george h w bush and bill clinton mr taylor testified before the senate committee on health education labor and pensions which is reviewing the administrations plan "essentially this provision is a requirement that people be injured or even killed before the fda can act " said sen edward kennedy d mass who chairs the committee "such a requirement undermines the basic goal of preventing illness " under current law the fda can impose preventive steps requiring companies to identify and control food safety risks if the agency can show there is a potential for harm to humans or animals the hearing follows a number of outbreaks of food borne illnesses ranging from salmonella in peanut butter botulism in chili and the chemical melamine in pet food that have shaken consumers confidence in the food supply the bush administration responded in november with two proposals one that covers a wide range of imported products including food and the other focusing on fda regulation of both domestic and imported food the plans would have the fda focus on products that pose higher food safety risks "americans enjoy one of the safest food supplies in the world " said mike leavitt secretary of the department of health and human services the fdas parent agency but he also testified that "our current system is not keeping up" with the high volume of trade mr kennedy wasnt convinced the administrations plan will solve the problem citing tight budgets and a remarkably harsh fda advisory committee report that report concluded the agency has "serious scientific deficiencies" and an inadequate workforce in his testimony mr leavitt said he has requested "substantial additional resources" for his entire department not only the fda for the next fiscal year beginning in october the administrations food safety plan falls short of what the food industry has been calling for and at yesterdays hearing cal dooley president of the grocery manufacturers association urged congress to require that all importers not just high risk ones take steps to ensure that their products and ingredients meet fda requirements
