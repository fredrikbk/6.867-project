how to avert recession the american economy is now very weak and could get substantially weaker current economic conditions call for lowering interest rates and for enacting a tax cut now that is conditioned on economic developments in more generally fiscal policy should be considered in the future whenever there is a risk that an excessively easy monetary policy could cause an asset price bubble after a surge of above trend growth in the summer there is likely to be virtually no rise in real gdp in the current quarter almost every economic indicator including credit conditions housing and consumer sentiment has deteriorated significantly since the federal reserves october meeting in my judgment the probability of a recession in has now reached if it occurs it could be deeper and longer than the recessions of the recent past further interest rate cuts can reduce the risk of recession and increase output and employment in and the current fed funds rate is essentially neutral not low enough to stimulate growth and not high enough to reduce inflation although there are risks that the rise in oil prices and the falling dollar will raise the inflation rate the greater potential damage of an economic downturn calls for a more stimulative policy the fed should reduce the fed funds rate at its december meeting and continue cutting toward in unless there is a clear sign of an economic improvement because of current credit market conditions there is a risk that interest rate cuts will not be as effective in stimulating the economy as they were in the past the current credit crunch reflects not only a lack of liquidity but also a lack of confidence in the creditworthiness of counterparties and in the accuracy of asset prices this problem is now being compounded by the banks loss of capital as they recognize past losses and by their need to use large amounts of the remaining capital to support existing off balance sheet credits that have to be shifted to their balance sheets all of this implies that lower interest rates may not raise lending and economic activity to the same extent that they did in the past but rate cuts can still help lower interest rates will still reduce monthly interest payments for the one third of homeowners who have adjustable rate mortgages thus freeing up cash to spend on other things when banks make new loans they will do so at lower interest rates encouraging more business and household borrowing yet more than lower interest rates is needed fed chairman ben bernanke signaled a desire for additional policies to reinforce monetary easing when he called for a dramatic temporary rise in the maximum size of eligible fannie mae and freddie mac mortgages to &# million from the current &# while this would help to stimulate the market for high priced homes it would cause these government sponsored lenders to assume an even greater share of the u s housing market when there is a strong fundamental case for reducing their role and why should american taxpayers provide an implicit guarantee to mortgages of up to &# million when the average sale price of a home is now less than &# in a similar attempt to go beyond fed easing the head of the fdic recently proposed that the government impose an across the board limit on the mortgage interest increases that are now scheduled to occur with more than &# billion of mortgages scheduled to adjust up in such an imposed limit could no doubt avoid many personal defaults but arbitrarily changing the terms of mortgages now held by investors around the world would also destroy the credibility of american private debt who would invest in u s bonds or mortgages if the government could arbitrarily reduce the contracted interest payments whats really needed is a fiscal stimulus enacted now and triggered to take effect if the economy deteriorates substantially in there are many possible forms of stimulus including a uniform tax rebate per taxpayer or a percentage reduction in each taxpayers liability there are also a variety of possible triggering events the most suitable of these would be a three month cumulative decline in payroll employment the fiscal stimulus would automatically end when employment began to rise or when it reached its pre downturn level enacting such a conditional stimulus would have two desirable effects first it would immediately boost the confidence of households and businesses since they would know that a significant slowdown would be met immediately by a substantial fiscal stimulus second if there is a decline of employment and therefore of output and incomes a fiscal stimulus would begin without the usual delays of the legislative process even if the fed decides that it should not cut rates further at the present time it would not raise rates to offset the stimulus effect of the fiscal change from the feds point of view the tax cuts can provide a desirable short run stimulus without the inflationary impact that would result from a lower interest rate and an increase in the stock of money some reliance now on a fiscal stimulus rather than easier money would also take pressure off the exchange rate adjustment while further declines of the dollar are necessary to shrink the massive u s trade deficit continued rapid declines might lead to counterproductive retaliatory actions by some of our trading partners the excessive asset price increases caused by some past monetary expansions especially the induced rise in the prices of real estate provide a further reason to use fiscal as well as monetary policy by cutting the fed funds rate to just in and promising that it would be raised only slowly the fed contributed to the sharp rise in house prices and the markets current weakness a mixed strategy that included a prospective fiscal stimulus would have reduced the feds perceived need for a sustained negative real fed funds rate and would therefore have produced a more balanced expansion of demand now is surely a time for such a two part strategy of expansion mr feldstein chairman of the council of economic advisers under president reagan is a professor at harvard
