politics &amp economics grappling with guantanamo supreme courts detainee rights ruling could affect bush legacy washington nearly six years after the bush administration began shipping alleged terrorists to guantanamo bay cuba the supreme court will today hear arguments over a basic question do its prisoners have a right to challenge their detentions before a neutral judge the courts decision expected by june could mark the final verdict on the bush administrations practice of indefinite detention and will help shape the presidents legacy a decision to deny the prisoners the right to challenge their detentions could effectively authorize the u s to hold without court review virtually any foreigner regardless of how or where apprehended by declaring him an enemy combatant such a decision could validate the administrations view that as a legal matter the entire world is the battlefield in its war on terrorism an adverse ruling for the administration could allow scores of prisoners to air claims of wrongful imprisonment before judges empowered to set them free opening the secretive detention program to independent scrutiny in the closing months of mr bushs presidency the ruling "could be the grand finale " says cully stimson a former detainee affairs chief at the defense department and now a fellow at the heritage foundation twice before the supreme court has rejected arguments that the administration need not account for its treatment of the prisoners it found in that existing law gave federal courts jurisdiction over guantanamo two years later it said the presidents plan to try selected detainees before military commissions ran afoul of the geneva conventions both times the administration responded by obtaining congressional legislation restricting judicial review of the detentions the military commissions act of abolished the power of u s courts to hear guantanamo based habeas corpus petitions which require a jailer to demonstrate a detentions legality the prisoners lawyers say thats unconstitutional the government says habeas corpus never was intended for enemy combatants the governments classification of the roughly men currently held at the naval base as is typical the constitution is terse addressing the subject in a single sentence "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it " the principal case before the court one of three cases that were consolidated illustrates the ambiguities of the post conflict the case began not in afghanistan but in bosnia and herzegovina where some american troops were stationed as part of the north atlantic treaty organization force helping implement the u s brokered dayton accords in the weeks after sept u s personnel around the world braced for more terrorist attacks fears were especially high in bosnia a country with a muslim plurality whose fight for independence had attracted hard line volunteers from arab countries some of whom had settled in the balkan republic during the s according to press accounts u s intelligence intercepted telephone conversations suggesting plans to attack the american and british embassies in sarajevo the embassies were closed in reaction to the threat reopening only after bosnian police at u s behest arrested six men of algerian origin most of whom held bosnian citizenship evidence allegedly included the telephone number of al qaeda commander abu zubaydah which the government said was found in one suspects apartment another suspect was the son in law of a janitor who worked at the u s embassy the u s refused to share details of its intelligence on the men with bosnian officials according to press accounts at the time after a three month bosnian investigation couldnt independently verify the allegations a bosnian court ordered the suspects released amid rumors that the u s would remove the men from the country the human rights chamber a tribunal of bosnian and international judges established by the dayton accord to enforce human rights laws issued an order barring deportation of some of the men nonetheless in january bosnian police handed the men to the u s which flew them to guantanamo where they have remained after the supreme courts first guantanamo ruling in the pentagon convened administrative hearings to confirm its classification of all the prisoners at the prison the government asserts that the classification process which continues largely unchanged is adequate to satisfy whatever rights the prisoners might have at his first hearing one of the bosnians mustafa ait idir insisted he wasnt a terrorist but an aid worker for charity groups helping orphans he submitted an affidavit from his bosnian born wife saying he moved to croatia in because his job as a computer technician for an islamic charity was relocated there a former croatian national champion in karate he obtained bosnian citizenship after frequent visits there the affidavit said the pentagon alleged that mr idir now years old belonged to gia an extremist islamist group with ties to al qaeda military records say he obtained bosnian citizenship by serving in the bosnian army in "associated with a known al qaeda operative" there and planned to travel to afghanistan the government didnt show its sources to mr idir who complained it was impossible for him to challenge unnamed witnesses or rebut unseen evidence mr idir said at a hearing in that the fact of his prolonged detention made it too embarrassing for the u s military to let him go "like the interrogator said after holding a person in prison for three years this tribunal cannot just say i am innocent and let me go home " he said todays case could determine whether mr idir can make his case before a court rather than a panel of military officers
