can new hong kong tower put kowloon on the map the icc a mixed used project being built in three phases through bundles upscale shopping and a ritz carlton hotel with million square feet of office space hong kong for decades this citys famous skyscrapers have all been jammed together in a district of hong kong island known as central across the narrow harbor from the island the citys mainland portion called kowloon a sort of new jersey to centrals manhattan has stayed off the radar for financial firms despite being a five minute ferry ride away instead the peninsula developed into a dense hodgepodge of narrow shopping alleys sprawling public housing projects shipping yards and garment factories but when the foot tall international commerce center which will be the tallest tower in hong kong and the third tallest in the world opens for business this month on the kowloon side it will change the face of a commercial property market that has boomed along with chinas rising financial might the icc a mixed used project being built in three phases through bundles upscale shopping and a ritz carlton hotel with million square feet of office space it is being developed by sun hung kai properties ltd a locally listed company controlled by the kwok brothers mainstays of forbes magazines annual list of the wealthy sun hung kai oversaw the development of what is currently hong kongs tallest building the international finance center the icc sits atop kowloon station a three minute subway ride from hong kong station in central when a planned high speed rail link to guangzhou mainland chinas third largest city is completed in a few years it will position the icc at the crossroads of a key rail line that will bring guangzhou to within minutes of hong kong still when morgan stanley announced in august that it was moving across the harbor and consolidating its asia pacific headquarters in the icc it shook a banking sector and an office market that have for decades revolved around prestigious central the wall street firm has signed up for as many as square feet of office space more than double the space it currently leases out of several buildings in central lo king wai a general manager for sun hung kai says the developer was initially targeting firms with close business ties to mainland china for which a kowloon location would be a more natural fit an announcement is expected today in hong kong that credit suisse group is moving all its hong kong operations to the icc by starting next year the bank will initially occupy the top office floors a total of square feet expanding its hong kong office space substantially "a lot of banks are looking for the one firm experience everyone in the same building " says simon lo a hong kong based director of research and consultancy for real estate services firm colliers international the announcements will lend more credibility to kowloon as a home for global financial firms with a foothold in hong kong other firms are in talks to set up shop in the icc with abn amro holding nv and deutsche bank ag both discussing deals according to a number of people in the industry deutsche bank and morgan stanley declined to comment an abn amro spokeswoman didnt respond to requests for comment the arrival of the icc comes as chinas booming economic growth and hong kongs increasing stature as the gateway to that market have fueled demand for top grade office space low supply in space crunched central has driven costs there into the stratosphere forcing financial institutions to shunt back room operations to farther flung locations since hitting a nadir in office lease rates in central have jumped fivefold to about hong kong dollars us&# per square foot per month according to data from property consultants cb richard ellis for newer buildings the increase has been steeper with floor space at the ifc now pulling as much as eight times what it did just four years ago brokers say in the past year alone average monthly rates in central have risen making office space there about five times as expensive as it is in mainland kowloon according to cb richard ellis office space across hong kong is the th most expensive in the world and in november was the th fastest rising the high rates have been driven by sustained demand from expanding banks hedge funds and firms from mainland china eager to secure prime office space in central that trend has already driven out a number of accounting legal and professional services firms that moved into central during as severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars walloped the economy for a big investment bank like morgan stanley saving on a lease the firm saved more than in making its move according to property brokers isnt necessarily the top factor given some of the iccs other advantages state of the art infrastructure like advanced data capacity and security facilities for computer transactions as well as ample room for consolidation and expansion increasingly the one firm experience is becoming difficult to obtain in central as these banks businesses in asia all continue their aggressive expansion plans even as demand has boomed supply in space crunched central has remained stagnant since the early s hong kongs economic growth has far outstripped office supply in central a situation exacerbated by the fact that few major construction projects have taken place there since the ifc opened in with virtually no top grade office space expected to open up in the next three years still there could be hurdles to the iccs success not least of which is that for some in hong kongs banking community kowloon feels as far away as new jersey might to a manhattanite "kowloon is like a barbarian place unfortunately thats how a lot of people in hong kong feel " says mr lo of sun hung kai when morgan stanley approached mr lo says he was pleasantly surprised especially when the bank said it would consolidate its operations there the sun hung kai general manager says the developer responded by regearing its pitch to investment banks now with morgan stanley packing its boxes credit suisse signing on and others expected to follow he says a critical mass may be developing a view shared by brokers ultimately the icc together with a cluster of developments farther east in kowloon could help relieve the upward pressure on prices in central yet in a sign of the immense demand for space in central analysts say that some landlords far from worrying that their tenants will flee to kowloon are only too happy to see them go knowing they can increase the rent for the next investment bank or brokerage firm cb richard ellis says it has a list of investment and retail banks that are very close to signing andy yuen director of the office department at property consultant dtz in hong kong says he doesnt think the icc will make a huge difference to kowloon as a whole more important mr yuen says is the gentrification of east kowloon the traditional industrial part of town the icc on the other hand is being built on reclaimed land in recent years the teeming area has seen a degree of gentrification with a number of glitzy new redevelopments sprouting there the icc is expected generally to hasten that process mr lo of sun hung kai says that with young expatriate professionals flooding into kowloon the icc could trigger a wave of upscaling to the area corrections &amp amplifications the second tower of hong kongs international finance centre opened in a property report article on dec implied that the ifc as a whole opened in wsj dec
