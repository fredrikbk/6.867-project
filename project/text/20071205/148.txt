with blackstone worries old and new pity the poor blackstone shareholder investors who bought shares of blackstone group lp from its initial public offering in june and held on to them have seen the stock price fall more than old worries such as little disclosure about its investments limited rights for its shareholders compared with its fund investors or limited partners and tax risk have weighed on blackstone and that has been compounded by the recent deal chilling credit crunch now a relatively small investment blackstone made four years ago in financial guaranty insurance corp needs some maintenance with fgic likely to require a capital infusion from blackstone and fgics other investors to save its business the problems facing fgic only add to the woes weighing on blackstones

fbr funds which has &# billion under management like many investors he bought shares in the ipo but has since sold them like other bond insurers that guarantee interest and payment in the event of default fgic is under scrutiny by credit ratings firms over whether it has enough capital to cover potential losses in its portfolio of complex debt securities backed by subprime mortgages as default

from limited partners and has nothing to do with the permanent capital blackstone raised from shareholders in its ipo blackstone has been unequivocal about its intention to make investment decisions based on what is best for its limited partners as opposed to its shareholders even if those decisions raise eyebrows "the average holding period of our investments is years " says peter rose a blackstone spokesman "we are prepared to be long term investors through business cycles " any more money that blackstone sinks into fgic isnt likely to have much of an impact on its earnings which analysts are already projecting will shrink in because of the poor environment for the megasize deals at which blackstone excels the firm continues to attract assets that generate management fees which comprised of revenue through the end of the third quarter but the slumping real estate market hurts its prospects for growth in performance fees and with the volatility in the stock and debt markets blackstones exit opportunities by way of selling portfolio companies to strategic buyers or listing them through public offerings have diminished for these reasons douglas sipkin an analyst at
