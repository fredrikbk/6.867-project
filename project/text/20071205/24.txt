campaign which democrats health plan really truly covers more people while the leading democratic presidential candidates agree on most policy issues a sharp dispute has emerged who would do more to provide health coverage for the uninsured sens hillary clinton and barack obama have been engaged in a bitter back and forth over whose health plan covers more people former sen john edwards has jumped in saying his plan is the best of all the argument concerns whether the government should require all americans to get insurance mrs clinton and mr edwards would require people to get insurance either through work a government program or new health marketplaces that all three candidates promise to set up mr obama would only require that children be insured other elements of their plans are similar including subsidies to help lower income and even middle income families pay premiums and various proposals to cut the cost of health care the candidates say they would pay for their plans by rolling back president bushs tax cuts for upper income earners and by savings in health spending through various measures but with the race tight and health care the no domestic issue for democrats their differences have become a point of continuing tension mrs clinton charges that mr obamas plan would leave million people without insurance outside experts agree that number is in the ballpark if people arent required by law to buy insurance many wont there are millions of children for instance who remain uninsured even though they qualify for free or subsidized government programs in addition all three candidates want to bar insurance companies from rejecting sick people or charging them more but it is hard to require companies to insure expensive sick people if they arent guaranteed that cheap healthy people will balance them out on the campaign trail mrs clinton has attacked mr obama for his plan saying it betrays the democratic principle of universal coverage her campaign has demanded that he take down an advertisement that claims his plan "covers everyone " mr obama has replied that her attacks are more about politics than substance they didnt come he noted until she lost ground in the polls but his advisers dont dispute her central charge rather they claim mrs clintons plan would also leave millions without coverage obama adviser austan goolsbee argues that if mrs clintons health plan is enacted she will have to waive the mandate for millions of people that is because he says there isnt enough money for subsidies to make health insurance affordable enough for people to buy it "you cant put in a mandate until health care is affordable " he says he predicted that a hillary clinton administration would wind up exempting of the uninsured or about million people that is the percentage of uninsured adults who were exempted in massachusetts the only state to try an individual mandate that view may not be true ken thorpe a health policy expert at emory university who has advised all three major democrats said he ran cost estimates for the clinton plan at the clinton campaigns request and found there should be enough money to make insurance affordable for all he said he ran three scenarios with varying levels of subsidies from &# billion a year to &# billion a year the campaign chose one in the middle &# billion if it turns out that isnt enough money to make health premiums affordable mrs clinton would have to spend more on subsidies one of her health care advisers said but the adviser said it is wrong to assume that of americans will be exempted it is impossible to say for certain because the campaign has not explained how large the subsidies will be or who will qualify for them the obama plan does some other things to get people insurance it allows adults up to age to stay on their parents insurance even if they arent in school and it attempts to lower the cost of insurance overall through a reinsurance plan whereby the federal government would cover some expenses of some of the most costly patients outside experts note that the clinton and obama plans propose spending about the same amount of money while mr obama uses some of his to pay for the reinsurance plan an initiative that could cost tens of billions of dollars that should help lower premiums across the board but it means there would be less available for direct subsidies none of the candidates want to talk about the fact that even if their plans worked out exactly as designed none would cover all million uninsured people in the u s thats because several million of the uninsured estimates put it at about seven million are illegal immigrants and none of the front runners include them in their programs
