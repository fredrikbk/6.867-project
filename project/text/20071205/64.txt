growing keeping the ph d s needed for a world beating economy thank you for the editorial "american brain drain " nov the statistics do not convey the full extent to which foreign ph d level employees are critical to the prosperity and maybe even existence of research and development dependent u s companies and to many engineering and science departments at academic institutions in my experience at three places of work the overwhelming majority of researchers were foreign born ph d s this situation did not arise because of some hypothetical "anti u s born" discriminatory practices by the employing organizations further attrition in the availability of foreign ph d s due to u s government policies could cause significant damage to american technological leadership and to the u s economy an overlooked dimension of the problem is a more personal one most foreign ph d s live in the u s for many years on temporary visas that require repeated renewals these are often lengthy and costly processes while one tries to obtain permanent residence from a bureaucracy that seems to be doing all it can to keep them out living in such perpetual limbo exacts a tremendous emotional and psychological toll one that few americans comprehend let alone appreciate not least it disrupts family life and long term plans i have been working in the u s for eight years now and my attempts to gain permanent status have been thwarted so far by a byzantine system coupled with administrative errors on the part of u s government agencies my case is far from being special or unique despite the fact that i have a superb r&amp d job with an outstanding employer i have started considering opportunities outside the u s in more hospitable countries amir handzel ph d rahway n j your editorial did a very good job of describing the shortage of ph d s caused by too few u s citizens seeking such an education one reason this undesirable situation exists and i dont know how significant it is is the preference given to foreign students because they are obligated to pay higher tuition giving more revenue to the universities more of our citizens having acceptable grade point averages would like to further their education but foreign nationals are displacing them this happened to one of my grandsons he was not accepted with a grade point average by the university of washington a neighbor who had worked in vietnam and met his wife there informed me that they had just brought his vietnamese sister in law to live with them and she is attending u of w this is very unfair and discouraging to our young people ron wambolt edmonds wash the writer apparently does not see the elephant in the room why are ph d s being awarded to an increasing number of foreign students why hasnt the u s educational system produced more students prepared to undertake such programs why has the u s media trivialized scholarship and learning especially for women g e lambert ann arbor mich since graduating from a major u s university with a masters degree in quantitative finance i have been working in new york as a financial services consultant for a global consulting firm i and many of my foreign classmates in other firms face the prospect of leaving and taking our skills elsewhere when our one year post completion training periods end unless our employers can find some way around the visa problem this will ultimately prove very costly to our employers but not necessarily to us individually we stand to gain from the accelerating global boom in demand for our skills and experience our american employers are in danger of being left behind by economic protectionism and over regulation the financial services industry is already having problems hiring enough high quality u s graduates to fill skills shortages in quantitative analytics and computer programming let us hope that your u s politicians have the wisdom and good sense to someday correct this situation judging by the track record of the current congress and white house however this is almost surely a vain hope sarbo saha new york your concern about the american brain drain is right on but your solution isnt what we need are more american ph d s this can be achieved by awarding more scholarships to americans and using other types of incentives our relying on mostly foreign ph d s is like the ancient roman army relying on goths in the end it didnt work out well william thayer san diego calif
