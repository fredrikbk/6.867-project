bidders face new game for french soccer rights paris french pay television company canal plus is facing a tactical headache over how to cut its spending for content after frances top flight soccer league put together a complex set of rights packages in an effort to wring more money out of broadcasters canal plus which paid billion euros &# billion to obtain exclusive live rights for three seasons through says it is determined to pay less this time around as it seeks to cut its content budget and improve margins but a new structure for rights packages unveiled by the ligue de football professionnel last week illustrates the efforts by sports authorities around europe to introduce new competition into markets traditionally dominated by cable and satellite broadcasters canal plus a owned unit of vivendi sa bid high in beating out rival pay tv operator television par satellite which it later swallowed in a billion euros deal with tps out of the equation canal plus is in a stronger position in the coming auction since no other candidates can match its spending clout on content the company is now the dominant pay tv operator in france with million subscribers at the end of september it generated billion euros in revenue in and an had operating profit of more than million euros but to level the playing field and attract smaller bidders the league this year split the games into packages up from four in the league is also selling the rights for four seasons rather than three in the hope of drawing the interest of digital content distributors which need the additional season to boost their audience shares and realize a return on their investment the situation is similar to that in england where the european commission forced an end to british sky broadcasting group plcs monopoly on the rights to live soccer games in the premier league managed to collect gbp billion &# billion over three years starting in up from gbp billion previously bskyb ended up paying more money for fewer games as tv company setanta sports bought two of the packages however many of frances most gifted players such as thierry henry and franck ribery play abroad so the french league may struggle to achieve a similar rise in price "the premier league is a higher quality product " says conor oshea an analyst at landsbanki kepler in paris last week the french league announced a broadcast rights structure that includes three "premium" packages for the prime time games as well as three "fan" packages comprising the rights for games of particular clubs various rules determine which broadcaster gets the rights if a match falls into two different packages there are also four highlights packages and a multiplex package which covers the rights to broadcast as much as minutes from all matches on four specific days during the season last of all is the mobile phone package held by france telecom sa candidates for the different packages must submit proposals to the french league by jan explaining how they plan to cover the matches the financial bidding process will be completed by jan analysts say the removal of the tps threat means canal plus can afford to cede exclusivity over some live games by letting other broadcasters take some of the lower value packages but it cant relax its grip too much as soccer remains a key subscriber retention tool a survey by market research company ipsos sa published last month in french newspaper les echos found that of canals million subscribers who watch soccer would "certainly" cancel if canal lost the football rights a further would "probably" cancel the survey said canal plus will have to bid for all six of the premium and fan packages and probably one highlights package mr oshea believes he says this "reduces considerably the odds of getting a reduction on the &lt euro&gt million a year they are paying currently " a spokesman for canal plus declined to comment on how the company would bid but jean bernard levy the chief executive of canals parent company vivendi has repeatedly said it overpaid last time around some analysts say that buying up the rights would also help canal limit the ability of others to start offering more competition in the industry "the importance of soccer rights for canal lies more in the potential return of competition than in the saving achieved " analysts at exane bnp paribas said in a note to investors the wider variety of packages will allow "new entrants to test business models around soccer " which should "constitute a bigger threat to canal in the longer term " the analysts said among other interested parties france telecom which currently holds the mobile phone rights for the french first division has expressed interest in beefing up its supply of content chief executive didier lombard has said france telecom will bid "modestly" for soccer rights but is not interested in the prime time packages meanwhile frances free to air broadcasters including state controlled france televisions which currently has the rights to the leagues sunday highlights package television francaise sa and m metropole television sa could also bid for some of the less expensive packages such as the highlights packages or the multiplex package france telecoms two rival broadband providers iliad sa and neuf cegetel and cable company numericable could also be interested neuf cegetel "has not shown interest thus far " a company spokesman said because of the size of the necessary investments relative to its subscriber base representatives for france televisions tf and iliad declined to comment while numericable and m were not available jerome batteau contributed to this article
