the mossberg solution a card concierge in case you forget site preps greetings for you including addresses stamps electronic greetings or e cards have come a long way since their debut as one dimensional postcards and now can include animation slideshows and personal narration these digital creations save forgetful friends who dont think far enough in advance to buy and send snail mail cards however even the hippest e cards such as customizable cartoons from political parody site jibjab com are no match for paper cards with thoughtfully penned sentiments rather than fight the ever popular old school cards the digital world is trying to improve the way people buy and send those cards this week i tested a web site called www jackcards com which sends email reminders a month before important dates and offers to ship paper cards one two or four weeks before an event the cards can arrive pre stamped and pre addressed so you need only add your own hand written message before dropping them in the mail jack cards llc of boston based its business after the notion that an imaginary correspondence butler named "jack" could take care of you making you look like the friend spouse relative boss of the year its cards range from &# to &# each plus the cost of a stamp if you opt to get the card pre stamped u s shipping is free throughout december my primary skepticism about jack cards was its content did it offer enough variety to justify buying cards without seeing them would its cards be funny enough to send my uncle into a fit of laughter and would they be like the tear jerkers best friends see in stores and buy for one another for no reason jack cards prides itself on unique offerings that cant be found in the local drugstore and i found that its cards fit the bill for many occasions its worth noting the cards looked even better in person created by about designers who left me both scratching my head over some of their humor and cooing over their beautiful designs but the functionality of the site needs to improve especially in the way it helps users search through cards too often results were hit and miss and it doesnt incorporate enough rich web features which could improve navigation on the site and be a real boon for looking at cards imagine an inset animation of a card opening and revealing its message inside predictably hallmark cards inc isnt sitting idly by as a start up tries to steals its thunder its web site hallmark com sells paper cards in addition to e cards and it too can remind you of coming events its way of personalizing cards is to send them directly to recipients with a message typed inside a method that isnt as personal like jack cards hallmark offers to mail cards to buyers to send out but doesnt pre stamp or pre address anything hallmark also differs from jack cards in the shipping department a &# birthday card from hallmark com cost &# to be shipped to me and wouldnt arrive at my door for five business days the free shipping offer from jack cards will end in january but the company normally charges cents for two to three day shipping this flat fee applies to a package filled with any number of cards without signing in anyone can browse through the more than cards on jackcards com those interested in joining the site can do so for free after entering a name password email and birthday members are asked to enter a list of the "fast five" people with whom they most often correspond such as parents siblings best friends or close colleagues each of the fast five is set up with a name address and list of events that correspond to the person i listed my parents with their anniversary mothers day or fathers day birthdays and christmas i was a little stunned to find an event titled "will you marry me " but i suppose jack cards thought of everything the site could stand to be better organized the page filled with data on each of my fast five seemed jumbled and jumping from one contact to another wasnt as easy as it should be hyperlinks beside the events i entered for these people directed me to a general browsing page for cards instead of to a page specifically related to an event these extra steps gave the page a clumsy feel drop down search toolbars let you choose the occasion style of card humor just for kids romantic etc recipient and designer each cards front and inside messages size and paper color are identified as you move your cursor over them i was stunned by some of the mother specific birthday cards none of the cards said "happy birthday mom " which was a problem because without that the cards all seemed ambiguous a card in this search said "you are going to cherish this birthday card years from now cuz who knows if ill remember your birthday again happy birthday " i cant think of anyone who would give such a card to a mother the company continues to improve its searching to be more accurate but jack cards did introduce me to some clever and original material that i never wouldve seen in my cvs beautifully colorful cards made by masha dyans caught my eye immediately and looked more like watercolor paintings than cards i bought a good variety of about cards and had them sent to me some stamped and pre labeled with my return address and the recipients address typed in attractive script others without any stamp or label square cards cost more to mail cents compared with cents but jack cards will give you the appropriate stamp the weight and quality of the cards along with their artistic attributes made them feel more special than something that has been picked up from a shelf and opened by a hundred passersby many cards were individually packaged in plastic wrappers to stay clean en route if jack cards can continue to work on its sites navigation and search functions i think its system would be welcomed by many people looking for good quality well designed cards that catch the eye it saves users the hassle of last minute trips to the card store and still lets greeting cards keep their personal touch which is what makes them such a permanent fixture in our lives edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj
