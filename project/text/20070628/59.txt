second largest food distributor which subsequently pulled the bond offering and postponed plans to sell the loans that left underwriters of u s foodservice which is being acquired for &# billion by

composite trading yesterday to &# below its offer price of &# a share taken together the setbacks are stoking unease across wall street "the biggest risk we face and there are a lot of things that contribute to this risk would be a very big crisis in the credit markets " lloyd blankfein chief executive of goldman sachs group inc told an audience at the wall street journals deals &amp deal makers conference in new york a "sentiment shift " he said "could unravel very quickly" the vast wealth that has been created by the takeover boom at the same conference treasury secretary henry paulson called the market jitters "a wake up call to focus on excesses" that have developed in recent years in the debt markets several factors underlie the new pushback against buyout financings one is the growing awareness that investors have been demanding very little in return for the risk they have accumulated in snapping up buyout related loans and debt yields on junk bonds when compared with ultrasafe u s treasury securities hit historic lows around a month ago the near collapse of two bear stearns cos hedge funds that invest in risky subprime mortgage debt also sparked broader investor worries about risky investments still it isnt clear if the latest credit market turmoil represents the kind of shift in sentiment that mr blankfein and others worry about mr blankfein himself and many others at the conference said they expected a soft landing for the market underpinning that hope the global economy remains in strong shape growth is robust and inflation and interest rates are low and some deals are still moving forward including debt offerings by dollar general corp and itt switches a unit of itt corp both of which are being acquired by private equity firms banks handling the dollar general deal intend to sell investors &# billion of loans and an additional &# billion in junk bonds with provisions that give the company leeway if it struggles to entice investors the underwriters have been offering higher interest rates other less risky bond sales were completed yesterday including a &# billion junk bond offering by community health systems inc a hospital operator in recent years easy credit has allowed private equity investors to raise gobs of cash to take private such corporate giants as student lender sallie mae utility txu corp and hospital operator hca inc transferring them from public markets into private hands the low interest rate loans and bonds behind these takeovers also have increasingly given borrowers extra leeway if their operations struggled last year announced private equity buyouts in the u s hit &# billion in value including the companies existing debt according to thomson financial already this year the total has reached &# billion if buyers of these loans and bonds typically institutional investors like mutual funds pension funds hedge funds and endowments start to turn sour on these borrowings it could slow if not derail the buyout boom some big buyout related deals remain in the pipeline investors are looking ahead at &# billion of new debt coming to market in the next several months just this week chrysler group which is being sold to cerberus capital management by german parent daimlerchrysler ag began marketing a debt fund raising that will total more than &# billion in addition to demanding higher interest rates investors are resisting many bonds and loans whose terms they believe to be too easy on borrowers investors have rejected a number of recent deals that included "payment in kind" provisions which allow companies to postpone debt payments to their lenders if they run short of cash investors also have rejected loans that are light on certain common performance requirements known as covenants "a lot of managers are starting to get miffed about deals with no covenants and the fact that underwriters seem to have little regard for the risks investors are assuming " said bradley kane who manages a portfolio of corporate loans at scm advisors llc in san francisco banks in several cases have been stuck holding portions of loans or bonds they planned to parcel out to investors something that could make them more selective in underwriting deals meanwhile companies and their private equity buyers face bigger drains on their cash flow as their interest costs rise the debt offering by u s foodservice which is being sold by ahold nv of the netherlands is emblematic of the type of deal that just a month or two ago was getting snapped up largely by hedge funds tuesday evening a group of wall street underwriters canceled a &# billion bond offering and a &# billion sale of corporate loans for u s foodservice after failing to find enough investors to take on the debt the underwriters had to finance the &# billion in debt on their own via a "bridge" loan to the company on the surface u s foodservice ought to have been an attractive investment the company which distributes food to restaurants hotels and schools nationwide provides the kind of stable cash flow that debt investors like the offering was handled by citigroup inc deutsche bank ag j p morgan chase &amp co morgan stanley goldman sachs and rbs greenwich but when the underwriters began to shop the offering around two weeks ago they met a frosty reception from analysts and portfolio managers at big mutual fund companies and other potential buyers investors were concerned about the large amount of debt u s foodservice was taking on to finance the buyout for such risky loans they typically look for protections should the company run into trouble one protection is collateral to seize if the company goes into default but most of u s foodservices assets were already securing other debt obligations the loans in the deal also had minimal covenants and the bonds included payment in kind features neither of those facts sat well with potential investors who refused to buy the debt on the proposed terms "we didnt think investors were being compensated for the risk " said andrew cestone head of the high yield team at evergreen investments a money management arm of wachovia corp evergreen turned down the deal market participants said hedge funds which had been reliable buyers of even the most speculative offerings were also suddenly absent from the marketplace it quickly became clear that the deal would struggle participants say u s foodservices underwriters were soon making calls to investors asking what would make the deal more enticing the main demands from potential buyers were structural get rid of the payment in kind feature and add in covenants then there were the returns being offered investors the yields were below what fund managers thought they needed in view of the deals risk but the underwriters said they couldnt budge on those terms they also didnt cede much ground on price and investors continued to say no thanks now the offering sits on the underwriters books they hope to distribute the loans and bonds to investors in the months ahead gregory zuckerman and dana cimilluca contributed to this article
