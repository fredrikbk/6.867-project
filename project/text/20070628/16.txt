battle brews over asthma astrazeneca challenges glaxos dominance in growing u s market drug maker astrazeneca plc launched an asthma inhaler in the u s this week in an effort to tap that multibillion dollar market in doing so it has picked a fight with rival glaxosmithkline plc which plans to do everything it can to defend its leading position the launch is important to london based astrazeneca which has seen its recent efforts to bring major new drugs to market foiled by test failures and rejection by regulators the company is counting on the asthma inhaler symbicort to drive sales as some of astrazenecas older products lose patent protection about million americans have asthma and many dont manage the disease well according to the american lung association the group says about million emergency room visits in the u s in were attributed to asthma a chronic condition that inflames the airways and makes it difficult to breathe the u s market for asthma treatments which are typically inhaled was about &# billion last year and has been growing at an annual rate of about in recent years according to wood mackenzie a research and consulting firm rising rates of asthma as well as higher prices are contributing to the increase as tougher safety standards and sluggish research and development make it increasingly difficult for pharmaceutical companies to bring new drugs to

glaxo based in brentford england is the dominant maker of asthma treatments in the world and in the u s by market share u s consumers can buy several brands of inhalers but until symbicort was

milder treatments astrazeneca already sold symbicort outside the u s in europe symbicort has about of the market for combination asthma inhalers while advair has the rest according to paul diggle a pharmaceutical analyst with nomura code securities an investment bank in london he says symbicort and advair are quite similar which will make it tougher for astrazeneca to come to market second in the u s "its very difficult to overtake a product youre not a lot better than especially if youre up against a bigger marketing force " mr diggle says astrazeneca plans to differentiate symbicort by emphasizing that the drug gets to work quickly says tony zook president and chief executive of astrazeneca u s "we know that symbicort delivers improved control as soon as the first day of use and it has a fairly rapid onset of action within minutes we believe that will be a point of differentiation for us " he says a glaxo spokeswoman says advair "quickly improves lung function within to minutes of use " she adds that both advair and symbicort are "indicated for long term maintenance treatment of asthma they are not indicated for the fast relief of sudden symptoms " mr zook declines to

corticosteroid to maintain control of their asthma corticosteroids a type of steroid reduce swelling of the airways the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs both advair and symbicort contain a corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist they both carry a black box warning stating that long acting beta agonists may increase the risk of asthma related death analysts say glaxo will have an
