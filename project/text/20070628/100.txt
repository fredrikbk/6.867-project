the daily fix getting kevin garnett may be draft day prize online edition as two teenagers prepare to join the nba tonight in the annual amateur draft the drafts no pick may provide the days biggest surprise kevin garnett is on the block after seasons with the minnesota timberwolves rumors and conflicting rumors suggest no one has any idea whether kg will be dealt phoenix is his most likely destination but atlantas reluctance to trade its draft picks could hold everything up whether or not mr garnett leaves town the minneapolis star tribunes patrick reusse wants to kill a recurring storyline hes seen in the trade coverage "as a noble warrior garnett has an inalienable right to go to a team where he can win a championship " "garnett was part of a team that had the best record in the western conference in " mr reusse writes "when you have the best record in the best conference thats a chance to win a championship and garnett and pals didnt get it done so now his team has gone in the tank and garnett is made into a martyr it is a role that kg seems to relish particularly with the national media an all star weekend tradition has become the interview where garnett laments the condition of the wolves yet vows to continue to expend sweat blood and fist pumps in the effort to win id trade all those emotional displays we see from kg in the fourth quarter of a close game for a single non stop foray to the basket in the final seconds what we get is the foot jumper that bangs off the iron followed by kevins familiar head hanging walk off the court " if mr garnett confounds the odds and heads to los angeles he could let kobe bryant take those final seconds shots "nothing will compare to pairing kobe bryant with garnett which takes everything back to the future instead of keeping everyone wallowing in the past " kevin ding writes in the orange county register "other help from jermaine oneal ron artest or even jerry west doesnt cut it now that garnett shines so brilliantly available out there in the northern sky " mr ding offers two scenarios that could bring mr garnett out west but los angeles times columnist helene elliott says it isnt happening "garnett supposedly favors the suns and the opportunity to have all star teammate and pal steve nash feed him the ball over a chance to play for the lakers " ms elliott writes "which only proves that hes smart given the lakers current dysfunctional state " thats only fair suggests l a times blogger christine daniels "havent we taken enough from minnesota already first we took the states beloved five time nba champion thus depriving the twin cities of nine more basketball titles and the clippers of having to move there to become joint tenants of the target center where they too would know the heart warming joy of having to shovel snow off the hoods of their cars after home games " later indignities included the dodgers victory over the twins in the world series and the lakers defeat of mr garnett and the t wolves in the western conference finals how will greg oden and kevin durant be perceived years from now thats the question hanging over the portland trailblazers as they prepare to make the first pick in tonights draft as noted in yesterdays fix nearly everyone expects portland to select mr oden but not everyone thinks the blazers should "for months now ive been conducting my own searchlight hunt for the right words to describe durant ever since the night he reduced me to a stammering insomniac sleeplessly agape as i watched him lay points and rebounds on oklahoma state in triple overtime just maybe the most gigantic performance ever from a boy without a drivers license " sally jenkins writes in the washington post "words failed then and now " so she quotes the blog free darkos draft preview "so sweeping angelic and sweetly electric a player we have almost never seen" but even there mr oden goes no the posts michael wilbon agrees "wing players with beautiful jump shots inspire the imagination are easier to market and usually sell more tickets " mr wilbon writes "but teams with a great big man win championships " espn coms bill simmons a founding member of the durant fan club picks him first in a mock draft an opinion carefully considered and finally dismissed by his colleague chad ford mr simmonss argument "one guy plays basketball because he was created to play basketball the other plays because he was bigger than everyone else and it seemed like the logical thing to do if there was a pickup game and oden was on one side durant was on the other and your life depended on the game youd pick durant " four out of five louisville players interviewed by louisville courier journal columnist rick bozich because theyve played against both phenoms agree theyd take the big man over the wingman messrs durant and oden forfeited their college eligibility after their freshman years in order to enter the draft nba legend oscar robertson takes issue with this policy in a new york times op ed today "in no other line of work is someone penalized for leaving or delaying school and returning later " the big o writes "besides college coaches who can make millions of dollars negotiate with other colleges or with n b a teams all the time they dont forfeit their employment if they decide to stay put " there are other roundball employment opportunities besides the ones being offered tonight josh pace stuck around for all four years at syracuse didnt get drafted and is now excelling in new zealand pete mcnae of the nelson mail previews mr paces effort to lift his team to the title former nba player john amaechi has other things on his mind these days besides the draft for one thing hes studying for a phd in clinical psychology mr amaechi in an interview with the guardians gary younge talks about his decision this past winter to announce he is gay and about many other things besides "in the course of an hours conversation homer einstein malcolm x martin luther king and oscar wilde all make an appearance to illustrate various points " mr younge writes "while he was playing he spoke out against the war and the national rifle association meech one of his team mates tariq abdul wahid once told him you are the only person i have ever met who is an expert at not fitting in no matter where you are and that was before he came out " the times of londons simon barnes considers the unburdened carefree play of tim henman at wimbledon noted in yesterdays fix as a prime example of the wonderful liberation from expectations "begone dull care away with ambition and most particularly away with fear " mr barnes writes "how can you fear the dragon when its already eaten you " if you havent yet watched mr henmans match today against feliciano lopez the fix will say only that its worth a view and that mr barness comments remain relevant at the opposite end of her career aravane rezai is burdening herself with some big goals "my goal my dream is i want to win the grand slam you know consecutive four grand slams for five years " the year old tells the new york suns tom perrotta mr perotta explains "how improbable it is that shes playing professional tennis at all " ms rezai is hardly the product of elite tennis academies "in recent years as they went from tournament to tournament to boost aravanes ranking the rezai family traveled in a van and slept in it to save money " mandarin high head football coach j d hall has died of an apparent heart attack he was florida times union columnist gene frenette feels
