that at ripplewood "our ambitions are certainly going up not down " the sports fan bain capital managing director mark nunnelly private equity firms are poised for a lot more growth and success he said using baseball analogy to drive home his point "this is not a th inning broadcast but a nd inning broadcast " the skeptic breeden capital management ceo richard breeden the former sec chairman confessed that "abundant leverage and cheap debt make you look smart " but that private equity managers will really be put to the test when credit markets start to dry up "then we see how smart we were " he said the banker goldman sachs ceo blankfein asked whether private equity has hit a peak the straight shooting mr blankfein said "i dont think it has " why so confident "private equity is in there to shake things up " the regulator treasury secretary paulson while mr paulson didnt address the question directly he did paint a rosy picture for future deals "i think the economic fundamentals are strong here and around the world " he said tennille tracy deal maker poll blame politicians it was a suspicious crowd at the wsj conference sure concern is escalating that an end to the deal
