boss talk tesco studies hard for u s debut ceo leahy sends teams to observe how americans shop see whats in their fridges london the chief executive of tesco plc terry leahy runs a retail chain thats twice the size of wal mart stores inc in the united kingdom and this fall even though the u s is considered over crowded with stores mr leahy plans to expand into wal marts home turf mr leahy has studied how americans shop and he is hoping his new design for smaller stores with fresher food will differentiate his stores from competitors to develop his model he sent tesco teams to live with american families one finding americans visit many stores theyre not one stop shoppers after all knowing customers is a big part of the way mr leahy runs tesco the worlds third largest grocery retailer by sales after wal mart and carrefour sa of france an unassuming year old with an accent colored by his hometown of liverpool mr leahy still likes sitting on customer panels and making unannounced store visits mr leahy made his mark at tesco by inventing clubcard a much copied loyalty program that gives shoppers points for buying at tesco and gives tesco valuable information on shoppers habits and tastes in his years as ceo tesco has grown into britains biggest food retailer with a market share that now dwarfs that of its nearest competitor wal marts asda chain its &# billion in annual sales comes from five different types of stores from small convenience shops to large superstores selling everything from baked beans to bicycles mr leahy says the different store sizes were necessary to meet britains tough zoning laws that flexibility he says now helps the retailer in foreign countries in the u s tesco will open only square foot stores which are smaller than typical u s supermarkets but bigger than u s convenience stores over tea on the shop floor mr leahy sat down with the wall street journal to discuss how tesco will woo u s shoppers how retailers can expand globally and how to make shoppers buy low energy light bulbs the wall street journal why is tesco setting up shop in the u s arent there enough grocery stores already mr leahy there is no shortage of stores but it is a place that rewards innovative retailers so if you do something different you get rewarded for it retailing returns in america are quite good by international standards wsj why didnt you just buy an american supermarket chain mr leahy we didnt want to buy an existing business because whats the point of going to america and just doing the same as everybody else there is already so much retail there so what we tried to do is turn a weakness we had that we had no presence in america into an advantage we can research and design the perfect store for the american consumer in the st century our team went over to live in the u s we stayed in peoples homes we went through their fridges we did all our research and were good at research wsj what did you find out mr leahy americans shop in more stores than for example the british shopper no one store gives them everything they want you would think it is the home of the one stop shop but its not i think they feel the one stop shop the big box retailer doesnt quite do it on the food quality the fresh food whereas here more people are content to do their whole food shopping in one place wsj you have been very secretive about the prototype for your american stores mr leahy we built the store inside a warehouse we claimed it was a movie set so that people would deliver all these goods and not think it was us we had to borrow products from other retailers because we hadnt at that stage developed any products we took ordinary people in and they really really liked it wsj isnt it daring to challenge wal mart on its home turf mr leahy wal mart is a great retailer but america is a big place the part of the market that we are addressing which is convenience is an underinvested part of the market and i think there is plenty of room in the market now wsj but wal mart also has smaller stores called neighborhood market isnt it competing for the same turf mr leahy no doubt it is but its a big segment a wal mart neighborhood market would be more their version of an american supermarket we would be approaching it from a slightly different angle wsj what are you most proud of in your u s stores mr leahy the tortilla is going to be pretty good and some of the wine will be pretty good were very proud of the wine wsj are you planning to become a national chain in the u s mr leahy the west coast of the u s is a big place california is virtually the same size as the u k and were starting in california arizona and nevada so there is a lot to get our teeth into but hopefully the format will have a wider appeal than that wsj of all the markets you have entered which one has been the toughest mr leahy japan is very challenging because its a very well defined society in terms of its value systems and theyre very confident consumers wsj carrefour has withdrawn from japan and wal mart is struggling there what mistakes are you trying to avoid mr leahy we didnt go in in a big way we could see it was complex again there we lived in japanese homes and spent three years researching japan we didnt bring our format in carrefour brought in the french hypermarket we bought a small business in the convenience sector which we thought suited shopping in japan people shop every day small is beautiful in japan western concepts of large big extra value dont work wsj even at home in britain tesco is famous for doing a lot of customer research with its loyalty program the clubcard mr leahy its an important technical part of an even more important philosophy which is to listen to customers but really listen many organizations say they listen but theyre very selective in what they allow themselves to hear the great thing about customers is that theyre very honest people wsj american retailers including kroger co now use dunnhumby the tesco owned company that runs clubcard to help with their loyalty programs has data mining become a side business for tesco mr leahy we had some techniques there that we felt other people were not using so we allowed dunnhumby to go and sell these services not just in retailing but in lots of consumer facing organizations clearly retailers are most interested because they know more about tesco but other organizations too that dunnhumby business is and will be very successful in the future wsj like wal mart you get attacked for being too dominant in the market how do you respond mr leahy its normal that people discuss how you do your business youve got to be prepared to engage in that discussion also you shouldnt concentrate on debating the negatives but come forward with some positive ideas there was a lot of debate about tesco as a good neighbor so we set out our community plan which was a set of initiatives about open sourcing nutritional labeling energy conservation and recycling which has been very well received actually people are very interested they will criticize you but they will be very open to your coming forward with positive suggestions wsj do you think consumers are really green or do they just think they are especially if they have to help pay for it mr leahy when we talk to consumers one of the big subjects is climate change consumers want to do something about it but the vast majority doesnt know what to do what does it mean for them do they change the car they drive do they recycle more do they change their light bulbs do they insulate their homes do they not fly there is no use knowing that you should use low energy light bulbs if there arent any or if the range doesnt fit your light fittings at home they say "ok we know about low energy light bulbs but theyre too expensive " so we halved the price of low energy light bulbs and once we do that of course what do our competitors do they reduce the price for low energy light bulbs so now low energy light bulbs are a no brainer for people not only do they last longer but theyre much cheaper wsj if american visitors wander into a tesco store in britain what product should they try mr leahy they should try our finest yogurt i know americans are so so about yogurt but they should try the finest yogurt they should try the finest rib eye beef and they should try a nice bottle of california viognier wsj you bought your wife mothers day flowers from tesco what else have you bought her mr leahy theyre great flowers i also bought her a birthday card from tesco
