whos really sicko toronto i havent seen sicko " says avril allen about the new michael moore documentary which advocates socialized medicine for the united states the film which has been widely viewed on the internet and which will officially open in the u s and canada on friday has been getting rave reviews but ms allen a lawyer has no plans to watch it shes just too busy preparing to file suit against ontarios provincial government about its health care system next month her client lindsay mccreith would have had to wait for four months just to get an mri and then months more to see a neurologist for his malignant brain tumor instead frustrated and ill the retired auto body shop owner traveled to buffalo n y for a lifesaving surgery now hes suing for the right to opt out of canadas government run health care which he considers dangerous ms allen figures the lawsuit has a fighting chance in the supreme court of canada ruled that "access to wait lists is not access to health care " striking down key quebec laws that prohibited private medicine and private health insurance in the u s house democrats voted for a bill in calling for single payer health care that idea collapsed with hillarycare and since then has existed on the fringes of the debate winning praise from academics and pressure groups but remaining largely out of the political discussion mr moores documentary intends to change that exposing millions to his argument that american health care is sick and socialized medicine is the cure its not simply that mr moore is wrong his grand tour of public health care systems misses the big story while he prescribes socialism market oriented reforms are percolating in cities from stockholm to saskatoon mr moore goes to london ontario where he notes that not a single patient has waited in the hospital emergency room more than minutes "its a fabulous system " a woman explains in britain he tours a hospital where patients marvel at their free care a patients husband explains "its not america " humorously mr moore finds a cashier dispensing money to patients for transportation in france a doctor explains the success of the health care system with the old marxist axiom "you pay according to your means and you receive according to your needs " its compelling material i know because born and raised in canada i used to believe in government run health care then i was mugged by reality consider for instance mr moores claim that ers dont overcrowd in canada a canadian government study recently found that only about half of patients are treated in a timely manner as defined by local medical and hospital associations "the research merely confirms anecdotal reports of interminable waits " reported a national newspaper while people in rural areas seem to fare better toronto patients receive care in four hours on average one in patients waits more than a dozen hours this problem hit close to home last year a relative living in winnipeg nearly died of a strangulated bowel while lying on a stretcher for five hours writhing in pain to get the needed ultrasound he was sent by ambulance to another hospital in britain the department of health recently acknowledged that one in eight patients wait more than a year for surgery around the time mr moore was putting the finishing touches on his documentary a hospital in sutton coldfield announced its new money saving linen policy housekeeping will no longer change the bed sheets between patients just turn them over frances system failed so spectacularly in the summer heat of that people died largely of dehydration hospitals stopped answering the phones and ambulance attendants told people to fend for themselves with such problems its not surprising that people are looking for alternatives private clinics some operating in a "gray zone" of the law are now opening in canada at a rate of about one per week canadian doctors once quiet on the issue of private health care elected brian day as president of their national association dr day is a leading critic of canadian medicare he opened a private surgery hospital and then challenged the government to shut it down "this is a country " dr day said by way of explanation "in which dogs can get a hip replacement in under a week and in which humans can wait two to three years " market reforms are catching on in britain too for six decades its socialist labour party scoffed at the very idea of private medicine dismissing it as "americanization " today labour favors privatization promising to triple the number of private sector surgical procedures provided within two years the labour government aspires to give patients a choice of four providers for surgeries at least one of them private and recently considered the contracting out of some primary care services perhaps even to american companies other european countries follow this same path in sweden after the latest privatizations the government will contract out some of stockholms primary care and of total health services including stockholms largest hospital beginning before the election of the new conservative chancellor germany enhanced insurance competition and turned state enterprises over to the private sector including the majority of public hospitals even in slovakia a former marxist country privatizations are actively debated under the weight of demographic shifts and strained by the limits of command and control economics government run health systems have turned out to be less than utopian the stories are the same dirty hospitals poor standards and difficulty accessing modern drugs and tests admittedly the recent market reforms are gradual and controversial but facts are facts the reforms are real and they represent a major trend in health care what does mr moores documentary say about that nothing dr gratzer a practicing physician licensed in canada and the u s and a senior fellow at the manhattan institute is the author of "the cure how capitalism can save american health care" encounter see related letters "letters to the editor canadian and u s health services lets compare the two" wsj july
