beleaguered immigration bill faces do or die vote washington the senate immigration bill was bleeding support from the left and right leaving president bush in danger of losing a closely fought vote this morning to end debate and move toward passage "were going to finish this legislation " vowed senate majority leader harry reid d nev and the white house worked into last night trying to salvage a narrow victory but more than a half dozen republicans and democrats were at risk of defecting and sen jeff sessions r ala a leading opponent predicted "there is a realistic chance the bill will fail " house republicans hurt the presidents cause this week by passing a party resolution disapproving of the senate bill the sour senate mood was captured by sen pete domenici r n m who had voted with the president tuesday to call up the bill but said he would oppose the cloture motion to limit debate this morning "this bill is toast " he said in an interview "this bill will never become law and consequently i dont see why i should continue down this path its not going to pass the house ever so were never going to get a bill so why go through this torture " a supermajority of votes is needed to invoke cloture and the administrations high water point tuesday was a loss of five votes would be fatal and apart from mr domenici sens christopher bond r mo and richard burr r n c are expected to now oppose cloture and sen judd gregg r n h remained uncommitted among democrats sens ben nelson of nebraska and jim webb of virginia are moving toward the "no" column also sens robert menendez of new jersey and jeff bingaman of new mexico more liberal labor democrats were up in the air because of family and labor provisions in the bill "its nip and tuck " said mr menendez and old colleagues from the house came over to visit on the senate floor urging him to keep the bill alive in hopes of improvements down the road "its over if it doesnt get out of the senate " said rep howard berman d calif mindful of the risks sen edward kennedy d mass urged that his colleagues "stand back a little bit and think through the significance of this vote " or "miss an incredible opportunity " the core measure like the immigration proposal that failed last year promises millions of undocumented workers now in the u s a path to citizenship conservatives have won tougher border security measures and new restrictions to try to stem the tide of immigrants who may follow this mass legalization but for many the process is seen as amnesty despite being long and arduous to build support this week &# billion was added to improve border security and further changes are expected to try to quell the conservative revolt but supporters yesterday had to contend with a series of challenges that opened old divisions over amnesty and could come back to haunt the bill today on a roll call for example the senate rejected a proposal by mr bond that would permit undocumented workers to legalize their status as workers in the u s but never gain permanent residency and a path to citizenship the missouri republican argued this would blunt complaints of amnesty in the bill but mr kennedy said the result would be a "permanent underclass" and "two americas " at the same time mr webb lost in his own effort to roll back the mass legalization so it would only apply to immigrants who have lived in the u s for four years and thus demonstrate roots in their communities to require less he said "violates the notion of fairness among a lot of people in this country thats one of the reasons we had such a strong surge of resentment toward the legislation as it now exists " but sen lindsey graham r s c still clung to the hope of saving the measure "there are a lot of people who know this is better policy than the current system " he said of the measure "there are a lot of people quietly hoping this thing passes and therell come a time where theyll have to not be quiet
