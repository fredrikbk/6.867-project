antidepressants and pregnancy new findings two major studies find no significant increase in birth defects with ssris for women who suffer from depression pregnancy can pose an agonizing dilemma keep taking antidepressants that might cause birth defects in your child or get off the drugs and risk other complications new research being published today wont settle the question but it is likely to comfort those who opt to stay on the most popular type of antidepressants during pregnancy the studies found elevated risk of birth defects associated with certain antidepressants but researchers termed the risks as small especially when balanced against the drugs potential benefits of reducing harm to depressed mothers and their babies the class of medication in question known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been under scrutiny since several studies linked the drugs to a slightly increased risk of birth defects including heart and lung problems that can be fatal ssris include pfizer inc s zoloft eli lilly &amp co s prozac and glaxosmithkline plcs paxil the two new studies published in the new england journal of medicine present often conflicting findings yet they agree that the risks posed by ssris are low taking issue with the prior research neither study found a connection between heart defects and ssris as a group "there appear to be risks but the risks are small and theyre limited to specific drugs and not to the entire class " said carol louik a professor at boston university and lead author of one of the studies funded by arms of the national institutes of health with added support from glaxo and sanofi aventis sa which is developing an antidepressant that wasnt under scrutiny the other study was by the federal centers for disease control and prevention both studies reported that mothers who took paxil or a generic form of the drug during pregnancy were at least twice as likely to have children with obstructions in the right ventricle of their heart a potentially fatal malformation still the defect is rare even in children exposed to ssris paxil already carries a warning that it may cause heart defects in fetuses a spokeswoman for glaxo said the company didnt plan to change its warning because the new research is "roughly in line with past studies " glaxo provided funding for the data analysis of dr louiks study but didnt have control of the results "since its their drug that were pointing a finger at i dont think we could really be accused of finding what they wanted us to find " dr louik said a study published last year in jama on antidepressant use during pregnancy came under scrutiny because its authors who warned against stopping medication had extensive ties to drug companies that make antidepressants and didnt initially disclose the conflict the results of such studies are crucial to drug makers which sold nearly &# billion of antidepressants last year according to data compiled by verispan llc most evidence suggests that women have become increasingly comfortable taking antidepressants while pregnant prompting researchers to redouble their efforts in identifying potential risks about four million babies are born in the u s each year its unclear exactly how many are exposed to their mothers ssri medication in the womb but an analysis of data from tennessees medicaid program published last week found a surprisingly large jump in antidepressant use during pregnancy from of pregnancies in to in that studys lead author william o cooper an associate professor at the vanderbilt university school of medicine said in an interview that the nationwide figure could be even higher because medicaid patients use antidepressants less than the general population since the risk of any birth defect from ssris appears small researchers say that women who become pregnant should also consider the potential harm of stopping their medication depressed mothers to be are more likely to experience stress eat poorly smoke or drink alcohol all of which can endanger the fetus in rare cases depression can lead to suicide or infanticide "it is a balance of risks to be determined by the woman in consultation with her health care provider " advised jennita reefhuis an epidemiologist for the cdc she cowrote one the papers which is part of the national birth defects prevention study together the two new studies examined nearly infants about two thirds of whom had birth defects researchers for both studies said they were more confident in the results on which they agreed and that their differences might be settled with further study the cdc study found a slightly increased risk of three birth defects that hadnt previously been associated with ssris as a class the risk of anencephaly or birth without a forebrain was times the rate than in women not exposed to the drugs craniosyntosis a premature fusion of the skull occurred at times the unexposed rate and ssri use was associated with times the incidence of omphalocele in which babies are born with organs outside the body these defects are rare in the general population for instance craniosynostosis occurs in about four per births according to the nih so the overall risk is still low the other study by dr louik associated neural tube defects like anencephaly only with paxil and its generic forms omphalocele was associated only with zoloft and its generic forms that study didnt find an association between craniosyntosis and any ssri the studies dont prove that ssris cause any of these defects and the researchers cautioned that since the defects are rare some associations could emerge by chance still scientists theorize that problems emerge from the primary function of ssris which is to increase levels of serotonin a hormone that affects mood serotonin is also believed to play a role in fetal development so larger amounts of the hormone could be the cause of birth defects it isnt clear why certain ssris would have different effects but each has a different chemical structure that could play a role christina chambers a university of california san diego epidemiologist who found a link between ssris and heart defects in a study published last year in the new england journal of medicine said the new research was "the best that we have in this country" but wont resolve the issue taking meds in one study of over infants  of mothers reported using ssri antidepressants in the period from month before to months after conception use of ssris as a group was not associated with significantly increased risks of heart defects or most other birth defects source the new england journal of medicine
