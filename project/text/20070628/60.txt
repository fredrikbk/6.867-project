mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q is there a way to print wirelessly from a digital camera to a printer a yes a number of digital cameras include bluetooth and a few even have wi fi these wireless technologies allow you to send your pictures to a wireless equipped printer over varying distances in some cases you can also use this wireless capability to transfer the pictures in the camera to a computer without the use of cables or the need to remove the memory card q i am a high school student and am buying a dell laptop for use during a semester in israel i plan to use the computer only for word processing watching videos listening to music viewing pictures and using the internet no gaming whatsoever does it matter whether i get intels core duo or core duo processors also would you recommend purchasing or gigabytes of memory a assuming you are on a budget i would suggest the core duo since the extra speed and power of the core duo wont make any significant difference in the kinds of tasks you will be performing however i would advise spending extra for gigabytes of memory if the computer comes equipped with the new windows vista operating system if you opt for the older windows xp operating system assuming its available on the model you choose you will be giving up some degree of security but you can also get away with just gigabyte of memory q is there a way to "authorize" the copy protected songs i bought from itunes so they play on a treo wx are there any cellphones that can play these songs a no you cant directly play copy protected songs you have purchased from itunes on a treo because apple hasnt licensed the decoding software to palm which makes the treo the only way to make them playable on your treo is via a laborious work around in which you burn the songs to cds on your computer then reimport them as nonprotected mp music files and manually input the artist and title data after that you could move them to the treo and play them there are only a few cellphones that can directly play copy protected music purchased from itunes one is the new iphone which comes out tomorrow from apple itself and contains a full blown ipod that can hold more than songs the others are a handful of motorola models which contain a version of itunes that can hold and play back up to copy protected songs
