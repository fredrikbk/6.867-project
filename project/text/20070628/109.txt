unhappy returns in italian crackdown tax cheats get the boot new tools help officials find chronic evaders ending a vicious cycle rome for years many italians from small town shopkeepers to well heeled milanese businessmen had a strategy for dealing with the countrys notoriously high tariffs they cheated on their taxes while many citizens and companies profited from the ruse they nearly bankrupted the state in the process now the government is waging war on tax evasion a national epidemic that has weakened the countrys ability to balance its budget fund new investment and create a stable business climate the government of prime minister romano prodi estimates that unpaid taxes including income from the countrys sizable black market economy are equal to of italys gross domestic product thats more than the country spends on pensions and health care combined italys public debt is a staggering of its gdp and is the third largest national debt pile after japan and the u s the countrys sovereign debt rating has faced three downgrades in the past four years the result is a smoke screen society in which people live far better than what their reported income would suggest only of italians claim to earn more than euros or about &# a year yet italy is the no market for luxury swiss watches after the u s and hong kong a weak italian political system has long worked like a gas pedal for tax evasion accelerating an already chronic problem a succession of unstable spendthrift governments has been unable to cut the countrys ballooning debt desperate for new revenue the government has imposed taxes on everything from pornography to bingo games the upshot says giacomo vaciago an economics professor at milans catholic university is a "vicious cycle the government hikes taxes people evade more " official statistics offer only hints about who might be stashing funds away italian restaurant owners declare an annual average income of just euros or &# less than schoolteachers who are among the worst paid in europe according to data from italys tax collection agency jewelry store owners declare an average of euros less than the yearly rent on a small apartment in milan to raise more revenue mr prodi has launched a national crackdown on tax dodging which he said had become so pervasive in italy as to be "incompatible with democracy " among the new measures making it easier for tax authorities to peek into bank accounts limiting cash transactions for payments of only euros or less and harsher penalties for businesses that fail to issue receipts to customers theres a lot riding on the initiative mr prodi has pledged to cut the countrys deficit to of gdp this year from last year more than a quarter of the new funds or billion euros he promises will come from smoking out tax cheats to lead the charge mr prodi has selected deputy finance minister vincenzo visco a cigar chomping tax hawk nicknamed "dracula" by political opponents one morning in february agents from italys tax police the guardia di finanza stormed into an elegant apartment building in central milan and arrested alberico cetti serbelloni a businessman descended from italian nobility he ran a company that sold access to an online art catalogue database police suspected it was a front for a massive tax cheating operation in the arrest warrant prosecutors claim that mr cetti serbelloni ran an intricate european wide scheme he sold licenses to access the database to several dozen companies in and around milan police claim these companies would then resell the licenses to firms in switzerland controlled by mr cetti serbelloni the resale to foreign companies allowed the milan firms to qualify for a rebate on italys value added tax with the rebate the companies significantly slashed their tax burden and would give mr cetti serbelloni half of the money they effectively pocketed the alleged scheme which authorities say allowed mr cetti serbelloni and others to evade some million euros in taxes helped provide the year old mr cetti serbelloni with a plush lifestyle say police he drove a ferrari and was building a golf resort in tuscany "were still finding bogus transactions even months after his arrest " says capt salvatore la bella the tax police officer who led the investigation after spending three months in jail mr cetti serbelloni is now waiting for a judge to rule on whether his case should proceed to trial his lawyer insists his client ran a legitimate business though the government claims it recouped billion euros in unpaid taxes last year not all economists are convinced it can keep up that pace the organization for economic cooperation and development warned in may that italy is unlikely to make its deficit target because the government is too optimistic about its tax crusade even if it misses some targets the government hopes to chip away at a widely accepted practice in italian society eluding the tax man is like an inverted civic duty in italy from the hairdresser who doesnt issue a receipt to the notary who signs off on a phony real estate sale italian citizens often feel compelled to shield one another from a state they find at once invasive and inefficient "there is solidarity among tax evaders " explains beppe severgnini a social commentator and author of "bella figura " a book about italians "in america if you cheat on your taxes your neighbors wont talk to you in italy theyll ask you how you did it " italys guardia di finanza act as a sort of mobile financial crimes unit the strong corps a division of the countrys law enforcement patrol customs at the border carry out random checks on businesses to see if financial records are in order and conduct investigations into fraud tax evasion and securities law violations several years ago the tax police launched a campaign to get people to anonymously report tax cheats via a toll free number the move was roundly criticized in newspapers as something that tried to turn citizens into spies many celebrities from tenor luciano pavarotti to olympic gold medal skier alberto tomba have been caught evading taxes and were forced to pay fines for more than a decade billionaire former prime minister silvio berlusconi who controls a vast media empire has been rung up on various charges such as bribing tax police false bookkeeping and tax evasion on some of the charges he was acquitted on others lower court convictions were either overturned or the statute of limitations expired he currently awaits another tax evasion trial romes attempts to clamp down on tax evasion are part of a broader ill afflicting europe tax rates on the continent have swelled over the past half century as governments struggle to finance a costly social welfare system that many citizens feel is their birthright according to the oecd in the most recent year for which data is available the average tax burden in the european union was of gdp total fiscal pressure in the u s by contrast was and has been decreasing in recent years some historians claim that tax evasion in italy has ancient origins from the fall of the roman empire to the establishment of modern italy in italy was occupied by arabs austrians french and spanish among italians dodging taxes constituted a sort of social resistance after world war ii italy needed to rebuild its shattered and impoverished nation as the economy started to take off in the s and s the government turned a blind eye to tax evasion for fear that a crackdown would cripple growth mr visco the governments point man on tax evasion believes theres also a cultural explanation "were individualistic and we like to bend the rules " he said "we try to get around waiting in lines or paying the bus fare if we can get away with it " mr berlusconi recognized voters frustrations with high taxes and glossed over the national habit of evading them in a speech before the tax police several years ago he said italians shouldnt "feel guilty" about cheating if their taxes were too high while prime minister mr berlusconi also passed numerous amnesties that allowed tax cheats to avoid penalties by paying a small fine yet in some quarters of the business community there are signs that a long held tolerance for tax evasion is waning the confindustria the powerful association of italys largest companies for years resented any effort to crack down on tax evasion considering it just one more form of government interference confindustria now recognizes that rampant tax evasion is contributing to a widening imbalance within business and society those hit hardest are salaried employees of large companies confindustrias largest stakeholders because taxes are directly subtracted from their paychecks so they cant shirk them consequently they are bearing a heavier burden because they pick up the tab for those who dont pay this tax disparity can put large companies at a disadvantage though italian businesses offer their workers contracts with generous welfare benefits its often difficult for them to compete on salary workers might make more if they were self employed and not paying taxes in choosing mr visco a silver haired economics professor who also served in past governments mr prodi knew he had a determined ally "either we fix this or we end up like argentina " said mr visco referring to the latin american countrys default on its debts in when mr visco last year started looking for unpaid taxes it was difficult to even know where to begin since the italian economy is mainly made up of small family owned businesses the difference between business and individual taxpayers is hazy so he decided to go after both among the key problems half of italian companies claim either to be in the red or just break even among those that declare a profit the vast majority declare an income of less than euros "if thats the case i dont understand why theyre in business " snickered mr visco one of mr viscos first measures was allowing tax police to close any store for up to six months if it was caught not issuing receipts random checks ordered by mr visco showed that shop owners frequently didnt give customers receipts after a purchase pocketing the money directly instead of counting it as taxable sales during a check in one small northern town trentino san valentino tax police found that of cafes and of clothing stores failed to issue receipts owners of small businesses are enraged by mr viscos directive "we dont deserve this sort of harassment " says mauro bussoni deputy director of the italian association of small and medium size companies the penalty he says "is barbaric " many small business associations insist the government is blowing the problem out of proportion "once upon a time maybe you could be more lets say elastic " says tullio galli who heads a food vendors trade association "thats over " at the heart of business owners complaints is frustration with an unwieldy rule tax code the system is paper heavy requiring even small shopkeepers to retain piles of invoices and bills "the other day the tax police came in and wanted me to prove i had paid my garbage tax every month between and " says mauro collucci owner of a corner eyeglass shop in downtown rome "they gave me days to find the receipts " he says he was able to produce them government officials admit that the tax code itself is a large part of the problem with so much paper information is scattered everywhere making it relatively easy for a supplier and a buyer to report only a portion of their business officially while doing the rest off the books tax officials have so many receipts to go through that its easy to lose track as a result some of mr viscos attention is also devoted to uniting different tax collection databases under one roof rossella orlandi is part of this effort as one of the tax authoritys top investigators in rome she spends much of her time hunched over a computer screen cross checking data that doesnt seem to add up mr visco has tried to beef up the tax authoritys computer resources so ms orlandi now can check peoples income declarations against car or home purchases the findings often set off alarm bells for example there are people in italy who declare incomes of less than euros a year but who drive cars worth more than euros "the vehicle registration database is a gold mine " smiles ms orlandi another thing she looks for multiple electricity bills registered under one name thats a clue that a landlord is renting out apartments but not declaring the income last year tax police in genoa closed in on a year old man who had been renting apartments but hadnt declared more than euros in rental income over several years the tax police spent months secretly interviewing his tenants and combing through bank records when they finally confronted him with the evidence "he just shrugged " says capt filippo capineri even amid the current crackdown tax police complain they are outgunned court cases against tax evaders take years to wind their way through italys burdened justice system giving defendants time to sell assets and move their wealth out of reach of the authorities sentences almost never include jail time and tax police have limited ability to freeze assets as luca cordero di montezemolo chairman of fiat spa and confindustria president describes it "italy is a like a boat in which half the people are pulling the oars while the other half are kicking back enjoying the ride "
