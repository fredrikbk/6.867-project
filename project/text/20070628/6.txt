in a narrow hallway of hill haven senior citizen nursing home a half dozen other residents many with dementia and most four to six decades older sit nearby around them a maintenance worker mops the linoleum floor ronnie has lived in this single story red brick building since she was years old the only child among elders her mother iris rivera smith has tried unsuccessfully for years to get the financial help she would need to bring her daughter home thousands of other children are growing up in nursing homes across the country many for the same reason as ronnie federal disability insurance guarantees nursing home care for the disabled but in many states its coverage isnt enough to let those people children included live at home even when the cost to taxpayers and the strain on families is often much lower born legally blind with club feet and cerebral palsy ronnie cant walk or speak she cant feed or dress herself but she responds to touch smells and sounds pounding her chest with her right hand and laughing when happy latin music the outdoors and her mothers voice make her happy until five years ago ronnie lived at home and went to school with other developmentally disabled children then she had severe respiratory problems her lungs filled with fluid and she almost died doctors told her parents that ronnie should go to a nursing home to receive hour care for the few weeks she was expected to live ronnie outlived expectations and remains here more than miles from her home she doesnt go to school her world consists largely of the homes long corridors its atrium with a big screen tv and her room with its cinder block walls painted blue about children nationwide live in nursing homes according to medicaid a small often hidden population that has wound up in these incongruous settings often against their parents wishes while some of the homes cater to children many are traditional facilities designed for the aged their staff may dote on young residents but are often more familiar with geriatrics and dementia visits to family may be limited nursing facilities often give away residents beds if they spend more than nights a year away from the home "any child in a nursing home is so outrageous it offends the sensibilities " says ruby moore executive director of the nonprofit georgia advocacy office a federally chartered group that supports the disabled but for these families there is often no alternative parents may seek help after their disabled child suffers a life threatening emergency or a divorce leaves a single working parent without time or resources for child care depending on what institutions are located near the family a child may be sent to a group home a state or private school or often in the case of the most severe disabilities to a nursing home a total of about children are in out of home facilities across the country home care isnt an option for many parents medicaid the federal state program that insures people with low income or disabilities automatically pays for nursing homes its up to individual states to decide how much they will pay for in home services few states fund the level of skilled care such patients require leaving parents with a burden that can run tens of thousands of dollars annually nationwide there also arent enough home care workers nurses and therapists to serve these families about developmentally disabled americans of all ages are on waiting lists for home and community care services when home care is available it typically costs taxpayers less georgia spends about &# a year for each resident in institutional care which includes nursing homes home and community care by comparison costs about &# a year according to the university of minnesotas research and training center on community living "we simply dont do enough to support families to care for their children with significant disabilities at home " says eric jacobson executive director of the georgia governors council on developmental disabilities to begin to address the issue last year georgias state legislature committed &# million to programs for the disabled including a plan to move more than institutionalized children including in nursing homes back to their families in the meantime ms rivera smith years old makes the four hour round trip to hill haven at least once a month in between working and caring for a young grandson she brings elmo dolls dollar store hair ribbons and handmade bibs embroidered with hearts on ronnies birthday ms rivera smith brought her daughter home to eat chocolate cake with her cousins and four older siblings ronnie wore a new red dress the federal centers for disease control and prevention has called for all children with disabilities to be out of "congregate settings" four or more people with disabilities by budgets for home care have grown federal and state spending for home and community based services the bulk of it through medicaid increased to &# billion in fiscal nearly tripling the amount spent in spending on institutional care over the same period was up to &# billion "the bush administration has been very supportive of home care " says mary kahn a spokeswoman for the centers for medicare &amp medicaid services "it is particularly poignant when a young child is involved " yet even as home care spending has increased the population of institutionalized children has remained steady in recent years in more than developmentally disabled americans under the age of lived in congregate care facilities after a national movement away from institutional care the number dropped to in only to edge up to the current according to the university of minnesota community living center the needs of these children vary some have survived a traumatic injury such as a near drowning and live on a ventilator responding with their eyes to touch and sound those with severe mental retardation often require help to dress and eat but dont require involved medical care others have physical disabilities but a mind that leaves them aware of their setting and their singularity "compared to the other residents i was healthier physically and mentally " says danny shirey who has muscular dystrophy and was sent to a columbus ohio geriatric nursing facility when he was nine in his six years there he would roam the halls in his electric wheelchair help older people play bingo and euchre or guide disoriented patients to their rooms he looked forward to monthly visits from his family who lived in pittsburgh the facilitys occupancy rules made going home for an overnight visit rare "there has to be a better alternative " says mr shirey who received some tutoring during his nursing home stay and has attended school he now consults with groups trying to improve options for children with developmental disabilities "i was far away from my family i remember crying myself to sleep many nights " on nights when judy zifka is feeling particularly lonely she will drive to providence child center in portland ore and climb into bed with her year old daughter andrea they listen to billy idol dave matthews or jazz her daughter will sometimes hum the only sound she makes born seemingly healthy andrea zifka had her first seizure at three months doctors performed an mri and found her brain lacked the natural folds that control the ability to speak chew move or register emotion by crying or laughing though profoundly disabled andrea wasnt eligible for medicaid because she lived at home and her father an electrician was earning &# a year putting them above oregons poverty line her fathers private insurance covered hospital stays but wouldnt pay for in home nursing care therapists or all the medical equipment andrea needed for those with private insurance out of pocket expenses for prescriptions lifts wheelchairs and other equipment can run more than &# a year by age andrea had lost all purposeful movement ms zifka dressed bathed and turned her to prevent bed sores as her energy and sympathy went to andrea her marriage suffered after carrying her pound daughter up and down steps she developed rheumatoid arthritis in her spine her husband lance zifka worked on construction projects often out of town "i just couldnt guarantee that i would be working close to home and i could tell she couldnt lift her anymore " he says "it just wasnt going to work " the closest residential option was providence three hours away from the familys home in bend ore the family had sent andrea to the nonprofit facility one of the nations pediatric nursing homes for short term care in the summer when mr zifka heard it had a long term bed available he requested it for andrea "i felt like i totally failed my daughter " says ms zifka "id wake in the middle of the night come out in the living room and cry " she visited andrea every two weeks from bend making the six hour trip in one day after several months andreas seizures began intensifying "i believe she was dying of loneliness over there " her mother says ms zifka rented a room in portland so she could spend two weeks a month with her daughter she spends the other two weeks with her husband and son while shes away ms zifka asks providences staff to play her daughter cds the zifkas made on them andrea can hear her parents reading fairy tales andrea has been there two years ms zifka says shes glad her daughter is with her peers not at a nursing home geared to older people andrea goes to school providences pediatric facility hosts proms and takes the children to malls and horseback riding in a recent production of "the wizard of oz " andrea was glinda the good witch pushed across the stage in a chair ms zifka says she knew they would eventually need someone to care for andrea she just didnt expect it so soon "it was wrong that i had to make the choice that i did " she says "it was wrong that the only way i could get help was to send her away " medicaid pays providence center about &# a year for each child says administrator pat budo average home and community based spending for someone such as andrea with developmental disabilities and extensive health care needs is about &# "it is crazy " ms budo says "this child could be kept at home at much lower costs " which services medicaid covers and whom it covers vary by state the centers for medicare &amp medicaid services pays a percentage of each states total costs often footing a higher share of needier states bills states determine who is eligible for the aid with some covering only those below the poverty line and others paying for all residents with certain disabilities this year oregon passed legislation to allow all severely disabled children living at home to get medicaid coverage regardless of family income it would also help the children currently in the states nursing homes such as andrea zifka to move home the new policy begins jan it is an involved process agencies must line up nursing care therapy and schooling homes may need wheelchair ramps or hoists to lift children out of bed and there are other more delicate issues parents may be reluctant to relinquish the safety net of hour paid care some argue that certain children are so medically fragile that there will always be a need for institutional care laurie
