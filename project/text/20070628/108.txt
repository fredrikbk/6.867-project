the fed and liquidity home builders mortgage lenders and borrowers and now wall street are all taking their lumps in the housing and subprime loan blowoff and fair enough thats capitalism the one body that has so far escaped any scrutiny however is the institution that started it all with its mistakes in monetary policy the federal reserve with the feds open market committee meeting this week its a good time to revisit recent monetary history and its role in our current credit market upheavals all the more so because there are signs that the same lending excesses now being exposed in housing credit are also taking place in the high yield and emerging market arenas the fed doesnt force consenting adults to make or accept bad loans but it can create a financial environment of excess liquidity and asset inflation that contributes to credit excesses of the kind now coming acropper the nearby chart see accompanying illustration wsj june from economist arthur laffer offers an instructive summary of recent monetary history it compares actual prices as measured by spot commodity prices to the fed funds rate which is a rough proxy for tighter or looser monetary policy the left side of the chart records the great inflation of the late s and the feds attempts to break it the right side shows what weve been living through this decade with soaring commodity prices amid historically low interest rates weve been writing since at least that the two are related and worrisome in june the fed cut its target fed funds rate to an extraordinarily low and kept it there for a year even when it began to tighten again the fed did so very gradually causing us to write in june that "the danger with gradualism" is that "it risks always being behind the inflation curve " there was no inflation evident at the time but monetary policy works with a lag and it showed up later most notably in the housing asset inflation of and everybody loved that bubble while it lasted including some lenders who found increasingly creative ways to lend to increasingly unreliable borrowers we are now living with the aftermath of that mistake however amid the current housing washout that has lasted a year already and with probably more financial casualties to come neither former fed chairman alan greenspan nor successor ben bernanke has acknowledged the feds role in creating this housing bubble but last autumn richard fisher president of the dallas fed offered a kind of proxy mea culpa when he noted that "in retrospect the real fed funds rate turned out to be lower than what was deemed appropriate at the time and was held lower longer than it should have been " which brings us to the current moment with the fed having held fed funds at for a year and spot commodity prices hitting the highs in mr laffers chart meanwhile the world continues to be awash in "liquidity " the buzz word for lots of money at low prices private equity firms have to turn money away while hedge funds are so flush theyre taking flyers on the likes of pakistan the question is whether we are in a genuine global boom or another fed inspired monetary bubble our view is that its some of both we should point out that plenty of smart people say boom including our friend mr laffer he watches the monetary base and gives the fed high marks for controlling its growth the "velocity" of money is soaring as the world demands more of it he says so there is no inflation threat as for rising commodity prices thats due to a rise in "relative" prices caused by the global boom that is creating new and unprecedented demand for oil metals and even corn meanwhile the u s measure of "core" inflation sans food and energy has been falling in recent months fed governor kevin warsh gave a speech in march in which he defined liquidity in part as investor "confidence " rapid growth in india and china a surge in global savings and better policy decisions are all healthy reasons for the liquidity surge so whats to worry about well actual prices for one thing the dollar remains weak and inflation is undeniable in such dollar bloc nations as china kuwait recently dropped its longtime dollar peg to stop importing inflation as for the u s eliminating food and energy from official inflation measures might console the fed but it doesnt matter much to consumers paying more for gas groceries and health care the actual price level continues to rise we pay attention more to real current prices than to mr laffers money supply figures which are impossible to measure with any certainty in a world of floating exchange rates the bond market has also backed up in recent weeks with the year note climbing or so basis points as investors anticipate stronger growth and shed their illusions about fed rate cuts all indications are that the fed will keep its target fed funds rate today while perhaps fiddling with its accompanying policy "guidance " wed feel better however if the governors leaned toward protecting the dollar and curbing any credit excesses built on expectations of future dollar inflation around the world for that matter the fed would have done better to keep raising rates a year ago that might have deterred some of the high yield credit risks that mr warsh warned about in a follow up "liquidity" speech in london earlier this month were all for "open mouth" fed operations when the need arises but the feds main obligation is to maintain price stability no one wants a repeat of the subprime housing bust in the high yield debt business
