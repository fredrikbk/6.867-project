start ups make inroads with googles work force as google inc exploded into a company of more than employees attracting a million resumes a year the internet giant rarely lost staff to start ups or had prospective workers turn down job offers now though googles magnetic pull on top silicon valley talent is showing signs of weakening take justin rosenstein years old a google employee since march who invented its web site building service page creator he joined social networking start up facebook inc last month as a senior software engineer and says googles past success in hiring entrepreneurial people helps explain why its seeing some of those people leave as it becomes larger "that same caliber of people is naturally going to consider carefully whether its at google or somewhere else that they have the most potential to do big things and do them quickly " google had more than six times the number of workers at the end of the first quarter than it had at the same point in which some former employees say tends to slow decision making and make it harder for individuals to feel like theyre having an impact another big consideration some highly lucrative stock options are beginning to finish vesting for thousands of employees brought on during a big google hiring spree in and lessening the financial incentives to stay options granted during have average exercise prices as low as cents compared with the &# price in trading at p m on the nasdaq market yesterday on top of all this a new generation of internet start ups has matured enough to attract top technical talent and offer a real possibility of riches from a stock offering or sale to a bigger company in contrast googles shares hit a record level this week suggesting the stock simply doesnt offer the same potential gains it once did the concentration of many of the start ups within a few miles of googles headquarters which google itself has exploited in the past can make poaching staff a faster and easier pursuit but google people operations vice president laszlo bock says the companys staff attrition rate has remained "pretty steady" in recent years at under and the rate at which google job offers are accepted is similarly stable approaching or higher depending on the position being filled he chalks any perception that start ups are gaining on google in recruiting to the fact that the internet giant is hiring many more people than in the past with more staff and more hiring and steady attrition and acceptance rates in absolute terms there are more people snubbing google for start ups he says "so the start ups experience it as a change while from our perspective there hasnt been much of a change " adds mr bock still mr bock says google executives spend a lot of time thinking about how to attract and retain top talent as the company grows in size "we dont want to become a victim of our own success were aware of that risk " he says cautionary tales abound as a string of other technology companies from microsoft corp during the dot com boom to more recently yahoo inc and ebay inc has seen hiring and retention challenges accompany massive growth its unclear whether the latest departures will have any impact on googles performance down the line but the company acknowledges that creative and entrepreneurial people are the core of its success thats one reason google lavishes them with extravagant free food and other perks "if we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or retaining or motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively " google has acknowledged in regulatory filings facebook mr rosensteins new employer is one company that professes having an easier time competing with google for staff co founder and engineering vice president dustin moskovitz says the person start up has managed to hire out of the roughly engineers who had rival job offers from google since the beginning of the year an improvement on the past "there are lot of people at google who are talking about leaving now and what they want to do next " says mr moskovitz mr rosenstein says he still loves google but was attracted enough by the "huge potential upside" at facebook and other factors to leave "a lot of value on the table" in stock options that had yet to vest when he jumped after leaving he posted a note online for friends describing facebook as "the google of yesterday the microsoft of long ago " similar factors are at play in other google departures suranga chandratillake chief executive of video search startup blinkx just hired a young engineer from google "google was a big draw for exactly the sort of people we looked for a year ago and that seems less the case now " he says vanessa fox a two year google veteran who created a service called webmaster central to help sites better manage their inclusion in search results recently left the company and will begin working at online real estate start up zillow com next month two other google defectors bret taylor and jim norris started yesterday at venture capital firm benchmark capital as entrepreneurs in residence and are working on their own internet start up idea two of the engineers who created the google maps service they last year received the prestigious google founders award for their work "google has grown to be a larger company now so i wanted to find our own destiny " says mr taylor who joined google in march and estimates his net worth at under &# million bismarck lepe is starting an interactive video company called ooyala inc with two other former google employees "we decided even google such an innovative company wasnt taking an innovative approach at solving" a video related problem they were working on says mr lepe a four year google veteran he began thinking about leaving when his initial options grant was about to vest completely in march after four years "google is losing a number of its very talented individuals some because theyre frustrated and some because theyre burned out " mr lepe adds he predicts any flow of staff out of google will eventually slow as the company finds ways to stem it and the wave of cheap options vesting passes next year googles mr bock though says vesting stock options have "not been in our experience a huge driver of people leaving " in addition he says that the company is taking measures to try to keep employees satisfied google has begun experimenting with the creation of offsite "skunkworks" operations to develop cutting edge products and separating out parts of the business to be run as more autonomous units within the company its trying to distribute authority for activities such as hiring and deal making farther down in the organization like other big companies google has also established a training program for employees it identifies as having leadership potential but mr lepe says google in the meantime has lost currency with young engineering recruits "they just assume google is now the borg now the man " says mr lepe conjuring groupthink bogeymen from s radicalism to "star trek the next generation " mr bock points out that the company is on track to receive more
