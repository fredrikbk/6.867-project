new choices in flat panels perplex shoppers buying a flat panel television used to be an easy decision the sets were straightforward devices that simply showed tv programs not this summer shoppers looking for a new flat panel tv will increasingly be faced with a confusing array of choices in the past two years electronics makers from hewlett packard co to lg electronics inc have added new bells and whistles to their flat panel tvs some of the tv sets now come with embedded technologies that help connect to wireless home networks or internet videos others now come with built in digital video recorders and in the next few months a new wave of options will hit retail floors in august hewlett packard is launching inch and inch versions of its liquid crystal display tvs that come with the ability to connect wirelessly to a home network the new sets dubbed the mediasmart tvs can display those movies music or photos stored on a personal computer in the network later this year samsung electronics co the largest u s lcd flat panel tv seller by shipments also will launch a wireless flat panel plasma tv that for the first time comes with a separate media hub that can be stored within

panels next year for consumers the new generation of flat panels is a step closer to the electronics industrys holy grail a connected tv that can not only play television programming but also download films music and videos from the internet a device that can meld all those functions is likely to be a winner in consumers living rooms where many tech companies are trying to gain a toehold in march for instance apple inc released apple tv a device that allows users to beam movies television shows and music purchased through apples itunes store on the internet to their tvs and stereos many of these new tvs may also be highly frustrating for consumers paul odonovan an analyst for gartner inc a market research firm warns that the market is in its early days for networking technologies since such technology in tvs isnt standardized customers who buy the devices may get somewhat limited features that arent compatible with other gadgets in the home for example h ps tvs can play music loaded from cds into itunes but they cant play music downloaded from apples itunes store because that music is encoded with protective software also the new flat panels have limited online content they dont technically allow users to surf the internet using their tv instead they connect users to an interface with videos or movies from specific providers the tv maker has made deals with such as cinemanow inc or yahoo inc still the new accoutrements are being added to flat panels as tv makers try to stave off rapid price declines in the industry the declines are being caused by the increasing
