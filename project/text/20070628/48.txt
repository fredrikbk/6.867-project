h ps emerging task deter forgeries tailored projects abroad aim to stem fraudulent documents bangalore india as anyone who does business in india knows you cant get very far without the right piece of paper that makes forgery a big problem and one of the most common types of fraud at a research and development laboratory here in indias tech hub hewlett packard co is researching a way of marking new paper documents with a bar code that helps prevent forgeries "trusted hardcopy " h ps internal name for the project is one of several innovations that are part of a big push by the personal computer maker to devise products for specific markets that will also have broader use the aim to help capture what it calls its "next billion customers" a reference to massive emerging markets such as india and china with trusted hardcopy which is just one of the tailored efforts rather than requiring holograms or watermarked paper the system uses equipment no more complicated than some software a scanner and a computer the bar code is designed to act like a digital signature "thus bringing network level security to the world of paper " says h p in a company document h p envisages government entities public offices and companies as potential users such as for the registration of land ownership "india is one of the largest growing markets for h p " says anjaneyulu kuchibhotla a department director at h p labs india though he adds that india is "starting from a fairly low it base " the asian pacific region which includes india and china accounted for &# billion of h ps total revenue of &# billion for the three months ended april but with an increase of over the year earlier period the asian pacific region was the companys fastest growing geographical area h p based in palo alto calif declined to provide results just for india indias technology industry is expected to grow dramatically in coming years in indias tech industry is likely to be worth more than &# billion in annual revenue says research and consulting firm idc india ltd up from &# billion in now theres a computer for only one in every people a total of million idc says but that is expected to grow significantly as indias economy expands at an annual clip of about already h p is indias biggest seller of pcs in terms of units sold with a market share according to idc ahead of indias hcl technologies ltd which has and chinas lenovo group ltd with h p employs more than people in india its second largest single nation work force after the u s with a business that spans areas including outsourcing manufacturing technology services and customer support by focusing its research in india as well as at its labs in russia china and elsewhere h p aims to invent products that fit a particular local need but can also be used in other markets the time from conception to market can be as long as three to five years some of them might never see the light of day "not everything we work on makes it to a product but the ones that do tend to have a very significant impact " says ajay gupta the director of h p labs india in an email at the companys lab in beijing h p is researching new databases that can handle very large amounts of information h p says some of its biggest clients in terms of the number of transactions and customers are in the worlds most populous nation and the company is working with them to build information systems large enough to handle that given the huge number of people in india the results of the research could have application here h p says h ps indian labs in downtown bangalore are staffed with employees with advanced degrees in computer science and engineering the majority of employees are of indian origin rooms are named after scientists such as galileo and marconi h p reckons that the potential market in india those who may buy computers or are customers of companies that use computers could number million yet india also is famously bureaucratic and forms ridden so the company has focused some of its efforts on trying to bridge the gap between tech and paper "we sort of assume that papers not going to go away " said mr kuchibhotla "and we say that if papers not going to go away what technology do you need to bridge whats happening in the paper world with whats happening in the it world " h ps goal was to make a product that allowed paper to be read by a machine and secure against forgery an early version of trusted hardcopy puts a bar code on paper that is similar to the bar codes on groceries it contains the data that are also printed on the document and can be read by a scanner it also encodes the data in the bar code to prevent tampering because the bar code contains the authentic data any changes to the document should be identifiable the content of the bar codes cant be modified the bar code is printed at the bottom of a page of regular size copier paper in about six square inches another product h p is developing is "tvprintcast " which sends data over television networks a set top box receives the data and the consumer can then print out the information tv penetration in india is far higher than computers in india had million tv viewers compared with million internet users the product would mean for instance that while watching a cooking program the recipes featured could be broadcast and printed out h p isnt the only one in the running an india company chennai based novatium solutions pvt ltd is already selling a product called nova nettv which allows desktop computing
