game of buyout bingo may be ending investors stop guessing which targets peer will be next player up when dollar general corp received a nearly &# billion buyout offer in early march investors scooped up shares in other discount retailers and when slm corp the student loan provider better known as sallie mae announced in april that it would be bought out for &# billion bonds issued by countrywide financial corp and cit group inc sold off on fears that they too could become takeout targets bond holders typically disdain buyouts because they add new debt to companies potentially straining their finances and credit standing for the past year similar jumps and falls have occurred in sectors ranging from consumer goods companies to industrial groups to technology companies as investors tried to game which companies would get taken out next in the great private equity led buyout wave once a company became a buyout target investors would look to peers screening them in a search for companies with high stable cash flows and low debt levels as potential candidates for a buyout they would then buy these stocks or sell their bonds in the hope of an acquisition led payoff now investors are wondering if the game of buyout bingo will soon come to an end as the investors who purchase the debt that fuels such takeovers begin to balk at some of the riskier deals debt investors already shaken by problems in the mortgage market grew increasingly nervous after ahold nvs u s foodservice the second largest food service distributor in the u s was forced tuesday to postpone bond and loan deals for its &# billion sale dollar general itself is in the spotlight as the buyout firms looking to take it private are expected today to try to place bond offerings that will help finance the deal these debt market problems could render moot the seemingly endless stream of lists that have been generated in a bid to identify companies that could be the next takeout target in march for example goldman sachs in a report pointed out stocks based on those with the highest potential internal rate of return top targets included performance food group co and supervalu inc earlier this month ubs came up with a model for tech buyout candidates that highlighted unisys corp and cgi group among others the premise for much of the chatter was that no company no matter how big was off limits from a potential buyout because of the seemingly endless appetite for the debt funding these deals with the use of borrowed money or leverage buyout firms had been able to dramatically increase the amount they could pay for a company thats changing "i know theres been talk about &# billion and &# billion deal sizes but thats probably not on the table anymore " said gregory peters head of credit strategy at morgan stanley from now on "buying a company at higher leverage multiples and expecting to easily finance it through the debt markets is going to be much more heroic " the frequent chatter about large retailers such as sears holding corp or best buy co inc as leveraged buyout targets is likely to fade according to some investment bankers ditto for technology companies and utilities where the buyouts txu corp and freescale semiconductor inc had prompted takeover speculation in those industries one consequence of the tightening by banks is that "strategic" buyers may have an advantage for the past couple of years the private equity firms have been kings of the takeover game and companies have been unable to compete with their rich cash bids now sellers may be more willing to accept stock swap deals from rival companies to be sure investors arent expecting the buyout boom to end outright nor will stocks that have been pushed up by buyout speculation likely sell off overnight strategists said "theres about &# billion of uninvested and unlevered private equity money thats available to be invested " said david kostin managing director for u s portfolio strategy at goldman sachs "will private equity money still be looking for candidates yes that will still be an important theme in the market " with debt investors casting a more jaundiced eye on the wave of paper coming their way private equity firms will face new choices in how they approach deals the firms could lower their own expectations for the rate of return theyll generate they could put up more of their own money so that transactions wouldnt rely on so much borrowed money or leverage finally private equity firms could pull in their horns a bit offering less lofty prices strategists expect the last option to be the most likely given that private equity firms across the board will likely face the same debt market constraints in some cases a combination of all three options may take place depending on the size and financial muscle of the private equity buyer and the relative lure of the company being acquired scott patterson contributed to this article
