investors look for fed to calm inflation fears expectations help stocks bonds recover from recent turbulence nervous investors are looking to the federal reserve today to help ease fears about rising interest rates and troubled hedge funds while fed policy makers are expected once again to leave their target short term interest rate unchanged at in the two day meeting that ends today investors will be closely watching the feds statement due at p m edt they are hoping for more signals that the fed sees inflation slowly coming under control which would help ease fears about resurgent world inflation forcing the fed to bump rates higher hopes for some soothing signals from the fed helped stocks and bonds recover some lost ground yesterday the dow jones industrial average rose points or to leaving it up this year doubts about the markets future have sent stocks up and down sharply this month leaving the industrials still points off their record finish of hit june the broad standard &amp poors stock index rose or points to up for the nasdaq composite index jumped or points to ahead this year the much watched year treasury note whose yield is a benchmark for market interest rates recovered or &# for every &# invested pushing the yield down to the dollar rose against the euro but fell against the yen financial stocks which had been suffering as borrowing costs rose and the mortgage market hit rough waters were among the rebounders also helping stocks money managers some of whom are required to be fully invested at quarters end felt obliged to buy before the quarters last trading day tomorrow behind the recent market turbulence has been a growing fear among money managers that global inflation will drive borrowing costs higher damaging the stock outlook "inflation expectations are being built into bond yields " said edgar peters chief investment strategist at panagora asset management which oversees more than &# billion in boston for the stock market "i think we have already seen the highs for the year " not everyone is that worried of course as was reflected in the days gains but many expect sharp stock swings this summer mr peters who invests using mathematical models based on a variety of economic and market indicators says he doesnt see a bear market for stocks meaning a drop but wouldnt be surprised at a swing he has hunkered down a bit reducing his exposure to stocks and similar decisions by other money managers help explain the recent volatility higher rates hurt stocks in several ways they stifle consumer spending and business investment hurting profits they draw investors to bonds and money markets away from stocks and they make it harder for big investment funds to arrange the cheap loans that have been funding huge takeovers which in turn have been helping drive stocks higher investors nerves have been particularly irritated by the gyrations of the year treasury note whose yield influences a variety of mortgage rates and corporate borrowing rates the year yield has gone from early last month to a five year high of on june since then the yield has fallen back toward but its refusal to sink below that much watched level has kept money managers nervous the yields rise is doubly troublesome because it comes as wall street is unsettled by the woes of two big bear stearns hedge funds that have lost money investing in securities tied to home mortgages those problems have made some big financial institutions back away from risky investments and loans making borrowing all the more expensive for some firms mr peters for example doesnt expect the year yield to push much beyond but "if the year goes to or higher then we could see a pretty good stock selloff " he said that level is so much higher than investors have seen recently that it could force people to re evaluate their expectations and their portfolios gordon fowler chief investment officer at glenmede trust in philadelphia is more sanguine he says he is confident that the fed is bringing key inflation indicators below removing the need for interest rates to rise while stock investors wouldnt like to see yields above he says he thinks that wouldnt create a real problem unless they got near reassuring words from the fed today could help persuade others to share that view mr fowler who relies on classic market indicators such as profit and interest rate trends said he wouldnt be surprised to see the stock market move sideways for six months since profit growth promises to be positive in the quarterly earnings reports due next month he said he isnt prepared to bet on stock weakness yet "as earnings come out and the earnings are relatively positive the market will be inclined to move upward at a slow nervous rate " he said some investors are focused less on rising treasury yields than on the impact of the hedge fund mess on borrowing rates until recently the extra borrowing costs or "spreads " that nongovernment borrowers pay on top of treasury yields have been razor thin which has been great for profits and for stock gains borrowing costs have been held down by competition among the many investors who want securities that pay yields higher than treasury bonds but the near collapse of two big bear stearns hedge funds has sowed worry in that world and some spreads have begun widening already worries are spreading that the higher costs could make it harder to arrange buyouts by private investment partnerships and weigh on stocks "that is where issue lies more than with inflation " said henry herrmann chief executive of money management group waddell &amp reed in overland park kan who also uses classic economic and market indicators to track stock trends "if risk spreads widen out enough it is going to make it more difficult for a lot of the transaction activity that is going on in the market to occur and the number of transactions will diminish " if spreads dont react much mr herrmann says he wont react much either he hasnt changed his stock holdings yet but if spreads widen noticeably and it gets harder for buyout firms to borrow money he says watch out
