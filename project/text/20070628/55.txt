journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources military affairs u s diplomacy and defense at odds in africa the u s is building a new africa strategy around both fighting and diplomacy but esquires thomas p m barnett reports that the military has struggled to unify those elements on the ground the aims of the special operations forces that have long been the main u s military presence in africa sometimes clash with civil affairs oriented units charged with building long term local alliances in the u s military set up a base in djibouti that has become an experiment in combining what are known as the three ds defense diplomacy and development next summer the pentagon plans to launch an africa command that will probably model its strategy in the continent along the lines laid down in djibouti the difficulty in synchronizing the two components became apparent when u s forces aided the ethiopian invasion of somalia earlier this year capt bob wright who heads strategic communications for the combined joint task force horn of africa in djibouti complains to mr barnett that the u s soldiers involvement in the somali mission undermined the militarys diplomatic and development efforts in the region it "makes everyone think that what were trying to do here in the horn of africa really doesnt count but it does you cant make the horn a better place simply by killing bad guys " said capt wright capt wright says he has hardly any contact with the special ops soldiers housed separately at the djibouti base when mr barnett sees men in black scrambling down a building in the north side of the base he asks the public affairs officer whats happening "over where " comes the reply "i dont see anything " in a separate base in kenya however mr barnett praises the sort of work the civil affairs unit is doing in the muslim community the troops recently learned that girls were being pulled from a village school because of a prohibition against girls and boys sharing a bathroom the army built a new school "girls stayed in school parents were happy mullahs were satisfied local leaders immensely gratified " writes mr barnett esquire july politics partisanship scolds ignore reality of the political system the rising number of pundits and politicians who decry partisanship arent any more consensus oriented than the party faithful says the new republics jonathan chait partisanship scolds as mr chait labels them complain politicians spend too much time trying to score points for their party they accuse partisans of lowering the level of discourse and hindering "real results" or "good ideas " in the words of new york city mayor and self proclaimed enemy of partisanship michael bloomberg they have a lobby in the form of unity consisting of a group of washington eminences seeking a bipartisan presidential contender mr bloomberg has emerged as their potential candidate mr chait agrees with the partisanship scolds that certain popular centrist views arent represented well in washington yet the partisanship scolds tend not to cater to these underrepresented voters gravitating instead toward "free trade open immigration cutting entitlements and social tolerance " in effect most of the bipartisans are actually moderate democrats mr chait says they represent the beltway elite more effectively than they represent any other demographic if they are frustrated they should blame the u s political system the reason the u s has political parties is because voters dont actually agree on what "good ideas" or "real results" should be is a real result the banning of stem cell research or the funding of it partisan battles exist to settle those questions mr chait also takes issue with the portrayal of mr bloomberg and california gov arnold schwarzenegger as politicians who get things done without an eye toward party interests while the partisans in washington argue with each other some of the positions the two have taken adhering to the kyoto protocol funding stem cell research would seem partisan to the republicans who disagree the new republic july mining termite tunnels unearth underground deposits geologists and mining companies are piggybacking on termites which as they dig down into the earth to escape the desert heat reveal untapped sources of minerals termites sometimes create tunnels that extend feet or more below ground in search of wet mud to build their colonies by digging up soil from deep underground the critters essentially serve as prospectors for miners who can sift through the excavated dirt for signs of valuable minerals like gold or diamonds "a termite mound is an inverted drill hole its just what we want " says jon north of toronto mining company
