the evening wrap interpretive dance online edition federal reserve policy makers appeared to give financial markets what theyd been hoping for by tweaking their assessment of inflation trends but while the language of their statement has changed their message may not have as everyone expected the fed left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at the rate charged on overnight loans between banks has now been at that level for a full year but since no change in borrowing costs was a foregone conclusion investors were focused intently on any change in the banks take on inflation recent data had showed that inflation less food and energy prices was drifting down toward the feds comfort zone and onlookers thought the bank might be forced to change its tune after months of insisting that core prices remained "elevated " and so it was gone from the statement was any reference to "elevated" core inflation and in its place was this "readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months " markets have been trained to expect few surprises from chairman ben bernankes fed so a change of that magnitude made some traders feel like it was the last day of school stocks shot higher on the news the dow jones industrial average bounced up by more than points after the feds statement floated across the wires with a slip back from &# a barrel on oil seeming to underline that everything was just fine on the inflation front but not so fast the next line of the feds statement would suggest that policy makers are still quite concerned about inflation it said "a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated " and once again the fed reminded its audience that "the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures " to a number of economists that was proof that the feds view on inflation hadnt really changed at all david greenlaw of morgan stanley commented that the change "reinforces the fact that the fed still fears a possible reacceleration in core inflation " while also supporting the notion that some at the fed are comfortable with inflation where it currently is "assuming that it can be sustained " drew matus a senior economist at lehman brothers wrote that the feds decision to toss out the "elevated" language may have "had less to do with a change in the feds view on the inflation outlook and more to do with removing a word that was garnering unwanted attention " economists also said that the statement further nailed down what a large part of the markets has come to expect that policy makers are likely to leave rates on hold for the rest of the year and so as the afternoon progressed the big rally in stocks that came in those first few minutes after the fed wrapped up for the day flickered out the dow jones industrials closed the day lower by points at and other stock indexes similarly crumpled after their large midafternoon bumps the nasdaq composite index climbed to and the standard &amp poors index dipped to treasury yields picked up in the aftermath of the fed decision leaving the year yield parked at the dollar held steady against the euro and rose against the yen immigration bill looks dead after reviving the stalled out immigration reform measure earlier this week the senate today stomped on the brakes voting on a measure that would have limited debate and carried the legislation closer to a final vote several lawmakers said that given the pitched emotions surrounding the bill it was unlikely to surface again this year and that perhaps it wouldnt be revived until well after the elections should that be the case immigration seems likely to be a central issue in the presidential campaign conservatives in the republican party made their opposition to the package well known voicing pointed criticism of what they saw as the measures inadequate focus on border security and enforcement and faulting provisions that they said would amount to the granting of amnesty to illegal immigrants some democrats had said they were opposed to a guest worker program that they said would have led to the creation of a permanent underclass of impoverished foreign workers but in the end it was republicans who led the charge against the bill only voted to end debate voted against "americans feel that they are losing their country to a government that has seemed to not have the competence or the ability to carry out the things that it says it will do " said sen bob corker of tennessee the outcome is a sharp setback for president bush who had made the passage of comprehensive immigration reform a domestic priority for his second term after an earlier effort to push the bill through congress failed while he was at the g summit in germany mr bush had confidently told reporters that hed see them again at the bill signing but despite the presidents efforts to appeal personally to a number of senators his campaign came up short in a last ditch drive to save the bill mr bush phoned lawmakers this morning to ask for their support while homeland security secretary michael chertoff and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez approached lawmakers as they entered the chamber the president made his frustration clear saying today that "legal immigration is one of the top concerns of the american people and congresss failure to act on it is a disappointment the american people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to our immigration laws a lot of us worked hard to see if we couldnt find common ground it didnt work "

important civil rights ruling that could affect millions of students nationwide the decision broke on the courts partisan faults with the four conservatives and moderate justice anthony kennedy making up the majority but justice kennedy didnt sign on to the totality of the majoritys findings he wrote in a concurring opinion that racial considerations could be a component of school district plans designed to achieve diversity saying that the majority opinion by chief justice john roberts could be viewed as foreclosing the use of race in any circumstance and that he disagreed "with that reasoning " the court was reviewing admissions policies in seattle and louisville public school systems the court also ruled that an antitrust curb on retail pricing accords should be thrown out
