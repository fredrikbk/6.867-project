a cultural conversation with eric idle a python grip on handel as a musical genre oratorios large scale settings of biblical texts for chorus soloists and orchestra are hardly known for their comedy during the th century oratorio was serious business and representative works by handel mendelssohn gounod max bruch and arthur sullivan rivaled the most popular operas of verdi and wagner as audience attractions this was especially so in victorian england germany and the u s where a love of choral singing was fired by the prevailing notion that sacred choral music was morally uplifting there were dissenters however george bernard shaw no lover of religion or pompous notions cast his usual gimlet eye upon oratorios dismissing them as "unstaged operettas on scriptural themes written in a style in which solemnity and triviality are blended in the right proportion for boring an atheist out of his senses " one oratorio that remains a fixture in todays repertoire is handels "messiah " performances of which are a christmastide tradition this is why shaws crack about "unstaged operettas" sprang to mind when i learned that the irrepressible team of eric idle and john du prez creators of the broadway hit "spamalot" have produced a new and irreverent riposte to handels perennial masterpiece "not the messiah hes a very naughty boy " was commissioned by the new luminato arts festival in toronto and received its world premiere there earlier this month on sunday this comic oratorio based on the film "monty pythons life of brian " will receive its u s premiere at the caramoor international music festival in katonah n y with mr idle displaying his self described "baritone ish" voice as narrator i was recently able to pin mr idle down for a bicoastal phone conversation and right off the bat he observed to my question as to whether he deemed this new work a divine inspiration "i think that these things are always inspired moments i suddenly thought how appropriate to do the life of brian as an oratorio it struck me instantly as being funny " the inspiration was initially sparked by family ties mr idles first cousin is peter oundjian music director of the toronto symphony orchestra and the caramoor festival "peter has been after me for years to do something humorous with him and an orchestra but i couldnt figure out how youd keep up the fun past the first number then this oratorio idea came to me " the idea of a comic oratorio should come as no surprise to cognoscenti of monty python films which have sent up some of the fundamental subjects of world civilization "monty python and the holy grail" "monty pythons life of brian" and "monty pythons the meaning of life" reflecting on this mr idle says with a chuckle that "an italian journalist once asked us who is the only common character in the python films and the answer was god " admittedly the "life of brian" about a contemporary of jesus who is erroneously thought to be the messiah unleashed a considerable furor upon its release in norwegian theaters blackballed it inspiring neighboring sweden to market the film as "so funny that it was banned in norway" a prominent american clergyman denounced "brian" as a work "produced in hell " and it was banned in many parts of the american south asked if he and the other members of the python comedy troupe expected to whip up such a controversy mr idle replies "we knew it was contentious but perhaps due to our ignorance and innocence we hadnt really foreseen it mushrooming into such a big story certainly in america " he says that "we had been very careful not to insult people who believe in jesus and in fact jesus appears only twice in the movie once at his birth and once at the sermon on the mount and its perfectly evident that at no stage is brian anything but somebody mistaken for the messiah the comedy emerges from the tragedy of being mistaken for something youre not and curiously thats what celebrity is all about " discussing the creative process of the new work mr idle notes that he started it by writing the libretto which he sent along to composer john du prez "i then packed john off to ireland with it " he says that mr du prez an oxford university trevelyan scholar whose film credits include scores for "a chorus of disapproval" "a fish called wanda" "teenage mutant ninja turtles" i ii and iii "the wind in the willows" and "fascination" spent significant time in dublin where handel first performed his "messiah" in it was originally a benefit performance to aid three charities there mr du prez returned from his hibernian idyll "with the most wonderful pieces of music in styles ranging from shostakovich to gilbert and sullivan and then in my low way i inserted a couple of cheap and obvious melodies " he says with a laugh "john is so tolerant of me we bounce ideas off one another and find ourselves in quite unexpected creative places " one such place he says is "the killer moment when the bagpipers come on " "bagpipers " i ask "yes " he says "full kilt and the whole thing you see where were coming from " asked if they pipe in a haggis as an additional course for the last supper mr idle says "well not quite they enter when brian is mistaken for the messiah and the chorus sings youre the one we slip into b flat the only key bagpipes can handle " handel himself doesnt escape the compliment of a parody a chorus with the enticing first line "hail to the shoe " "that was the first piece we wrote and the springboard for the whole oratorio idea " says mr idle "but john and i realized that a whole evening of handel parodies would be dull " comedy in music demands greater stylistic variety and mr idle calls the resulting musical mosaic "baroque n roll or as mr du prez puts it "the ipod shuffle " the authors regard "not the messiah" as a work in progress which is still undergoing changes since its toronto premiere "we have a few more surprises in store for caramoor " mr idle says he and mr du prez have been pleasantly surprised that their current broadway hit "spamalot " has been able to capture young audiences in the post monty python era as well as it has "i always thought wed get the python crowd given the success of the python american tours for gods sake when john and i played carnegie hall i stood on that stage in full drag having the audience sing" here he names a python number whose title exceeds this newspapers limits on naughtiness "which is something that brahms cannot boast at least as far as we know " certainly as a longtime python devotee i can observe that in all pythonic humor from such venerable tv series sketches as "the ministry of silly walks" and "the dead parrot" to "spamalot" and "not the messiah" the common element that speaks to young audiences as well as veteran python addicts is the genuine wit and literary intelligence that underlies all the belly laughable antics yet observes mr idle beneath the pythonic hilarity in "not the messiah" is a serious purpose namely that it might help bring more young people into classical concerts "it tells people its ok to enjoy yourselves in a concert hall and that was also why i got permission from the other pythons to turn brian into an oratorio " mentioning that along with vivaldi and other choral repertoire his daughters high school choir regularly sings "always look on the bright side of life" which first was sung in "the life of brian" and then was reprised in "spamalot" and now in "not the messiah" mr idle is sanguine about the positive influence "not the messiah" can have on young audiences especially as the first half of the program features genuine concert music including sousas "liberty bell" march the python theme glinkas overture to "russlan and ludmilla " the "nimrod" movement from elgars "enigma variations" and the finale of beethovens seventh symphony he says that "a concert program including this work would show kids that they have nothing to fear and because it contains many types of music it introduces young people to the plurality of concert music as a whole in fact in toronto we found that a lot of young people did indeed say to their parents oh i enjoyed that can we go to another symphony which means that its purpose was achieved " mr scherer writes on classical music for the journal his new book "a history of american classical music" sourcebooks is being published in august
