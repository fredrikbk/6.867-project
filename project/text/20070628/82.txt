real time when public records are too public open records are an established tradition but does internet access call for a change online edition the web wasnt created to appeal to our sense of voyeurism it just feels that way sometimes im not talking about dirty pictures but the ability the webs given all of us to snoop on our friends colleagues and neighbors from googling the new guy in the next cube to finding out what the people next door paid for their house to seeing which neighbors have given money to which candidates and parties such behavior runs the gamut from generally acceptable nosiness were a nation of self googlers after all to mildly gauche in new york city discussing what apartments cost is practically a sport to creepy keep your nose out of my politics as with all questions about internet privacy and personal information there are generational differences at work if you came of age blogging and being googled someone seeing you gave &# to moveon org might not be the biggest deal i wrote about different generations attitudes toward personal information online earlier this month but then theres another set of personal details that have made their way online and these documents are much more worrisome property deeds marriage and divorce records court files motor vehicle information and tax documents are increasingly being digitized and contain a wealth of information that few of us would want online social security numbers birth dates maiden names and images of our signatures local governments have rushed to put those documents online for a decade or so often without scrubbing them of such information and thats made them potentially fertile ground for busybodies stalkers and identity thieves betty "bj" ostergren a year old from outside richmond va has made it her mission to alert people to the dangers of public records online ms ostergren is feisty bordering on ferocious her tactics include mailing letters to people alerting them that their personal information is online and posting copies of public documents or links to them displaying the personal information of circuit court clerks and other politicians including former house majority leader tom delay and florida gov jeb bush see her web site the virginia watchdog here this washington post profile of her is also a good read long a local activist ms ostergren began her crusade in the summer of when a title examiner called to tell her that public records from her home county of hanover would be put online within a few weeks ms ostergren says she objected to the fact that her signature would be online not to mention other peoples social security numbers she confronted her countys circuit court clerk and began a telephone campaign "people were livid " she says adding with satisfaction "our records in this county did not go online " since then her campaign has grown to include the entire u s ms ostergren moves easily from a discussion of franklin county ohios decision to remove images of mortgage records to what she sees as floridas lack of progress and maricopa county ariz s troubles an important note the records being put online are public and available &lt ndash&gt sensitive information and all to anyone who goes down to the courthouse or county seat and many of them have already been compiled and digitized by data warehouses who often make them available to marketers and real estate professionals open records are a longstanding american tradition so too is a hold your nose acceptance that commercial entities will try to make a profit by exploiting that openness but at the same time its too simplistic to say that just because records are available by going to a government building and talking to a clerk we shouldnt worry that theyre now available through some web sleuthing sometimes a difference of degree is so significant that it may as well be a difference of kind foes of the recording industry rightly note that people have always stolen music by taping it for their friends but its risible to compare the potential effect of running off some cassette copies of an album to that of making a digital copy of that album available for the taking online similarly it takes a pretty determined busybody or thief to visit the courthouse and the law has acknowledged this noting the "practical obscurity" of such records the web may not change the status of public records but it means the end of practical obscurity enabling drive by voyeurism for the bored or petty &lt ndash&gt or identity thieves in the cybercafes of say nigeria or romania how did social security numbers and other sensitive information wind up online blame a collision between our enthusiasm for technology and our failure to appreciate its consequences in the last decade states and local governments rushed to put documents online eager to appear progressive and make government more efficient but the momentum of that effort got ahead of our ability to sort out what might happen in particular we underestimated the borderline spooky power of search to find needles in technological haystacks now the job is to clean up the mess and there does seem to be progress counties are working to redact sensitive information from online records and courts and government agencies are doing a better job keeping personal information off the web in the first place mark monacelli is president of the property rights industry association a trade group thats working toward developing national standards for accessing public property records and the recorder for st louis county minn mr monacelli says pria has "worked very hard with lenders and mortgage settlement officers to not put social security numbers on mortgages " he adds that "we try to the best of our ability to create awareness of the issue and work with counties to be aware of whos looking at your information " at the same time mr monacelli notes that there are reasons to put information about property records online quick access to such information offers a slew of economic benefits mr monacelli says that when he purchased his first home the process from looking across the lenders desk to getting the title took about days &lt ndash&gt an unacceptably glacial pace now technology has allowed us to obtain a new mortgage or refinance very quickly without that speed he argues the recent real estate boom wouldnt have existed "where would this economy be without it " he asks there are other standards for handling personal information of course this associated press story documents swedens recent clampdown on ratsit se a site which offered financial details for free from the countrys national tax authority if you wanted to know how much your colleague made or if your neighbor was in debt you could that may seem amazing to americans but such openness is long established in swedish society discussing his site ratsits ceo told the aps louise nordstrom that "a lot of people use it to negotiate their pay " as in the u s it wasnt that sweden was suddenly making documents that had been private public rather its that ratsit did away with practical obscurity now information is still available via the site but its no longer free ten requests a week cost &# and anyone whose finances are viewed will be notified by mail and told who asked that new standard seems to go further than americans might like imagine the chilling effects of such notification on investigative journalism or community activism so what should we do "to me if people want to see the records let them go down to the courthouse that way you have to put forth some effort " ms ostergren says adding "i think there are too many people we have a responsibility to protect " robert gellman a washington d c based privacy and information policy consultant thinks the digital era calls for states to reassess what records should be public and what level of access should be allowed but he defends the u s s tradition of openness as a way of keeping the system honest "property tax records are available to other people for a good reason " he says noting that if you see your house is assessed for more than your neighbors or a similar house across town you can appeal on the other hand access to driver license information is now largely limited to law enforcement agencies and insurance companies the legacy of the murder of actress rebecca schaeffer whose killer obtained her personal information through the department of motor vehicles "there should be discussions about these things and theres no absolute right or wrong answer here " mr gellman says mark mccreary a lawyer with philadelphias fox rothschild llp who specializes in internet law expects a long slow grind as sensitive information is redacted from old documents and standards emerge for keeping such information off new documents and are adopted by local governments "the solution is for all the counties to do it for all the states to do it " mr mccreary says adding that "you cant take a system in place for more than years and expect it to be fixed overnight " the fix wont be simple it will require agreement about what personal information should and shouldnt be available which may or may not be the same as what should and shouldnt be available online perhaps sensitive information will be redacted online but available in person or perhaps sensitive information will be restricted in all forms those standards ought to emerge side by side with a hard look at what personal information credit reporting agencies and marketers have access to and what theyre allowed to do with it and efforts to make identity theft harder and easier to recover from and there is no technological fix for identity theft while our fears center on distant hackers stealing our identities those with access to our trash or our homes will always be a much bigger threat popular conceptions of the web have been shaped by science fiction visions of the net as a virtual reality analogue of the world with humanitys wealth of information organized into a gleaming cyber city of data but what those visions elided was all the hard work of bringing that into existence imagine instead virtual acres of rubble with shining towers emerging from mounds of information scattered all over the place without regard to how it should be organized labeled or kept secure order will emerge but dont expect it any time soon and dont expect the process to be painless public records have always been public but do you find the accessibility of these documents worrisome what implications does this have for our society as a whole join me and other online journal readers in the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
