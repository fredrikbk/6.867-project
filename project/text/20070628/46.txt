how the peoples republic does pr charm offensive by joshua kurlantzick yale pages &# the cabdriver was african the city was washington and the radio was tuned to the english language service of the peoples republic of china after listening to some sprightly chatter about hair braiding in nigeria i asked the cabby if he was a fan of this channel yes he explained but only because it carries "all the foreign radio services " how would he rate the chinese service "not my favorite look at what the chinese are doing in africa " not everyone is as enlightened as that cabby the whole world it seems blames america for having failed to stop genocide in rwanda but when it comes to darfur only a few fingers point at china yet it is china not america that supports the brutal sudanese regime not to mention the murderous ruler of zimbabwe robert mugabe as joshua kurlantzick reports in "charm offensive " poll after poll finds a pattern of "positive public opinion for china and deteriorating public opinion toward the united states in important developing nations " even if you are inclined to doze off at phrases like "public diplomacy" referring to a countrys efforts to foster good will and influence abroad mr kurlantzicks book will jolt you awake he notes that "americas core interest its national security increasingly relies on wooing foreign publics " right now though china is the worlds leading wooer as mr kurlantzick documents chinese diplomats and businessmen learn the language customs and history of every country they are dealing with no matter how small chinese universities year after year exchange thousands of students and faculty with their counterparts abroad chinese art and chinese films find ever more venues throughout the world and chinas tourism industry is booming meanwhile chinese officials sign countless agreements with other countries promising riches and asking no hard questions as for chinas media they enjoy the kind of global credibility that countries with a free press might well envy the state controlled newswire xinhua mr kurlantzick observes gets "picked up by newspapers across the developing world and even by american news sites like google " china has a good sense of timing too mr kurlantzick recalls that in when the thai economy tanked china immediately made "a symbolic move publicly refusing to devalue its currency " because china moved so quickly it managed a public relations coup getting credit for "standing up for other asian nations" even though japan and the u s would eventually offer south asias suffering economies a huge bailout with much greater beneficial effects elsewhere in the world china works hard to convince oil rich countries like venezuela nigeria saudi arabia and iran that it can serve as a model for their own societies it argues as mr kurlantzick puts it that a "top down control of development and poverty reduction" is superior to "democratic liberalism " with its emphasis on individual rights no wonder so many autocrats conclude from the precipitous rise of chinas economy that prosperity can be obtained without that annoying western indulgence political freedom are they right to his credit mr kurlantzick neither avoids this tough question nor opts for what journalist james mann calls "the soothing scenario " in which it is assumed with little or no scrutiny that chinas wealth and power will inevitably generate liberal democracy instead mr kurlantzick traces the flaws in chinas charm offensive and by extension in china itself he reports that chinese from outside the mainland account for of its foreign investment yet when these diaspora chinese visit the peoples republic they are "shocked" by what they see there appalled at the waste and corruption some have even pulled out their investments waste and corruption arent the half of it either china is guilty of harsh labor practices environmental abuses human rights violations from foods and medicines poisoned by adulterated chinese ingredients to mass pirating of films books and other intellectual property there is much to criticize about chinas way of doing business yet with a few notable exceptions public criticism of china seems strangely muted perhaps because of the prcs pr machine and china is very good at soliciting advice from foreign experts many of whom are duly flattered to think that their ideas will be used by powerful rulers instead of shelved by pandering politicians but as mr kurlantzick rightly argues the u s has not yet lost this soft power contest some of the values touted by china "noninterference respect for other nations internal affairs" sound good but are frequently compromised in chinas actual dealings with other countries others "economic gradualism directed by the state" appeal mostly to authoritarian regimes "willing to trade away some degree of political freedom for chinese style growth rates " by contrast america offers ordinary people "a comprehensive inspiring vision of how to build a free rights oriented political system and economy a vision that remains popular in many parts of the world " thats a pretty big advantage maybe we should try adding a smidgen more charm ms bayless book about u s cultural diplomacy will be published in by yale university press
