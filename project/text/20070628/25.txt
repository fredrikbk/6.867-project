credit crunch time the hedge fund meltdown at bear stearns was a trifecta of modern financial bugaboos combining subprime mortgages gone bad hedge funds taking on water and opaque derivatives it has already led to questions about whether all of these need better read more regulation what they really need is what theyre so far getting which is an adam smith cleansing financial bets gone wrong are not a crime in fact they are essential financial innovation has been a great boon to the american economy but innovation entails risk and risk means the potential for failure the key point is that when financial players step out too far on the risk curve in order to earn larger rewards they are then allowed to suffer the requisite market penalties for reckless driving take the case of the bear stearns hedge funds which focused on subprime debt securities the fund manager ralph cioffi was a hero to his boss and his investors as he developed new mortgage instruments that returned a year while the fun lasted but he got in over his head because he had taken on hedges that didnt hedge his exposure to the subprime market in the way that he imagined the losses led to margin calls from creditors and eventually to bears offer of a &# billion lifeline to one of the two ailing hedge funds youd think a hedge fund would know how to hedge but many of todays debt instruments and derivatives are new enough that they havent been tested in a downturn the index against which the bear stearns funds were trying to hedge has only been in existence for months so no one knew how it would behave when the subprime market swooned that turned out to be bad for mr cioffi and its probably worse if youre one of his investors but its a long way from market failure we may not have heard the worst in the subprime space and almost certainly not in high yield credit markets either as failures unfold were willing to bet that some investment banks will be found to have overcharged for innovative products of limited value even if they seemed like a good idea at the time people will have invested their money in places they shouldnt have and "lost everything " shakeouts are never pretty but theyre necessary because mistakes do get made in a free market financial system and if the mistakes are not paid for by those who made them the whole system suffers this is not to say that there are never any genuine victims well posit that somewhere out there someone sold someone else a subprime home mortgage for the sole purpose of collecting the origination fees on the loan knowing full well that the borrower couldnt afford the payments and maybe some boiler room operations forged income documents to push through loans that should never have been made but last we checked fraud is still a crime the myriad investigations lawsuits and regulatory inquiries currently swirling around the subprime mortgage industry hardly show that we need stricter laws it may be that underwriting standards on adjustable rate mortgages need another look but a lot of this is happening anyway banks want loans to be paid back when it comes to securitizing and reselling those loans buyers whove been burned may also demand more in the way of disclosure and guarantees that the securities are what they purport to be and thats also all to the good until things went south in the subprime space even sophisticated investors didnt necessarily know what information was important to have theyre learning from recent mistakes as for the regulators the main goal should be to protect the financial system from any specific failures not to protect the bankers and their investors who made the failed bets if it gets bad enough regulators should clean out the equity holders as a lesson to others who might want to take risks that they too dont understand
