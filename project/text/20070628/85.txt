scoring sold out tickets at face value we set out to find best deals for police concert on the web a gift shop rendez vous thanks to the web there are more ways than ever for music fans to score tickets to hot concerts the first police tour in years presented an ideal occasion to test the options it was high profile but not an immediate sell out from the day tickets went on sale there was plenty of inventory in the so called secondary market but seats were still available through ticketmaster for weeks too so with a budget of &# a pair we set out months after tickets went on sale to try four methods for securing tickets ticketmaster stubhub ebay and craigslist ticketmaster which has a virtual lock on selling tickets to major music and sports events has battled bitterly with rival resellers over their aggressive push into the secondary market ticketmaster calls such reselling a ripoff of artists concert promoters and fans alike not to mention a hotbed of counterfeiting and fraud most of the ticket resale sites say they have customer protection measures in place and say they bring efficiency to a market dominated by ticketmaster that is notoriously bad at setting appropriate prices we wanted to see for ourselves whether ticketmaster or its competitors actually offered clear advantages or disadvantages in terms of seat location price convenience or reliability sometimes though concert promoters set prices efficiently the first time out despite a variety of tactics we paid about what ticketmaster charged every time the main advantage offered by resellers the ability to get tickets even after a show is sold out was relevant mainly for midrange seats some of the best seats did not even go on sale until the afternoon of the show though at &# each they were too pricey for us the classic rock trio was scheduled to play three dates in the los angeles area all at big venues for a total of nearly seats available for shows in the span of just four nights in late june with the best seats priced at &# not including service charges others were sold for around &# and &# the secondary market seemed primed for rich bargain hunting three weeks before the first show scheduled for june at the capacity staples center we logged on to ticketmasters web site the show had been on sale for months and brokers online were already hawking heavily inflated tickets to what they called the "sold out" show one would be seller was asking &# for a pair of front and center seats that was on the high end of the market but only by &# or so others were fishing for hundreds of dollars for &# seats in the nose bleed section it is impossible to know if these seats ever sell for close to such outrageous asking prices since ticket reselling sites like stubhub and razorgator dont specify seat locations and the same tickets may be relisted at lower prices in reality plenty of seats were available at all three price levels and after a few hang ups thanks to ticketmaster coms maddening habit of demanding that a customer decide within two minutes whether to pull the trigger on a transaction we bought a pair of perfectly good seats not far above floor level facing the stage at the far end of the arena next up was stubhub the sites design makes bargain hunting extremely difficult there is no ability to haggle with sellers and the site does not display the exact location of seats for sale sellers were seeking thousands of dollars for what they described as prime seats while even tickets in staples cheap section set on top of three levels of luxury suites started at &# apiece determined not to sit so high we found what appeared to be a decent price &# for a seat fairly near the ones wed just purchased from ticketmaster unfortunately we hastily mistook the row number six for the number of seats available and ended up stuck with a single ticket pairs of seats in the area were actually priced in the &# range or higher despite the fact that they could be had cheaper from ticketmaster with &# in commissions and shipping fees tacked on to a single ticket stubhub turned out to be the most expensive of the options we tried the stubhub ticket arrived within a few days while an email from ticketmaster said its tickets had been printed and were in the mail the stubhub seat arrived by two day mail the ticketmaster seats did not with one ticket in hand and prices on all the secondary sites reaching &# for midtier &# seats we took a breather and waited until closer to the show to see whether asking prices dropped closer to our budget of &# as the show approached prices did indeed come down a bit but the tickets wed ordered from ticketmaster still hadnt shown up two days before the show we called a customer service number and after more than minutes on hold we arranged to have the original tickets bar codes canceled so that if theyd been pilfered from the mail they would be useless and have new ones waiting for us at the venue we had to wait on hold for another minutes to speak to a different representative to get our parking fee refunded the waits were frustrating but the system worked the night of the concert we swiped our credit card at a ticketing machine and out popped two tickets the day of the show the secondary market sites heated up ebay still featured a fair number of "floor" seats carrying outrageous price tags of &# or more a growing number of brokers also were touting the extensive inventories still on hand even as they were seeking prices well above face value bargaining was looking like an increasingly viable option on the freewheeling classified ads site craigslist meanwhile offbeat proposals began popping up midday including a desperate sounding guy offering a free pair of tickets for a "cute sexy and open minded girl " even so the best value to be had on either site was from a guy in carson calif miles away offering a pair of decent seats for face value the catch they had to be picked up in carson around p m a fresh look at ticketmaster revealed that a batch of excellent seats near the stage had just been released this often happens the day of big shows once the stage and lighting gear have been set up and the promoters have a feel for how many of the seats they have held back for the artists arent actually needed and how many seats they need to block off for the stage the seats were priced in the top tier out of our range but were still the best value to be had anywhere that close to the shows p m starting time in fact it appeared that in our gusto to wait out the resellers we missed a key window by p m it was clear that the only bargains to be had were for upper deck seats something we considered the option of last resort given the three tiers of luxury boxes beneath the top section we posted a tickets wanted ad on craigslist in hopes of flushing out scalpers the calls came but they all offered terrible seats we wouldnt consider at any price finally an email exchange and phone call with a twitchy sounding character on craigslist trying to unload two seats with a degree rear view of the stage brought him down from &# to &# about what the seats would have cost from ticketmaster we met him at a gas station cash in hand and picked up the tickets on ebay meanwhile we found a phone number for a local broker and called him about a nearly identical pair of tickets also priced at &# he wouldnt take &# but for &# the deal was done the broker even accepted an american express card number over the phone something that made us wonder if we were setting ourselves up for fraudulent charges later so far it hasnt been a problem it was now p m the broker said he would email them by p m emailing tickets is possible thanks to ticketmasters "ticketfast" system it makes ticket delivery quick but it also makes fraud ridiculously easy all an unscrupulous seller has to do is pass along the email but keep a print out for himself if he arrives at the show first the email recipient is out of luck by p m the tickets hadnt arrived and we had to head out for the show during a heated phone call from the car we threatened to dispute the brokers charge if he didnt find a way to get the tickets to us in the neighborhood of the venue magically he located an associate who could have them held at the lobby gift shop of a holiday inn near the staples center these appeared to be the sketchiest of the tickets they came with an unknown pedigree and had been printed from some strangers computer but when we strode up to the arena just in time for the opening
