capital if a quake hits markets at least shock absorbers have improved since wall street wizards discover the world is riskier and more complex than they and their foolproof computer models recognize congress ponders tweaking the tax code to squeeze takeover kings the u s trade deficit is widening and the dollar is sinking inflation jitters are in the air its october just before the stock market crash this isnt a prediction that the crash of is at hand it might be i just dont believe anyone can predict such events its a reason to ask if events in washington on wall street and in global financial markets are tremors that signal a shifting of the tectonic plates that underlie the economy for the past several years global markets have been kind to the economy and the global economy has enjoyed a great run interest rates and inflation have been low credit has been readily available even near deadbeats have been able to borrow cheaply wall street has come up with ever more complicated ways to make bets leverage them and hedge them in ways that diffuse risk far more widely than ever before it has profited handsomely from doing so today there are signs that the era of placid markets and cheap money may be coming to an end inflation pressures are emerging as the global economy strains to supply growing demand from india and china gone is the talk of china exporting deflation central banks are pushing up short term interest rates and bond markets are pushing up long term rates falling u s home prices are ending the frenzy of lending to subprime borrowers more broadly it looks like lenders arent going to be quite so generous with the terms they offer in making risky loans whether to home buyers or companies now bear stearns has discovered that financial innovation has moved faster than its high paid employees ability to understand whats going on and someone is going to lose a lot of money as a result there is an aura of inevitability to this twenty years ago it was portfolio insurance and index arbitrage nine years ago it was the hubris of long term capital management the big leveraged fund that thought it was smarter than everyone else todays financial instruments are so opaque that almost no one can be certain how risky they are "its not hard to argue that our understanding of economic processes may even be less today than it was in the past " says the bank for international settlements the central bank for central bankers in a thoughtful essay in its just published annual report "on the real side of the economy a combination of technological progress and globalization has revolutionized production on the financial side new players new instruments and new attitudes have proven equally revolutionary " adds the bis "there seems to be a natural tendency in markets for past successes to lead to more risk taking more leverage more funding higher prices more collateral and in turn more risk taking " "the danger with such market processes is that they can indeed must eventually go into reverse if the fundamentals have been overpriced " the bis continues its worries beginning to show "should liquidity dry up and correlations among asset prices rise" thats central banker speak for too many investors trying to sell all sorts of things at the same time "the concern would be that prices might also overshoot on the downside " thats central banker speak for "crash " "such cycles have been seen many times in the past " it adds thats central banker speak for "we told you so " now maybe these are just tremors maybe the woes that recently brought two bear stearns hedge funds to the brink of a meltdown will shake wall street out of its complacency maybe the inflation scare fades maybe the markets are a little bumpy but theres no confidence rattling crash maybe congress tweaks the tax code enough to raise some revenue and let off populist steam without overdoing it but what happens if its more than that if these tremors turn out to presage an earthquake obviously that will hurt those who lose money but what about the rest of us part of the answer lies in the strength of the financial systems shock absorbers which have improved since the asian financial crisis the long term capital mess and sept attacks hedge fund amaranth advisors collapsed without many side effects it looks like the same may go for the two bear stearns funds whatever their fate recent history is encouraging the stock market crash as frightening as it was didnt tank the u s economy neither did the horror of the sept attacks the economy gulped and then rebounded that isnt any guarantee that the next crash or crisis and there will be one someday will have similarly passing effects on the impressively resilient u s economy but it is encouraging
