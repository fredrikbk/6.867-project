dinner and a powerpoint patricia handschiegels dates start like many other couples "we cook an amazing dinner grab a little wine " says the year old los angeles entrepreneur and then "we pull out our laptops and get some work done " toiling side by side for hours "we laugh and have a great time " she says "i know it doesnt sound fun " she adds but working on dates has saved her from a worse fate no social life at all she says she is so busy running a web site launching a second one and working part time in public relations that "i probably wouldnt have left the house or office" for any man if she couldnt bring her laptop along youve heard of working vacations now comes "the working date " many single people are so busy with careers that they dont have time for a social life so theyre increasingly blending work and romance for some the practice has provided a path to lasting love for others working dates are one more way to avoid intimacy or just a major turn off in part the phenomenon is driven by so many americans working wall to wall hours but also more people are plunging into all consuming entrepreneurial ventures at younger ages "as an entrepreneur you dont really separate" work and life says beth schoenfeldt new york co author of "ladies who launch " and more women have high powered careers making them a match for men who cant stop working either a matching work ethic is becoming a kind of compatibility test for many career minded singles a typical working date for scott friedman of denver a motivational speaker and humorist starts with "look im busy youre busy why dont we order in and well work " with one recent partner who also has a demanding career they would dine on chinese food at his kitchen table admiring the city lights from his windows "then wed work for a few hours " he says "at least " he reasons he could glance at his date across the room after that came dessert or a trip out for ice cream "the actual social part of a four to five hour date would be to minutes " he says the relationship ended for other reasons but the dates "made me feel better because i wasnt always the one saying geez i have so much to do " a subsequent relationship tanked partly because the woman wasnt as busy as he was mr friedman says although she agreed to pass time reading a magazine while he worked after dinner "it was uncomfortable for me because i knew she was just waiting for me to spend time with her " he says feeling guilty he broke it off "i decided i was better off by myself " some people even regard devotion to work as a plus in choosing a date true com says it sees a growing number of new clients who say theyre workaholics often including the word in the headline of their profiles as if it were an asset and match com says it sees men and women on its site using the term "hard worker" in their postings seeking dates both web sites are among the largest dating sites and claim tens of millions of users after starting her own business allie pfister owner of bollare a fashion publicity firm in los angeles says "work became my life " thus many of her dates with hayden aalvik founder of a web services business were consumed by work in addition to working side by side on laptops "you have the tv on so you can say you caught american idol " ms pfister says the couple has since split with mr aalvik heading back to graduate school but he too says he enjoyed the working dates "some couples have mixed doubles on wednesday nights but for us it was collaborating" on business he says ms pfisters marketing skills complemented his technical and financial know how he says so "it was just one more way for us to connect " on one date they brainstormed names for ms pfisters business "we spent the whole dinner writing down names and ordering drinks " ms pfister says looking at the placemats later "you could see where the martinis started to set in " some people may let work intrude on dates to prevent emotional intimacy ian kerner new york a therapist who specializes in relationships for match com says working on a date "says a lot about that persons inability to put a relationship first in their lives " fa karamzadeh a year old real estate agent in newport beach calif recalls that on some of his dates with an accounting manager one person would cook dinner while the other worked on a laptop or cellphone on such occasions he admits to wanting her "to put a little more focus into me " although he enjoyed her presence "i couldnt understand i didnt want to understand all the pressures of her work " he says working so much brings to the forefront "all the difficulties and obstacles" in the path to romance working daters agree that working on dates doesnt interfere with sex "when its time for sex its time for sex " says michael french a santa fe n m author on relationships but working can encumber the fine art of communicating making the leap from the gritty competitive mentality of work to the "intuition the give and take" of romance may be too much for some people mr french says "the values we associate with work success are very different from the values we associate with relationship success " to make working dates work make clear plans up front says rebecca morgan a san jose calif speaker author and productivity consultant who has had some working dates for example "say ive got a deadline i have to get this done if you want to come over and sit with me and bring your laptop or a book im good with that but know that i cant give you of my attention until after work " she says that gives your date a chance to decide "i really dont want to sit and watch you do this " talk about whether its ok to interrupt each other while working she says and agree on time limits such as "were both going to work until and then were going to watch a dvd " also if you dont know your date well be mindful of security issues advises diane mapes seattle author of a book on dating "i wouldnt leave my laptop next to somebody and go to the restroom who knows they could be cruising your email " she says if the stars line up working dates can lay the groundwork for a major romance liz dennis of new york city had many working dates with george allen "he works a lot and is always on his blackberry and i do the same " she says after ordering in dinner on evenings together at his apartment mr allen a principal in a private equity firm would take conference calls or work on his computer while ms dennis picked fabric swatches or designed a brochure for her new luxury cotton pajama business because he scouts fast growing businesses and she was forming one they found common ground "i think its made our relationship stronger " says the former ms dennis who is now ms allen since being married in the couple continue to work side by side and even type each others emails "for us " ms allen says "it has definitely worked out " email sue shellenbarger wsj com
