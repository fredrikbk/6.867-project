the afternoon report food for fed thought online edition the federal reserve will wrap up a two day meeting on interest rates this afternoon and while the central bank isnt expected to take any action on rates some news today may give policy makers plenty to debate at future meetings data this morning confirmed that economic growth was every bit as flimsy as earlier estimates indicated and that corporate earnings while not as meager as they were at the tail end of last year were far from stellar the commerce department said that gross domestic product expanded at just a annual pace the weakest showing in four years and that corporate profits after taxes increased that was better than the increase in the fourth quarter but it also made clear the pressures that companies faced as the economy slowed and even as growth is expected to rebound some in the current quarter companies are still facing significant pressure on the bottom line unsurprisingly much of the pain stems from the battered housing industry some wall street titans including bellwether goldman sachs group had their earnings smudged by the subprime mortgage fiasco the construction sector is still hurting too kb home saw a loss in its most recent quarter as the slump meant selling fewer homes at lower prices and banks and builders arent the only ones who have seen larger forces cut into their profits cereal maker general mills earnings rose by less than during its fourth quarter as the company was squeezed by higher raw materials costs even as it booked strong sales of its snack bars yogurt and soups and experienced strong international demand like other food companies general mills has felt the pinch from rising commodity costs whipped up by the interest in corn based ethanol as an alternative energy source earlier this week it effectively boosted prices on its top selling cereals by reducing its box sizes and pressures from the ethanol fad seem likely to continue spiraling prices for grains have made it more expensive for meat producers to feed livestock slicing into the margins of meat producers and efforts to pass on those higher costs have hit restaurants such as dominos pizza and wendys international which recently pared its outlook partly due to higher beef prices among the winners from rising corn prices seed supplier monsanto which posted a surge in profits and high energy costs make getting food out to restaurants and grocers more expensive the federal reserve is reportedly taking a second look at its long held focus on core inflation readings which strip out those food and fuel prices the thinking behind that focus is that the cost of food and energy tend to be rather volatile and thus more noise than signal but a long and clear upward trend in both categories has made them hard to cast aside and the central bank may fear its credibility could be tarnished if consumers start to feel that they are ignoring such pressures cleveland fed president sandra pianalto said in a recent speech that while she and other policy makers think that food and energy inflation will eventually fade "until our beliefs are validated by the data there is a risk that the publics trust could erode and inflation expectations could move higher " in todays gdp numbers the trends were on display as a price index for personal consumption rose higher than an earlier estimate core prices

reviving the stalled out immigration reform measure earlier this week the senate decided against moving any further with the legislation voting on a measure that would have limited debate and moved the legislation closer to a final vote president bush had lobbied hard for the legislations advancement claiming that it was an imperfect but necessary fix of current immigration rules the outcome likely puts off major action on immigration reform until after the elections and is a victory for conservatives who said that the measure did not do enough to improve border security or immigration enforcement in a last ditch drive to save the bill mr bush phoned lawmakers this morning to ask for their help and homeland security secretary michael chertoff and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez approached lawmakers as they entered the chamber but republicans led the drive against it "americans feel that they are losing their country to a government that has seemed to not have the competence
