politics &amp economics candidates shift funding tactics with big backers maxed out contenders tap small donors on march in an effort to close her first quarter fund raising books with a bang democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton held a &# a plate dinner at a miami area mansion that booked &# million for her campaign come saturday on what will be the final day of the second quarter the new york senator will headline another miami fund raiser a &# a head gala that is expected to pull in a more modest &# is this a campaign heading for the rocks hardly mrs clinton raised more than &# million in the first quarter more than any other candidate in the field her campaign says she will post a similar amount for the current quarter which ends june but how she and other candidates are focusing their efforts has undergone a significant change after a first quarter fund raising round that saw dozens of massive donor events and raised a collective &# million for presidential candidates many of them are bumping into a very real problem a lot of their most enthusiastic supporters have "maxed out " hitting the &# limit that federal election law places on donors mrs clinton and others have switched tactics and begun concentrating on "small dollar" donors hers is also one of the few democratic campaigns to make a firm prediction of its second quarter haul even as it attempts to damp enthusiasm for the fund raising of her rival illinois sen barack obama though the obama campaign said it expects to collect around &# million for the period clinton spokesman blake zeff suspects that is a lowball figure "we expect senator obama will report at least &# million " he said despite protestations from the obama campaign other rival candidates and democratic party operatives concur with mr zeffs assessment in the first quarter mr obama raised nearly &# million from supporters others in the race seem unlikely to do as well as either mr obama or mrs clinton delaware sen joe biden a darkhorse democratic contender raised &# million in the first quarter and is likely to disappoint even more in the second period an aide said on the republican side former massachusetts gov mitt romney likely will fall short of the &# million he raised during the quarter ended march and arizona sen john mccain is likely to post disappointing second quarter numbers despite reorganizing his fund raising staff and piling on a number of late high dollar events if mr obama hauls &# million or more in second quarter cash it will likely be on the backs of thousands of small donors who put up as little as &# to watch him deliver stump speeches at dozens of small fund raisers around the country mr obamas low donor model is attracting interest from other candidates the shift will be apparent in the final days of fund raising when mrs clinton moves from mega fund raisers such as the &# million plus event she did on tuesday with famed investor warren buffett to much more modest cash drives indeed this week in an email to thousands of supporters former president clinton mrs clintons husband appealed to the modest end of the donor community "come june all the campaigns will be measured on what they raised in the last three months " mr clintons email said "can you pitch in for hillary today " the minimum request was &# a stark contrast to the &# that wall street money managers paid to hear mrs clinton and mr buffett on tuesday evening in the second quarter the biggest adherent to the small donor philosophy has been former north carolina sen john edwards a democrat who has made great use of technology and employed a variety of unusual tactics to harvest small fry contributions in early june mr edwardss mother bobbie edwards asked supporters to put up small amounts in honor of her sons birthday either &# his birthday &# birth year or &# his age mrs edwards promised donors "my old family recipe" for pecan pie about people took her up on the offer the unusual drive was overseen by joe trippi a senior edwards adviser and a former top strategist for presidential hopeful howard dean though mr dean failed to win the democratic nomination he outraised all his rivals and was widely credited with remaking the political fund raising apparatus by harnessing the internet and targeting small donors mr trippi who stars in a humorous online video in which he tries and fails to make a bobbie edwards pie "you smell something burning " he says into the camera doesnt pretend he wouldnt like to have a schedule chockablock with big money events but with front runners mrs clinton and mr obama collecting a combined &# million a quarter for an election still months away the edwards organization decided to concentrate on developing a list of donors "who will be there when we need them " "obviously wed like to have both but what were really going to need is fuel for feb " mr trippi said when about states will hold nominating contests the edwards campaign reckons it needs &# million to get through the iowa caucus in january it banked &# million in the first quarter and expects to haul &# million or so in the second mr trippi said the pie drive brought in about &# along with something even more valuable the email addresses of willing donors who havent hit federal donor limits "the reality is that for those people who put up the maximum its over you can never go back to them again " mr trippi said at a &# a head event in a washington bar last week mr edwards probably drew less than &# from the or so people who showed up the campaign has staged more than a dozen such events and has raised about &# from them mr trippi said but in addition to mr edwardss standard stump speech at the washington event guests became part of the latest campaign experiment reaching potential donors through cellphones as he wound up his presentation mr edwards exhorted supporters to dispatch a specific code from their cellphones those who did were ambushed by a tape recorded call from mr edwards pleading for yet more cash next up a drive in which supporters were asked to host house parties for mr edwards a one night clutch of mini fund raisers hosts pledged &# and invited friends for a videoconference call with mr edwards himself mr obamas campaign staged a similar drive in the second quarter corrections &amp amplifications presidential
