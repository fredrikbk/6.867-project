who is helped and who is harmed by schools mainstreaming the practice of mainstreaming implemented correctly with proper supports has brought special education out of the dark ages and given millions of children a chance to maximize their potential "hard lesson mainstreaming trend tests classroom goals " page one june its efficacy in dramatically improving student outcomes is supported by a veritable mountain of solid scientific studies much of it decades old the sad truth however is that the individuals with disabilities education act is enforced less by the government than even the immigration laws and very few disabled children receive what they are entitled to under the law unless their parents enforce it through litigation the real issue behind the failures is money children with learning differences are expensive to educate and with the funding extracted primarily via local property taxes we as a country are simply refusing to pony up the cash unions and school districts ought to lobby to change the funding mechanism of idea to a more politically palatable source their choice instead to demonize already disadvantaged children isnt only wrongheaded and nonproductive but despicable mary tiesenga chicago principal larry miner has assigned an "unusually large number" of special needs students to his most capable instructor patricia mcdermott this decision and the reasoning behind it are typical for public school administrators is there another profession that routinely punishes its highest achievers by guaranteeing that they cannot succeed glena e mcdonald river forest ill you have insightfully captured some of the difficulties of mainstreaming i have participated in the successful implementation of inclusion classes as a principal why did it work the district provided a special education teacher and aides assisted each of the classroom teachers all faculty and staff contributed to the success including the speech therapist social worker psychologist reading specialist resource room teachers teacher aides lunch monitors and the principal as conflicts arose we all pitched in helping the classroom teacher and ensuring the education of the entire class everyone benefited academically as their hearts and souls were allowed to flourish help these educators provide the necessary personnel and dont allow administrators to "dump" large numbers of special education students in one class michael wolk south huntington n y our district merely tolerates my son and those like him in the "special ed room " they are shut away from other children giving them only other special needs children to model for most of the time ive long hoped that he could join a mainstream class to be around children from whom he can learn your article seems to suggest that he shouldnt have that chance while i respect and appreciate the personal effort that his teachers and aides make i have no faith that the district is going to do more for him than the absolute minimum that the law requires while i appreciate the challenges mainstreaming presents to "normal" children and parents and dont believe it is appropriate in every instance i resent the implicit message that the children are the problem not the schools matt kaufman palatine ill whether they are disabled or not children who attend inclusive programs grow up accepting everyone as members of their community learning from a young age that everyone is unique everyone has different minds and different abilities and that these differences are something to be accepted not something to be frightened of or hidden away katy franklin san francisco there is to be sure an interesting series to be written about the benefits and costs of including disabled people in all walks of life from elementary school classrooms to the workplace unfortunately instead of informing readers you turned the front page over to a teacher who somehow "lost hours of instruction time" when a student knocked photos off her desk this isnt representative of the best of the profession and thankfully the article isnt representative of the best of the journal mark igra seattle it seems to me that ms mcdermott is ready to retire if andrea wasnt in her classroom she would have found another child to fuel her dissatisfaction likely an overly energetic boy most of us dont have the same idealism we had when we were in our early s is that news christine berryman dearborn mich as a teacher with years of experience i know firsthand that this type of grouping is mostly counterproductive for both the students and the teacher bill lee hamer s c finally someone is willing to expose this politically correct notion that is destroying our childrens education my son has learning disabilities and i have found that public school teachers not only have little skill in dealing with his problems they have only basic grasps of the materials they are teaching the effect of mainstreaming my son was that on most days he came home dejected because the other students questioned and often teased him about his use of a second grade textbook in sixth grade he disrupted the class and the other students resented him the teachers passed him from grade to grade until we demanded otherwise always assuring us that his time would come when he would magically grasp algebra and geometry and attend college despite his difficulty with multiplication tables its time to return to sanity and give each child the education they need and deserve and stop using our kids to justify failed social experiments bob zeidman cupertino calif theres a big difference between inclusion for a child who is dyslexic and inclusion for a child who has williams syndrome educators will talk about differentiating instruction but the teachers at our school teach more than students per day in six classes there arent enough hours in a day and night to meet that expectation the kids in honors or pre advanced placement classes arent as affected as the students in grade level classes this is a huge disservice to these kids their parents and teachers sara stevenson austin texas
