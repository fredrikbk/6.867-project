the call to fight energy dependency as the chairman of the new select committee on energy independence and global warming in the house of representatives i think it is entirely too soon for your editorial page to be blaming my friend rep henry waxman for the activities of this committee a panel on which he is neither chairman nor serves "california dreaming" by matt kibbe march but speaker nancy pelosi most certainly deserves credit for establishing this panel to focus congressional and public attention on our debilitating national dependence on oil and the looming threat of global warming depending on the middle east for oil is a national security disaster that has become a major source of volatility in the financial markets we have the technology to change this over time and doing so will simultaneously help us reduce global warming pollution fourteen states have already joined in regional pacts to reduce global warming more than cities have signed on to the u s conference of mayors climate action plan and the public is demanding that our government wake up to a future that invests in cleaner safer ways of growing our economy the select committee intends to heed this call rep edward markey d mass chairman select committee on energy independence and global warming washington while i agree wholeheartedly with mr kibbes plea for congress to enact legislation that eliminates existing barriers to providing cleaner and cheaper fuels i strongly disagree with his reasoning as to why california shouldnt act now to fight global warming over the past years california has been able to achieve dramatic increases in economic growth per kilowatt hour theres no reason to believe we cant do the same with carbon what ab does is balance market mechanisms and regulatory measures to accomplish real change while ensuring that companies can meet the targets in the most cost effective manner and california is not going it alone in february gov schwarzenegger joined the governors of four western states to sign an mou creating the western regional climate action initiative which sets the stage for a regional cap and trade program and provides a framework for developing a national one almost every law i enforced as usepa administrator had first been pioneered in a state often that state was california especially where clean air was concerned under gov schwarzenegger its leading again and while mr kibbe doesnt dispute the threat posed by global warming neither does he propose how to confront it scientific and economic analyses have made clear that a failure to address the problem in this generation will leave an even bigger challenge to the next one william k reilly administrator of usepa san francisco
