the daily fix vancouver edges dallas after tense minutes online edition for the fixs money the best thing about the nhl playoffs isnt the stanley cup trophy the history or the upsets in last years first round all four western conference series were won by the lower seeded team no the best thing is the prospect of seemingly endless games like game last night between the vancouver canucks and the dallas stars in the regulation minutes of his first career postseason start star canucks goalie roberto luongo was mediocre allowing four goals and yielding a lead but in the overtime minutes mr luongo stopped all shots to help vancouver clinch a victory on henrik sedins fourth overtime goal assisted by his brother daniel sedin it was the sixth longest game in league history when a game ends at a m columns tend to wear their deadline effects proudly "lets be honest we were well into our third or fourth column having torn up a bunch deleted a pile of useless prose thrown out the section about how good the sedins were early in the game because after that it was taken over by the fresh legs a whole passel of dallas players and guys like ryan kesler and jeff cowan " cam cole writes in the vancouver sun mr cole adds "but in the end the stars not the stars got the last word luongo and the sedins finished it but its only just begun " thats a suitable mantra for the pittsburgh penguins after their disappointing loss to the ottawa senators last night in game of their eastern conference series "for a team with nothing to lose the penguins did everything to lose skating with scant passion or purpose losing almost every puck battle getting hit all over the ice and generally stumbling around like ingenues who have not yet grown accustomed to the high heels they are supposed to wear to the stanley cup debutante ball " michael farber writes on si com while mr luongo starred last night and into this morning one of his peers among the goaltending elite sat out his teams opener anaheim ducks netminder jean sebastien giguere has been understandably distracted since last week when his son was born with problems in both eyes one doctor later assured mr giguere and his wife kristen that young maxime olivier should attain full vision in his left eye and mr giguere is now back with the ducks though he didnt play in their victory last night over the minnesota wild "the ducks playoff opener was the kind of game giguere would have enjoyed fast paced hard hitting a fair amount of scoring chances " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times "the kind of game in which he excelled during the teams run to the stanley cup finals in when he shut out the wild three times in the western conference finals and repelled of the shots they threw at him but four years is an eternity in hockey long enough to change a lot only six players who wore wild uniforms during the playoffs remain with the team only three ducks remain from the squad that lost to new jersey in the seventh game of the cup finals a journey they made on the back of giguere and his playoff mvp performances as giguere has learned the world can change drastically in a few minutes let alone a few years to cope he is developing a different kind of strength now one thats not purely physical one that is deeper than he knew he was capable of mustering " also last night the san jose sharks beat the nashville predators in overtime four more series begin tonight including the detroit red wings the top seed in the west against the calgary flames detroit fans have grown jaded since the clubs last championship five years ago has been followed by several postseason flame outs bob wojnowski writes in the detroit news "the wings grip on hockeytown has slipped playoff ticket sales have lagged in a tough economy the tigers and pistons give detroit fans other winning options " the duke lacrosse case is over with all remaining criminal charges against three former players dropped and the players declared innocent by the north carolina attorney general the boston globes jackie macmullan takes stock of the impact the case has had and will have on those involved "what was once a prestigious battle cry im a duke lacrosse star became a shameful secret " ms macmullan writes "as one player told me it went from something i would have put at the top of my resume to not mentioning at all even so lacrosse players past and present stood by the coach and the team and kept waiting for the truth to emerge it was a very very very long wait " sports illustrateds s l price examines the odd case of mike nifong the district attorney who first pursued the case and blasted the duke players in interviews last spring "nothing in his long history as an attorney pointed to grandstanding " mr price writes "longtime opponents and allies testified to his integrity " what can explain mr nifongs trip from respected lawyer to "a rogue prosecutor " as the state attorney general called him yesterday "it wouldnt be a shock if his motives are never understood " mr price writes "over and over lawyers and people from the players camp desperate to figure out nifong kept telling me that perhaps the source of his zeal was his lifelong hostility toward duke university he graduated from the university of north carolina after all i barely listened at the time it seemed absurd to consider that a childish school rivalry could somehow be driving a rape prosecution but at this point it makes as much sense as anything " yesterday the fix noted that england looked set to dominate the champions league semifinals sending three of the four teams liverpool made things official yesterday with a defeat of psv eindhoven the fourth semifinalist milan which won at bayern munich to clinch a semifinal matchup against manchester united winners by a stunning margin tuesday against roma "the manner of milans victory was typical " rob hughes writes in the international herald tribune "it absorbed bayerns muscular but unimaginative thrusts then clarence seedorf and the inevitable filippo inzaghi scored in the space of four minutes game over what milan had it held where romans had capitulated on tuesday the milanese most assuredly would not the germans or those in munichs employ had neither the class nor in the end the will to break down the rearguard organized by paolo maldini and alessandro nesta " marquee matchups such as milan man u and chelsea liverpool would be the norm rather than the exception under a long discussed plan for a european super league that appears to be gaining new momentum cathal kelly writes in the toronto star the idea is that premier teams would break away from their national leagues in reaction to an expected plan at the other end of the spectrum that "will likely call for a new form of revenue sharing designed to steal from the rich to prop up the poor " thats standard in several u s sports leagues but would represent a sea change in european soccer daisuke matsuzakas fenway park debut was ho hum three runs allowed to the seattle mariners in seven innings venezuelan felix hernandezs debut at the stadium three days after he reached drinking age was electric a one hit shutout following a scoreless eight innings in his debut last week "this was a burgeoning star announcing his arrival to the world " larry stone writes in the seattle times "this was roger clemens breaking out in this was springsteen in an i have seen baseballs future and his name is felix hernandez moment and it was a pure unadulterated heist of a story line " found a
