figuring out what to feed your pet now recall sends cat dog owners fleeing to many alternatives issues with organic and raw amid the recall of dozens of brands of pet foods many dog and cat owners are grappling with a tough question what can they safely feed their pets nearly a month after the first products were yanked off the shelves recalls have since spread to about brands there is still confusion among pet owners some are turning to the slew of companies that have begun selling "organic" or "raw" products in the past few years others owners are so spooked that they are actually making their pets food themselves some are second guessing their decisions to feed their pets pricier foods such as procter &amp gamble co s iams and eukanuba &amp hills pet nutrition inc s science diet iams and science diet were both part of the recall along with many lower end brands suggesting to some shocked pet owners what many veterinarians have said all along theres little evidence that fancy pet foods are healthier than the cheap stuff pet food fears erupted last month after ontario based menu foods a pet food maker announced a recall of the wet food produced at its plants in kansas and new jersey when test cats got sick after eating samples the food and drug administration found that wheat gluten imported from china and used as a protein source and binding agent in the products was contaminated with melamine an industrial substance with no approved use in food that recall and related ones now include some dry food though the fda points out that only of all pet food products were involved in the recall the fda has confirmed animal deaths resulting from the tainted food but said many more pets may have been affected since the recall marie macaulay a retired nurse in davison mich has avoided pet food entirely instead she has started giving her cat millie jars of baby food she suspects her other cat who died suddenly last summer may have been poisoned "im afraid of cat food " she says while some pet owners may be so turned off by the recall that they take it upon themselves to make their pets food veterinarians warn against this pet diets need an adequate balance of nutrients and homemade food may actually put a pet at risk says claudia kirk associate professor of veterinary medicine and nutrition at the university of tennessee not enough calcium for example could result in bone fractures but too much calcium can cause bone deformation in growing animals dr kirk says vets advise that people committed to a homemade diet for pets should contact the american college of veterinary nutrition or talk to their veterinarian as for "organic" pet food veterinary nutritionists say these and other high end ingredients are generally more important for the pet owner than for the pet and some of the premium brands made with fresh or organic ingredients can cost more than double the price of standard products "we dont have any controlled trial studies to show that feeding organic or natural versus other types is better " says andrea fascetti an associate professor of nutrition with the school of veterinary medicine at the university of california davis newmans own organics this year unveiled a reformulated line of dog and cat food thats made with ingredients such as free range chicken and organic brown rice some pet owners are opting for a "raw" diet primal pet foods in san francisco calif offers meats such as human grade chicken pheasant and venison mixed with organic vegetables the company follows the so called b a r f diet which stands for biologically appropriate raw foods and says its diet promotes healthier coats and is more readily absorbed resulting in fewer stools that are nearly odor free says founder matt koss but the foods are pricey primal meals sell for &# to &# for a four pound bag yet veterinary nutrition experts say there are no data showing that such diets are healthier for pets they say one drawback of "raw" diets is that handling raw meats can pose a salmonella threat to humans and sometimes animals people should take care to wash surfaces as if they are handling raw meat for human consumption they say in addition pieces of bone in some raw diets can damage pets mouths and intestinal tracts vets say nutritional experts do say that more expensive foods are likely to contain more fat which can increase palatability meaning how much the animals like it thats not necessarily a problem vets say but owners should be aware that the recommended portion is often smaller pet owners should double check the label when switching foods to avoid weight gain in animals in general pet obesity is much more of a problem than pet malnutrition in the u s experts say a drawback of less expensive brands say veterinarians and food technologists is that the amount of ingredients may vary from batch to batch if one week the fiber content is higher than an animal is used to for example that can cause gastrointestinal upset some animal nutritionists says that consumers should buy from recognized companies such as nestle s a s purina and colgate palmolive co s hills pet nutrition that specialize in pet food and conduct nutritional research such companies are more likely to have done feeding trials establishing how well the food is digested they say dry foods are generally more economical than wet foods for large pets and can also have tartar control benefits for teeth but some vets say the extra water in wet food can be helpful for cats with urinary tract problems veterinarians say that switching pets diets suddenly can cause gastrointestinal upset they advise introducing the new food over a couple of days especially if the animal has been on the original diet for a long time the spotlight cast on the pet food industry by the recall comes as business is booming in the industry saw &# billion in sales up from the year before according to the pet food institute a washington d c group that represents manufacturers overall pet ownership is on the rise with million pet dogs and cats combined in the u s in up from million in according to the institute the recall has also highlighted the fact that so many different brands and ones with widely varying prices are manufactured in the same facilities according to a spokesman for the iams and eukanuba brands "the different branded products made by menu are not the same iams and eukanuba pet foods have unique recipes and important ingredient differences " food technologists and pet food manufacturing experts say this isnt unusual and is often cost effective for large producers of both human and pet food to contract with a single manufacturer that has the equipment to make a certain type of food in addition it isnt unusual that a common ingredient such as wheat gluten be used in a variety of products menu foods makes more than different recipes and the lines are cleaned between runs said sam bornstein a menu foods spokesman he said the contamination issue has been resolved and that food made by menu foods is safe "we continue to run taste tests on newly manufactured food and the animals are thriving " he said assurances like this one have done little to mollify consumers the fda said it received more than complaints from consumers and veterinarians reporting illness in the past three weeks more than twice the number of complaints typically received in a year by the consumer complaint coordinators
