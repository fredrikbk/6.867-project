fingerprints give a hand to security verifying identities through biometrics is poised to expand one day soon it may not matter that you lost the house key or cant find all five documents required to renew your drivers license instead youll need just your fingerprints for identification thats the future painted by a number of companies that are touting fingerprints as the preferred way to use biometrics peoples unique physical traits to verify identity indeed businesses and government agencies in the u s are beginning to use fingerprints as a safe and simple security tool though their approaches are quite different on the commercial side personal computers and cellphones have been the early adopters about of new laptops sold in the u s come equipped with tiny inexpensive fingerprint censors eliminating the need for people to remember passwords as the public gets comfortable with security procedures other uses for fingerprints such as on cellphones are on the way in japan cellphones already have been deployed using fingerprint technology as passwords and have become so widely trusted that they are used by about million customers for access to online bank accounts and automated teller machines and for point of sale credit card purchases fingerprints could also be used to replace keys to houses or cars later this year home depot inc stores in the u s and canada will begin selling door locks that can be programmed to open when they recognize a swiped fingerprint of the homeowner or as many as approved individuals home depot also plans to sell garage door openers with fingerprint sensors fingerprint sensing for commercial use is reliable and cost efficient said mark cohn vice president of integrated security programs at unisys corp an information technology company that offers security systems consumers need a system that compares fingerprints "one to one " he said in other words you want to be sure your fingerprint matches a single print already on file yours the accuracy standard for commercial use is no more than one error for every scans mr cohn said "the biggest problem with fingerprint identification is hacking and spoofing or fooling the system with a false print " he said authentec inc the leading maker of commercial fingerprint sensors has improved security with patented technology that reads prints on living tissue in a layer of skin below the surface said larry ciaccia president that eliminates mismatches that could happen with scarred or wet skin also because it senses live tissue the system cant be spoofed by lifting a print on a piece of tape or using a fake finger made from a mold of a real finger as with password systems stored fingerprint information is encrypted adding another layer of security still mr ciaccia said spoofing and hacking are potential problems that require continuous software updating government agencies face the challenge of making "one to many" fingerprint comparisons checking a fingerprint against a database of thousands or even millions of prints to identify individuals as a known criminal or security risk such one to many comparisons are used for u s border protection and at airports as well as in traditional police work "the big problem with fingerprinting is to get the forensic quality prints needed for a one to many comparison " said mr cohn the security expert in criminal forensics a one in error rate doesnt cut it mr cohn said "if you have a database of million that would yield tens of thousands of false positives all of which would have to be checked individually " too costly and time consuming to be practical the federal registered traveler program geared to speed up security screening for some airline passengers requires an accuracy rate that limits errors to one for every scans the program achieved that goal by comparing two fingerprints from each person instead of one in fact the way to optimize fingerprint accuracy is old fashioned carefully roll all fingers across an ink pad or electronic surface ten full prints offer all the more data to compare mr cohn pointed out criminal hunters also use more expensive fingerprint sensors to create digital pictures of dots per inch compared with dots per inch for commercial applications the federal bureau of investigation is now requiring even more detail with dots per inch mr cohn said a majority of americans have said they are comfortable with the use of biometric identification in a survey published in february unisys found that of those polled were worried about identity fraud and said they would prefer that banks credit card companies health care providers and government organizations adopt biometrics over smart card readers security tokens or passwords barry steinhardt director of the technology and liberty program for the american civil liberties union said the use of biometric identification raises legal privacy issues particularly if a big database were used for a national drivers license or id card program in the worst case the government could use personal information to keep tabs on innocent citizens he said
