the fannie tax democrat barney frank and the bush administration seem to have found common ground on new rules for fannie mae and freddie mac naturally theres a catch late last month mr franks house financial services committee passed a bill that would give a government overseer the power to limit the companies &# trillion in mortgage backed securities this has the potential to reduce the risk to taxpayers and to the larger financial system from the implicit federal subsidy the mortgage giants have used to grow like google thats the good news the bad news is that mr frank is an expensive date and his price for tolerating reform of his favorite corporate giants is dunning them for mega bucks in the name of "affordable housing " his bill would tax fannie and freddie to the tune of basis points of their total book of business or just over th of of all the mortgages fannie and freddie have bought and packaged to sell to investors thats more than &# million a year with potential to grow the bush administration has insisted that the fund be disbursed based on non political criteria but cmon this is washington while the first years payout is supposed to go for housing on the gulf coast a honey pot this sweet will soon be passed out based on the interests of the most powerful members the larger political danger is that such a fund gives congress an even greater stake in seeing fan and fred grow the fund amounts to an annual dividend payout to congress the fannie tax would thus make it even less likely that these "government sponsored enterprises" gses will ever be weaned off their implicit taxpayer subsidy and act like normal private companies congress could also look at this earmarked tax precedent and try to apply it elsewhere say on the profits of energy companies for a "global warming fund " one irony here is that mr frank is taxing fan and fred in the name of "affordable housing " even as he is cracking down on other lending to non rich borrowers one reason so many more americans have been able to afford homes in recent years is innovation in lending products by banks and other private financial companies while fannie and freddie grew rich by expanding into more affluent mortgage markets and yet the current meltdown in the subprime and alt a mortgage markets has led to calls by the same people now dunning fan and fred for all kinds of new lending oversight rules and restrictions mr franks latest brainstorm is to stick investors in mortgage backed securities with the losses when subprime borrowers default its hard to imagine a measure better designed to cut off credit to those mr frank claims to want to help if investors dont have legal certainty about the debt they are buying they wont lend the money and no new subprime lending means no homeownership for many americans but maybe this is what mr frank meant when he told bloomberg news that "more money was lent than should have been lent " the question is whether the other reforms in the bill are worth mr franks political price most of our allies in the fannie reform movement say yes james lockhart the current director of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight says he believes the bill would give him the tools to rein in the growth of fannie and freddies mortgage backed securities portfolios these mbss have been the main source of fannies growth and systemic risk as the companies tried to hedge their greater interest rate and other risk with derivatives that it barely understood mr lockhart has used his limited powers to hold fannie and freddie to account since he took office last year so his word counts with us in his annual report to congress released tuesday mr lockhart wrote that the bill "provides the basic building blocks of a strong bank like regulator for the gses " the political risk is what happens if the next regulator is a soft touch or works for an administration that wont back him up against fannies many friends and retainers in washington wed prefer the bill passed by the senate banking committee last year that strictly limited the size of fannie and freddies mbs portfolios as a matter of law but even a republican congress couldnt get that bill past the companies and the homebuilder lobby the barney frank george bush deal may be the best reformers can hope to get though everyone should keep his eye on the fine print as it moves through capitol hill the reason fan and fred became rich and unaccountable isnt because they knew the housing marketplace its because they knew how to work congress
