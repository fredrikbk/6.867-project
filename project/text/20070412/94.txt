steves jobs this is the thanks steve jobs gets for saving an entire industry cast your memory back six years a generation ago in high tech industry terms at that time in the interlude between the bursting of the dot com bubble which crashed the electronics industry and which did the same for the rest of the u s economy the one bright light in tech was the maverick upstart napster napster founded in was a pioneer in what would be called peer to peer file sharing what made the company so popular with users was that it specialized in the new mp music files it had an appealing user interface and best of all the music was free it was the last that drove established music artists and record companies nearly insane it began with the lawsuit by metallica followed soon after by dr dre then madonna and culminated in when a&amp m records was granted a preliminary injunction stopping napster from allowing downloads of any of its artists by then napster officially had more than million users but may in fact have had twice that many just as important napster and those imitators that tried to copy its success by working the corners of the law had set off a social revolution by the time the music industry began to contain the damage tens of millions of songs had already been downloaded and a generation of college and high school kids had come to expect the free exchange of free music what the music industry did next was a case study in bad strategy bad marketing and bad public relations not only did the industry crush napster and any other company that followed in its path but it also criminalized its own customers we all got to watch as federal agents arrested college kids music lovers and even a poor little girl living in the ghetto needless to say this program of applied troglodytics only managed to drive music downloading further underground turn americas children into small time crooks and make popular musicians and their record companies those famous celebrants of maverick and transgressive behavior look like the worst kind of freedom crushing rich plutocrats if anything good can be said to have come out of that train wreck it is that it has served as an object lesson ever since to content owners trying to protect their assets note how sumner redstone very carefully did not go after end users when viacom sued google over youtube and how he also offered an alternative pay outlet joost for viacoms video content for the next two years until the music industry pursued the single dumbest strategy possible in the digital age it tried to stop the progress of technology and deny users access to a new and more powerful industry standard instead the major record labels dithered unable to settle upon a single download standard distribution system or pricing scheme instead they devoted their energy to attempting to undermine each other meanwhile the download underground grew now populated by a growing number of indy bands who saw an opportunity to circumvent traditional media and promote themselves directly to the public by the beginning of the entire music industry was on the brink of disaster then in rode steve jobs to the rescue when apple computer first introduced the ipod in it had given tacit approval to illegal downloading with its notorious "rip mix burn" advertising campaign but as the ipod quickly became one of the most successful consumer electronics products in history million units sold as of sunday it became obvious that the company couldnt depend on content either from the underground or from a fractious delusional music industry thus the apple itunes music store which opened online four years ago this month only a technologist with the hollywood cachet of steve jobs could have ever gotten the major players of the music industry together and better yet convinced them to agree to a single download and pricing standard in doing so mr jobs very likely saved the music industry which was on the brink of seeing its entire revenue model destroyed by the black market instead at cents per song itunes gave music lovers a means to escape illegality at a reasonable price needless to say it has worked brilliantly with more than billion songs sold by itunes apple with of all music download revenues as well as nearly of the devices sold to play those tunes has deservedly been a huge beneficiary of this agreement but the music industry by being forced to actually accept a new industry standard and an attendant pricing structure has arguably benefited even more but to get the music moguls around the table steve jobs had to make a faustian bargain the paranoid record execs fearful of illegal copies demanded that every itune sold had to be freighted with digital rights management drm anti piracy software in practice this meant that itunes music could only be played on apple ipods the need for absolute proprietary control over both hardware and software has always been mr jobss achilles heel twenty years ago that philosophy cost apple computer a similar dominance in personal computers against an army of competitors working under a common "open" system so one can imagine apples ceo readily accepting the music industrys demand for drm knowing that it would give apple instant ownership of the online music business but mr jobs is older and wiser today than he was in and he can see the future even if the music industry cannot in a public letter in february he called upon the music industry to free itunes from the obsolete shackles of drm his argument was a sound one first as he pointed out the underground is still alive and stronger than ever for all of the success of itunes its downloads represent just of the total songs on an average ipod some of the rest are songs ported over from cd players but most are drm free downloads so why is the music industry straight jacketing its most popular distribution channel with an onerous anti piracy requirement further mr jobs went on to note trying to solve the problem by simply sharing apples "fairplay" drm code with competitors like microsoft and sony would inevitably lead to leaks of secrets and armies of hackers cracking the code and an even bigger black market no mr jobs argued the only real solution was to just abandon drm altogether as an artifact of another time and let the mp industry players fight it out amongst themselves and together against the underground for mr jobs it was a turnabout so astonishing that industry watchers assumed that the move was both cynical jobs turning on the music moguls once he had scale and self serving apple insiders say the move was partly driven by the impending eu antitrust suit perhaps but that didnt make it wrong less noticed was the underlying message of the memo that apple was so helpless in the face of its deal with the music industry big four universal sony bmg warner and emi that it had to take its case to the court of public opinion by all appearances the big four which control of the worlds music were unmoved by mr jobss appeal and then last week a breakthrough apple announced that it had reached agreement with britains emi to sell the latters music archives which includes the beatles without drm thirty cents more but twice the sound quality the first mass market improvement in music fidelity since the death of the lp a fair exchange good for emi is this a turning point in the story of digital music will the other big three follow suit one can only hope so the music moguls trusted steve jobs once and he saved them its time for them to trust him again if they dont they shouldnt be surprised by what comes next having squandered the trust of its consumers the music industry is rapidly losing the loyalty of its content providers as well artists have been the big losers in all of this and by necessity theyve had to learn a little about marketing and distribution software is software even if its got a beat so whats to keep steve jobs and apple from going into the music business itself mr malone is the author most recently of "bill &amp dave how hewlett and packard built the worlds greatest company " published this
