green light districts so the environmentalists have decided that light bulbs are the latest indicator of civilizational decline compared to "sustainable" sources conventional incandescent lighting uses too much electricity and hence is responsible for emitting greenhouse gases and global warming the only solution is for government to ban incorrect bulbs the greens may believe themselves more enlightened than the rest of us but honestly the great light bulb prohibition movement is achieving traction world wide in february australia enacted an outright ban on incandescents to take effect in in march the european union handed down a directive on "eco design for energy using products" whose regulations phase out incandescents within three years this expansion of the eurocracy will affect million people and all homes offices and even streetlamps in the u s al gore and other global warmists demand federal prohibition democrat jane harman has introduced a bill in the house that would outlaw "non conforming" bulbs legislatures in california connecticut and new jersey are considering similar measures the greens point to the inefficiency of incandescents which heat a tungsten filament inside the bulb only about of that energy is released as visible light the alternative is compact fluorescent lighting or cfls which are coiled tubes that excite a gas with electric current cfls are estimated to use one third of the energy of their conventional counterparts to generate the same amount of light no doubt this is a useful innovation the department of energy says that if every u s home installed one cfl it would save the equivalent of million tons of coal a year about half of residential electricity comes from coal fired utilities but those who would foist a cfl regime on the u s fail or refuse to notice that trends are already moving in that direction without government beneficence according to the doe compact fluorescents constituted of the u s residential lighting market in by out of the approximate two billion bulbs sold cfl share jumped to about this is a larger displacement than it sounds because cfls last roughly eight times longer than normal bulbs or seven years general electric which controls some of the u s residential lighting market has been aggressively selling cfls in ge tripled its manufacturing capacity and tripled it again in wal mart recently launched a major campaign to sell million cfls by which would double the cfl market share by itself cfls are only now experiencing growth because of technological advances in the s when they were introduced they cost &# to &# each they also tended to flicker and give off a harsh light now the per bulb price is down to between &# and &# and improved "soft white" cfls can mimic incandescent illumination other drawbacks remain though consumers are surely capable of evaluating for themselves the tradeoffs between energy savings and price as well as other considerations from the looks of it they are gradually transforming a market that has been more or less static since the s when thomas edison invented the filament bulb whats equally as illuminating is that the environmentalists cant make their case through argument and persuasion instead they immediately resort to state coercion even when it is as here superfluous see related letters "letters to the editor if greens persist that incandescent glow may flicker and dim" wsj april
