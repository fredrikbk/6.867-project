dow ends run at history stocks swing and miss and streak dies at record of is safe it was fun while it lasted until yesterday the dow jones industrial average was on its longest winning streak since up for eight straight sessions had it continued one more day it would have been the longest streak in more than a decade it was a quiet gradual streak involving a gain of just it ended yesterday with a decline of points or which in one swoop wiped out almost one third of the point eight day gain even a nine day run would have been nothing compared with what happened once in the gay s back when ragtime and art nouveau were hitting their heydays in the year after the dow was created by one of the founders of the wall street journal the blue chip average surged ahead for consecutive trading days to this day its longest streak ever total gain from may through june a whopping points by comparison it rose more points than that on its least eventful day this week back then points was a big deal it amounted to a gain over those two weeks or so and pushed the average to a move of that magnitude nowadays would involve a jump of points or so what was fueling the dows surge back at the end of the th century theres no one around who remembers of course but the average then wasnt the staid measure of established companies that it is today it contained only stocks not todays and only one of them is still a dow component general electric co today the second largest american company by market value after exxon mobil corp the others were staples of the industry of the day american cotton oil american sugar refining co american tobacco chicago gas laclede gas light co national lead auto companies barely existed bicycles were in vogue industrial stocks in those days were viewed as highly speculative and the dow jones industrial average in some ways was considered even more speculative than the nasdaq composite index is today industrial stocks were treated like the risky end of todays nasdaq internet stocks conservative proper people didnt own stocks at all they owned real estate or bonds the daring owned railroad stocks in the late th century if a stock "is listed on the new york stock exchange it probably is one of the railroad stocks that dominate the big board " says a history of the industrial average called "the markets measure " published in by dow jones &amp co the journals parent if it wasnt a railroad stock the history says a stock "might also be one of the new largely untested industrials among the stocks traded outside literally on the curb of broad street " back in the spring of investors were focused on the inauguration of president william mckinley a few weeks earlier and his administrations plan for an increase in tariff rates to help american businesses says economic historian william hausman a professor at the college of william and mary in williamsburg va "much of the press in may and june was related to the progress of the new tariff legislation " mr hausman says "if it was becoming clear that some kind of higher tariff would be passed that might have boosted stock prices including some of the companies in the dow " indeed president mckinley a pro business republican had defeated democrat williams jennings bryan a populist who campaigned on a pro inflation pro silver standard platform railing against republicans for wanting to "crucify mankind upon a cross of gold " american sugar then a dow stock was frequently mentioned in the press as a beneficiary of the tariff which was passed in july and which with an overall rate was the highest in the countrys history at the time american sugar sometimes called the sugar trust was accused of helping to write the tariff legislation the general market mood seems to have been upbeat that spring and on saturday may stocks traded on saturdays back then the wall street journal published a friday commentary from brokerage firm robert goodbody &amp co "the expressions of dissatisfaction with the state of business are heard everywhere and yet business is we believe decidedly better than it has been for over a year " read the commentary the firm sounding as upbeat as wall street firms still sound these days said the economy benefited from "more men being employed and at higher wages in many trades the exceptions being cotton and iron where there had long been overproduction " the market certainly had a lot of bullish tail winds back then but it was inevitable that the dow would at some point have a day streak given that it is up roughly two thirds of the time anyhow in some ways it is similar to joe dimaggios record game hitting streak for new york yankees in like that hitting streak the dow required the right combination of players skill momentum and a fair amount of luck "could it just have been random i really think so " mr hausman says
