the new crusaders as religious strife grows europes atheists seize pulpit islams rise gives boost to militant unbelievers the celebrity hedonist caen france with minutes to go before show time the seat alexis de tocqueville auditorium was already packed a fan set up a video camera in the front row a sound engineer checked the microphones the star michel onfray celebrity philosopher and frances high priest of militant atheism dressed entirely in black he strode onto the stage and looked out at the reverential audience for his weekly two hour lecture series "hedonist philosophy " which is broadcast on a state radio station "i could found a religion " he said mr onfray years old and author of books stands in the vanguard of a curious and increasingly potent phenomenon in europe zealous disbelief in god passive indifference to faith has left europes churches mostly empty but debate over religion is more intense and strident than it has been in many decades religion is re emerging as a big issue in part because of anxiety over europes growing and restive muslim populations and a fear that faith is reasserting itself in politics and public policy that is all adding up to a growing momentum for a combative brand of atheism one that confronts rather than merely ignores religion karen armstrong a former catholic nun and prominent british author on religion calls the trend "missionary secularism " she says it mimics the ardor of christianity islam and marxism all of which have at their core an urge to convert nonbelievers to their worldview mr onfray argues that atheism faces a "final battle" against "theological hocus pocus" and must rally its troops "we can no longer tolerate neutrality and benevolence " he writes in "traite datheologie " or atheist manifesto a best seller in france italy and spain "the turbulent time we live in suggests that change is at hand and the time has come for a new order " as with many fights involving faith europes struggle between belief and nonbelief is also a proxy for other concrete issues that go far beyond the supernatural in this case they involve a battle to define the identity of a continent half a century after the treaty of rome laid the foundations for the now nation european union europe has secured peace and prosperity but it is deeply uncertain about what binds the bloc together beyond mere economic self interest says ms armstrong "there is a big fight going on to define european civilization " in london last month leading british atheists squared off with defenders of faith in a public debate on the motion "wed be better off without religion " tickets cost nearly &# but so many people wanted to attend that the event was moved to a bigger venue with over seats it still sold out the audience declared the atheists the victors by a margin of to with a few score abstentions in germany a wealthy furniture manufacturer is funding a "think tank of enlightenment " a group of scientists and others committed to debunking religion it is named after giordano bruno a th century philosopher and cosmologist who was burnt at the stake as a heretic in italy one fervent nonbeliever has gone to the european court of human rights with a claim that the roman catholic church is guilty of fraud jesus he says never existed alarm over islam has acted as the prime catalyst for much of the polemic europes muslim populace estimated at between million and million people is growing more numerous more vocal and in some cases more religious the clash also feeds on a deeper confrontation that dates back to europes enlightenment the th century intellectual movement that asserted the primacy of reason over superstition "the battle over religion is restarting it is going to be a difficult one " says terry sanderson president of britains national secular society an organization that was founded in the th century but has now gained a new vibrancy membership has doubled in the past four years to around says mr sanderson for converts from christianity the society provides a certificate of "de baptism " "make it official " urges the societys web site www secularism org uk the atheist cause won a big name endorsement late last year when pop star elton john in an interview said organized religion turned people into "hateful lemmings" and should be banned the backlash against religiosity has even seeped into europes muslim community in february mina ahadi an iranian born woman in cologne germany set up the continents first muslim atheist group the national council of ex muslims she immediately started getting death threats and was put under police protection "our main message is we dont believe " says ms ahadi talking in a coffee shop next to cologne cathedral a towering tribute to faith that took years to complete a police guard hovered nearby atheism ms ahadi says must confront religion head on and adopt its methods her group started with just members in february and a month later had more than it is lobbying european union officials for restrictions on the veil and organizing a public meeting at which ex muslims will explain why they quit "if you want to work against muslim movements you have to be like them " she says "we have to go outside and say what were fighting for " europes atheist campaigners have also made a splash in america "the god delusion " a book by oxford professor richard dawkins has been on the new york times hardcover nonfiction best seller list for weeks another british atheist u s based writer christopher hitchens has written his own antireligious treatise "god is not great how religion poisons everything " due out in may christianity once the bedrock of europes identity has been losing worshipers on the continent for at least half a century though some opinion polls suggest the downward trend has bottomed out around three quarters of europeans still describe themselves as christians but only a small minority go to church in western europe according to polls fewer than do the number of atheists is hard to pin down some surveys put the figure at under but others say it is much higher when the european union asked citizens to rank values representing europe religion came last far behind "human rights " "democracy " "peace " "individual freedom" and other choices only chose religion religious leaders are pushing back against the assertive unbelievers the church of englands archbishop of york john sentamu complained in a december statement about "illiberal atheists who have joined forces with aggressive secularists " he was responding to demands that jesus be removed from nativity plays and that christmas parties be called "winter festival" gatherings mr onfrays atheist tract recently translated into english has prompted three book length rebuttals by angry christians and a flood of articles to counter prof dawkinss "god delusion " an oxford theology professor wrote his own book "the dawkins delusion " both atheists and their foes agree on one thing god declared dead over a century ago by german philosopher friedrich nietzsche is making a comeback at least as a focus of controversy "faith is on the public agenda in a way that is unprecedented in recent times " proclaimed the founding manifesto of theos a new british based christian think tank europes atheist movement has no vatican like central command and springs from many different sources some adherents have personal grievance mr onfray spent part of his youth in a home run by catholic priests who he says mistreated him and abused others ms ahadi head of the german ex muslims group says her first husband was executed by islamic revolutionaries in iran secular europeans voice dismay at american religiosity and worry that faith based reasoning is spreading in europe too many britons for example believe the christian faith of prime minister tony blair helped lead him to entangle britain in americas war in iraq there is also deep suspicion of poland a devoutly catholic new member of the european union its deputy education minister late last year urged the teaching of creationism the bible inspired alternative to charles darwins theory of evolution celebrations last month to honor the th anniversary of the eus founding treaty of rome were marred by squabbling over whether christianity among other things should be mentioned in a declaration defining the blocs basic principles atheists and secularists who believe religion has no place in politics campaigned hard to prevent any nod to christianity and drafted their own so called brussels declaration affirming europes secular moorings the faithful lost and the eu marked its birthday in berlin without any mention of christianity pope benedict xvi was furious "how can they exclude an element as essential to the identity of europe as christianity " he asked at a conference organized by european bishops europe is committing a "peculiar form of apostasy " the most potent force driving activist atheism is concern that islam europes fastest growing religion is jeopardizing the principles of the enlightenment and emboldening other religions to raise their voices too and re fight old battles "i have a big problem with islam " says mr onfray the french philosopher last fall he offered sanctuary at his house in northern france to a high school philosophy teacher who had received death threats from muslims the teacher had denounced the prophet muhammad as a "merciless warlord" in a newspaper article but mr onfray says his basic beef is with all religions not just islam europes disquiet over islam soared after the november murder by a muslim militant in amsterdam of theo van gogh an irreverent dutch writer filmmaker and antireligious polemicist then came a global furor over cartoons of the prophet muhammad published in a danish newspaper jyllands posten a french court in march ended a long legal campaign by muslim groups to jail the editor of a satirical weekly that republished the cartoons the court ruled that the editor had committed no crime one of the groups that initiated the case immediately vowed to appeal "there is an identity crisis we have to answer the question who are we one answer is to say were atheists " says flemming rose the danish journalist who first commissioned the drawings and now gets invited to speak to atheist groups muslim activism is encouraging other faiths to be more assertive university of london professor anthony grayling cites violent protests by british sikhs that forced the cancellation of a play in birmingham in and christian protests against the television broadcast of a london opera that featured jesus dressed in diapers christians and muslims both campaigned vigorously but without success to torpedo elements of a new british law that bans discrimination against homosexuals such faith based agitation says mr grayling threatens a "dark ages for free enquiry and free speech " atheism in europe dates back to the ancient greeks who coined the word "atheos " meaning godless socrates was convicted of atheism and poisoned early christians and their foes each branded the other "atheist " atheism as a philosophical system first took root in the th century british philosopher thomas hobbes dismissed religion as "lies " he fled to france there voltaire and other french thinkers took up the cause with gusto though many did not entirely reject the possibility of some sort of deity the soviet union enshrined atheism as a state creed mr onfray the french philosopher says he believed in god as a child in the same way as he "believed in santa claus " his impoverished parents a farm laborer and a cleaning lady put him in a church run home for orphans when he was he developed a loathing of christianity and now embraces what he calls "ethical hedonism " hes not married but has had the same female companion for years he says they have a "hedonist contract " which does not require monogamy but he says hedonism is not "about cigars vintage bordeaux and expensive cars " "to enjoy and make others enjoy without doing ill to yourself or to others this is the foundation of all morality " he says citing an th century french writer nicolas chamfort after nearly years teaching philosophy at a catholic high school mr onfray in set up an experimental college in the normandy town of caen near the beaches of the d day landing called the universite populaire de caen it has no exams no degrees and consists of public lectures by mr onfray and a few friends the local government helps cover costs and caens public university lets him use its main auditorium to the chagrin of its philosophy department which is headed by a devout catholic and takes a dim view of mr onfrays diatribes against god "frankly we think he talks a lot of garbage " says emmanuel housset a philosophy lecturer caens catholic theological college has tried to fight back maurice morand a priest went on local radio to denounce mr onfrays work "he is a fundamentalist who hides behind the ideas of the enlightenment " says father morand "we cant defeat him we can only denounce him " mr onfrays popularity shows no sign of flagging at a recent lecture the th so far an adoring audience held aloft lit candles and cigarette lighters in tribute a middle aged man took the floor to praise mr onfray for providing "the key to life " pierre andrieu a year old former executive with bnp paribas a french bank travels up to caen each week from paris for the lecture show he makes the trip he says because he shares mr onfrays take on faith and fears that religion is making a comeback "it is far more present than before " he says "this need for religion is very very strong religion is like magic it is all about tricks " ahead of frances presidential election later this month philosophie magazine arranged a meeting recently between mr onfray and the front running candidate nicolas sarkozy who sometimes attends church they argued about faith politics and philosophy as a gift mr onfray gave mr sarkozy several books including one by his favorite philosopher nietzsche its title "the anti christ "
