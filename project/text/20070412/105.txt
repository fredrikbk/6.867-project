the evening wrap bad chemistry online edition dow chemical summarily severed ties with a pair of senior officials accused of engaging in freelance talks to sell the company raising a thorny bramble of corporate governance issues but perhaps not stuffing deal buzz back in a box the two officials that dow pushed out were old hands at the company j pedro reinhard a senior adviser and director first came to the company in and had served as its chief financial officer for a decade long stretch ending in he warms a seat on the boards of royal bank of canada and colgate palmolive and until last year served as a director at coca cola the other man romeo kreinberg served as an executive vice president of dows performance plastics and chemicals portfolio his tenure dated to dow stated its anger in crystalline terms declaring that they "engaged in business activity that was highly inappropriate" and they were "involved in unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential acquisition of the company " andrew liveris chairman and chief executive said "we are greatly saddened by the disrespect shown by our former colleagues " dow didnt say just whom the men had been talking to or how far along any illicit talks may have moved for weeks rumors that dow chemical was a buyout target had been turning up in british and indian media outlets and investors excitement over various deal scenarios had sent the companys stock up sharply some reports suggested the midland mich company was in the sights of private equity players including kohlberg kravis roberts along with unnamed investors from the middle east some of the reports pegged the value of a potential deal at over &# billion a pricetag that would place it very high in the all time takeout rankings given that magnitude and the recent buyout tsunami talk of a play for dow exerted a powerful pull on traders but it also disturbed dows management which denied a buyout was in the works when another deal article trickled out in a british newspaper early this week dow decided it was time to start shaking the tree and attempt to pin down the rumors origins the company soon got a call from a source detailing the discussions that messrs reinhard and kleinberg had allegedly been conducting dow said it isnt yet sure that the two were sources for the media reports the developments will provide some fresh grist to recent corporate governance debates over who should oversee the sale of a company charles elson chair of the john l weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delaware told dow jones newswires that its the perogative of the board of directors to authorize such talks and that to have company officers negotiate a sale without informing the board is a real problem " but if messrs reinhard and kleinberg were put off their alleged pursuit of a deal that doesnt necessarily mean that the possibility of a deal is dead a number of analysts on wall street had welcomed the deal chatter even if a real live offer never materialized as they felt it might lead the company to boost its dividend or speed up its share buybacks in order to please restless shareholders and mr liveris has said that dow is considering a range of possible deals in a bid to smooth out its earnings which can swing about broadly with the bumps in the economic cycle dow stock
