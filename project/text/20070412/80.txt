purchasing health care how do you know what youre buying john c goodman "perverse incentives in health care " editorial page april is correct in stating that such perverse incentives create mediocrity in our health care system but his examples of systems that work are only partially correct while patients can shop for services for cosmetic surgery and lasik procedures walk into minute clinics or purchase pharmaceuticals from efficient providers this shopping is based solely on costs mr goodman even alludes to this when he says "people can compare prices and in some cases quality " the key words are "some cases" and the reality is there are few or no cases where true quality measures are available while we the consumers seem to want ever more data about the quality of the cars we buy and there are numerous sources for objective relevant data we continue to make purchasing decisions in an area infinitely more important based on anecdote satisfaction surveys and direct to consumer advertising hype until the health care system lifts its veil and lets us see behind the curtain mediocrity will continue to thrive frederic s goldstein president specialty disease management services inc jacksonville fla mr goodman goes directly to the conundrum at the heart of health care in america today as important as such progressive steps as health savings accounts may be "consumer driven health care" will not be viable until a free market in medical care can be re established while it unquestionably helps to involve patients in making choices and paying for health care the mechanisms to support their choices are just not yet in the marketplace in order for insurance companies and providers to start doing more of the right things the federal government has to stop doing many of the wrong things with medicare and medicaid to muck up the whole system state governments must stop burdening the insurance market with mandates regulations and the disallowance of competition from insurers in other states all government can help more by doing less richard e ralston executive director americans for free choice in medicine newport beach calif mr goodmans compelling call for entrepreneurship in health care alludes to the vital role consumer information on quality and cost will play in enhancing efficiency indeed most consumer markets are shaped by buyers perceptions of such "value" trade offs but the current trend toward consumer directed care in which the responsibility for the patients own good health is influencing treatment and payment policies will succeed only if a critical information gap between doctors and patients is filled physicians do not expect and are therefore not prepared to have conversations with patients about cost quality trade offs and health care value patients and their families however view doctors as the most trusted source of information on both quality and costs consumers certainly do not consider their health plan or the government as credible alternative sources this information disconnect must be reconciled by a trusted source perhaps an academic consortium or a health care consumer organization as pharmacists continue to enjoy substantial public confidence they too may play a key role finally incorporating information on the cost quality trade offs of treatment options into electronic medical records could arm providers and consumers of care with a clearer and more objective picture of the benefits and costs of choices affecting ones health a health care system that provides consumers with more options along the value continuum has the potential to enhance the efficiency of care delivery andrew m baker scarsdale n y it is a maxim that whatever the government freely gives it also freely takes setting an incentive payment for quality care delivered at low cost would quickly be altered as we doctors have experienced before medicare and the sycophant third party payers would simply ratchet the incentive downward if quality care can be delivered at say a incentive rate then why not at and so on i believe a more lasting solution is to once again allow providers to balance the bill for their services what an insurer or government pays for a particular medical service is decided solely by the insurer and the patient the provider then can negotiate with the patient for the remainder of the fee this allows the patient to shop for quality low cost medical care placing health care back in the free market robert j masi m d f a c s san jose calif
