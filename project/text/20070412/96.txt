style fashion journal rethinking expensive clothes designer learns to appreciate the value of cheap chic the cotton eyelet from china with famous designers creating clothes for mass retailers from target to gap consumers may be wise to ask whether its worth shelling out thousands of dollars for expensive designer clothes patrick robinson former designer for such well known fashion emporiums as giorgio armani anne klein and perry ellis has lately begun to have a change of heart when it comes to high end fashion he no longer has the patience for fashion shows and the inefficiencies of studio design that drive up the price of clothes without delivering real value mr robinson who is about to become targets sixth guest designer had this epiphany when he created his greek inspired collection in cotton gauze jersey and khaki set to debut in targets stores next month after spending four years as design director for womens wear at giorgio armani in the early s and most recently at paco rabanne the year old designer was accustomed to having a lot of creative latitude and access to the highest quality italian fabrics and workmanship but in turning out clothes for under &# for target mr robinson was surprised that he didnt have to compromise as much on design and materials as he expected the imperative that high fashion must be expensive is increasingly being questioned as more mass retailers adapt the strategy of commissioning upscale designers to produce special collections for their stores mr robinson is just the latest name to come to target which has had guest stints from up and comers louella bartley tara jarmon paul &amp joe behnaz sarafpour and proenza schouler these designers who arent yet household names but who are well regarded in the fashion world produce limited edition collections that are in target stores for just to days swedish retailer h&amp m has also caused a stir with collections by karl lagerfeld stella mccartney and viktor &amp rolf and starting on tuesday the gap will be showcasing a special group of white shirts priced between &# and &# created by critically acclaimed new york designers doo ri rodarte and thakoon of course high end fashion continues to hold sway none of these designers would have been in a position to be hired by mass retailers if they hadnt first gotten on the fashion radar by way of the runway shows in new york paris and milan the idea that affluent consumers will suddenly abandon expensive designer duds for mass marketers is highly unlikely for one thing mass marketers are limited in how many fine garments they can produce target and h&amp m have concentrated largely on casual clothes in a narrow range of sizes and quality can be hit and miss they have yet to conquer the highly tailored garments that simply cant be turned out at the mass retailers prices which typically max out at &# for those who can afford it it still makes sense to splurge on expensive wardrobe staples such as tailored suits and jackets winter coats and shoes where fabric fit and workmanship clearly make a difference most people justify splurging say spending &# on a handbag because they will get a lot of wear out of it "in some cases the status handbag is perceived to have more value as opposed to the &# dress that you will wear for one season " says pamela danzinger a new york based luxury goods marketing consultant still mr robinsons target experience suggests its increasingly worthwhile to browse the discount aisles mr robinson began working with target last may when he sketched out a collection of about pieces dresses skirts tops pants bathing suits evening dress and handbags and scarves inspired by ancient greek goddesses and the "essence of summer " he had all kinds of ideas for signature prints with faded medallions and gold coin embellishments he combed through targets library of fabrics and when he didnt find the fabrics he wanted target came through three days later with suitable alternatives from its extensive sourcing network in asia one cotton eyelet fabric from china in particular he says was "as good as what i would get in italy " one lesson that target had learned beginning with its ongoing four year relationship with designer isaac mizrahi was to avoid watered down looks by having too many people involved in the design process "we dont attempt to design any portion of the line " says trish adams senior vice president merchandising during the design process mr robinson had just one main point person to report to sally mueller director marketing planning "the fewer merchants that work on it the better " ms adams says "we dont have people weighing in " mr robinson says the process resembled his experience in traditional fashion houses where he decided the look of the clothes as well as made major decisions on the look of the advertising what target figured out years ago and its competitors are now discovering is that consumers respond to creative designer as opposed to brands designed by committees of merchandisers or endorsed by celebrities "what chains like gap are learning is that people want to be led by a real designer even if theyve never heard of them before " says david wolfe creative director of doneger group inc retail consultants mr robinson was prepared for the usual trial and error of fitting and redraping prototype samples as they came in from china a process that usually takes three times to get right he says he was bowled over when all samples arrived from china in less than two months with most garments needing minimal corrections "it went so smoothly it was shocking you cant get that out of italy " he says now mr robinson says he is so happy that his collection will reach so many customers that he is ready to switch the course of his career to design exclusively for the masses "i wont take another job in the designer market because i just dont believe in it " he says "it doesnt excite me anymore "
