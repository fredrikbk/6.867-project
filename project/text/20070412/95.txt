import and market modelo beers such as corona and negra modelo in the u s deutsche banks marc greenberg said the integration "may cause some hiccups" as constellation and modelo combine some of their beer operations and figure out pricing higher prices for corona which were put in place by the previous distributor and in some cases kept in place by crown could damp sales of the popular beer mr pecoriello cited this potential "weakness in the modelo beer business" as a risk for constellation along with the possibility of losing the import rights in years when the mexican company could buy constellations share of crown wine woes the wine business is "inherently unattractive " wrote robert van brugge at sanford bernstein he said wine is a "far less attractive industry than other consumer packaged goods categories " wine makers lose pricing power to wholesalers which isnt the case in many packaged goods markets hes also sour on wine because of the high costs saying that constellation needs to reinvest much of its profit "one reason constellations free cash flow remains so poor " finally the wine business is more subject to cyclical swings in agricultural prices "with low barriers to entry low grape prices hurt established producers " mr van brugge explains "on the flip side if grape costs are high producers have limited ability to push through the full cost increases to wholesalers retailers and consumers " write to worth civils at worth civils wsj com disclosures merrill lynch acts as a market maker for the securities of constellation the firm has received
