politics &amp economics iraq funding fight is two front war bush team broadens attack to include pork spending and withdrawal provisions washington the struggle between the white house and congress over an iraq war spending bill is really a battle on two fronts one regarding the war overseas the other budget priorities at home with polls running against president bush on the war the administration has turned to the domestic funding dispute in hopes of isolating democratic legislators as profligate spenders the white house press machine and its republican allies ridicule congresss &# billion plus package &# billion over mr bushs requests as a pork laden caricature crafted by irresponsible lawmakers incapable of managing the budget let alone foreign policy beyond the bluster administration officials privately concede that much of the added funding is appropriate and the real question is whether the white house and congress can agree on an overall limit for spending this year and next with iraq military costs eating up almost &# billion a month democrats argue that adding what amounts to two months worth of spending for domestic needs is warranted the white house fears that giving in now will invite less spending discipline in the new fiscal year that begins oct the official white house line was seen tuesday when president bush traveled to an american legion post in suburban virginia to lambaste congress again for spending "billions of dollars on pork barrel projects" and programs unrelated to the war yet hours later an administration official privately expressed hope that a deal may yet be reached on the extra "security" funds in the bill and that major pieces of the added domestic spending could be considered as part of the fiscal appropriations process "we agree that the funding is needed " the official said specifically citing added funds for homeland security and to help gulf coast states still recovering from hurricane katrina "we also totally disagree that it is needed in this emergency supplemental " house and senate appropriations committees have begun staff negotiations hoping to craft a single package to be reviewed by returning lawmakers next wednesday the same day democratic leaders agreed last night to meet with mr bush at the white house on the iraq bill within defense accounts there are differences the house provides &# billion more than the senate for operations and maintenance but overall both bills are quite similar in their structure and only about &# billion apart in total spending there is pressure among democrats to remove obvious political targets such as &# million to help spinach growers who pulled their product from the market during an investigation of an e coli outbreak last year there have been discussions as well about redesignating some of the funds possibly as agriculture disaster relief to give mr bush more discretion as to whether he wants to spend the money the iraq provisions which press for the withdrawal of most u s combat forces next year overshadow this spending debate but since a veto seems certain at this stage democrats are already focused on thinking ahead to what will be their second bill some democrats would argue for a delay to squeeze the administration others think a quick response is crucial to demonstrate they arent wavering before the president on the spending side one question will be how far the white house will go in defining the "security" related funds that it finds acceptable administration officials say added funds for base closings defense and veterans health programs could qualify as well as increased appropriations for the purchase of armored vehicles for the marines and army but democrats may want the same definition to apply to homeland security funds for domestic needs such as rail mass transit and new explosive detection machines to screen baggage at high priority airports one official said the administrations concern is that too much added spending becomes a "sleight of hand" to get around budget caps in "it is perhaps a very clever example of prefunding the budget " he said by enacting appropriations now under emergency rules outside the budget caps in truth both sides are playing the same game of moving money between fiscal years for their own purposes the white house for example complains that congress is trying to use the iraq bill to provide about &# million to fight avian flu money slated to come out of the budget but to help pay to rebuild storm wrecked levees in new orleans the administration is borrowing from another levee account for future improvements "since those funds were not going to be spent now better to tap them for the ongoing work " another administration official said but that means a future administration in will have to come up with the money something congress could avoid by adding &# billion now for the levee costs the situation is more complex regarding &# billion to buy and install explosive detection devices for airport baggage screening fewer than airports are equipped and congress wants to take care of more with the highest priority needs the transportation security administration has estimated that only of the funds can be obligated before the end of the fiscal year and the rest spread over the next two years but supporters of speeding up the funding say having the money up front will "jump start" the program because airports will be more confident about making the time consuming building changes needed to install the equipment
