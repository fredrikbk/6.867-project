mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q even though the new windows vista is now being included on most new computers is it still possible to buy a brand name pc with windows xp preinstalled instead a microsoft says it is still possible to buy machines preloaded with windows xp the companys deal with computer makers allows them to offer the previous version of the operating system for one year after a new one succeeds it and you arent likely to have the compatibility problems with some hardware and software that currently plague vista however it is hard to find a brand name computer priced and configured for average consumers that comes pre loaded with xp a cursory check of the online sites for the two biggest pc makers dell and hewlett packard under their "home and home office" categories shows that all of the computers offered came with various flavors of vista some models configured for business can still be ordered with xp so if you really want a brand name windows computer that comes with xp you can order a so called business machine but these models may lack some kinds of software and hardware features that mainstream nontechie consumers might want and could include some that consumers would find superfluous you could also forgo a brand name model and buy a computer from a local shop that is willing to preinstall xp instead of vista there are some downsides to buying an xp machine xp lacks some new tougher security features and the slick built in search that are included in vista also if past experience holds over the typical life of a new computer more and more hardware and software products will emerge that either will only work with vista or will work better with vista q we are contemplating buying a new lcd tv if it has a digital tuner built in do i still have to buy a converter for over the air antenna reception in a no any television that has a built in digital tuner for receiving digital broadcasts over the air wont require a converter in when all tv stations will be broadcasting only digital programming the only tv sets that will need a converter will be older sets without built in digital tuners q i have read a lot about running windows on a mac would anything prevent someone from going the other way and running the mac operating system on a dell for example since macs and dells are both based upon intel processors a it is theoretically possible and some hackers have claimed to have done it but their methods couldnt be easily replicated by mainstream users and dont enable all of the operating systems features so essentially the answer is no the reason apple owns the mac operating system and doesnt want it running on non apple hardware so it has erected technical and legal obstacles to stop people from doing so
