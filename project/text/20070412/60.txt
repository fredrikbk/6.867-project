justice at duke we believe these individuals are innocent " with those six words north carolina attorney general roy cooper yesterday ended a travesty of justice that had lasted days that travesty has been known from the start as the "duke lacrosse scandal " it began as a narrative all too familiar to those schooled in the "race class gender" ideology taught at duke and other prestige universities white male privilege in the form of the duke lacrosse team black female victimization in the person of a stripper from the other side of town hired to entertain them into this template came the allegation of rape unleashed amid the modern world of media saturation that elevates instant judgments mike nifong the durham county prosecutor harnessed the power of his office to this machinery of political correctness to bring charges against three of the team members and in the process win an election as it is mr nifong now may face disbarment which seems apt for such an abuse of his authority we wonder though whether any analogous sanction will be meted to those on the duke faculty who rushed to condemn the accused long before their guilt could reasonably be established at a press conference yesterday formerly accused student david evans noted that "were just as innocent today as we were back then nothing has changed the facts dont change " hes right facts dont change which is why they are free but unless we get past the narrative that prematurely judged them similar miscarriages of justice are bound to follow see related letters "letters to the editor duke professors need civil rights re education" wsj april
