financial leverage how u s used a bank to punish north korea nuclear talks are said to proceed as macau frees frozen accounts among the many strategies the u s has pursued over the years to get north korea to rein in its nuclear program none has had a more startling impact than the bush administrations decision to put the squeeze on a little bank in macau under pressure from the u s banking authorities in macau moved months ago to freeze some &# million in north korean funds at banco delta asia a bank used for years by the north koreans this weeks release of those funds is raising hopes that pyongyang will now move toward permanently halting its nuclear program and normalizing relations with the u s south korea and other neighboring countries after five decades to support these aims american diplomats are dusting off proposals to integrate north korea into the global economy and potentially allow it to join the world bank and international monetary fund returning from a visit to pyongyang yesterday new mexico gov bill richardson said north korean leaders told him that they "would move promptly within a day after receiving the funds" to begin decommissioning their yongbyon nuclear reactor though they may miss some deadlines set by the u s at the center of the diplomacy has been a saga of bluff and brinkmanship by the u s and north korea as washington scurried to choke off pyongyangs access to capital and north korea charged ahead with its first test of a nuclear weapon the u s tactic had its share of detractors even among strong bush allies even now its possible that the talks could unravel if the north koreans balk at a final deal struck on tuesday in beijing to release the frozen accounts still the banking story pieced together from u s officials involved in the matter shows how the bush administration is increasingly relying on finely tuned financial maneuvers instead of military action to try to influence troublesome regimes u s officials are implementing a similar strategy against iran which is thought to be pursuing its own nuclear weapons program last month they announced measures aimed at choking off key iranian banks and businesses of the elite iranian revolutionary guard corps the war against north koreas financial system and illicit businesses traces back to the early days of the bush administration which had dubbed the country part of the "axis of evil" along with iran and iraq looking for weaknesses in the kim regime then secretary of state colin powell and his aides focused on how the government was funding itself amid a stagnating economy and chronic food shortages some of mr powells aides surmised that pyongyang might be raising money through black market sales of heroin counterfeit cigarettes and other contraband items in pursuing these leads u s officials spotted a common thread the use of macau as a hub to move north koreas ill gotten wealth funds deposited in banks in this chinese enclave a slightly seedy port city formerly run by portugal and known for its casinos were being used to procure components for north koreas nuclear and missile programs u s and asian intelligence officials allege "the more we bore down into north koreas network the more we started to focus on macau " says david asher a former state department official who oversaw the bush administrations financial war against north korea during its first term by early bush administration officials were ready to take the next big step six party talks among the u s north korea china japan russia and south korea to end pyongyangs nuclear program had stalled seven months earlier u s officials fretted that the norths erstwhile ally china wasnt doing enough to pressure pyongyang treasury and state department officials decided to apply their own pressure using a money laundering provision in the patriot act the statute known as section allows the u s to bar its banks from doing business with institutions allegedly involved in illicit businesses the u s had previously invoked it to sanction banks in latvia and syria among others that had allegedly processed drug and terrorist funds after rejecting a proposal to target the bank of chinas macau branch for fear of angering the chinese the administration focused on banco delta asia a small family run bank with customers and &# million in deposits founded in the s bda had nine branches in macau and two in nearby hong kong u s intelligence officials had been following its interactions with north korean businesses since the mid s and saw it as a major node in north koreas foreign financial dealings "we decided " says mr asher "to kill the chicken to scare the monkey " the chinese proverb refers to the strategy of getting the small guy bda to scare the big guy which in this case was the government of north korean dictator kim jong il and some large chinese banks on sept the u s publicly accused bda of being "a willing pawn for the north korean government " alleging that it had helped conduct "surreptitious multimillion dollar cash deposits and withdrawals" for front companies involved in counterfeit currency drugs and other illegal activities for more than years the u s said it was weighing whether to bar all u s banks from doing any business with bda bdas chairman stanley au disputed the allegations but by noon the next day long lines of depositors had withdrawn more than &# million in cash from the bank the macau monetary authority set up a team to investigate bda and two days later took over its management and froze more than north korean accounts with about &# million in deposits among them were accounts held by north korean state owned banks held by trading companies and nine held by individuals state run zokwang trading co accused by the u s in of passing hundreds of thousands of dollars in counterfeit u s currency into hong kong held a number of accounts treasury alleged that another account holder state owned tanchon bank has financed north koreas weapons programs the u s move came at a delicate time for the north korea talks negotiations had sputtered back into motion and on sept the six participating countries agreed to a tentative package aimed at dismantling north koreas yongbyon nuclear plant but when negotiators met again in beijing two months later north koreas envoy kim kye gwan lashed out during a private plenary session he accused the u s of heaping more sanctions on his country and called the bda action "intolerable " says one u s official who was present "at first we thought it was one of those typical blustery north korean speeches that often go away like a summer shower " he says "but this one just stayed they never stopped talking about it " the chinese too were miffed that the u s had thrown a wrench into the negotiations and told chris hill the u s assistant secretary of state who was leading the u s side of the talks as much but apparently fearing their banks could be targeted too they also quietly froze a number of north korean accounts at the bank of chinas macau branch other countries like vietnam and mongolia began to restrict north korea linked transactions these developments hit north korea hard say westerners who were in pyongyang around that time the value of north koreas won dropped sharply on the black market as access to hard currency dried up foreign aid groups tied to the united nations faced difficulties bringing foreign currency in and out of the country some innocent businesses got caught up in the dragnet daedong credit bank a joint venture between north koreas state owned daesong bank and a hong kong based investment company says about &# million of its funds were frozen in bda of that figure &# million were funds owed to its client british american tobacco plc bat runs a small manufacturing facility in pyongyang in a joint venture with a north korean trading firm in february mongolian intelligence officials detained daedong couriers seeking to deposit &# million and million yen in cash at ulan bators golomt bank daedong says its couriers were carrying cash because north korea doesnt have any computerized systems to make money transfers the money was later cleared as genuine but colin mcaskill a british citizen who heads the hong kong investment fund that owns a majority stake in daedong says the damage was done under pressure from treasury banks in mongolia and vietnam "told us we had to close our accounts there because of their new strategic alliance with the u s " which was warning asian banks against doing business with north korea he says as financial pressure mounted on pyongyang in spring u s officials met with their north korean counterparts in a cramped conference room at the u s mission to the u n to explain their actions against bda deputy assistant treasury secretary daniel glaser gave a minute tutorial on section and explained that the chain reaction set off by the bda action was "merely market forces doing their job " no resolution of the bda action would come he added until pyongyang explained its voluminous transactions at the bank the north koreans responded with their own demands besides seeking an end to the bda action they wanted a shipment of counterfeit currency detectors to keep what they described as fake u s notes from entering their financial system they also asked for help to open an account at j p morgan chase &amp co saying they needed it to conduct dollar denominated transactions mr glaser and the other u s officials were noncommittal saying the session wasnt a negotiation that angered the north koreans further and the two sides had no contact for the next seven months over the next few months treasury officials traveled across asia to warn local bankers of the risk of doing business with north korea pyongyang responded with its own message it test fired eight missiles in july then three months later in october it detonated an underground nuclear device five days after the nuclear test the u s china russia france and britain voted for a u n resolution to impose limited economic sanctions on north korea a number of chinese banks cut off transactions with north korea the north korea test sparked some finger pointing within the bush administration and in asia officials and experts questioned whether the bda action by delaying the discussions had won north korea more time to develop a nuclear device or had even provoked it to test one but ensuing talks between the u s and north korea showed how critical the frozen bda accounts were to pyongyang after blasting the u n resolution as "an act of war " north korea softened its position at a secret meeting with the u s in beijing on oct mr hill suggested that the u s might be prepared to resolve the bda action if north korea agreed to return to the negotiating table his north korean counterpart mr kim accepted stressing that the bda issue was of paramount importance to pyongyang two days after thanksgiving mr hill sat down again in beijing with mr kim anxious that north korea might still be waffling mr hill warned that if the north koreans didnt return to the talks ready to make a deal the u s was prepared to increase the financial pressure "we have the capacity to go after your activities all over the world " he said "if you want to go open an account on the moon we can go after that " the response from mr kim says one u s official present at the session "was just gulp " the outlines of an overall deal came into focus during two days of meetings between messrs hill and kim in january in berlin under the deal the u s and other countries would provide fuel oil and other aid to north korea in addition to resolving the bda case pegged to pyongyangs moving toward full denuclearization a week later treasury officials flew to beijing to sift through bdas north korean accounts and identify those linked to suspicious transactions the north koreans provided some details on the accounts but denied that any north korean entities had been involved in counterfeiting u s currency in one exchange the lead north korean negotiator o chung kwal alleged that then secretary of state madeleine albright had brought the bad bills in when she visited pyongyang in an accusation u s negotiators shrugged off as laughable still the talks provided a road map for how north korea could retrieve at least some of its funds from bda treasury said it would close its investigation of bda within days of a signed denuclearization deal on feb after resolving disputes over how much oil aid north korea would receive for shuttering its nuclear reactor at yongbyon the u s north korea and the other parties in the talks signed off wrapping up the bda episode proved to be complicated the treasury department formally blacklisted the bank on march for its alleged illicit business but said macau would release any north korean funds found to be clean after north korea protested treasury sent a delegation to beijing for negotiations that stretched on for two weeks and focused on creating a mechanism to release the &# million into a fund for humanitarian projects the transfer itself got bogged down as banks in china balked at getting involved for fear of being punished for receiving tainted money many conservatives have criticized the policy turnabout including plan architect mr asher focusing particularly on the return of the tainted funds "weve now unfortunately sent the message to kim jong il that he can get away with counterfeiting and blackmail and that theres no lasting price to pay for his coercion and crime " mr asher says others are hopeful the u s north korea dialogue on bda could be broadened into wider talks to bring pyongyang into the global economy some of the u s negotiators say that rather than finding their north korean counterparts menacing they often felt sorry for them the bda episode illustrates just how little north korea understands about the outside world they say which only fuels its belligerence if it can be integrated into international bodies and diplomacy they say it may gradually moderate itself
