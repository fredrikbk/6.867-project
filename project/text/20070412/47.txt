assemblyman in tried to push through a state resolution recognizing his city as "surf city huntington beach " waves of protest from santa cruz helped entice a local representative to sink the resolution in the huntington beach bureau kicked off a "surf city usa" promotion that was the brainchild of doug traub the bureaus president who envisions huntington beach as a tourist destination with surf city usa events and goods his plan includes building a surf museum with a lighted foot tall glass surfboard visible from miles away passing it youd get "a little flutter in your heart and youd say wow " mr traub says his first step was to file trademark applications with the u s patent and trademark office so far huntington beach has been granted trademarks allowing it to advertise itself as "surf city usa" and to market scores of surf city usa branded goods and services including clothing volleyballs bicycles inflatable pools handbags software and concerts pending applications

surf off that would decide the rightful owner of the title in august a northern california state senator submitted a state resolution to have santa cruz designated "surf city usa " huntington beach lobbied against it and the resolution died the nolands fell into the froth when bruce chose the words to print on a new t shirt that reads from top to bottom "surf city santa cruz california usa " mr noland says he didnt know at the time that the huntington beach bureau had applied for a trademark though he was aware of a "little fight " the shirts landed on shelves in august the nolands had sold

newspaper article that refers to santa cruz as "surf city " the suit recounts how nephews of queen kapiolani of hawaii the unchallenged birthplace of surfing surfed the san lorenzo river on redwood boards in and how the patron saint of surfing hawaiis duke kahanamoku rode waves on santa cruz shores in the huntington beach bureau filed a counterclaim declaring that "santa cruz is a somewhat dated seaside town that has no particular prominence in surfing culture " the claim asks the court to declare that the nolands infringed huntington beachs trademark the two parties will try to resolve their differences with a court appointed mediator on april if a settlement isnt reached the case will go to trial in september next year mr sybert the huntington beach lawyer says he believes the nolands
