politics &amp economics capital whats changed in the protracted health care debate debating the ailments of the american health care system is a chronic disease it sometimes seems the same experts have been making the same points for decades the u s spends more on health care than other countries but doesnt have healthier people americans with generous insurance use health care readily and doctors provide it on demand because third parties pay the bill and so on "i remember this from " former treasury secretary robert rubin said this week at a washington forum recalling his years in the clinton administration "every time i think about health care i get a headache " it would be easy to fill a column with the ways in which the health care debate never changes but without offering optimism that a grand solution is imminent three things are now apparent that if not new at least werent widely appreciated or years ago employer based health insurance is slowly dying the notion that requiring employers to provide health insurance is the best route to universal coverage is fading sure nearly of americans still get health insurance on the job but even in a growing economy with a tight labor market employer coverage is eroding fifteen years ago says joseph antos of the conservative american enterprise institute "large employers were concerned about rising health spending but they were not leading the march to a big solution " now they want out employers either through premiums or through taxes will be paying part of the health care tab for a long time but there is surprising interest in requiring that every individual get health insurance and then subsidizing those who cant afford it we dont know as much about medical science as we need to know it always has been true that there is a lot about disease doctors didnt know and it is true doctors can cure diseases that were killers just a decade ago but it is also increasingly clear that ignorance about what treatments work well and for whom is very costly especially as new treatments are discovered and new technologies deployed the flap over stents versus drugs for heart disease is only the latest example "i dont think there was very much recognition years ago about how little we know in areas that we spend large amounts of money on " says economist gail wilensky a former medicare administrator now at project hope a global public health charity dartmouth medical school researchers have been showing for decades how differently medicine is practiced from one town to the next there is surprisingly little agreement on what works and what doesnt there is however a consensus that figuring that out is important and getting the health care system to make better use of information technology is crucial to that end americans want a lot of health care are willing to pay for a lot of it and dont like their choices limited maybe this isnt exactly new but it is more certain americans rebelled against managed care and particularly didnt like employers forcing them to enroll "one of the lessons of the s is that every consumer insists on the right to choose a poor quality physician " ronald williams chief executive of aetna inc said at that washington forum which was sponsored by the hamilton project the outfit mr rubin and others founded to devise ideas for centrist democrats so no matter how many experts prescribe big integrated health care plans as the best way to get medical care americans wont be forced into them some may choose such plans but they want choice and politicians wont enact legislation that denies them choice politicians and employers may however be willing to make americans pay to satisfy their unlimited hunger for health care president bush no fan of tax increases has proposed raising taxes on those with the most generous health plans jason furman a former clinton and kerry campaign aide floated a proposal this week that says americans ought to pay more for the health care they buy with the best off paying more out of pocket than the poor some say the biggest change is that the anxiety of american workers and businesses about the costs and shortcomings of the u s health care system have reached a crescendo and something big will happen soon could be but weve heard that before one veteran of the health care wars robert reischauer the former congressional budget office director who now heads the urban institute think tank observes a repeating year cycle in which "building optimism and enthusiasm" about big time health reform is "dashed by realities and politics " complaints about the american health care system havent yet produced the political will to do something particularly since that something will pinch some big interests and generate fierce opposition no matter what form it takes some things dont change mr wessel responds to reader comments at wsj com capitalexchange or email him at capital
