hope where there was none when sub saharan africa makes headlines it is usually about poverty disease and conflict from wars fought over diamonds oil and mineral wealth to famines and diseases that devastate entire communities africas misery is well known the desperate need on this vast sub continent is undeniable nearly half of africas population struggles to survive from one day to the next on less than &# in the past quarter century when half a billion people managed to escape poverty world wide largely due to private sector growth in east and south asia the number of poor in sub saharan africa nearly doubled africa is the one continent that is expected to fall short of the millennium development goals to halve poverty and improve basic social indicators by yet almost without notice that bleak landscape is changing in many places across africa peace and growth are taking hold we are seeing conflicts recede and small businesses emerge we are seeing hope where there was none over the past decade a total of african countries that are home to one out of three africans have consistently achieved annual growth rates of or better perhaps the most unexpected progress is unfolding in countries that have emerged from decades of horrible conflict in rwanda where nearly a million people were killed in a horrendous genocide years ago growth has averaged in the last decade and mozambique a country ravaged by years of civil war has averaged growth both countries invested in infrastructure eased regulations to make it easier to start a business and worked hard to attract private investors behind these growth figures are stories of human triumphs and real improvements in peoples lives with more children attending school and more mothers delivering healthy babies africas progress is by no means uniform but it is a striking change from the past without question growing peace and stability are major factors behind this change although zimbabweans continue to suffer in the ongoing crisis and some conflicts persist especially the horror that is darfur for countries like liberia burundi sierra leone and the democratic republic of congo there is hope where for years there was only violence and atrocities african countries are also making progress because they are taking serious steps to improve their governance ghana kenya mauritius and rwanda were the first four countries to subject their governance systems to a rigorous examination as part of the african peer review mechanism it is not an accident that three of these countries are among the relatively good performers this recognition by leaders is paralleled by an increasingly informed african citizenry which is also calling for change after more than two decades of devastating war and conflict liberias citizens voted in their first elections just over a year ago they voted overwhelmingly for an economist who pledged to pursue reforms and rebuild the country she is now africas first female president ellen johnson sirleaf rich countries themselves recognize the importance of good governance in africa and have placed it high on the g s development agenda they too can help encourage governance improvements by sanctioning their own bribe givers and by helping poor countries recover assets stolen by corrupt leaders the african countries that are making progress are also doing so because their leaders are learning from the past and from the experience of others tanzania ghana and mozambique are revisiting doctrinaire economic policies and creating space for their private sector to thrive they were inspired to do so in no small measure by the success of reforms in developing countries like east and south asia the demonstration that sustained economic development is possible has resonated with leaders and ordinary citizens alike last year the world bank hosted high level delegations from african countries in kuala lumpur to learn about malaysias development experience fifty years ago malaysia and ghana started out with nearly the same endowment of human and natural resources yet today malaysias per capita income is nearly times that of ghanas and extreme poverty is almost nonexistent but ghana has started to make up for lost time in the last decade it achieved average real growth of nearly per year and managed to reduce extreme poverty from nearly one half to one third of the population it is starting to become an african example of success for others to emulate indeed president joseph kabila of the democratic republic of the congo came away from ghanas th anniversary celebrations last month marveling at what ghana had accomplished the most compelling examples for progress are the ones closest to home the questions before anyone whose conscience is moved by the tragedies of africas past is how can we encourage todays good performers to become outstanding performers and how can we encourage the other two thirds of the subcontinent to follow their example much of the answer of course lies in sustaining and improving sound economic policies and good governance and that will depend most of all on the african people and their leaders but a large part of the answer lies in providing more resources and here the rich countries need to do much more than they currently are true without sound policies and good governance money alone will not do much good and it can even do harm but without resources to invest in education in health care and in the infrastructure that businesses need to grow good policies alone cant achieve much either in tanzania and ghana businesses struggle to survive with power outages that often last hours per day and with telecommunications charges that would bankrupt businesses in the u s or europe that means lost jobs and lost opportunities more children who grow up without education and more people denied urgent health care the successful east asian emerging economies benefited enormously from public sector investment in education rural development and physical infrastructure much of it financed by foreign assistance in korea foreign funding financed nearly half of public investments during the formative years which paved the way for its spectacular development success for africa and the poorest countries in the world a critical source of development financing comes from the international development association or ida the world bank groups soft lending arm last fiscal year ida support to the poorest countries reached a historic high of &# billion with half of that dedicated to africa in uganda ida resources were used to improve water and sanitation in small towns supplying water to some residents and in ethiopia ida resources helped demobilize soldiers and integrate them into civilian life allowing the government to shift its spending from defense to social sectors this year donors are discussing the next triennial round of replenishment for ida a higher level of commitment is needed from the international community one that will match the ambitions and aspirations of the african people today we are seeing a new generation of african leaders who are increasingly aware of their responsibility to their people and pushing for reforms they are giving the world compelling reasons to support their efforts they dont want charity what they want and deserve is opportunity and that is a historic opportunity for the rest of us an opportunity to help africas energetic and capable people join in the march out of poverty that is transforming so much of the developing world today mr wolfowitz is president of the world bank group
