a culture driven by impatience for the future nostalgia for the past barcelona and modernity metropolitan museum of art through june new york could it be a case of too many cooks "barcelona and modernity gaudi to dali " on view at the metropolitan museum of art through june lists a quintet of blue ribbon curators backed up by a quartet of similarly distinguished scholarly advisers an epic of identity and self image of aspiration and accomplishment of native genius and a yen for the exotic underscored by the rumble of socioeconomic industrial and political upheaval the show is all this and more the period under review extends from the september revolution of which temporarily brought down the spanish monarchy to the fall of the second spanish republic and the imposition of fascism under francisco franco in the checklist runs to some items including paintings sculpture drawings prints posters periodicals and other ephemera jewelry hardware housewares furniture and architectural models no one can fault the organizers the cleveland museum of art and the met in association with the museu nacional dart de catalunya barcelona for failing to think big a proud "rooster greeting the dawn" lords it over the orientation gallery making a grand first impression one of four wrought iron cocks of the walk designed by lluis domench i montaner for a faux medieval red brick tower he crows with heraldic abandon a more suitable mascot could scarcely be imagined especially as displayed against the picture postcard backdrop of the spires of the temple de la sagrada familia that dribbling iconic construction you should know was already in progress when the year old antoni gaudi signed on as architect of record in "the patron of this project " gaudi remarked meaning god "is not in a hurry " today the target date for completion is well into the fourth decade of the current century past that pitch perfect opening flourish the show quickly starts to wobble of blockbuster proportions it actually breaks down into nine fairly manageable sections that fly off in as many different directions whatever linear narrative may have been intended the material subverts it at every turn and that is perhaps as it should and must be as much as by impatience for some utopian tomorrow the culture was driven forward there is no other direction by nostalgia for a past steeped in retrospective romance to open there are materials on city planning the tearing down of the medieval walls the laying of europes first urban grid cheek by jowl with a focus show of catalan expat painters on the prowl in paris a very young pablo picasso born in the andalusian port of malaga but an honorary catalan by association makes his first appearance here putting to shame the well heeled ramon casas whose canvases from the moulin de la gallette a hot night spot in monmartre look thoroughly bourgeois his lone blonde at a side table hair piled high wary glance trailing off to her right glass of absinthe at the ready cigar in hand exudes all the mystery of a norman rockwell casas was in his mid s when he painted her in visiting the gallette nearly a decade later picasso scarcely out of his teens captured a wicked wordly crowd of swells and vamps who plainly take no prisoners far more pertinent to the story of modernist ferment in barcelona is an assemblage of material from the avant garde hangout els quatre gats casas was one of the "four cats" who founded the establishment and his full length charcoal portraits of noteworthy men about town evince a liveliness not seen in his work done abroad again picasso is represented as well even younger here pre paris with a wall of tiny but captivating ink and watercolor character sketches a four cat mobile in painted metal and attributed to picasso makes a jazzy pendant to domenchs rooster by now we are approaching a gallery focusing on art as the mirror of class conflict remarkable for images of outcasts and anarchists bomb throwing it turns out enjoyed quite a vogue in the barcelona of the s with public executions the squalid consequence casas puts in another appearance this time with the large historical canvas "the garrotting" a stately unexciting performance in which the condemned man seated with the noose around his neck is all but lost amid an expressionless cast of thousands as the historical era we know as the modern age recedes further into the past the patina of antiquity only deepens perhaps it should come as no surprise yet it does to see how fixed in amber the young turks of yesteryear now appear to this day the concept of the modern connotes a certain revolutionary spark but in the context of "barcelona and modernity " only picasso and joan miro can still be counted on to administer that old jolt of the new picassos blue period allegory "la vie" singing its cryptic song of eros mother love and death is the most startling image in the show miros "the farm" part folklore part magic realism originally purchased by ernest hemingway who had to scrape together his pennies to buy it comes in a close second surely the curators goal cannot have been to canonize saints already long established yet there they are pablo and joan transubstantiating just about all the art hung near them into something quaint tame of its time or simply familiar to the point of being taken for granted certainly salvador dali who needs no introduction springs no surprises here in design and architecture the gamut runs from camp medieval revival to glamorous neo classicism and archetypal bauhaus but what stands out above all is modernisme from an international perspective modernisme looks like nothing more than the local swell of the great wave of art nouveau that washed the continent of europe leaving encrustations that dot cities from st petersburg to glasgow copenhagen to venice like precious mineral deposits in barcelona neo rococo reigns supreme and not just thanks to the fertile imagination of gaudi creator of the pleasure garden of park guell and the undulant facade of casa mila as well as the sagrada familia the dizzy palau de la musica catalana by lluis domenech de montaner is no less emblematic a model showing the right half of the auditorium captures what may be its most memorable feature a flight of sculpted valkyries stampeding over the stage beneath a stained glass canopy like a giant tiffany lamp the catalog published by the cleveland museum of art in association with the yale university press runs to well over pages chockablock not only with images but also the erudition of over scholars currents countercurrents contradictions assimilating all this would take months luckily for those in a hurry theres a foreword by robert hughes whose love affair with barcelona has been going on for years in just wizardly words he distills a lifetimes passion and intimate knowledge if only the exhibition could have done the same it makes the head spin which may be the next best thing mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
