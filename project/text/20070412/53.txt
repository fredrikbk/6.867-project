ibm touts breakthrough in d chips international business machines corp said it achieved a breakthrough in developing a three dimensional semiconductor chip that can be stacked on top of another electronic device in a vertical configuration long sought by engineers to reduce size and power use ibm said the new chips which feature tiny wires leading down through the semiconductor may appear in cellphones and other communication products made by customers of its east fishkill n y semiconductor foundry as soon as next year semiconductors are normally connected to each other through wires around their periphery chip manufacturers have worked for years to develop ways to connect one type of chip to another vertically but they havent been able to achieve such links without using up huge amount of space on the chip reducing the room for circuitry and processing power ibms new method which uses current semiconductor manufacturing technology involves creating tiny holes called "through silicon vias" that are etched all the way through a chip and then injected with tungsten to create wires "this allows us to move d chips from the lab " said lisa su vice president semiconductor research and development center dave lammers director of research for wesrch com a web site for semiconductor engineers based in austin texas said "honestly this is historic for the first time were exploiting the vertical dimension " mr lammers said there has been considerable discussion about d semiconductors but no manufacturer had previously said it was ready to start selling chips he said microprocessor titans intel corp and advanced micro devices inc are both believed to be working on d chip technology for future microprocessors which he predicted will appear in or he also said sony corp is believed to be working on d chips for image processors
