will u s be a drag on global growth washington when everything is going right its time for the dismal scientists to worry about what might go wrong the international monetary fund predicted yesterday that the world economy will grow at a blistering this year and just as fast next year if those forecasts prove correct the global economys streak of expansion at a or more annual clip would be extended to six straight years that feat hasnt been achieved in at least years as long as the imf has been keeping such records "by and large things look very good " the imfs new chief economist simon johnson said at the release of the institutions semiannual world economic outlook report but even as theyre celebrating economists are looking for what might dim the bright outlook another oil price spike a sudden drop in the dollar further selloffs in stock and bond markets yet more setbacks to the once booming u s housing market price increases that lead central banks to crack down on inflation further reductions in business investment in the u s a rash of protectionist legislation and subsequent trade war if the imf predictions are wrong almost everyone agrees it will be because they are too optimistic "its a no brainer to say the risks are on the downside " said stephen roach chief economist at morgan stanley "as we move through i wouldnt be surprised to see the number slip below " the main concern is that the u s economy which accounts for two cylinders in the global v economic engine is losing power and may begin to sputter the imf predicts that the u s economy will grow just this year down from last year that would put it roughly on par with the euro zone countries and japan for europe and japan those are respectable numbers but the u s and the rest of the world have long been accustomed to a far faster american growth the imf said the u s economy "is expected to gradually regain momentum " but its report notes the many factors that could turn a pause into a screeching halt "a further cooling of the u s economy that increasingly spreads to weakness in consumption and business investment in would be challenging particularly since the euro area economy is likely to be slowing " the imf warned high among the looming risks is the possibility that the decline in u s housing prices will deepen construction jobs will be lost and consumers will lose the sense of well being that rising home values provided business investment has already begun to weaken another possible danger is the enormous u s current account deficit which hit a record of gross domestic product last year could spark a run on the dollar along with higher interest rates that slow the u s economy that threat has existed for years however and hasnt materialized the imf predicts that the recent gradual weakening in the dollar will boost exports cut imports and reduce the deficit to of gdp this year "projections based on the current constellation of real exchange rates and policies suggest that global imbalances would still remain large over the foreseeable future " the imf said the u s current account gap should be around of gdp for the next five years it said market volatility the past couple of months "appears to be contained in magnitude " but the imf warned that investors in search of higher returns have been taking bigger risks buying into the likes of subprime mortgages and derivatives the danger is big losses could send those investors running for the exits and dry up credit for the rest of the world the question is just how big of an impact a u s slowdown will have on global growth others say the point is how deep the u s slowdown becomes a true recession or even consistently anemic growth of around would likely send shivers through much of the globe "nobody believes a u s recession will not have severe effects on the rest of the world " said nouriel roubini an economist at new york university and chairman of consulting firm roubini global economics mr roach said the growing economies of asia might not be able to compensate for a profound slowdown in the u s slower u s growth means less appetite for imports which could reverberate he said but mr roachs main worry which the imf highlighted as well is that protectionist sentiments will win out in the u s and elsewhere leading to tariffs and other trade restrictions
