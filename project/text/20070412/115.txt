wonder land the rebirth of civility and so it came to pass in the year that a little platoon came forth to say unto the world enough is enough two leading citizens of the web tim oreilly and jimmy wales have proposed a "bloggers code of conduct " the reason for this code is the phenomenon of people posting extremely nasty verbal comments about other people on web sites devoted to political and social commentary for mr oreilly a publisher and activist for open web standards the last blogospheric straw involved a friend whose suggestion that it was ok to delete offensive comments from web sites earned her a backlash of vitriol on several sites with one posting a photo of her alongside a drawing of a noose it is appropriate that this line should be drawn in the ether of the world wide web whose controlling ethos up to now has been that speech and expression should remain free unfettered and the totemic word that ends all argument "democratic " as it developed too many of the webs democrats for reasons that have provided much new work for clinical psychologists tend to write in a vocabulary of rage and aggression take politics in the house of representatives members by tradition address each other as the "gentleman" or "gentlewoman " these salutations often drip with irony but exist nonetheless to temper the bitterness beneath much political combat the democrats around the web regard any such modulating habits as hypocritical unlike the fogies in politics or tradition hampered media they describe their opponents as what they believe they are morons idiots fools sellouts traitors liars perhaps the most used word on the politicized web crooks and various other expressions that the touchingly termed "family" newspapers still wont print the admission of need for something called a bloggers code of conduct is about more than just the web the deeper import of what may be happening here should be evident in mr oreillys remark which was the final sentence in a long new york times article on the subject last sunday "free speech is enhanced by civility " it is difficult for me to imagine a more revolutionary sentence one might call it "subversive " "free speech is enhanced by civility " the revolution comes at the end of that sentence free speech we know about civility we have forgotten ask don imus subsets of civility would include courtesy respect politeness and deference civility is a public virtue like oil or wheat it is a necessary social commodity that allows society to function that said it would be overreaching to lay the blame for civilitys fall on the world wide web the erosion of our stores of civility occurred over the past years undermined by torrents of political rage and self assertion in abbie hoffman the yippie saint and a founding father of anti civility wrote a book whose title alone still stands as the best summary of the new game "revolution for the hell of it " the web democrats the public hecklers the loudmouths are abbies children they know it and are proud of it no limits dont like it get over it if you object they will like characters in a dick tracy cartoon scream "i demand my constitutional rights " with the bloggers code of conduct comes the counterrevolution some excerpts from the wiki site put up by jimmy wales co founder of the remarkable and controversial web based encyclopedia wikipedia "we take responsibility for our own words and reserve the right to restrict comments on our blog that do not conform to basic civility standards " this is a shift from an early precept of the web known by the acronym yoyow or "you own your own words " in the world of yoyow one is responsible only to the drummer keeping the beat in ones head from mr oreillys web site "if you know someone who is behaving badly tell them so " which is to say we are surrounded now by people who have no clue that they are behaving badly or dont believe that they are or who argue that behaving badly is their "right " are they wrong psychologists commenting on the phenomenon of web based verbal abuse or aggressive public heckling often talk about societys expanded notions of personal entitlement and the failure of baby boomer parents to set norms of behavior for their infallible children we have ratified a lot of over the line behavior college administrators held the door open for four decades the question at the center of oral arguments in the supreme courts "bong hits jesus" case last month was who runs the schools the kids or the adults people behaving badly have simply taken the norms their elders gave them to a logical ending point on the web on one level the idea of a code of conduct for language on the web marks the overdue restoration of adulthood in american life but there is a harder side to this tension after news spread of the oreilly wales proposal an needless to say angry battalion of bloggers counterattacked crying "censorship " now were beyond the merely obnoxious culture of chin dribble now were talking politics and power so the cry goes up you cant tell us how to talk thats "censorship " the censorship claim is often made by political web players who want to be "free" to use whatever means will achieve the end of driving their opponents over the cliff consider the congressional black caucus its affiliation with fox news to conduct presidential debates was fire bombed recently on "progressive" web sites example "guess it takes a whole lot of grease to fry cbcs chicken " scared the three major democratic presidential candidates pulled out censorship try doublespeak the strategy of deploying charged and hyper aggressive language is now evident first intimidate ones targets then coerce them into conformity or silence and do it always under the banner of free speech and democracy there is no evident political coloration to the broader concern thats arisen about conduct on the web the anti civility trolls are in restaurants stadiums theaters planes church the airwaves in dreams this is merely a recognition that rules of the road can indeed enhance not suppress the flow of truly free expression and minimize the already ample frictions of daily life better late than never
