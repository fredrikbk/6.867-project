facing ad defection nbc takes don imus show off tv as a flood of advertisers pulled their ads from don imuss radio and tv programs and under mounting public and internal pressure nbc universal abruptly canceled msnbcs simultaneous broadcast of the show nbc reacted after half a dozen big spending marketers and a host of smaller companies withdrew their support from his show yesterday amid a mounting controversy over racist remarks made by mr imus about the rutgers university womens basketball team on his program last week civil rights leaders have called for an advertiser and guest boycott of the show the national organization for women called for the firing of mr imus and his executive producer bernard mcguirk mr imus went onto the rev al sharptons radio show on monday to apologize later that day nbc and cbs which owns the radio station that originates the broadcast suspended mr imus for two weeks starting april but the firestorm has only intensified among the advertisers pulling out yesterday mostly from msnbc but some from radio as well were general motors corp american express co genworth financial inc sprint nextel corp glaxosmithkline plc and petmed express inc the advertisers were following in the wake of similar moves by procter &amp gamble co the nations biggest advertiser and some smaller marketers on tuesday the group pulling out included six of the biggest advertisers on the msnbc broadcast cbs is yet to follow msnbc and cancel imuss program although pressure is mounting a cbs corp director bruce gordon in an interview with the associated press called on cbs chief executive leslie moonves to fire mr imus mr gordon is a former head of the naacp cbs has an interest in westwood one which syndicates the radio broadcast to other radio stations cbs said in a statement yesterday that during the two week suspension "cbs radio will continue to speak with all concerned parties and monitor the situation closely " in a statement nbc news said "effective immediately msnbc will no longer simulcast the imus in the morning radio program " the decision took "into account many conversations with our own employees " don imus years old is an old time radio hand who once spun records and did comic shtick but in recent years has gained new prominence as he focused more on media and politics although his audience has long been smaller than that of rush limbaugh drawing million listeners a week he has been on the cover of newsweek and addressed a gala dinner with president clinton sitting next to him on the dais every week he plays host to a queue of eager media heavyweights and senators he would tone down the irreverence when talking to guest luminaries but when the show would revert to its familiar morning radio show format with his cast filling time for plus hours a week the talk often pushed the envelope what to some listeners might have seemed like naughty social satire was taken as racism and sexism by others and this one incident took on a momentum of its own which didnt fade msnbc was bearing the brunt of advertiser defections most of the advertisers to pull their ads in the past couple of days were big national advertisers with commitments to the cable channel rather than the radio broadcast much radio advertising is bought locally on a market by market basis unlike cable channels and because the big advertisers are marketing to a broader audience than radio theyre often more sensitive about controversial issues the impact on msnbc was amplified because many advertisers purchased time across the channels entire daytime schedule rather than specific shows as a result to get out of imus several of the advertisers pulled their ads off the channels entire schedule general motors which advertises both on imus radio and tv program and withdrew from both the top advertisers which have suspended commitments so far spent more than &# million on msnbcs broadcast of imus last year according to tns media intelligence roughly a quarter of the &# million brought in by the simulcast last year msnbcs total ad revenue was about &# million in tns estimates nbc universal ceo jeff zucker personally made the decision to yank the program after lengthy discussions with nbc news president steve capus in a memo sent to all employees yesterday mr zucker said "nbc universal has a strong reputation for integrity and our employees value that integrity tremendously " mr capus denied the decision was due to advertiser pressure in an interview last night on msnbc "that is not why this decision was made what price do you put on your reputation the reputation of this news division means more to me than advertising dollars " "imus" wasnt one of msnbcs strongest programs although its ratings had risen in the first quarter to viewers according to msnbc nbcs decision raises questions about the impact on the shows guest roster as frequent guests include several journalists from nbc news and newsweek which has a cooperative agreement with msnbc one high profile nbc staffer has came out against mr imus al roker a host of nbcs "today " called for mr imuss ouster on his blog writing "it is time for him to go " for cbs radio dropping mr imus would likely be a last resort decision the company is trying to find its feet after a rough particularly in new york where his show provides about of revenue to wfan a key station in the companys roster after being hard hit by the departure of howard stern and the ensuing drama of finding a replacement host for him the company doesnt want to launch another high profile talent search if cbs did succumb to the mounting pressure mr imus could seek employment elsewhere although it wont be easy satellite radio has proven a career saver for many fired radio hosts including shock jocks opie &amp anthony but at a time when the two satellite companies sirius and xm are desperately seeking federal communications commission approval for a merger they are unlikely to antagonize the fcc by hiring a host now famous for a racial slur an xm spokesman said the company wasnt talking to mr imus sirius didnt respond to a request
