journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources nature seeing the softer side of africas wild dogs scientists are scrambling to save africas much hunted wild dogs insisting that the feared predators also have complex social interactions and a softer side that has long gone underappreciated wild dogs cousins of domestic canines that are popular as pets once roamed sub saharan africa in the hundreds of thousands they were known to attack humans and as predators they can be deadlier than lions but now fewer than of them are left on the african continent the rest victims to habitat loss and hunting by farmers seeking to protect livestock to help save the species conservationists are hoping to soften the dogs ferocious image paul raffaele reports scientists only recently have learned the animals are as humboldt state university behavioral ecologist micaela szykman gunther puts it "one of the most intensely social animals we know " the conservationists prefer to call them painted dogs after their tails white tips wild dogs chase animals in large packs exhausting their prey by rotating who takes the lead they have been known to disembowel animals on the run they get most of their fluids from blood scientists say wild dogs arent ferocious beasts all the time they have a highly evolved social sense which includes elaborate greeting rituals involving leaps twittering and face licking gregory rasmussen who runs a wild dog conservation program in zimbabwes hwange national park has seen a pack care for a wounded dog that veterinarians had assumed couldnt survive for months one dog in the pack licked the wound and brought food until the animal recovered packs also assign dogs to specific jobs mr rasmussen has seen a dog that was a poor hunter being left to care for the pups while the pack sought food unlike lions and hyenas they allow their pups to feed first after a kill even before a dominant pair in the pack this social complexity has made it hard for conservationists to reintroduce the animals to the wild in the packs all the males are related to each other as are the females but no male is related to a female at age two females and males split from their home pack and seek out a new group the process can take months conservation efforts which include removing poachers traps and educating tribes about the rarity of attacks on humans have had some success says claudio sillero of the world conservation union a switzerland based organization that runs wild dog monitoring projects in africa wild dogs once again are roaming the serengeti mr rasmussen also has had success reintroducing into the wild four orphaned dogs who managed to learn how to hunt in a pack all on their own smithsonian april economics developing nations urged to keep useful local systems economic development can thrive in places that dont have strongly enforced systems of laws say two analysts with the organization for economic cooperation and development local customs and other informal arrangements sometimes can foster growth just as well especially in places where formal institutions have collapsed write johannes jutting and denis drechsler in an article published in english language taiwanese newspaper taipei times some of these arrangements are worth preserving as the development community ratchets up its focus on ensuring the rule of law exists before pursuing other goals as an example they cite the success of south africas minibus taxi industry which has grown in recent years to accommodate of the countrys commuter market even though its operation was entirely unregulated in many developing countries access to credit and insurance is determined by village associations through a system that relies entirely on trust and peer pressure to outsiders these systems might smack of corruption and bribery but for villagers the established provisions carry a high degree of credibility formalizing and regulating these community based financial structures could damage the social system in small villages not all local customs aid development and the authors say development experts should work to change traditions where they are stunting growth whats more stronger laws are valuable to curb practices that clearly discriminate or lead to human rights violations such as the use of microcredit loans to pay dowries in an article that was syndicated to media by nonprofit organization project syndicate messrs drechsler and jutting urge a middle path between the "romantic preservationist" and the "bulldozing modernizer " given the slow pace of institutional reform they recommend that development experts identify which informal systems of governance stimulate growth and focus first on regulating those that clearly arent benefiting local societies taipei times april entertainment  rock fans with hdtvs find laughs in fine print high definition television hasnt just exposed actors wrinkles set designers now have to come up with actual meaningful words for the fake fliers newspapers and other written props that festoon their sets it used to be enough to paste in a plausible headline for a faux newspaper or magazine and type nonsense underneath but with the advent of hdtv designers are feeling the need to be more creative wireds gavin edwards encountered some unusually thorough detail work on text heavy props during a visit to the set of nbcs comedy " rock " which stars tina fey as the producer of a network television sketch show the series production designer teresa mastropierro commissioned fake text for props in the knowledge that hardcore fans might pause high definition playbacks to make out every detail the phony newspapers in the office for example have titles such as "daily voracity" and "usa biweekly " elsewhere a bulletin board lists sketches that shows characters supposedly are working on including "too hot to be homeless " toward the end of
