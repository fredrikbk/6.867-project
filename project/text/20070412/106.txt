the expat life encountering danger way off the beaten path online edition visiting friends and families often look to us to help them plan more extensive travels through china excited by the belief that our insiders acumen will help them get off the beaten track the problem is you never know what you will find on chinas backroads and the unknown can be quite frightening in a place that lacks minimal safety standards even in beijing you can watch window washers dangling from skyscrapers by a single rope pedestrians strolling by open manholes and men welding without masks we try to control what we can the kids wear bike helmets and make do with what we cant sometimes there is no choice but to pile the whole family into a seatbelt less cab chinas vast often beautiful interior is far wilder it feels totally unregulated and often extremely primitive with vast stretches of dirt roads and outhouses that are just wooden slats atop small ravines its a side of the country that short term visitors rarely see but rebeccas parents sister and aunt now know well thanks to a recent trip we took to sichuan province we took in many spectacular sights on the five day journey through the provinces wild west tibetan region but it was an extremely trying journey the culmination was an endless bus ride on a half built high altitude road in the dark of night that left me fearing for our lives my first mistake was taking too much for granted while planning the trip i told the guide that our group ranged in age from three to years old he said he understood but i should have known that he really didnt many chinese dont think twice about riding a train for hours or driving straight through for a day to reach their destination the guides idea of a reasonable amount of driving proved to be quite different from ours since we were on a circular route it was impossible to alter our plans once we set out for four days we rode our seat coach through grand vistas past monasteries roaring rivers and soaring mountains up to feet high we visited ancient watchtowers and tibetan villages populated by rakish cowboy hat wearing men zipping around on motorcycles we were welcomed into homes and fed impossibly rich yak butter tea and raw barley cookies but we rarely had time to linger in any of these places and some of the roads were just rock strewn dirt tracks one eight hour drive was so bad that it cured rebeccas aunt judy of motion sickness apparently pushing her so far she broke on through to the other side that afternoon i apologized for the long drives and rough conditions over a lunch of chicken feet and mushrooms a sentiment that was soundly rejected by everyone they were enjoying their walk on the wild side then things started getting interesting on our final day in the frontier we had a kilometer mile drive from dongba a primitive town in a gorgeous valley to wolong home of the countrys largest panda preserve and research center we stopped in a lovely little town for lunch and our guides said we had three more hours including about km on a "bumpy road " we started ascending a mountain road reduced to one mangled lane by construction in america this route would be closed in at least one and probably both directions here there was still two way traffic and no flagman so the drivers had to vigilantly keep their eyes locked on the twists ahead ready to use the few reliable pullover options luckily our driver was the calm and competent mr wang early on he waited for another bus which pulled astride so the drivers could talk after a lengthy animated conversation in sichuan dialect i asked what they had said "the road is like this all the way " said chris our english speaking guide "all the way to where " "wolong " my heart sank but there was no turning back so we pushed on stopping frequently for various obstacles there was the tractor blocking the road with three guys shoveling sand and unwilling to move until the wagon was full there was the car that drove into a ditch backing away from us necessitating an hourlong delay while a gaggle of workers watched us try to lift the car demanding yuan to help there was our driver pulling over to examine the axles and our guides getting out to move rocks out of the way or to fill in gaping potholes all of this was interesting even amusing at first but it became tiresome then frightening as we rose higher and higher and a guardrail never appeared what pushed me over the edge was the cement barrier that closed a newly paved section of road and forced us to drop two feet onto a rubble strewn lane with a precipitous drop off to our immediate right this was when i first felt a tightness in my chest that did not subside for five hours only my father in law seemed to share my terror but none of us were discussing the situation all that much it was too freaky and we had no viable way out as dusk approached we finally reached the snowy summit of four girls mountain four majestic peaks each over feet high downhill to the right corkscrew switchbacks cut through a barren rocky landscape that stretched to the horizon the elevation topped feet and we descended for several hours before even reaching the tree line it was soon pitch black the only illumination provided by lanterns in the workers tents that we passed every few hundred yards there must have been laborers fixing this massive stretch of road i felt terrified angry at our guides for not knowing about this situation and responsible for placing us in such a dangerous passive predicament we slowed to a crawl before stopping for another flashlight illuminated axle check when my father in law suggested sleeping on the bus it actually sounded like a reasonable plan but the guides scoffed i wondered if the guides standards for safe and normal travel were so vastly different that they couldnt fully grasp our concerns even while apologizing for the sorry conditions i made it clear that i was angry but didnt press the issue because we had no other options and i didnt want to panic the kids mercifully they remained extraordinarily well behaved thanks to my mother in laws heretofore unknown storytelling prowess her wonderfully rich half hour versions of several classic fairy tales kept the kids and even me calm and focused at about p m we finally reached a sign that read "welcome to wolong home of the pandas" but we were still on a rubble pile we banged along and arrived at our hotel at p m the "three hour drive" had actually taken nine and a half our guides tried to cheer us with news that the hotel promised to keep the hot water running until midnight and a nearby restaurant would stay open to serve us dinner everyone was solemn almost silent i volunteered to stay with the kids as long as someone sent me a beer i took a long hot shower washing away the days considerable grime then settled in for a liquid dinner it was then that i discovered that the sounds of your children sleeping deeply and the taste of warm tsingtao beer are both pretty darn good when youre happy to be alive im still not sure where the whole experience leaves me trips to remote guizhou and yunnan are among my favorite china experiences and both had their hairy moments we also loved much of this trip including the panda bears we finally visited were not ready to give up on venturing off the beaten path but im not sure what steps i can take to assure our safety other than to be very careful about whom we choose to guide us and asking a lot of questions before agreeing to any itinerary on the plane home from sichuan i loaded my photos onto my laptop and was stunned by the beauty of some of the places we had visited for a moment i questioned if the drive was really all that bad before coming to my senses next time i have that thought ill re read this column to give myself a reality check have you even ventured off the beaten path in a foreign land only to find yourself in a perilous situation how did you respond what would you have done in my shoes share your stories readers respond write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published below is a selected response to my previous expat life column on being a parent with a sick kid overseas my wife and i were traveling in the central part of nicaragua with our month old daughter when she developed a low grade fever which we felt comfortable treating then her fever shot up to and she developed diarrhea and other symptoms in the middle of the night the local pediatrician felt he could not help us as he had recently retired with the capital and known hospitals at least hours driving time away we decided to use the american express global assist hotline which promises to provide the names and addresses of reliable doctors and hospitals and in general assist you with medical emergencies while traveling abroad it didnt work getting through to someone who claimed could help us took almost minutes of navigating automated response systems hold time and transfers they indicated they needed an hour or two to get back to us with those names they actually called back hours later leaving a voicemail to the effect of "glad we could help" i was shocked i signed up for the amex platinum card around years ago and have been paying the hefty annual fee specifically for this service i travel a great deal and always felt i could rely on the service the one time i actually need to use it and with my daughter nonetheless it doesnt work now american express has announced that the annual fee is going up to &# you can bet that i wont be renewing it again fortunately we were able to find a medical clinic about minutes away and had to take our chances with the treatment it was diagnosed as a throat infection common in that area and with antibiotics our daughter was back to usual self in hours it was a very scary experience our home is close to doctors and outstanding hospitals something we took for granted we certainly wont again mike periu write to alan paul at expatlife dowjones com or join an online
