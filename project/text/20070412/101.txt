the h word what don imus failed to recognize in his puerile fatuity about the rutgers womens basketball team is the intimacy of college athletics and hence its hot importance to the inner lives of everyone concerned with it ive not had members of the current team in any of my classes but ive taught other varsity athletes and there is something clear cut and rich when you see them moving especially slowly to enter a classroom because you know they had a trying game the night before and their bones hurt when at the beginning of a semester they present for signature the schedule of their away games so that their absences are acceptable it becomes clear how hard the good ones work how keenly they evaluate their own results and how sharply they are able to separate the carnival of public success and failure from the private experience of their own effort when a student describes leaving his dorm for a winter practice at a m while fellow students are still returning from parties it becomes clear that the personal costs of athletic achievement are measured out on a daily basis so when imus made his improbably ugly comment he could not anticipate how many people were heartbroken that he turned a vibrantly decent moment of celebration and joy for the team their coaches and supporters into confrontation with a national pathology and of course national pathology it is pressing the race and sex buttons always gets a response from the media machine and the garrulous shepherds of the diversity flock mr imuss views on the decor habits of women with dark skin and very curly hair are condescending pedestrian and of no interest except as a symptom of the lens he uses with which to see other people but its his use of the "h" word which is most significant and herein lies an anthropological story perhaps because i was raised in victorian canada i have always found the casual use of the h word perplexing offensive and violent whatever its etymological derivation the fact is that its understood to be shorthand for "whore " the term appears to have achieved currency and seeming acceptability initially and mainly in the community of people with dark skin just take a look if your stomach is settled at any number of mtv video spectacles of rapper princes surrounded by wholly compliant and nearly nude women grinding their lives away but this is of course no alibi at all for any people with any pigment to describe any woman or group of women in a manner which deprives them of their sexual autonomy and paints them with the sign "commodity for purchase " the thoughtless use of such language is bad enough far worse is the situation which provoked and appears to support it the comparative ineffectiveness of some african american males in achieving stable and rewarding statuses in the wider society perhaps as a dramatic antidote that culture has produced a galaxy of tight rope heroes embedded in the largest black or white suvs with a weapon on the floor as they float from misogynist performance to performance they and their managers have not had to endure sermons from rev al sharpton and dont get threatened with losing their record contracts or concert venues the coercive trend is that ordinary african american males earn decreasing amounts of money compared to women of their community they are more accident prone more imprisoned and have frailer family lives than women do is this why they smoothly call them whores out of desperate resentment at their own ineffectuality there are structural reasons for this beyond the craven crumminess of popular culture when african and arab slavers captured people for the new world they preferred to break up families subsequent slave owning policies sustained that pattern as well many slaves were taken from west african societies in which biological mothers and fathers didnt necessary share child caretaking but mother and her brother did when i lived in ghana years ago christian families with father and mother in the household were called "same muddah same fadduh" in the street its likely that continuities persist as they certainly do in caribbean societies theres also a massive contemporary reason for the invidiousness many african american men feel in the presence of women their relative failure in a school system which broadly favors females by college age there is a sharp fall off of male enrollment in general and of african american men specifically when don imus meets with the rutgers women as they agreed he can it is doubtful he will have the bravery or stupidity to call them whores to their troubled faces he was after all an unelected representative of a broader culture when he used that phrase nevertheless for those of us in the rutgers community these are our accomplished young women whatever their color in their stately tearjerker news conference on tuesday they conducted themselves with discreet dignity and care and to a woman they called him mr imus mr tiger is a professor of anthropology at rutgers university and the author of "the decline of males" st martins press
