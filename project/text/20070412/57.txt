in the fray are strads really worth the price this is a highflying time for great old violins at auction in the "hammer" stradivarius a violin by the iconic maker antonio stradivari or antonius stradivarius as he signed himself in latin sold at christies new york for &# setting a world record for a musical instrument at auction and just last week the "solomon ex lambert" strad violins are often named for former owners fetched &# million it was last purchased in for gbp about &# the new buyer is an anonymous collector who according to kerry keane christies musical instrument department chief "has a philanthropic mission to loan this instrument to deserving young players " asked why christies estimated the "solomon ex lambert" at only &# million to &# million mr keane a former violin maker himself explained that "we formulate estimates around comparables taking previous estimates into account made in the solomon is late stradivari himself was there was a slight decline in his hands the profile is still there the shape that creates the tone a little more robust than those of his earlier golden period but a connoisseurs eye can see that the execution of the finer points is a bit less deft " nevertheless were still talking big bucks you might well ask why these old instruments command such hefty sums why do people live in constant hope that uncle jacks dusty fiddle in the attic will prove a goldmine why indeed especially in light of an article "science and the stradivarius " published in the april "physics web" physicsweb org its author british physicist colin gough of the university of birmingham states "science has not provided any convincing evidence for the existence of any measurable property that would set the cremonese instruments apart from the finest violins made by skilled craftsman today " the article also notes "every violin whether a stradivarius or the cheapest factory made copy has a distinctive voice of its own so a skilled violinist can distinguish between different qualities in the sound produced by individual stradivari or guarneri violins in practice however it is extremely difficult to distinguish between a particularly fine stradivarius instrument and an indifferent modern copy on the basis of the measured response alone the ear is a supreme detection device and the brain is a far more sophisticated analyzer of complex sounds than any system yet developed to assess musical quality " thus using their ears scientists musicians instrument dealers and violin makers have long debated the merits and mysteries of instruments made by the great old masters of cremona italys violin making center between the late th and mid th centuries toby faber author of the insightful "stradivaris genius" random house observes in an email to me "the price of a strad has risen so much in recent years mainly because the demand has risen throughout the world i cant believe that so many great violinists violists and cellists would endure the hell as well as the joy of being responsible for such a valuable object if they did not truly believe that a good violin makes a difference they are not the victims of some massive year con trick if science has not been able to find the difference then that is simply because science does not yet know where to look " contacted at his acoustical lab at east carolina university physicist george bissinger who like prof gough has been probing the mysteries of old violins offers several points among them "we have not yet measured the right parameter maybe there is no right parameter maybe the very best violins just have more things right maybe the wood itself has changed over the centuries in a way that no modern instrument could duplicate maybe three centuries of love and attention to violins that can rightly claim a prominent place in our artistic heritage has found the best combination of physical adjustments to get the very best from these violins " violinist lynn chang who teaches at the new england conservatory of music and boston university and who plays a carlo bergonzi says "a great performer will sound good on any instrument but the cremonese violin helps the performer go beyond the instrument the good strad or del gesu will give a range of color that is just unachievable by modern ones " former philadelphia orchestra principal violist roberto diaz agrees now president of the curtis institute of music mr diaz owns the c "primrose" amati which formerly belonged to the virtuoso william primrose a frequent recitalist and concerto soloist he also plays a two year old copy of the amati made by gabrielle kundert "this allows me to give my year old amati a rest for its own good " mr diaz notes that "projecting the tone in a pianissimo passage is easier on an old instrument than a new one and in soft dynamics i can achieve a lot of subtle colors on the old one that i cant do yet on the new one but im not prepared to say that in another five or years the new one will not achieve some of these subtleties " similarly violinist cho liang lin regularly plays his guarneri del gesu in the worlds greatest concert halls he also owns a copy of another guarneri made for him by samuel zygmuntowicz considered a dean of the profession mr lin says "i wanted a superb backup instrument and though i play the del gesu more often i did play sams violin exclusively for all concerts for months concertos recitals including one at tully hall in fact many of my violinist colleagues couldnt tell that i was not playing the del gesu " mr lin says that "if you remove all preconceptions about cremonese instruments theyre not that different from modern ones sams has considerable power a ringing bright quality and a lot of nuance it is only seven years old and like a wonderfully gifted child it is taking time for me to develop it if i put a strad or a guarneri in storage for six months it will come back quickly to its sound if i put sams in storage it takes a lot longer for the sound to get back out " ultimately however he says that "i dont think all cremonese instruments are created equal not every strad is a great strad " looking at the marketplace himself mr zygmuntowicz who has also made instruments for joshua bell maxim vengerov the emerson string quartet and the late isaac stern whose two zygmuntowicz violins fetched &# and &# at auction in may observes that "the name stradivarius conveys a wealth of meaning to people as a cultural icon as a collectible as a very beautiful luxury item " but a violin makers world is much more prosaic he says "musicians are out there doing a hard job and they need the right equipment in my work its important to separate the romance from the technical requirements the miracle is not that strads are such great violins but that the violin itself is such a miracle such a robust well functioning organic structure " he notes that "much of the strads reputation was established not by performers but by gentlemen collectors though the best of them are truly great it doesnt mean that in the concert hall they are that much better than the best of other fiddles old or new " asked if there are examples of modern violin making on a par with say those of stradivaris golden period or the great del gesu violins chicago violin maker and dealer fritz reuter says that "in terms of sound and utility modern master violins especially gold medalists in the numerous competitions of the violin society of america are fine or even superior examples created to the highest standards of the violin making profession " as for their value as antiques however mr reuter asserts that "there are three basic reasons for purchasing instruments of this nature exhibition investment or personal vanity " in this arena "tonal value is of least importance if it is considered at all " the cost he says is "whatever an infatuated party is willing to pay " of course the bottom line is that science cant yet measure beauty or the differences in our perception of beauty the laws of the marketplace and of supply and demand will prevail a or year old fiddle is an important antique in its own right its price comparable with old masters clocks and silver of the same period moreover historic provenance has a value of its own an instrument once owned by paganini or heifetz or as in the case of mstislav rostropovichs "duport" stradivari cello which still bears the scratch marks of emperor napoleons spurs he once played a few notes on it while wearing his riding boots carries a big premium as mr diaz observes "theres a certain aura of the ghosts that live in an old instrument but those ghosts cost a lot of money " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal
