a ge brand seeks place in trophy kitchens louisville ky chef joe castro slides slabs of hoisin glazed salmon into a stainless steel ge monogram trivection oven then he sears filet mignon over a powerful btu burner on the ge monograms professional style gas range twenty students watch from sleek cooking stations and then tackle the dishes themselves the students are appliance retailers catering to high end clients who often overlook the monogram line now general electric co wants more of their business twenty years after introducing its high end monogram line ge is angling for a stronger foothold in a niche market dominated by sub zero freezer co and its affiliated wolf appliance co miele inc and viking range corp those premium brands are synonymous with trophy kitchens by comparison a recent survey by the luxury institute market research firm found that ges monogram is the least well known of the designer brands even below ges own moderately priced profile line fred albano an appliance retailer in suburban pound ridge n y who attended the course says his customers are "extremely label conscious" and tend to prefer the well known high end brands he offers ge executives some advice for boosting monogram sales "take the ge name off " but ge has pinned high hopes on monogram particularly as profit margins shrink in the general appliance market a ge spokeswoman kim freeman calls the ge name an "asset to monogram " so the company is making a bigger push in the more profitable high end where refrigerators cost &# to &# by courting trendsetting architects designers and retailers who may give ge monogram short shrift in february ge opened a &# million square foot "experience center" here to show off its wares to as many as visitors a year over three days guests cook using ges latest technology and explore ges newest products from a &# high tech wine vault to a inch built in refrigerator with more capacity than a standard inch model ge which pays for all guests expenses puts the visitors up in louisvilles new c museum hotel the hotel places ipods by the guests bedsides with a list of songs selected by valinda wagner who runs the center and her ge colleagues the goal according to ms wagner "how do we get that salesperson to take them over to a monogram when they come in for a sub zero " ge introduced monogram in with a built in refrigerator designed to compete with sub zero the line however had limited success in part because ge didnt distinguish it from its other appliances in the late s ge tried to reposition the monogram line by cutting the number of distributors in half and selling through a more exclusive network over the next few years ge expanded monogram to include more appliances such as speed cooking with the trivection oven but that wasnt enough says lynn pendergrass chief executive and president of ge consumer and industrial of the americas region "we had to make some statements" to overcome ges "stodgy" legacy she says so in ge increased its monogram advertising budget by and installed new showrooms at its distributors it brought the manufacturing of its refrigerators in house instead of outsourcing as it does with some of its appliances ge says its investing &# million in the monogram line in and ge then took a page from competitors by creating the "experience center " distributors and salespeople used to attend a one day seminar at a local hotel ballroom where ge wheeled in its monogram line by comparison viking and sub zero had already been wining and dining retailers in their own lavishly appointed centers ms wagner says ge studied approaches by other storied brands like harley davidson and disney in planning its center ges facility features louisville artists work and incorporates design details from appliances the entrances roof for example resembles a stainless steel venting system the glass front doors have the same stainless steel tubular handles as monogram appliances ge also recruited mr castro a local celebrity chef from the landmark english grill one exercise pits teams of retailers against one another to calculate the time it takes to bake a pizza in the trivection oven the trivection combines microwave convection and traditional oven technology but has tripped up retailers and consumers because it appears complex the pizzas were ready in nine minutes compared with minutes in a conventional oven the guests then ate their handmade pizzas for lunch "i can now talk about ease of use i can talk about what i made " says ross blount a veteran salesman with kennedy hahn appliance a wisconsin based independent appliance dealer kelly rigdon kennedy hahn president who attended a seminar says the monogram line offers high tech features similar to those of better known designer appliances but lacking the same cachet "the challenge is having that high end customer recognize the monogram brand is as good as the viking " says mr rigdon who previously worked for ges appliance unit during one session ge trainer ken tripp asks the group to take a "friendly look" at the difference between monogram and sub zero refrigerators lined up side by side in a gallery he points out the ge models extensive lighting and accommodations for "ethylene producing" fruit and vegetables such as apples and avocados that tend to ripen easily and then contaminate others those items can be placed in a separate temperature controlled compartment he says mr albano whose pound ridge store is called albano appliance &amp service declares the ethylene concept novel and "fantastic " the whole experience at the center goes a long way toward proving that "ge is in the luxury business " says jason horst head of business development for tate appliance &amp bedding centers tampa fla tate has been a ge dealer for more than years but mr horst says the first request by affluent customers seeking a built in tends to be for a look at sub zero appliances because of the brand name but he says that opens the door to introduce other brands like ge monogram later this year ge plans to host architects and designers a key group ge has been "lax" in pursuing says ms pendergrass ge is also opening a showroom in new yorks architects and designers building where designers bring clients to view furniture and appliances the effort to put the monogram line on the map has been a departure for those concerned "it is counterculture for our business " ms pendergrass says "it is uncomfortable to make this kind of investment and leap of faith in something very sophisticated and very high end and a little more difficult to market " that may be but ge monogram appears to be making headway sales were up in from a year earlier according to the company overall market researcher npd group says the high end appliance market was flat last year at &# billion thats about of the nations &# billion appliance market ge declined to provide specific sales numbers
