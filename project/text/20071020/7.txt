activists test silicon valley icahn is latest investor trying to unlock value in technology industry activist investors had long shunned silicon valley thinking that technology companies were pricey and that their businesses were obscure not anymore consider carl icahn who has targeted companies in industries as diverse as media and biotechnology admitting that he was plunging into the unknown the billionaire investor recently snapped up shares of software maker bea systems inc and challenged the company to do better "technology hasnt really been one of the things ive focused on too much before " says the year old activist investor who declared that bea was underperforming and should consider selling itself now oracle corp is bidding to buy bea for &# billion and mr icahn sounds more encouraged about activist actions aimed at high technology companies "i think youre going to see more " he says other investors are making similar moves and finding plenty of opportunities to push for changes at tech concerns that could help shareholders turn a profit earlier this month hedge fund manager thomas sandell whose fund has about &# billion in assets disclosed a stake in software maker sybase inc and called on the dublin calif company to explore its strategic options in august hedge fund oliver press partners llc which manages more than &# million reported a stake in laser products maker coherent inc and said the firm "hasnt provided sufficient value to shareholders " and activist shareholder bryant riley whose hedge fund has around &# million in assets is currently targeting two silicon valley firms ess technology inc and silicon storage technology inc the action is a turnabout from past years and the latest sign of changing attitudes toward technology companies and their shares activists had tended to avoid silicon valley companies in part because the companies were young growing fast and commanded pricey valuations a turnoff for investors searching for down and out firms that trade at a discount some technologies operated in niches that were hard to understand and tech firms often had a large chunk of their shares held by a founder or venture capitalist making it hard for other shareholders to gain control now some of those barriers are crumbling tech firms are maturing bea for example is years old and sybase has been around for years as revenue growth has slowed at aging companies their valuations have sunken or stagnated tech stocks are currently trading at an average price to earnings ratio of times earnings down from an average times per share earnings in according to standard &amp poors yet many middle aged tech companies have predictable revenue streams large customer bases and substantial piles of cash which activists argue should be returned to shareholders the ownership stakes held by venture investors and founders for the most part also have been diluted and activists having picked the low hanging fruit off other sectors are casting about for other places to put their money "the dna of a tech company was to grow like crazy but now some of these companies have become adults " says scott galloway an activist investor at firebrand partners llc overall activist shareholders launched proxy fights at tech companies so far this year up from in and seven in according to factset research systems inc gus oliver an activist shareholder at oliver press partners in new york says he began looking at tech specifically at software companies in late after realizing how cheap the stocks were while he had previously been driven by opportunities in other sectors such as energy he says he noticed that software companies such as siebel systems inc had large net cash balances and in many cases were trading at low multiples of their enterprise values "software in particular was relatively undervalued and people werent tuned into that as much at the time " says mr oliver who formed his fund in "growth had disappeared many of the companies were operating at break even " mr oliver never bought into siebel ultimately sold to oracle but took positions in several software companies including matrixone inc in and webmethods inc earlier this year both companies were ultimately sold earning solid returns for investors he is now targeting coherent a santa clara calif company that has a market value of about &# billion and &# million in cash in the past year coherents share price has dropped about and the company recently said it would restate some financial results following an investigation into its stock option practices "theres a case to be made that coherents cash can and should be returned to shareholders " mr oliver says adding that he wants to participate in any discussion of the companys strategic future a coherent spokeswoman declined to comment joseph farley a managing director at private capital management inc in naples fla says investors have historically avoided activism in silicon valley because the common wisdom was that a disruption could send engineers a companys most important asset fleeing private capital which is owned by legg mason inc and has engaged in shareholder activism is the second largest bea shareholder oracle bid &# a share earlier this month for bea a price premium of for the san jose calif software company if successful the deal would generate a good return for mr icahn who has built up a stake through several investment vehicles making him beas largest shareholder according to factset he reported paying between &# and &# a share for his most recent purchases the financier however remains wary "its hard to understand these technology companies " he says
