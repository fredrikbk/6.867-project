weekend journal eating out the best power breakfasts from l a s bel air to new yorks regency our reviewer finds out which executive eye openers are worth their jaw dropping prices why am i not as successful as henry kissinger we are basically so similar not wiry wives taller ph d s from same university have both flown to many exotic places professionally and owe much to chinese contacts so what makes him a world beating molder of history and me ive pondered this long and hard and the only explanation ive come up with is that dr kissinger eats power breakfasts and dr sokolov doesnt actually i have no idea where henry the k eats breakfast these days or who he sees over his corn flakes but my working theory is that movers and shakers of his ilk in politics and business spend the early morning meal in a fancy hotel dining room schmoozing making deals and deciding the fate of nations or the federal reserve discount rate when and where did the power breakfast start when talleyrand sat down with metternich over cafe au lait to thrash out the future of europe at the congress of vienna in when hector and achilles drank nectar before fighting to the death by the light of the rosyfingered dawn in modern times anyway the regency hotel in manhattan insists that it originated the power breakfast during the s while other business concepts went the way of the yellow power tie in the s the power breakfast has spread to posh hotel dining rooms where movers and shakers can squeeze in a meeting before their day starts every city has them in chicago for instance one morning haunt is the restaurant at the four seasons while silicon valley venture capitalists go for the gnarlier bucks to discuss business over &# pancakes the parker meridien in new york once made a stir with a &# lobster caviar frittata but how is the food in these places to find out ive recently gone on what might be called the golden egg diet from coast to coast so far i havent made the whos news column of this newspaper or been invited to sit on any boards but i have learned a thing or two about power breakfasts and how to eat them for one the power breakfast is the least exclusive easiest reservation to cop in the whole frenzied universe of fine dining in fact you dont need a reservation except perhaps at the regency and you absolutely dont need to spend the night in the hotel where you consume your gilt edged lox other people with my lack of star quality have also figured this out and you will see many of them along with normal and subnormal hotel guests in los angeless bel air and peninsula hotels at bostons langham as well as at the hay adams in washington and new yorks regency and as for the food best in los angeles worst in keep your napkin tucked into your collar shining reader im getting there but to start with i want to split my oscar for the best power breakfast of between the serene bel air and the madly elegant peninsula for a new yorker it was a long way to go for breakfast but worth it just to wallow in perfection and start the day feeling well powerful it helped that the hotels supplied newspapers for both me and my life partner gratis for the rest there was my debit card it isnt hard to find out which hotels are centers for power breakfasting the internet city magazines and local business people were all excellent guides to finding where the elite meet to eat eggs benedict the hotels themselves often announce their supremacy the discreetly lavish bel air in los angeles preens itself on its web site as "the hottest spot for hollywoods moguls mavens and movie stars " to meet over omelets everyone at least once in his or her life maybe even every morning should drive up the gently rising slope of the moneyed enclave of bel air to its startlingly gracious eponymous hotel where guarded by its famous swans and ushered in as if we were douglas fairbanks and mary pickford we made our way to the quiet bower of a breakfast terrace no doubt on other mornings we would have slurped coffee next to sherry lansing or lee iacocca on this morning we saw mainly families with well behaved children anticipating a dandy meal we paused briefly over the menu to consider what the ideal guest would order at the ideal power breakfast venue of course you could always just have orange juice dry toast and coffee no doubt many hard charging executives resign themselves to egg white omelets but at a power breakfast venue you expect to find more than that if you are the former secretary of state advising a client about the coming elections in kosovo you want more than a bare bones breakfast more than two eggs over lightly with rye toast and mass produced sausage you want breakfast cuisine food to match the occasion the bel air rises to the occasion when i tell george soros to dump his euroyen i want to do it with a forkful of the hotels airy lemon souffle pancakes with fresh raspberries and raspberry syrup poised in midair the extraordinary lightness and strong fresh tastes of these hyperflapjacks carry a risk of distracting even the most avid dealmonger from his basic task ditto for the huevos rancheros which surpassed any other exemplar of this mexican classic in my memory with their artfully layered corn tortillas surrounded by excellent refried beans and a piquant pool of chipotle sauce the bel airs apple smoked bacon was the best i tasted on our entire breakfast odyssey the smoking really had a noticeably delicious effect on the excellent meat reminding me of barbecue in texas hill country after the high caloric meal we consumed at the bel air a nap would have been the right move but our budget did not permit a lie down in one of the bel airs homey cottagesque rooms so we drove down the hill past mega mansions and into the hurly burly of beverly hills having failed to see or at least identify a single power broker or star on the bel air terrace you could chalk this up to our insulated foodie cluelessness we did slightly better in the mover shaker department at the chic peninsula in the paneled floral splendor of the dining room huddled near walls mounted with beautiful china plates were tied and suited fellows communicating something or other with intensity or could their animation have been the result of intimate contact with the peninsulas "egg in a hole" translation one egg cooked inside of brioche toast with turkey sausage and fontina cheese had we been in attendance on a splashier day we might have seen such peninsular breakfasters as harvey weinstein or howard stringer not having overcome jet lag we decided to postpone our enjoyment of this marvel instead we opted for the relative simplicity of oatmeal brulee with maple syrup and devonshire clotted cream this apogee of porridge a humble looking syzygy of culinary notions from france scotland new england and englands south coast has spoiled rice krispies for me forever the dense evaporated cream and the syrup flowed into the oatmeal magically once i had broken its glassy top in a certain kind of advanced restaurant this dish could be served as a dessert after an adventurous dinner these two hotels were the gustatory twin peaks on the power breakfast trail the other sites we visited werent on the same culinary level but they compensated with their extraordinary urban settings in boston the langham inhabits a former branch of the federal reserve bank built in and modeled after the palazzo della cancelleria in rome in the cafe fleuri dining room at an early hour it was easy to imagine heady discussions of mutual fund billions or corner cutting palaver that led to the partial collapse of one of the towns new tunnels the kitchen was out of griddled jonah crab and potato cake with poached egg asparagus and lemon chive hollandaise so instead of cancer borealis i plumped for another even more typical local seafood specialty homarus americanus there was plenty of lobster with the scrambled eggs all of it delicately surmounting a split croissant it was churlish to harbor critical thoughts under the six story glass atrium ceiling but the lavish lobster portion was cooked too long and call me a purist but i dont think the dish was improved by the insertion of a croissant under the egg and crustacean in fact i think it was a mistake to serve a rich buttery croissant with rich buttery eggs and rich lobster flesh better to concentrate on cooking the lobster serve the croissant separately they order things better at the stately hay adams in washington insiders will know to request a white house view in the very pleasant lafayette room we bumpkins sat as far as possible from the oval office next to us was a marine colonel giving a civilian male a piece of her mind about benefits we did not intervene since we were quite content with a plate of decadent chocolate pancakes with fresh strawberries and whipped cream my loyal companion had no trouble finishing her eggs benedict the classic american fancy breakfast dish a poached egg with canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce on an english muffin invented not by benedicts spinoza or arnold but by power breakfasting new yorkers of that surname at either the delmonico or the waldorf astoria in the th century the hay adams kitchen produces a textbook exemplar with a runny yolked egg and a non soggy muffin and nice hollandaise and asparagus spears for &# that is more much more than you can say about the same dish for nearly twice the price in the city of its birth at the regency there the eggs were cold and overcooked the muffin was soggy this was true of the classic benedict with canadian bacon and the &# salmon benedict with smoked salmon an even greater ripoff one presumably endured without protest by loews hotels ceo jonathan tisch and other regulars was the granola with berries for &# it was a very nice granola perhaps a bit sweeter than other granolas but otherwise unremarkable we sat in the library a charming room off to the side of the larger main dining room it is fitted out with books some of them faux and very large there is a sofa and there are women having breakfast something we did not detect in the sea of dark suits in the dining room next door among these putative captains of finance and celebrity indeed at their very center was larry king live enough considering the early morning hour he was all by himself looking subdued by comparison with his hyperalert television persona on the other hand it was arresting to see him alone without an interviewee to query could it be that the most powerful man at the most powerful breakfast scene in the most powerful city doesnt need to dilute his power by sharing it with somebody else or had he been stood up in my fantasy it was the dynamic dr k who ditched mr k for the funky little bucks in woodside calif or maybe the man who invented shuttle diplomacy is back having the ultimate power breakfast at the white house mess we dont remember eggs benedict on the menu but a source familiar with the situation disclosed that the highly informal little restaurant is known for its fried
