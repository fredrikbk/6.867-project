the weekend interview with sam zell professor risk chicago in his office high above the chicago river sam zell the real estate virtuoso and master investor is talking about motorcycles "i have had accidents over the years " he says "but most of them while standing still im actually a very very good driver " in case i look skeptical he adds a sweetener his wifes verdict "helen rides in the back with me and this is not miss bravery or something " he says "but you know she wont let me drive a car i get distracted " hes hoping ill catch the broader point which is about managing risk the subject were actually here to talk about in his three plus decades in the business mr zell has built a fortune doing deals in industries and business cycles where few were keen to tread hes come out with levels of success that left others wondering how they failed to see the opportunities that were there plain as day the most recent of these high wire acts was his sale in february of equity office properties the real estate investment trust he had built over decades to blackstone for &# billion in cash at the time business publications were unconvinced "is he cashing out too early " one headline asked instead as we now know the sale was at the top of the market and only months before the credit meltdown that has shaken up a financial system so was he seeing portents of a tightening last winter that others werent yet ready to acknowledge "obviously the deal that was done on feb could not be done on sept " mr zell says while insisting that hes told everyone he didnt try to deliberately pick a market top so much as weigh the offer against what his own instincts told him was the right price "somebody made an offer that was wide by a significant margin of my own valuation so im looking in the mirror and any day you dont sell you buy and i wasnt willing to buy at the price they were willing to pay so i sold it " blackstone is likely to do fine he notes with a group of properties that spans the country from one post office place in boston to columbia center in seattle though perhaps not as fine as the enthusiasm of the time suggested it remains to be seen what will happen in the near future he explains "i tend to think that the commercial real estate market is kind of flattening after an enormous amount of rate compression and a tremendous rise in costs over a relatively short period of time it changed valuations quite dramatically in a relatively short period of time " he should know the current illiquidity of the market may be a new experience for the young guns of real estate and private equity who got rich doing deals when money was cheap sam zell on the other hand began to build his fortune in a market more similar to this one buying distressed properties that no one wanted to get near his m o during the early years earned him the nickname the grave dancer and a reputation for nerves of steel in the latter years he observed that so much liquidity had entered the market things would never be the same so had things come full circle i wondered could he end up back in the business he started in "an adequate description of me would certainly be a professional opportunist " he smiles "ive always had my own perceptions of value and ive always been willing to go forward and risk my own capital on whatever basis i believed and on many of those occasions it was really lonely you turn around and look behind you and theres nobody else " when he and his partner began buying distressed assets in the late s and early s they had hardly any competition many of the buildings were so empty they became known as "see throughs " and most savvy investors would have sooner jumped off the golden gate bridge than touched some of their early acquisitions "you know you can really be a macho guy " he says "but in the end you think well im sure im right arent i but i was always pretty sure i was right " to hear him tell it once he had assessed the risk it was just a matter of time the point is how to think about the risks you take as well as the ones you dont to this end mr zell has helped establish a center for the study of risk at northwestern university in the chicago area a project inspired by his own experience teaching an undergraduate course on risk at the university of michigan going into it he says he wanted to teach a "noahs ark class" not just business students but students from all departments english architecture math and so on "i was intrigued by the way people take all kinds of risk all the time and dont know it " he says "see im a professional risk taker but im a professional risk taker who understands all the risks he takes a lot of people dont " the same economic principles cross all boundaries he says "other than designing rocket engines or biotech or some high tech stuff business is business and risk is risk and the ability to incur risk and the ability to make things happen they are all the same " in the current market its the fear of unseen risks thats on peoples minds as a condition of the interview ive agreed not to ask about his landmark chicago tribune deal but mr zell isnt completely without his own exposure many now think the deal will have to be junked or rebuilt judging by the spread between his offer price of &# &# share and the current price of around &# &# share the market is still questioning whether it is going to happen so were talking about whether when and if the credit markets will get back to normal he pauses and gets up "let me answer your question a different way " he says heading over to a shelf along a bank of windows where a row of decorative music boxes sits these are mr zells famous music boxes hes known for sending them to friends and business associates around the holidays each one contains a message and a song on themes ranging from politics to the world economy as he tells it after getting chocolates or oranges ever holiday seasons "the idea that i should send someone a calendar with my name on it was just beyond my measure " instead he sent economic forecasting machines disguised as music boxes he sets one whirring to life the song it emits to the tune of "raindrops keep falling on my head " begins "capital is raining on my head everything is liquid were awash in cash to spend " thats how he saw things in what has changed now is not the existence of liquidity theres plenty but the will to use it the problem isnt a sudden lack of money but a lack of confidence from the people who control it resurrecting that confidence will be the key and its unlikely to happen in the near term that said while credit panics may not be anyones idea of fun their benefit is that they begin to restore some sanity and caution keeping the animal spirits in balance "we havent even begun to see the fraud that went on here " he continues pausing to put on his best professor risk face imagine youre a broker on a starter home in california and its a &# loan to a guy who makes maybe &# a year he says and someone just changes the numbers and the loan goes through "two days later some investor in poland owns it youre out you got your money what disciplines you " so did we get carried away with the notion of homeownership as part of the american dream "if you need to come up with some kind of a really sophisticated journalistic approach i think what you could basically conclude is that the country cant afford more than homeownership and that when we start pushing you create a disaster you push a bunch of people who cant afford it into the homeownership dream you have builders overbuilding you have brokers overselling and it always ends up badly " but dont jump out the window just yet mr zell sees some homeowners taking double digit losses because theyre forced to sell but many wont sell if they dont get their price and as long as employment holds up he says the housing market may be soft for many months to come but there wont be a national fire sale he also notes the oversupply is worse in some markets than others miami was hit badly while cities like seattle and new york have carried on with hardly a dip the public policy arena has now turned to efforts to protect the subprime borrowers from over easy credit in the future but the machinations of political types dont seem of much interest to mr zell whose office greets visitors with life size statues of porcine bureaucrats one wrapped in red tape and the other doing a six legged "bureaucratic shuffle " "it would be unfortunate if this also became a political football " he says "but to be honest with you its just like publicity seeking political committees they always look for a scapegoat and they always look for victims no matter what the subject matter is " to get away from it all theres always zells angels his very own motorcycle gang that takes trips around the world together most recently riding the dalmatian coast from trieste to albania and back mr zell has about motorcycles for his purposes he says but theyre all the same basic kind he tells me sport bikes fast and with a lot of torque he knows exactly what hes dealing with "im about as focused a motorcycle rider as you have ever seen " ms levy is a senior editorial writer at the journal based in washington see related letter "letters to the editor develop
