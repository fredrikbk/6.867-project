is your money fund siv burdened complex investments known as sivs are roiling wall street and the world of high finance but the investment vehicles also are threatening trouble in a seemingly unlikely place money market funds the choice for many individual investors seeking safety in recent years the short term debt issued by such structured investment vehicles or sivs had become a favorite for many money market funds thanks to their attractive yields high credit ratings and added diversification as a result many money market mutual funds were holding to of their portfolios in debt issued by sivs funds overseen by bank of america corp s columbia management group credit suisse groups credit suisse asset management and federated investors inc recently held big stakes in sivs including some of the most troubled names while many investors bought the debt issued by sivs their problems raise particularly thorny issues for money market funds a pillar of the appeal of money funds is that they maintain a &# per share net asset value meaning that an investor who puts a dollar into the fund will get his one dollar back plus interest earned along the way but with sivs foundering fund firms may have to take some cautionary steps to avoid their funds suffering losses what is known in the industry as "breaking the buck " significant money fund losses are unlikely for several reasons only a handful of sivs are thought to be in real danger and money funds typically own senior notes or a type of investment that provides some protection against losses in an siv additionally money market funds are subject to strict investing rules that limit how much they can keep in individual holdings many funds already have begun drastically trimming siv related purchases most have been cutting back on their holdings by allowing securities to mature without rolling them into new debt from the issuer and in recent weeks the u s treasury and wall street teamed up to try to create an siv bailout fund which if successful could alleviate the strain on siv issuers and investors money market fund managers have been looking to the bailout pool to stabilize the market for siv securities and help protect any funds running into trouble most important for money fund investors fund companies would almost certainly take steps to prevent losses from reaching shareholders such as absorbing the losses themselves by purchasing the money losing securities from the fund at their full price even if funds dont break the buck the collapse of the siv market could slightly reduce yields on funds that had held big investments in the securities which offered slightly higher payouts than comparable securities if a money funds siv related holdings were downgraded and a fund had to sell off the positions that could affect a funds yield says roger merritt a managing director at fitch ratings the concern underscores how complex investments such as sivs have ended up even in places that small investors turn to for a safe harbor that has brought some of those funds risks few investors expect the issue also has become more widespread money market funds continue to set asset records hitting a high of &# trillion through earlier in the latest week according to the money fund report published by imoneynet inc fund companies holding troubled sivs say they are assessing the situation many are letting the securities mature and not replacing them some may even buy troubled siv securities from their money market portfolios to prevent major problems says james mcdonald who oversees the t rowe price prime reserve fund which has long held only a fraction of its assets in siv debt the &# billion credit suisse institutional money market fund held billions in siv issued notes and commercial paper at the end of june including several that were downgraded recently by ratings agencies today however the fund holds no siv securities a spokesman declined to comment on how the fund disposed of the siv securities sivs have historically been relatively safe investment pools but after this summers bond market turmoil a handful now face substantial financial difficulties and potential losses deborah cunningham an executive at federated investors which owns siv debt in its funds acknowledges there has been an "unprecedented change" in the environment for sivs and the way portfolio managers need to evaluate them however she adds that money market investors "should take comfort" in the effort to resolve the problem it can be tough for money market fund investors to determine how much exposure a fund has to the siv market sivs generally have obscure names such as sigma finance or cullinan finance and the holdings are often grouped by the type of security the siv issues such as commercial paper or medium term notes even once an investor identifies a security as an siv offering it can be hard to track down information on the particular siv issuer sivs raise money by selling short term debt and using it to buy higher yielding long term securities profiting on the difference between the interest rates on the two however bond market turmoil lessened the appetite for such short term debt among investors such as money market funds turning the siv business model on its head money market fund siv related holdings vary the &# billion columbia cash reserves portfolio for
