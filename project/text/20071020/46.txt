politics &amp economics how blast may affect pakistan tone of bhutto response could rally the nation or prompt crackdown pakistan opposition leader benazir bhutto refrained from blaming president pervez musharraf for thursdays deadly bombings in the port city of karachi but she said elements within his government tried to kill her the attack which narrowly missed ms bhutto killed at least people authorities said it was an assassination attempt by a suicide bomber if ms bhutto seeks to use the bombings to criticize the government of president musharraf for security lapses and failing to protect her and her supporters it could create schisms in the new power sharing agreement she reached with president musharraf that permitted her to return to pakistan to run for a third term as prime minister should such criticisms prompt violent antigovernment demonstrations chances could increase that president musharraf would declare a state of emergency or martial law especially because he is facing a cloudy future he recently was re elected president for another five year term but pakistans supreme court has yet to validate the result so far there have been no signs of a popular uprising against the government the city of karachi was largely shut down friday with schools universities and many businesses closed if instead ms bhutto years old takes the opportunity in the weeks ahead to rally the nation against islamist extremism she could galvanize the country to tackle more forthrightly its biggest scourge authorities suspect al qaeda and the taliban were behind the bombings that tack could bring supporters of other opposition parties to ms bhuttos side even though many of them have distanced themselves from her since she began negotiating with president musharraf if her popularity were increased as a result her pakistan peoples party could sweep parliamentary elections in january installing her in the prime ministers office with a broad mandate and giving her the upper hand in sharing power with president musharraf at a news conference friday in karachi ms bhutto sounded notes from both themes she accused three unnamed government officials of conspiring in her attempted murder but didnt reveal their identities "i am not accusing the government i am accusing people certain individuals who abuse their positions " she said ms bhutto also appealed to "all citizens of pakistan and all those who are true muslims to look into their hearts and not to support violence " and she described the bombings as "an attack on democracy and on the very unity and integrity of pakistan " pakistan has faced a dramatic increase in extremist attacks which have moved from the lawless northwest tribal areas into pakistans biggest cities in recent months a spokesman for pakistans army maj gen waheed arshad said the army is determined to do whatever it takes to erase the threat "it is in the national interest and part of our national commitment to eradicate extremism " he said "we are all committed to ridding this country of extremism " democracy advocates said the best answer to tackling extremism is to ensure free and fair elections in january and that pakistans government in the future is properly representative of its people "its a serious blow to the democratic restoration and election prospects " i a rehman director of the human rights commission of pakistan in lahore said of the bombings but he said "elections should not be postponed or disrupted martial law isnt an answer " a spokesman for president musharraf rashid qureshi said he doubted the attack would lead to a change in direction "if someone thinks that by spreading this kind of terror they will stop the political process in pakistan i dont think thats correct i dont think that will happen " he told the associated press ms bhutto was surrounded by extensive security from the moment she arrived thursday and was greeted by massive crowds some police officers were among those who died a senior police officer said a lone suicide attacker lobbed a hand grenade to break the security cordon around ms bhuttos truck before blowing himself up authorities said security vehicles escorting her carried devices that were designed to jam the remote triggering of bombs but were ineffective against manually detonated devices some observers said she had been warned in advance about threats to her personal security especially after she made comments while still in self imposed exile that were widely interpreted as antagonistic to extremist elements both in the country as a whole and in the political establishment on sept two pakistani newspapers reported that ms bhutto said that if she returned to office she would give the united nations international atomic energy agency direct access to rogue pakistani nuclear expert a q khan she reportedly added that she also would appoint a parliamentary committee to investigate whether other pakistanis were involved in illegally selling the countrys nuclear technology she also has accused senior pakistani officials of "collusion" with militants and said parliament needs the power to act "without being destabilized by elements of the security apparatus who do not wish to see the terrorists and the extremists contained " shahid shah and raphael pura contributed to this article
