weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes dessert wine delights i bought my mother a gift certificate for some wine classes last christmas and she invited me to tag along last night one of the wines was a tokaji aszu from hungary we were blown away can you recommend some other dessert wines that we might also enjoy in anticipation of the holidays ill be keeping an eye out for this and other similar wines because i cant imagine a more thoughtful and imaginative gift for my wine drinking friends tom jordak charlotte n c we agree completely both that tokaji is incredible and that a fine dessert wine is an excellent unexpected holiday present not only does it taste great but it might change someones whole idea about how special a sweet wine can be tokaji which we once described in our column as "a majestic wine of oranges stewed peaches and plums and rich earth with a finish as light as a souffle " can be hard to find and is quite expensive but it is indeed a thoughtful present another possibility is icewine from canada an intense memorable wine made from super sweet frozen grapes in a column two years ago we also suggested a fine sauternes as a holiday present as we wrote then "there is no sweeter gift than sauternes and we mean that literally " while chateau dyquem is the greatest sauternes and would make a spectacular gift there are many excellent sauternes available at far more reasonable prices for our column about them drop us a note at wine wsj com in a recent "tastings" column we recommended visiting small little known wineries whenever youre in a wine region anywhere in the world that brought a number of responses similar to this one visiting the smaller "noncorporate" wineries has been our philosophy for years your description of the friendly staff at these smaller wineries reminded me of an experience we had on a napa valley trip several years ago when visiting a winery we always ask the tasting room staff where else we should go we frequently get wonderful recommendations of little known wineries that can turn out to be the best of the trip places that literally arent on the map the representative at one stop recommended a small winery just a short distance away that we had never heard of before when we found the property we were disappointed to find the sign at the end of the driveway said that the winery required advance reservations thinking we might return later we dialed the winery from the car and inquired of available times when told that we were sitting at the end of their driveway the tasting room representative cheerfully invited us in goosecross remains one of our favorites to this day david w carpenter elk grove village ill you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to include your name city and state
