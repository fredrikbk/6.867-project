weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink cognacs cousin from gascony armagnac has an image problem to start with not that many people seem to be sure exactly what it is kingsley amis in the "mean sods guide" section of his book "on drink " suggested that the mean sod that is cheap host can avoid the expense of serving a post prandial cognac by presenting his guests a "rather exceptional" armagnac "a watered down cooking brandy from remote parts of france or from south africa " since few know what armagnac a french brandy not unlike cognac but from the heart of gascony should taste like the average guest will be easily fooled amis suggested but ignorance isnt the biggest impediment to armagnac finding the market it deserves far worse is that to the extent most folks have heard of armagnac the impression they have been given is that it is a pompous quaff for phonies and poseurs and heavies characters such as senator planet guy francon sheridan ballou and eugene lopwitz senator planet in john dos passoss indictment of american avarice "the big money " makes todays abramoff crowd look like kindergartners "ive been much criticized of late " laments the senator over a lavish dinner with lobbyists "by irresponsible people of course for what they term my reactionary association with big business " to punctuate senator planets reactionary bona fides dos passos puts a brandy in his hand and has the rapacious fellow proclaim "fine armagnac has been my favorite for years " a few years later ayn rand picked up the theme the novelist prided herself on penning caricatures of phonies such as guy francon who in "the fountainhead" embodies everything her architect hero howard roark despises a rich and successful architect francon is intellectually lazy and stylistically derivative francon "hasnt designed a doghouse in eight years " but when he did he was fond of such touches as "corinthian columns of cast iron painted gold and garlands of gilded fruit on the walls " and what does francon like to drink armagnac rand seems to associate armagnac with the most contemptible sort of self satisfaction the paragraph that ends with francon declaring he has fired roark because "the insolent bastard" refused to mock up a simplified doric design for an office building begins with the boss bragging about how he buys his favorite armagnac for "a hundred dollars a case " armagnac continued to come in for such abuse in raymond chandlers novel "the little sister " sheridan ballou is a hollywood agent most notable for his pretentious affectations when detective philip marlowe first visits ballous office the agent strolls across the carpet swinging a malacca cane "it could only happen in hollywood " sneers marlowe "that an apparently sane man could walk up and down inside the house with a piccadilly stroll and monkey stick in his hand " ballou soon has a glass of armagnac in his hand instead the agent pours a "pot bellied" glass for marlowe too and then congratulates himself for it "armagnac he said if you knew me youd appreciate the compliment " ballou then demonstrates the approved method for enjoying the drink "he lifted the glass sniffed and sipped a tiny sip " marlowe is having none of that nonsense "i put mine down in a lump it tasted like good french brandy " "my god " sputters the agent "you sip that stuff you dont swallow it whole " "i swallow it whole " is marlowes blunt reply derision of armagnac or at least of those who fancy it isnt restricted to mid century authors tom wolfe uses the brandy in "the bonfire of the vanities" to fill out the picture of sherman mccoys boss eugene lopwitz the financier who has created a faux english manor lifestyle for himself maintains a private jet he keeps stocked with a armagnac "its great stuff " lopwitz crows "thats the greatest year there ever was for armagnac " unlike its cousin cognac armagnac has long featured vintage dating which is confounding to casual consumers but catnip to the sort of dilettante eager to bank impressively obscure knowledge thus armagnacs impression of fussiness a reputation that is not deserved if anything armagnac is less fussy than cognac which has been criticized over the years for being so carefully matured and blended that it ends up missing the quirky individuality natural say to single malt scotch though both cognac and armagnac depend in large measure on negociants merchants who buy up casks from small producers to age blend and bottle under a brand name armagnac is decidedly less corporate than cognac which is one of the reasons that the gascon brandy brands are generally less well known than courvoisier hennessy and martell but it is also the reason that armagnacs tend to have a little more personality than cognacs this is certainly the case with the single estate vintage unblended armagnacs bottled by the boutique negociants such as francis darroze even the mainstream blended armagnacs retain a hint of rusticity that makes them a pleasant change of pace from cognac i went to my local liquor stores to see what nonvintage armagnacs i could find and enjoyed most of them they shared the regional style which is somewhat drier than brandy from the cognac region of those i tried i particularly liked several including the cerbois v s o p that had a satisfying richness cut with a nice spicy note of licorice the laubade x o was dense without being heavy with a taste of toast just shy of being burned the kelt reserve de chateau de saint aubin had a slight scent of smoke but on the tongue was light and soft with a lovely balance between its taste of fresh fruit and its buttery texture the kelt by the way ought not to be confused with "domaine de saint aubin" a legendary producer of armagnac that is no more the remaining stocks of which are being carefully and expensively doled out by darroze if you give armagnac a try dont feel obliged to swirl it in a snifter or sample it in baby sips even so please dont put it down in a lump email me at eric felten wsj com nonvintage armagnac good very good kelt reserve de chateau de st aubin &# light and soft with a lovely balance of fruit and buttery smoothness cerbois v s o p &# rich but brightened by a spicy hint of licorice laubade x o &# dense without being heavy the taste of well done toast
