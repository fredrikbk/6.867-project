weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece a manual to freedom now on the road is filled with wild joy and despair anatomy of a classic the summer i turned i dragged myself semiwillingly into fort bragg n c with my rotc uniforms and equipment in two deliberately unmilitary samsonite suitcases two curious items were in the luggage one was a navy blazer in case frequent gentlemanly breaks for gin and tonics turned out to be an integral part of army officer training the other was the most powerful antidote to military rigidity i could think of my already worn paperback copy of jack kerouacs "on the road " everyone who came to the asphalt altars of "on the road" in a state of squirming desperate youth has a story about how the book saved or dazzled or propelled him into an ecstatic wonderment like that of its elusive hero dean moriarty my copy the th anniversary edition was my manual for freedom just as it was for numberless other youths who felt straitjacketed by their families their communities or their own lack of experience or surplus of inhibitions this fall the season of "on the road"s th anniversary the book remains a mighty force a hardcover reprint rose to no on the new york times best seller list and for the first time the famous "scroll edition" an early draft with no paragraph breaks blurted out in three weeks on feet of taped together drawing paper has been published how many books spark demand for a rough cut rereading kerouacs masterpiece which still sells copies a year may leave you with a startlingly different impression this time around though ostensibly about the howling urgent now its also soaked with loss one eye is always on the rear view mirror on the vanishing and vanished setting his sentimentality to the mad rhythm of an ebullient new language kerouac is the missing link between thomas wolfe and tom wolfe the books joy is infectious the open call to "dig" everything how every citizen in every bar and bus station is "crazy" or "mad" or "holy" but the jazz flutter plays over a tocsin of despair the books narrator kerouacs alter ego sal paradise calls himself a "haggard ghost" with "the sensation of death kicking at my heels " he begs dean "this cant go on all the time all this franticness and jumping around weve got to go someplace find something " "on the road" isnt manic its manic depressive and though kerouac presents the many drugs his characters take as experience intensifiers the books impossible highs and crushing lows today come across not as a fury for living but as something like the opposite a retreat from reality into a pharmacological haze minus drugs life couldnt be this intense it would be like being in the grip of first love forever people like dean moriarty a virtually undisguised portrait of kerouacs friend neal cassady are around us but in real life youd avoid them a car thief who hits his first wife so hard that he broke his thumb dean is a shiftless alcoholic cadger who dumps three wives over the three years in which the book takes place leaving his children littered across the landscape his sole occupations are raising hopes and dashing them "i have finally taught dean that he can do anything he wants become mayor of denver marry a millionairess or become the greatest poet since rimbaud " says sal "but he keeps rushing out to see the midget auto races " deans charisma is impossible he never walks he rushes he doesnt drive he roars "he leaped into the phone booth " how do you leap into a phone booth for all of sals talk of "the holy con man with the shining mind " deans conversation is either druggie gibberish "darling you know and i know that everything is straight between us at last beyond the furthest abstract definition in metaphysical terms or any terms you want to specify or sweetly impose or harken back " or as vapid as larry king at a poetry reading "ah god life yes look at her " though kerouac frequently tells us how brilliant dean is he almost never shows us relying heavily on paraphrase its not dean who shines its the descriptions his friend drapes over him as in for instance the books most famous passage about "the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved desirous of everything at the same time the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles " sals obsession with dean no less passionate for its not being sexual is the books roman candle "on the road " like "the great gatsby " is a great american love story of longing and loss though the book ends shortly after dean ditches a feverishly ill sal in mexico and sal finally realizes "what a rat he was " disillusionment doesnt begin to overpower the ardor in the books final paragraph with dean as its magnetic force his name the books final words a passage deleted from the original scroll in which kerouac and cassady appear under their own names clarifies kerouacs feelings "my interest in neal is the interest i might have had in the brother that died when i was five years old " he writes referring to an actual tragedy in his family another passage from the scroll that didnt make the final draft is an epigraph from walt whitman "camerado i give you my hand will you give me yourself will you come travel with me shall we stick to each other as long as we live " nick carraway says of jay gatsby after a seemingly perfect afternoon with daisy buchanan that "there must have been moments even that afternoon when daisy tumbled short of his dreams not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion " like daisy who "perhaps never went in for amour at all " dean is forever tumbling short but its the colossal vitality of sals illusion that still makes "on the road" roar mr smith is a film critic for the new york post who blogs at www kylesmithonline com
