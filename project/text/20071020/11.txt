cough medicine dilemma widens advisory panel says children under six shouldnt get drugs silver spring md a food and drug administration advisory panel said friday there is no evidence that over the counter cold and cough medicines work in children and the products shouldnt be given to those younger than years old the committees recommendations if the fda chooses to follow them would cap an extraordinary reversal of decades of medical and commercial practice with the drugs which have long been marketed to treat children and even young toddlers and babies it may also put a spotlight on the regulatory system surrounding them which largely extrapolated evidence of effectiveness gathered from adult patients to conclude that the products could be used in children an estimated million units of childrens over the counter cold and cough medicines are sold each year in the u s among the products likely to be affected if the fda follows the panels recommendations are medications sold under a range of brands including johnson &amp johnsons tylenol plus cold novartis ags triaminic and wyeths robitussin the companies had already pre emptively moved to stop selling versions aimed at babies younger than but the committees recommendations went well beyond their action the consumer healthcare products association an industry group had defended the products use in older children when taken at recommended doses linda suydam president of the association which represents makers of over the counter drugs said after the meeting that products for children to years old will remain on the market "these products are safe and effective and parents rely on them " fda officials said any changes to the labels of the drugs would have to go through a lengthy federal rule making process because they are regulated under a different structure from typical prescription drugs in the meantime john jenkins director of the agencys new drugs office said the fda would "get back to the public in the near future about whether we have any recommendations about the safe and effective use of these products " the fda said only studies of the products have been conducted in children during the past years and that most of them found the medicines werent effective however agency staffers also said that many of the studies had design flaws the committee found that the medications havent been proven to help in treating children and younger and members unanimously called for clinical studies of the drugs in that age group "theres overwhelming evidence they are not generally recognized as effective in age to " said panel member thomas newman a professor at the university of california san francisco still the group stopped short of saying that children ages to shouldnt use the drugs amy celento stamateris the patient representative on the panel said that without at least some childrens cold and cough products on the market "there are many people who will administer adult products to their children because they work for them and id be very concerned " the panel voted to recommend that over the counter cold and cough products shouldnt be used in children younger than panel members said there was "modest" evidence the drugs work in adults in addition to questions about how well the drugs work the fda had raised potential worries about their safety agency safety reviewers said their analysis suggested use of some of the drugs was associated with serious side effects and some deaths in patients younger than the fda said in documents prepared in advance of the meeting that it had received reports of deaths in children linked to decongestants containing the ingredients pseudoephedrine phenylephrine and ephedrine from to sept and reports of deaths linked to antihistamines with the ingredients diphenhydramine brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine the agency said the bulk of the reports were in children younger than some of the deaths occurred in children who received overdoses and an fda official said the agency worried that parents might be inadvertently giving young children multiple medications that contained the same ingredient the broad review of the medications was set off by a group of doctors who petitioned the fda in march to change the labeling of over the counter cough decongestant antihistamine and cough and cold products to say that they "have not been found to be safe or effective in children under for treatment of cough and cold " the panel did "exactly what we asked for " said joshua sharfstein one of the petitions signers and the health commissioner of baltimore "these products were held up to a standard of scientific review they could not pass "
