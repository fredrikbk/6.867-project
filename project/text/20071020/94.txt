what happened in syria over the last few weeks state department officials have reported major diplomatic breakthroughs that will roll back north koreas nuclear weapons program allow pyongyang to be removed from the u s state sponsors of terror list and normalize relations between our two countries north korea reportedly has agreed to disable its nuclear facilities and has as it has done many times before promised to give a full accounting of its nuclear program the latest deadline is dec congress has been asked to support this agreement which state department officials claim will benefit our nation and promote regional stability then early last month israel conducted an airstrike against a facility in northern syria that press reports have linked to nuclear programs by north korea iran or other rogue states if this event proves that syria acquired nuclear expertise or material from north korea iran or other rogue states it would constitute a grave threat to international security for which syria and any other involved parties must be held accountable the bush administration however has thrown an unprecedented veil of secrecy around the israeli airstrike it has briefed only a handful of very senior members of congress leaving the vast majority of foreign relations and intelligence committee members in the dark we are among the very few who were briefed but we have been sworn to secrecy on this matter however we are prepared to state based on what we have learned that it is critical for every member of congress to be briefed on this incident and as soon as possible we are concerned that although the bush administration refuses to discuss the israeli airstrike with the american people or with the majority of congress it has not hesitated to give information on background to the press to shape this story to its liking new york times writer david sanger authored and coauthored articles on oct and that appeared to reflect extensive input from senior policy makers washington post writer glenn kessler coauthored an article on sept that also cited inside information from the administration we believe this is unacceptable we want to remind president bush that the constitution invests congress with various powers and authority over foreign policy not only does congress have an obligation to conduct oversight over these matters but it is accountable to the people of this country to ensure that their security and interests are safeguarded the proposed deals with north korea will involve substantial expenditures of u s funds to pay for heavy fuel oil deliveries congress will be asked to approve the authorization of funds for this expenditure we cannot carry out our duties when we are being denied information about these critical national security matters we all want to secure agreements that address the proliferation of nuclear weapons ballistic missiles and unconventional weapons however for these agreements to have long term viability they must be transparent and based on close consultations and collaboration with the congress if the israeli airstrike last month is related to covert nuclear collaboration involving syria and either north korea iran or other rogue states this may or may not be an issue that can be easily addressed by negotiations alone it is certain however that such a serious international security issue will not stay secret forever congress therefore needs to be fully briefed not just on the details of the airstrike but on how to address this matter and how if press reports are true rogue states will be held accountable for what could amount to a very serious case of wmd proliferation we regret that the administration has ignored numerous letters from congress asking that all members be briefed on the israeli airstrike failing to disclose the details of this incident to the legislative branch preventing due diligence and oversight but talking to the press about it is not the way to win support for complex and difficult diplomatic efforts to combat proliferation by rogue nations until congress is fully briefed it would be imprudent for the administration to move forward with agreements with state proliferators congress must be a full partner in this process and from this point forward must be kept dutifully and currently informed about this matter mr hoekstra is the senior republican member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence ms ros lehtinen is the senior republican member of the house foreign affairs committee
