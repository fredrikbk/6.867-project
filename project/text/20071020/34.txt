mukaseys constitution while nothing emerged from the confirmation hearings this week to prevent judge michael mukasey from becoming attorney general the questioning did show that he will be his own man and wont let himself be intimidated into adopting any senators personal interpretation of the constitution on wednesday judge mukasey explicitly repudiated the controversial bybee memo which argued for an expansive view of presidential authority regarding the geneva convention and torture "the bybee memo to paraphrase a french diplomat " said judge mukasey "was worse than a sin it was a mistake it was unnecessary " and on his independence of mind as attorney general in matters of bedrock law or ethics judge mukasey said that if he disagreed with president bush "i would try to talk him out of it or leave " democrats loved that their ardor dimmed a day later however when judge mukaseys democratic interlocutors tried to get him to declare himself on the legality of specific interrogation techniques in particular on "waterboarding" simulated drowning mark us down as thinking it a sign of judge mukaseys character to have finally told the senators that he would not put the careers or "freedom" of the interrogators of captured terrorists at risk "simply because i want to be congenial" with the senators views on waterboarding on the issue of executive authority for warrantless eavesdropping judge mukasey was also robust and refreshing the president he said "does not stand above the law but the law emphatically includes the constitution " and that constitutional authority he said includes the presidents power to defend the country this was not what senator pat leahy and his colleagues wanted to hear and they groused publicly as is their habit but arent these the same members who had said going in to the hearings that they didnt want a yes man as attorney general we would hope that includes not taking dictation on constitutional interpretation from individual members of congress see related letter "letters to the editor an insulting insinuation" wsj oct
