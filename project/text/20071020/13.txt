cross country kentucky derby bowling green ky kentucky republican gov ernie fletcher should have been a shoe in for re election this year four years ago he won the governorship in a walk after serving six years as a popular congressman hes an ex fighter pilot ex baptist minister and a very strong campaigner but as voters prepare to head to the polls in a little more than two weeks there is a political horse race underway here in kentucky and thanks to a nagging political scandal its gov fletcher who is trailing one recent poll found him behind democrat steve beshear by points there is a lesson for republicans in this when an incumbent is saddled with scandal its better to find a new horse to bet on four years ago things looked much brighter for the gop back then mr fletcher pulled off what had once seemed impossible by becoming the first republican to win the governors mansion in more than three decades he did it by getting votes from registered democrats thus defeating former attorney general ben chandler grandson of political icon a b "happy" chandler a former senator and two time governor republicans knew then that the key to electoral success was to win over conservative democrats disgusted by the scandal riddled administration of the incumbent governor paul e patton and the republicans were right mr chandler was never able to get out from under the shadow of mr patton who had admitted to an affair with a nursing home operator it didnt help that mr patton had been fined and publicly reprimanded by a state ethics commission for securing certification for his mistresss business and for promoting a state employee at her request the result was that mr fletcher won a point victory in a state with about a half million more registered democrats than republicans out of some million voters mr fletcher followed up with a few other victories promising to clean up state government he managed to both trim the states work force and cut the number of state cabinet posts to nine from how many governors can say they literally cut the size of their government that record alone might have assured mr fletcher a second term but its not all there is to the governors tenure a few years ago a state employee turned over emails and other documents to state attorney general greg stumbo that indicated members of the fletcher administration may have violated the states civil service laws by promoting state employees based on political affiliation the ensuing political firestorm engulfed the governor and his administration mr stumbo carried out an exhaustive investigation and ended up indicting several people in the administration including mr fletcher for his part the governor issued a blanket pardon for anyone who may have been involved with one exception the governor did not pardon himself instead last year he cut a plea bargain with the attorney general to have all charges against him dropped the damage however had already been done after the indictments few republican officials were willing to be seen in public with mr fletcher lt gov steve pence extricated himself from the matter by refusing to run for re election with him the question coursing through kentucky politics is this if republican officials are willing to abandon mr fletcher why would rural conservative churchgoing "value" voters who are democrats because "my granddaddy was" come out to support the scandal plagued governor ann northrup tried to force an answer to the question by running against mr fletcher for the gops nomination shes a former member of congress from louisville and a favorite among many conservatives but in the may primary she proved that she doesnt have a state wide following among republican voters she roughed up mr fletcher but lost handily she did however succeed at convincing mr fletcher of one thing if he has a shot at winning in november hed better do something to win back those value voters so coming out of the primary he immediately blanketed the airwaves with a tv ad campaign not to address the underlying issue of his nagging political scandal but rather to take on an issue that he hopes will rile up conservative democrats gambling he then kicked off his general election run with a "no casinos" tour in a different year it probably wouldnt be a half bad campaign strategy gambling is a hot issue in kentucky right now because residents are worried about "racinos" casinos at horse race tracks cropping up across the state or as gop state chairman steve robertson put it conservative democrats in rural areas are worried about casinos "popping up in their back yard " well see if this is enough to get the democratic voters mr fletcher will likely need but as someone who spends a considerable amount of time worrying about public policy in kentucky i have a larger concern regardless of who wins in november a campaign that turns on inflaming the passions of relatively few voters will produce little political capital to take on the pressing problems of the state the tax foundation for example reports that only states have a worse business climate than kentucky its no wonder then that when nissan north america inc decided recently to move its headquarters with some jobs out of california it didnt come to the bluegrass state instead its taking its jobs to our neighbor to the south tennessee where its cheaper to run a business heres another issue the financial report of the kentucky retirement systems shows that they are carrying some &# billion in unfunded pension and health care liabilities a deficit that translates to about &# for every man woman and child in kentucky solving that and other issues will require hard political decisions and a governor who has enough political capital to win tough policy fights elections are always gambles but the odds that residents will win in the end are so much longer when the state is mired in the politics of scandal mr waters is the director of policy and communications for the bluegrass institute a free market think tank see related letter "letters to the editor if the shoo fits " wsj oct
