what would be one of the largest backup credit lines in history was kicked off by an organizational meeting thursday afternoon at which bankers disclosed the interest tally the same person said the credit line is needed to enable the planned fund to raise cash by issuing short term debt those funds would then be used to purchase assets from siv investment funds some of which are facing collapse

short term funding dried up this summer in the credit crunch the three banks leading the loan syndication bank of america corp j p morgan chase &amp co and citigroup inc would contribute as much as half of that total citigroup which manages the most siv assets of banks globally is expected to contribute more than the other two the group has about a half dozen indications of interest of &#
