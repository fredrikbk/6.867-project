weekend journal books deep focus reappraising the life and career of a famously mercurial filmmaker otto preminger by foster hirsch knopf pages &# as many contemporary artists have discovered a stylistic conceit pushed far enough is apt to win admirers at least in france such is the case of otto preminger whose fabulous life and career is recounted in a strangely likable biography by brooklyn college prof foster hirsch at one time americas most famous film director alongside alfred hitchcock preminger brought off an unusual triumph achieving success and great fame while turning in work that rarely rose above mediocre he is best remembered for "laura " the murder romance that became his only after he had as producer undermined and betrayed the director who had cast the movie and begun filming it much more interesting than most preminger films was his life he liked to say that he was born in vienna in december but it was actually witznitz poland now in romania a year earlier his grandfather was an impoverished talmudic scholar and his father a brilliant lawyer who became at age the chief prosecutor for the austro hungarian empire forced out of office in with the fall of the habsburgs he shifted to private practice and the family grew rich premingers father made a bargain with his pampered and stage struck son take a law degree then follow your theater interest otto did both becoming a protege of director max reinhardt at viennas theater in der josefstadt premingers weaknesses were spotted early reinhardts entourage mr hirsch writes "was not convinced of the young mans talent as either an actor or a director " premingers strength was management and he was soon running reinhardts theater "otto had a terrific way of pushing through things " premingers younger brother ingo told mr hirsch "he had a way of convincing people he could do what he said he was planning to do and then he would come through on his promises and he was a master of publicity a publicity genius really " in joseph schenck the co founder of twentieth century fox met preminger on a talent scouting trip through europe and invited him to los angeles to work at the studio after eight months as a bystander on the fox lot he was given two "b" pictures to direct but he gained the initial favor of schencks partner darryl f zanuck in an industry known for bad behavior preminger became notorious for his trantrums and cruelty as with most successful bullies it was the less powerful he picked on he forgot this rule in his first big assignment for zanuck the film of robert louis stevensons "kidnapped" when zanuck disappointed with the films dailies accused him of having made changes in a scene preminger exploded "the veins in his neck started to throb " mr hirsch writes "his voice rose to ear splitting volume " ordered by zanuck out of his office preminger slammed the door behind him "if you dont patch this up with zanuck " his studio pal gregory ratoff warned "youll never again work anywhere in hollywood " preminger found all doors shut and returned to new york looking for theater work taking a suite at the st regis he could not afford when confronted by the hotel manager colonel serge oblensky about the unpaid tab preminger charmed him into letting him stay on so long as he "did not use room service " premingers ticket back to hollywood would turn out to be clare boothe luces anti nazi play "margin for error " "there seemed to be a shortage of nazis in new york at the time " preminger would later write and so he reluctantly took the role of a nazi consul himself when fox bought the film rights and asked preminger to reprise the role he persuaded william goetz the interim studio head zanuck had gone off to war to give him a shot at also directing the film he turned in another lackluster job but caused no problems goetz gave him the go ahead to prepare "laura" and another "b" film then zanuck returned "his first order of business was to condemn the entire slate of films goetz had overseen in his absence " mr hirsch writes the goetz era films zanuck contended "would make the public vomit if we make the mistake of showing them " preminger was allowed to continue working on "laura" but only as producer the veteran film and theater director rouben mamoulian who had already clashed with zanuck on the tyrone power version of "the mark of zorro " was given the assignment here mr hirsch sticking to premingers version that mamoulian was "misdirecting" the film gives a flawed account of the directors firing according to an interview that dana andrews gave to columbia universitys oral history project andrews plays the detective in "laura" both preminger as producer and mamoulian as director encouraged him to play the part "as though he were a student of criminology from yale or harvard and not at all the hard boiled detective that you generally see " preminger andrews said "wanted to be different in this respect to blaze a trail " for the first couple of weeks the part was played that way then when zanuck reviewed the rushes he called a halt to the shooting and brought in the director producer and star zanuck told andrews to play the part like a typical detective "like pat obrien " here is andrewss account of the meetings denouement "otto came up and said why thats what i was telling rouben rouben became livid and said thats a lie you did not you explained to me that you wanted this man played in the other way the next morning mr mamoulian was out and mr preminger was the producer director of the picture a very curious little thing this of course it upset everybody in the picture because we were very fond of rouben " after the double cross preminger weathered a cast rebellion to complete the movie but zanuck still considered the finished film a bomb and only a favorable reaction from columnist walter winchell at a private screening saved the future film classic from possible oblivion preminger went on to make a number of bad and good films at fox most of the good ones e g "where the sidewalk ends" featuring andrews the films found an almost deliriously appreciative following in france where cahiers du cinema critics turned directors such as jacques rivette declared their admiration for premingers mise en scene defined as "the creation of a precise complex of sets and characters a network of relationships an architecture of connections an animated complex that seems suspended in space " but for most american commentators preminger as a director was a great producer for his first film outside the studio system he chose a slightly risque play "the moon is blue" he was mr hirsch says "counting on a censorship brouhaha to give the project notoriety " preminger helped with a stream of press releases trying to give the film a "naughty image " "we have to get a bishop to condemn it " preminger said when the production code administration fell into line raising objections a compliant press helped preminger portray an obvious marketing ploy as a heroic first amendment fight premingers uncontested success would be the ambiguous realistic seeming courtroom drama "anatomy of a murder" written by wendell mayes and starring jimmy stewart and lee remick in all his films he favored long master shots following lots of locomotion cars coming up driveways characters entering houses and climbing stairs he had an aversion to cuts and through them the ability to radically change the cameras perspective actors were put under enormous pressure having to complete long speeches or sequences according to premingers exigencies and within the limits of his hamstrung style during the shoot of "exodus" he kept extras standing in a jerusalem square all night to get a long lee j cobb speech in one take bill hayes cast in "the cardinal" told mr hirsch "hitler in a tantrum could not have conveyed a more frightening demeanor than preminger as he set out to demean or castigate " from the same film john saxon remembered "the moment he hired you he began to act as if you were going to ruin his movie yet in the way that he created difficulties he was ruining his own movie " premingers chief victim on the shoot tom tryon who played the title character said "i never did anything in my life i regretted more " years later catching sight of preminger from afar he confessed to thinking "tom thats the man who destroyed your life " perhaps at this point there was a chemical element to the intensity of premingers rages "otto used a lot of medication bottles and bottles of uppers and downers dexedrine and valium " his office manager in the early s said "i felt that the drugs created the mood swings " mr hirsch writing with the preminger familys apparent cooperation does what he can as counsel for the defense there were some actors preminger did not scream at and many cases of kindness mr hirschs book gains traction in its last third when he uses the many interviews conducted to make it a sort of oral biography showing preminger in a positive light the preminger story is transformed when in the late s he fell in love with and married hope bryce hired to work as costume coordinator during the french shoot of "bonjour tristesse" she gave the professional ogre an another identity as a doting father and family man thrice married and the veteran of many affairs a famous one was with dorothy dandridge his star in "cinderella jones" in preminger became in his s a loving paterfamilias to three children he had twins with bryce and reconciled with his son erik born years before and raised by his mother gypsy rose lee mr hirsch makes an especially moving story of this reunion between preminger and his son and describes the effect it had on his films but the best defense is left to premingers longtime friend the agent robert lantz "these days when almost everybody is so boring how i miss him " mr stillman is a filmmaker and novelist
