weekend journal leisure &amp arts more than a marketing gimmick why radioheads in rainbows really deserves attention if the most interesting aspect of a new album by a great band is how its distributed and priced weve got a problem luckily for us "in rainbows " radioheads new album thats available only via download at the bands site www inrainbows com is terrific itd be terrific even if we had to walk into a store to buy it which well be able to do early next year but when you hear it youll want it now downloading an album is old hat and so is a rock bands desire to have greater control over how its music is distributed what seems new about the british bands gimmick for "in rainbows" is that you pay what you want for it for the song single disc available since oct i paid gbp which translates to about &# less than a cd but more than we pay for most albums on itunes eight more songs will be available in early december you can lock in your purchase now at the price you choose if quantity is your measure of value know that the song "in rainbows" clocks in at under minutes which is much less music than in your average cd if quality matters most a question how much would you have paid for s "ok computer" capitol the bands third release and one of the greatest recordings in rock history a final factor to bear in mind versions of nine of the discs songs have been up on youtube for a while now where theyre free the bands seventh and latest studio album isnt "ok computer " nor is it as gnawingly interesting as radioheads sixth release s "hail to the thief " an insistent highly textured disc that married the bands gift for melody and its need to experiment with sound but it has many of the hallmarks of those two albums most notably fearless musicianship and a distinctive approach to song for all its use of crunching synthesized percussion and otherworldly sounds radiohead has as its foundation a tight traditional rock lineup with a killer rhythm section featuring phil selway on drums and colin greenwood on bass two guitarists who double on keyboards in jonny greenwood and ed obrien and thom yorke a charismatic singer and multi instrumentalist who writes lyrics unlike anyone elses producer nigel godrich has been with the band since "the bends" in but tradition can surrender quickly to the new when everybody in the band plays many instruments and easily switches or shares roles radioheads music achieves its distinctive sense of disorientation through a marriage of chaos and beauty no matter how much the band endeavors to disrupt the customary experience of listening to pop music its members superb musicianship makes their music familiar and accessible as well as thoroughly surprising "in rainbows" contains some of the bands most memorable ballads including the spry disquieting "house of cards " which arises from open chording on electric guitars and "all i need " a somber and gorgeous song built on a dark underpinnings mitigated by chimes and as it unfolds piano and a splash cymbal a droning piano and a haunting chorus of male voices provide the platform for "videotape " the albums finale another trait of the band is its sense of grandeur the lovely "nude " which the band originally developed during the "ok computer" sessions finds its tension on waves of strings in "reckoner " vivid percussion and gently picked guitars under mr yorkes falsetto belie the songs majesty until strings enter at its unsettling midsection had the beatles recorded the so called "white album" in they mightve come up with tracks like "faust arp " a folk tune enriched by a taste of cello and viola and "bodysnatchers "in which three chugging guitars all but swallow mr yorkes careening vocal before peeling back into a quavering sheet of sound " steps " "jigsaw falling into place" and "weird fishes arpeggi" remind us the band has been playing some of the songs on stage since at least mid at their cores are confident straight ahead modern rock performances enriched by modest studio tweakery for all the synths and noise making software its the sound of the slinky crackling guitars and mr selways drums that drives the songs underrated as a pure pop vocalist mr yorke sings with an unsettling blend of passion and detachment his oddly disassociated lyrics reinforce the bands sense of intense impassiveness and a curious mechanical phrase here and there disrupts and enhances revelation in "house of cards " he sings "the infrastructure will collapse voltage spikes throw your keys in the bowl kiss your husband goodnight " beautiful as "all i need" is mr yorke offers this as its opening lyric "im the next act waiting in the wings im an animal trapped in your hot car i am all the days that you choose to ignore " "videotape" may very well be about making a visual recording to be played after the narrators death by his own hand "this is my way of saying goodbye because i cant do it face to face no matter what happens next you shouldnt be afraid because i know today has been the most perfect day ive ever seen " mr yorke has been fine tuning those words for more than a year i dont see how he can make them any more penetrating than they are now in context with the music they devastate the hubbub around how "in rainbows" is distributed and at what price detracts from its wonder its a great album by rocks best band what else could matter once thats said if the music is this smart and this good ill take it any way they can get it to me and let the band name the price mr fusilli is the
