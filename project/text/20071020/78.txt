weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies long but not great indulged auteurs are plaguing theaters with hour wastes of time staggering out of the latest marathon movie i thought of an encounter a decade or more ago with a very old man in a small theater off broadway the theater had just started previews of an autobiographical play that seemed only slightly shorter than the playwrights life the performance i saw ran almost four hours including one merciful intermission after the show i stood at the back of the house waiting for a friend in the cast there was no stage door so everyone had to leave through the auditorium the wait was awkward because the playwright whom i knew slightly was standing there too waiting to give notes to the cast to avoid the uncomfortable subject of his play i made sporadic stabs at small talk while the audience filed out the last departing member of that exhausted group was a ninety something gentleman who approached us with small shuffling steps then fixed the playwright with a baleful stare "you wrote that " he asked the playwright admitted that he had "long " the old man said loudly "long " he shouted for emphasis "but " he added with a philosophical shrug "life is long " so it is but life has a way of getting shorter for all of us while movies grow ever longer earlier this month my friend anne thompson addressed the issue in an astute and succinct column in variety headlined "prestige pictures get super sized " in doing so she drew a crucial distinction between long movies that justify their length "gone with the wind " "lawrence of arabia " the "godfather" films "titanic " the "lord of the rings" trilogy and those that dont any of a dozen or more meanderers that come along every year but anne writes mainly for entertainment business readers who may or may not be disposed to remedy the problem the may nots are most likely to be self anointed auteurs stars star directors or producers with the clout to keep studios and distributors from amputating so much as a single frame of their deathless oeuvres my readers may welcome a reminder that the fault lies not with their flagging devotion to the movie medium but with a deepening broadening and ever lengthening plague of overlong films and dramatic longueurs the plague season coincides more or less with the flu season every fall and winter as award ceremonies beckon we are beset by films whose extended running times are supposed to signal seriousness and or ambition in recent years such allegedly prestigious releases have included "little children" minutes "dreamgirls" minutes "mystic river" minutes "memoirs of a geisha" minutes "munich" minutes "the good shepherd" minutes and the definitive emblem of going ape on this count "king kong" minutes the current season has already brought "lust caution" minutes and soon will bring not to prejudge the quality of these upcoming films only to note their run times ridley scotts "american gangster" minutes and paul thomas andersons "there will be blood " which reportedly ran minutes when it was recently sneak previewed in austin texas enough is enough long doesnt automatically mean serious any more than short automatically means frivolous "rashomon" minutes "breathless" minutes "wild strawberries" minutes "dr strangelove" minutes having said that though how much is enough or too much the answer cant be found in length alone because our sense of time is subjective and elastic long movies have always been with us some have been follies "heavens gate" minutes while others have been glories abel gances silent classic "napoleon" minutes indeed i was a staunch some might say dogged supporter of paul thomas andersons "magnolia " which runs minutes though i admired just as intensely his "punch drunk love " which clocked in at minutes and earlier this month i came down firmly some might say heedlessly on the side of "the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford " an ultra long western minutes with an ultra long title words that struck me as consistently interesting thoughtful and entertaining i didnt expect to fall for it to the contrary i showed up at the screening with a heavy cargo of dread since the production had already provoked well publicized battles between warner bros whod wanted it cut to conventional length and its producer and yes co star brad pitt who opposed making cuts and prevailed but movie going is full of surprises in my own experience enough is when a film fills its running time with dramatic energy originality and variety with the stuff of life and too much is when it doesnt if long movies make us squirm or yawn its not because they arent short but because they arent full morgensterns picks time well spent as an example of how times and running times have changed the recent remake of " to yuma" requires minutes to cover the same dramatic ground as the minute original which was made years ago heres the long and short of three other films worth your time war and peace sergei bondarchuks enthralling exhaustive and inevitably exhausting screen version of the tolstoy novel was produced by the soviet government in the epic originally ran more than seven hours though its been trimmed slightly in various video and dvd versions see it in widescreen only the pan and scan miniaturization is a stupid joke at the internet movie database where i checked to see what people thought of it these days the slug on the first user comment was "the epic accomplishment of this film will crush your skull " not exactly the way id put it but the intent was complimentary the man on the train some movies go from bad to worse in two hours this french language film directed by patrice leconte from a screenplay by claude klotz goes from good to great in minutes two men neither of them young occupy the center of a contemporary story thats set in a small provincial city the man of the title milan is a tough loner played by the french rock idol johnny hallyday the other man who offers milan the hospitality of his seedy chateau is a retired poetry teacher named manesquier hes played by the peerless jean rochefort hamlet youve heard of the play but you havent seen the whole thing on screen unless youve seen kenneth branaghs uncut version an excellent and elaborate piece of work starring mr branagh as the melancholy dane with kate winslet as ophelia that was shot in and runs minutes it seemed even longer when i saw it in december of that year the screening didnt get under way until almost p m due to logistical problems at the concession stand im not making this up which meant that the movie didnt end until the next day
