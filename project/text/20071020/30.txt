inside the greed zone lt col gutierrez was a whistleblower was he also tainted by corruption around him camp arifjan kuwait marshall gutierrez was classic military material a working class kid whose father and both grandfathers served in the armed forces he joined the army and marched steadily up the hierarchy ultimately becoming a lieutenant colonel and chief logistics officer at this sprawling base in kuwait his army record was spotless and he developed a reputation as a bit of a straight arrow so it isnt surprising how lt col gutierrez reacted in when he discovered signs of rampant overcharging by the armys main food supplier for the iraq war bags of coca cola syrup available in the u s for about &# for example were going for &# he blew the whistle that triggered a massive criminal probe of kuwait based public warehousing co that is now raising questions for such major american food companies as perdue farms inc and sara lee corp and is shaping up as one of the biggest fraud probes of the iraq war then the tables turned the kuwaiti contractor accused col gutierrez of seeking bribes setting in motion a bizarre chain of events that left his military career and his year marriage in ruins on sept he was found dead in his quarters at the age of next to his body were an empty container of prescription sleeping pills and a plastic bottle of antifreeze the story of col gutierrez who army investigators allege wound up tainted by the very corruption he complained about is one thread in the expansive fraud and corruption investigation into firms supplying food to troops in iraq the justice and defense departments are investigating overcharging and possible favoritism in awarding of contracts col gutierrezs role in the inquiry emerges from interviews with military officials contractors and others involved as well as emails letters court filings and other written material marshall gutierrez grew up in the little town of las vegas in the foothills of new mexicos sangre de cristo mountains a descendant of the original farmers who received spanish land grants to settle the area he was a driven and intensely proud man both of his achievements as a soldier and his hispanic heritage says his widow brenda also a las vegas native the two met a quarter century ago at a church event he was she was at the age of brenda discovered she was pregnant a harsh predicament for two teenagers in a small conservative catholic community "his mother offered to send him away to another school elsewhere in the state and he didnt he married me " ms gutierrez recalled "this was not a guy that ran away from trouble or from any type of a difficult situation " they married two years later and he started serving in the army national guard the very next weekend after high school he worked his way through college on a scholarship from the army reserve officers training corps and became a commissioned officer in the couple commenced the itinerant life of a military family bouncing from newport news va to colorado springs colo to saudi arabia after the persian gulf war in panama capt gutierrez led the th transportation medium boat company which moved thousands of tons of materiel and in won a prestigious army award "he was a hard charger he did not accept any sort of failure his way or the highway was how he was " recalls sgt sean kelly who served under him in panama "but he also was able to motivate the people who worked under him to literally accomplish the impossible " eventually mr gutierrez rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and in he shipped out to camp arifjan in kuwait a large logistics and staging facility with fast food restaurants and internet cafes camp arifjan is now at the center of the u s inquiries into contracting corruption one saudi catering company tamimi global allegedly had a "party house" frequented by contractors and at least five military contract officers according to a sworn statement in july by a former army officer contained in u s court records the officer admitted taking &# in bribes and gifts from a tamimi executive and another &# from another catering firm he claimed he had witnessed at least five other army officers taking bribes in the course of roughly a dozen parties at the tamimi house camp arifjan sends numerous truck convoys to iraq every day most of the freight is handled by public warehousing which began as a modest kuwaiti government spinoff now publicly traded it is one of the largest transport companies in the world under a series of contracts worth more than &# billion public warehousing is designated a "prime vendor" for virtually all food served to u s forces in iraq and kuwait some stomachs within months of arriving in kuwait col gutierrez clashed with public warehousing over its prices for various items according to emails he sent that are now part of the army record of the case he questioned why public warehousing was charging the army about &# for five gallon bags of coca cola syrup when they could be found for around &# from kuwait city merchants the emails indicate col gutierrez began supplying information via email to gary shifton a top official at the pentagons defense supply center in philadelphia in november pentagon officials launched an investigation the inquiry focused on public warehousings pricing agreements with its own suppliers investigators suspect the military wound up paying inflated prices for everything from preserved milk to lobster tails according people involved in the investigation and courts records from u s civil litigation between public warehousing and the defense department the investigators are looking into whether public warehousing passed along high prices from its suppliers to the military then was improperly compensated by those suppliers through large rebates and discounts the court records and the people involved say one focus is sultan center a supplier with close ownership and managerial ties to public warehousing which refunded to public warehousing some of the military sales it received food wholesalers often give customers such as public warehousing "prompt payment" discounts of a few percentage points the pentagon agreed that public warehousing could keep such discounts according to emails cited in the u s civil litigation whats in dispute is whether those discounts were so excessive they amounted to kickbacks or whether they were improperly used to pump up prices public warehousing says in a statement that its prices include "not only the cost of the food it supplies but also the costs associated with storing handling and delivering it at multiple locations in a war zone " more than of its employees it adds have been killed on the job col gutierrez and his aides began systematically analyzing public warehousings prices he found some troubling numbers including that the army was paying &# a pound for green beans his emails indicate public warehousing says the military required a hard to find style of green beans prices were high on some other items that were perishable or hard to find from qualified suppliers it says col gutierrez and his team were getting help from public warehousings chief competitor tamimi global in january tamimis director of operations in iraq and kuwait shabbir khan provided col gutierrez and other officials with a spreadsheet comparing public warehousings prices to the local market at the time mr khan was already the subject of a major investigation involving fraud and bribery at camp arifjan he was subsequently convicted a spokesman for tamimi says mr khans illegal conduct occurred "without the companys knowledge " army officials say the investigation into tamimi is continuing and investigators are looking into mr khans contact with col gutierrez tamimi is cooperating its spokesman says a week after he received the spreadsheet from mr khan col gutierrez submitted his own analysis to his superiors at camp arifjan "i have started looking at the items we are purchasing from public warehousing " he wrote to the camps commander "we are being charged way too much for food " two days later on feb mr shifton of the pentagons contracting office in philadelphia sent an email to public warehousing declaring that "the urgent concern is that we are paying too much" for local items from sultan center "this matter is urgent " that triggered alarm at an outside consulting firm used by public warehousing to help it deal with the pentagon a few hours after mr shifton sent his email to public warehousing an executive at the consulting firm professional contract administrators of albuquerque n m sent an email marked "urgent" to public warehousing it advised public warehousings chief executive retired navy officer charles "toby" switzer to "fire somebody blame it on them and cover up" by revising the local market prices "asap this is very serious " mr switzer forwarded the messages to subordinates adding that he agreed "except the firing part " public warehousing officials say the tone of the emails is misleading the company they say was merely seeking to be attentive to customer complaints on feb mr switzer met with col gutierrez and other contracting officials and promised a thorough price review but soon col gutierrez was making decisions that werent good for either public warehousing or sultan center in early may for example he requested that some &# million in purchases of vegetables dairy and baked goods be shifted from public warehousing to tamimi in july the investigation took a strange turn col gutierrez had a meeting at camp arifjan with a public warehousing sales executive mike abdul rahman he passed mr rahman a piece of paper which read "i need kd can you help " according to a subsequent affidavit from an army investigator who interviewed mr rahman kd is the abbreviation for kuwaiti dinars a thousand dinars is worth around &# mr rahman told other officials at public warehousing the company said while top executives at the company debated what to do the two men met again on aug on aug case documents state public warehousings chief mr switzer approached one of the most senior officers at camp arifjan brig gen raymond mason and revealed the alleged bribe solicitation the general referred the matter to criminal investigators at camp arifjan on aug col gutierrez and mr rahman met once again this time at the officers home they allegedly discussed a &# payoff in exchange for inside information on bulk fuel and laundry services contracts the army case record states but again no money changed hands the officer claimed to need cash because he had taken a young kuwaiti woman as a girlfriend according to an investigators affidavit at the time col gutierrezs american wife who had been living with him in kuwait had returned to the u s to attend to a sick relative days later she received the news that he had purportedly married the kuwaiti girlfriend in a phone call from her husbands former housekeeper in kuwait who was angry about being fired on aug mr rahman met col gutierrez a little before midnight at an upstairs corner table at divas a restaurant with english sports playing on the television and pictures of american movies stars such as marilyn monroe and john travolta stripped across the marquee the two men smoked tobacco through a shisha a traditional arab water pipe mr rahman was wearing a hidden microphone both kuwaiti and army criminal investigators were monitoring from nearby case records indicate the two men left in col gutierrezs car for mr rahmans home the case record says as they drove mr rahman offered the officer a bundle containing the dinars according to two people with knowledge of the investigation col gutierrez told him to put it in the cars center console they say agents then surrounded the car and arrested col gutierrez the colonel protested that he was being set up his widow and a lawyer hired by his family now say they suspect he was framed by public warehousing because the company knew he had blown the whistle on it a spokesman for public warehousing say the company had merely "notified the government of a suspected corruption ring within the u s military in kuwait" and "played a pivotal role in a successful sting operation that stemmed from the investigation " following the arrest army investigators searched col gutierrezs home off the base and found alcohol and a magazine it termed pornography both are illegal in kuwait they also found some &# in u s and kuwaiti currency and a two week old kuwaiti marriage certificate which described col gutierrez as the husband of an year old kuwait resident named fatima al rahdi under the religion of islam ms al rahdi also known as yasmine couldnt be located for comment col gutierrez was charged with bribery mishandling secret information accepting illegal gifts and illegal possession of weapons alcohol and pornography and bigamy col gutierrez was locked in an by foot steel cage next to some soldiers accused of murdering iraqi detainees during his first hours of detention his lawyer wrote in a later legal filing he "momentarily succumbed to the weight of his circumstances" and underwent "a brief bout with momentary anxiety over his current predicament " military officials describe it as a suicidal episode but decline to elaborate later col gutierrez was caught with a makeshift knife fashioned from a plastic spoon and charged with illegal possession of a weapon two days later he was caught allegedly attempting to make a weapon from a safety razor five days after his arrest his military lawyer capt stephen mcgaha motioned to release him from preventive detention "the government has chosen to materially misrepresent the strength of their case by charging one alleged instance of bribery separate ways " he complained about a week later col gutierrez was released from detention and transferred to nearby camp victory to await court martial proceedings on sept shortly after a m col gutierrez went to a restaurant at the camp the green beans cafe and bought &# worth of muffins later that day his body was found in his camp quarters there was no note two autopsies concluded that he had died of poisoning from ingesting ethyl glycol the active ingredient of antifreeze the army ruled his death a suicide in an interview his widow brenda expresses bewilderment about his death which she is reluctant to characterize as a suicide "the last time i spoke to him he said were going to fight this the lawyer said it looks good so theres no way " many questions about the case remain how did he meet his second wife and why did they decide to marry what was the nature of the col gutierrezs relationship with the tamimi executive later convicted of bribery and more broadly how pervasive is fraud and corruption in the armys food procurement system the amount in dispute in the public warehousing investigation is at a minimum &# million according to people involved in the probe col gutierrez probably violated military law in his relationship with the kuwaiti woman official records show the marriage was legally registered with kuwaits ministry of justice on july the document states that ms al radhi was his second wife taking a second wife is legal in most islamic countries and lists his religion as muslim he agreed to pay her a &# penalty in the event they divorced james culp a lawyer who represents the gutierrez family argues that the evidence of corruption by the colonel is far from clear the audiotape of the sting operation he says is of poor quality and hard to understand and the other evidence is "weak at best if it even existed " the army says it cannot talk about the public warehousing probe because it is still open no evidence has been found indicating that col gutierrez had any substantial hidden assets the evidence inventory in the case listed a silver and gold rolex watch but it was recently returned to his family after mrs gutierrez produced a receipt showing her husband bought it before his deployment to kuwait several receipts seized by the agents showed that the liquor found in his home consisted of &# in purchases from the u s embassys american employees welfare association liquor sales are legal at the embassy but kuwaiti law bars the possession of liquor outside foreign embassies the government claims in a civil forfeiture action that the &# in cash is the proceeds of bribery mrs gutierrez says she insisted that her husband have a large sum of cash on hand "to make sure we could get the family out of kuwait fairly easy should something happen " mrs gutierrez says she doesnt know what to think about her late husbands purported second marriage but she refuses to believe that he was corrupt "none of this stuff fits in his character at all " she says "he had never been involved in anything like this and he has been in several other positions like this where he had access to lots of money millions and billions " "im very upset that he was put in that situation in the first place " she continues referring to his assignment to a base allegedly riddled with corruption "either way whether he did commit suicide or not the military has blood on their hands in my opinion "
