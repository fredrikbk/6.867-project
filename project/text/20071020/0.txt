ask encore focus on retirement how a charity can know an ira gift is from you in your oct column you state that a gift from an ira to a charity must be made "without your handling it in between " that sounds like the check must be made out to the charity and also delivered directly to the charity by the ira custodian but i have been informed by two ira custodians that the check may be sent to the ira holder and then the ira holder can forward the check to the charity i called the irs to confirm this and was told that this is indeed the case last year i had a difficult time getting confirmation from a charity for my tax records because the ira custodian wouldnt tell the charity whose ira the gift was coming from is there any way you can extract a written commitment from the irs that it is now acceptable for the check to be relayed through the ira holder philip del vecchio allentown pa the internal revenue service already has confirmed what youre asking for in writing first to review you can make direct gifts from your individual retirement account to a charity without paying any tax on the distributions involved if you are at least years old you can donate as much as &# in individual retirement account assets this year to tax qualified charities a temporary opportunity created by last years pension law but the provision expires dec so you would have to act soon such a transfer could count toward your required minimum distribution as well as you mention above we said last week that you would need to transfer the gift directly to the charity without handling it in between if you get your ira custodian to write a check to the charity and then deliver it yourself either by hand or in the mail the gift would still qualify for the tax free treatment according to an irs spokesman however you cant make a withdrawal from your ira deposit it into your own bank account and then write a check to the charity from your own account you also "cant make out your own check to a charity and then take the same amount out of your ira to pay yourself back " says ed slott an ira consultant in rockville centre n y "the test is this if you can cash the check from your ira custodian yourself then youve failed at making a direct transfer " as you describe above a lot of people using their iras to make donations worry that the charity wont know who ultimately gave the money when a check shows up from a big ira custodian however you can probably avoid any confusion by giving the charity a heads up that the money is on its way and also by making sure that the custodian includes your account number on the check later when you file your tax return heres another thing to keep in mind this "qualified charitable distribution " as the irs calls it is an exclusion from gross income so while you dont pay taxes on the distribution you cant also claim it as an itemized deduction as you would a typical charitable donation the irs spokesman says both of these points are spelled out in an irs publication issued in january irs notice which is available online to view it go to irs gov type "notice " into the search box then click on "internal revenue bulletin jan notice " question deals with your quandary question discusses the tax treatment send your question to encore wsj com ask encore focus on retirement is a weekly column answering readers questions about retirement and personal finance from annuities and bonds to trusts and inheritance issues please include your full name and city and state
