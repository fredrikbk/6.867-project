out of their gourds paddling pumpkins on lake pesaquid leo swinimer wins again but his pound fruit was cranky this year windsor nova scotia leo swinimer carefully climbed into his boat and dipped his paddle into the pond last saturday afternoon the craft rocked back and veered to one side keeping the pound pumpkin on course was going to be a trick "its a cranky one this year " the year old said fidgeting in the hollowed gourd as he tried to get his balance mr swinimer then attacked the pumpkin with a drywall saw enlarging the opening enough to give him more room to paddle but not enough to flood the boat "if you dont sit in the right place youll sink " he said on sunday he was ready to face about four dozen competitors in the chilly waters of lake pesaquid as they paddled their supersize pumpkins over a three quarter mile course in the annual windsor west hants pumpkin regatta the giant pumpkin weigh offs common across the u s and canada are a bit old hat towns are coming up with novel ways to get more mileage out their massive harvest "there was just something lacking in our town " says helen romans a windsor resident and former town councilor she approached local farmer danny dill eight years ago to ask how the town could better capitalize on its history as the birthplace of giant pumpkin growing mr dills father howard had spawned a new era of competitive growing in the s when he engineered mammoth pumpkins and patented the seed as dills atlantic giant but few took danny dill seriously when he proposed the race "nobody believed it could be done they looked at me like i had three eyes " he says today the race attracts spectators to windsor a town of the event has grown from five entries to this year divided into two classes a big one for contestants with kayak paddles and a small one for motorized pumpkin boats there were just four of those this year wayne hackney a year old pumpkin farmer who lives in winchester n h got there a bit before windsor did he was one of the first to use a pumpkin as a boat when he completed a two mile voyage across candlewood lake in western connecticut in he rigged a three horsepower motor to his pumpkin and outfitted the craft with a bilge pump and a windshield the trip took an hour and minutes attracting an armada including a police boat from a nearby marina two years later he organized a three man race in manhattans central park and later floated the idea of taking a trip to marthas vineyard the island off the southeast coast of massachusetts "that would be an awful tough voyage " he says since its first regatta in windsor has inspired contests in towns from cooperstown n y to elk grove calif three years ago ron wilson started a regatta in tualatin ore after he was denied access to a trout lake next to the decommissioned trojan nuclear power plant in rainier near the oregon border with washington the electric utility company portland general electric "didnt like the innuendo that we had freakishly large pumpkins on a lake" near the former nuclear facility says the year old soil scientist a pge spokesman says the company isnt able to accommodate every request for the use of its parks and that officials may have denied the request out of concerns that pumpkins could not safely be used as boats one year mr wilson says he watched a heavy set competitor climb into a pumpkin that was too small submerging it a foot below the water level undeterred he paddled the pumpkin across the finish line with his head above water and his boat beneath the surface "we called it the submarine " he says as the races grow in popularity serious racers are looking to breed better boats "theyre not well shaped for sailing " says james nienhuis a professor of horticulture at the university of wisconsin who started an annual race in madison he bred a sleeker version of the atlantic giant by crossing it with a pink banana squash in windsor last sunday the siren of a fire engine started the race and four boats overturned almost immediately belching a mess of pumpkin pulp and turning the unlucky boaters into the lake "it just wanted to sink " says scott brison a contestant who happens to represent windsor in parliament he says that competing in the race and suffering "the ignominy of pumpkin naval disaster" shows his constituents that he doesnt take himself too seriously most racers here buy their pumpkins from the dill farm but not mr swinimer the five time defending champion who grows his pumpkins to be boats during the hot summer months when the pumpkins are pliable he rolls them up on their stems to force them to grow flat and round "like a pancake " he says a week before the race he takes them from the vine and opens them up using his saw and a crowbar he and his "pit crew" his son and a nephew use custom built aluminum scraping tools to thin down the inside walls reducing the boats weight as much as possible the sleeves of his jacket get covered with pumpkin zest and juice as he hauls out hundreds of pounds of pumpkin the race is serious business for him he keeps a fiberglass replica of his first regatta winning boat in the attic of his barn framed pictures of past races adorn a living room wall and he displays his trophies next to his fireplace before the race he stores his pumpkin boat inside the toolshed of his barn where safely out of the damp air the fruit can dry out reducing its weight he fills the inside with foam to stiffen up the thinned out walls and then he dries out the inside of his boat with a hair dryer and small space heater but mr swinimer has other weapons beyond his pumpkin thick muscular forearms which earned him the nickname "popeye" as a halifax police officer "are you ready i dont want to leave you at the line " he said to jeff farwell a top challenger in his early thirties who replied "ive developed some oms of my own old man strength " during the race mr swinimer cut through the water with his rotor like paddling leaving many out of breath competitors in his wake he reached the dock first and received a heros reception from the crowd after collecting a trophy a carved wooden pumpkin with silver plaques that name past winners a ribbon and a &# check he reflected on his accomplishment "it has to be something that everyone that competes in anything feels when they win " he said "there is a certain satisfaction " before a crowd of admirers and reporters after the race mr swinimer announced that hes retiring his family looking on had heard it all before "every year he says its the last one " said his son in law ian poole "but as soon as march or april comes up hell be out growing them again "
