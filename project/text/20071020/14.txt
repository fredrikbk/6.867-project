dont blame the fha for subprime excesses john berlaus oct commentary opposing fha modernization "the subprime fha" is incorrect when he tries to pin the "worst excesses" of subprime loans such as unverified income levels on the federal housing administration the fha requires lenders to underwrite all loans and borrowers to document their credit history and income short term "flipping" of homes is also prohibited contrary to his claims mr berlau conveniently omitted that the fha despite considerable opposition from special interests has closed the loophole allowing seller funded downpayment assistance we agree that such loans have been a drag on the fhas portfolio for years they are a financial shell game where the seller wins and too many homebuyers lose our rule puts an end to this type of self serving circular financing arrangement and its harmful effects on homeowners and the housing market by closing this loophole the fha will help prevent more people from being steered into a situation where they dont understand the fine print and end up being foreclosed upon a healthy fha is good medicine for the ailing housing market it is self sustaining costing taxpayers nothing not "subsidized " as mr berlau claims it is safe with a foreclosure rate half that of risky subprime mortgages and it is sound free of costly gimmicks such as "teaser" interest rates or prepayment penalties it also offers mandatory loss mitigation meaning that we will work with homebuyers if they get in trouble but the fha must be updated for the st century outdated loan and downpayment limits have priced the fha out of high cost markets such as california which not coincidentally has been one of the states hardest hit by the housing crunch thats why the house and the senate banking committee each voted overwhelmingly to modernize the fha and its why president bush recently launched fhasecure which will expand the pool of homeowners able to choose a safe affordable fha loan into which they can refinance the time to modernize the fha is now low and moderate income borrowers desperately need an alternative to the riskier and more expensive subprime loans a new fha would also increase liquidity in the market place and help stem the overall credit crisis the subprime market share explosion from in to in was a major cause of the housing bubble the fha is part of the solution alphonso jackson secretary department of housing and urban development washington
