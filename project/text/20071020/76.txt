weekend journal books longing across a cultural divide the abstinence teacher by tom perrotta st martins pages &# the title of tom perrottas latest novel "the abstinence teacher " is misleading it implies a story about the sex education wars between the liberal secular left and the conservative christian right there is evidence of this in the book ruth ramsey one of two main characters teaches "human sexuality" at a suburban public high school and is putting her life back together after igniting public outrage with a single comment to students "from what i hear about oral sex some people enjoy it " and then there are cameo appearances like that of joann marlow a "virginity consultant" hired by the school superintendent to stand in as the perky "saving yourself for marriage" role model for ruths students joann is tasked with supplementing the new "wise choices" abstinence curriculum that ruth is required to teach but abstinence is really a gateway for mr perrotta to tell a much bigger and more complex story about religious identity in america one about how we define ourselves as believers or nonbelievers and about the familial and communal implications of setting ourselves up in such camps in this case the beliefs in question are about jesus and mr perrottas characters are either with him or not in the believer category is tim mason at first glance tim seems the poster child of the man transformed by religion his life having once hit bottom because of drug and alcohol addiction tim now the towns beloved girls soccer coach found salvation by way of the bible thumping jesus praising pastor dennis and his evangelical tabernacle of the gospel truth congregation faith is the power behind tims still nascent ability to say yes to a clean life a stable job and a christian second marriage his first wife divorced him during the bad old days but tim isnt a one trick pony either salvation may be sweet at first but it leaves a bitter aftertaste for him that occasionally drains the joy out of living and his faith widens an already painful disconnect with his daughter from his first marriage abby with whom he is forbidden to discuss religion upon penalty of losing visitation rights then there is ruth the so called abstinence teacher supposedly leading the care free life of the nonbeliever yet in reality living with post divorce loneliness and a growing weariness from fights on behalf of causes that she is no longer sure she supports in ruths struggle to "free" her two young daughters maggie and eliza from the shackles of public prayer at one of tims soccer games and to raise her children in an "open minded " tolerant liberal household she somehow deprives her daughters of the thing they truly and so ironically for ruth desire most faith and jesus "i just dont see what you need jesus for " a confused and stricken ruth says to eliza who has just asked for permission to go to an evangelical service on sunday with a friend "he loves me " eliza responds so simply and with such grace that ruth is left despairing over whether she was wrong to keep religion from their household and whether by doing so she may have damaged the way her beloved daughters see their mother "the abstinence teacher" is promoted by its publisher as satire yet it is also a deeply moving story of a man and a woman who see each other on opposite sides of a religious divide but both are parents both thoughtful and genuinely human both surprised by their mutual attraction and both interested in doing what is right through the lives of tim and ruth mr perrotta presents readers with larger questions as adults duke out their differences on the public stage each side determined to prove its right to righteousness often under the banner of "doing it for our children" at what cost to the kids do we wage these battles and at what cost to ourselves do we dig in our heels on matters that at times only succeed in burying us alive and all those we care about ms freitas is an assistant professor of religion at boston university "sex and the soul " her latest book will be published in april by oxford university press
