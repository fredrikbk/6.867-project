weekend journal books a fable of the round table sir gawain and the green knight translated by simon armitage norton pages &# "sir gawain and the green knight" is with "beowulf " one of the two great works of the native english tradition of alliterative poetry which was eventually displaced by rhyme in alliterative poetry the lines are held together not by what happens at the end of words but by what happens at the beginning in the classic four stress line the first three syllables taking heavy stress but not the fourth will start with the same sound for english with its strong tendency to hit the first element in a word hard and let the rest tag along behind this may seem a natural mode and country and western songs sometimes slide back into it without knowing when steve earle sings of his hot rod "ill be blastin down some blacktop jus my baby an me " he has a near perfect "sir gawain" line the th century poem translated anew by the british poet simon armitage has grabbed the attention of modern poets for many other reasons its story of a challenge issued to king arthurs court by a giant hairy green skinned knight who lives in the green chapel in the back of beyond reeks of myth and ancient midwinter sacrifice and it poses questions of honor and courage that are of perennial interest the challenge made in camelot on new years day will allow an opponent to strike the first blow with the green knights own fearsome battle ax "the mother of all axes " mr armitage calls it provided that the green knight is permitted to take his turn a year later one of arthurs young knights sir gawain accepts the challenge and the betting at the kings court is that gawain wont need to worry about facing the return blow wrong gawain skillfully decapitates the green knight who then plucks his head off the floor and tells gawain to turn up on time at the green chapel a year hence "so come or be called a coward forever " a test of courage therefore in the heroic tradition but "sir gawain" is the product of a much later civilization than "beowulf " and gawain must leap other hurdles first as he wanders the winter moors of northern england trying to keep his appointment while fighting off wolves and bears and hill trolls he comes upon a castle of what seems to be a courtly refuge its owner promises to get him to the green chapel on time and suggests that in the meanwhile gawain had better stay at the castle recover his strength and keep the owners wife company while he goes hunting the next three days in the poems central scenes juxtapose bloody violent daylong hunts for deer boar and fox all horns and disembowelings and hounds baying with quiet stealthy scenes in gawains bedroom with the lady of the castle she comes to him giggling showing off her low cut gown and eager she says for experience "youre free to have my all do with me what you will " not an offer to take up in what turns out to be the fairy castle of the malevolent sorceress morgan le fay gawain doesnt know it but the chivalrous knight has fallen into a trap meant to test his honor he succeeds in avoiding the ladys clutches but ultimately fails the test nonetheless by hiding evidence of their near trysts from her husband the trap is not revealed until days later at the moment when the green knight who turns out to be the castle owner is about to swing his ax gawain slinks back to camelot in shame yet translators have been drawn to the story of gawain as much by its strange language as by its plot "sir gawain" is very much not in standard english not even standard medieval english the poet came from near a place where three shires meet in the pennine mountains englands central spine the modern descendant of his dialect would now be well down the english pecking order but the writer shows not a trace of cultural cringe even though there are strong indications that the poem was written to please a garter knight the cream of medieval english chivalry in particular the garter knight might have been one of the earls of stafford who became monstrously rich from ransoming french captives during the hundred years war the epics english then is stiff with norse derived words now found only among farmers and miners it is admirably suited to describing foul weather and foam tusked boars but the poem also includes the french vocabulary of ultra high society how to get all this into modern readable form simon armitage a yorkshireman from the other side of the pennines has done his best to keep both the colloquial and the courtly elements of the mix alive its not easy the original poet says of gawain before the lady of the castles last attempt to seduce the beleaguered knight "in drey drouping of dreme draveled that noble " "dry drooping of dream" is a great phrase but whats "draveled" was gawain "traveling " walking strange paths in a nightmare or was he "driveling " muttering nonsense in his sleep mr armitage votes for the latter giving us "he dozes in a daze dreams and mutters " on the very last night before gawain goes out to face the giants ax the weather is clamping down outside the castle walls "the snawe snitered ful snart that snayped the wylde and drof uche dale ful of dryftes ful grete " though all the words in the first line sound as if they ought to be english the only stressed word to survive to the current day in a near form is "snow" snawe but you could leave the second line pretty much as is apart from spelling and it would be plain modern english mr armitage renders the lines "creatures were scattered by the stinging sleet driving snow into deepening drifts in the dales " which is a fair compromise but longer you notice and somehow politer sounding by contrast when gawain gets launched into one of his verbal demonstrations talking arthur out of taking on the giant himself or flattering the lady of the castle out of his bedroom the sentences in the original curl and roil like waves crashing on a beach the subject and the main verb in there somewhere but liable not to be noticed mr armitage deals with these challenges especially well in spite of the much more rigid word order of modern english when the lady of the castle hints that he should have asked for a kiss gawain says he couldnt possibly "for that durst i do not lest i devayed were if i were werned i were wrang iwysse yif i profered " mr armitage renders gawains complex evasion "i dare not kiss in case i am declined if refused id be at fault for offering in the first place " his translation helpfully supplies the medieval text on facing pages enabling you to see how he does it but either version would offer a serious test to would be sentence diagrammers mr armitages "sir gawain" faces stiff competition from other modern translations of this difficult poem for instance bernard odonoghues but he does get across the epics emotional authenticity and subtlety and its tough tricky sardonic core this translation reveals a writer closely attuned to centuries old local influences and traditions of language as the medieval poet of "gawain" says "in land so has been long " mr shippey is a professor of humanities at saint louis university his most recent book is "the shadow walkers jacob grimms mythology of the monstrous" brepols
