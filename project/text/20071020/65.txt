the week ahead our take on coming events medical science as stent sales stall cardiologists look to reduce safety concerns by ron winslow it was years ago that pioneering cardiologist andreas gruentzig performed the first balloon angioplasty procedure on a heart patient giving birth to a specialty that has transformed treatment of coronary artery disease in the past two decades but as interventional cardiologists toast their founding father at a big conference beginning this weekend in washington d c the glass clinking will be muted by the sober state of their business in particular the status of its flagship device known as the drug eluting stent johnson &amp johnson reported this week that sales of its cypher stent plunged more than in the third quarter from a year earlier revenue for boston scientific corp s taxus stent cyphers only current rival in the u s fell and boston scientific announced a restructuring that includes laying off workers the devices are tiny metal sleeves implanted to prop open diseased arteries the drug coated version minimizes chances that the stent will reclog within a few months a problem that has required redo procedures for about to of bare metal ones the current turmoil reflects thorny long term safety questions over the drug eluting devices in addition the results of a major study called courage last spring suggested many patients who routinely get stents could fare just as well on heart drugs fueling worries that too many patients were having stents implanted for too little benefit estimates are that this one two punch will result in fewer patients getting angioplasties in the u s this year down about now stent champions at the annual transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutics meeting long an annual showcase and promotion platform for the latest in stent technology are uncharacteristically on the defensive "were celebrating the th anniversary of a landmark event and were seeing the greatest year to year drop in the number of procedures in the history of angioplasty " says martin leon a founder of the cardiovascular research foundation which puts on the tct meeting which runs through thursday few major advances are expected at the session but dr leon promises "probably the largest collection of data ever presented on the issue of the safety of drug eluting stents " the question is will the results ease fears of practicing cardiologists and their patients over rare but potentially lethal blood clots that can form in the devices long after they are implanted other efforts are planned to push back against the message of the courage study which has given many cardiologists confidence to manage heart patients with cholesterol reducing statins aspirin and other medicines instead of referring them for an early angiogram an x ray peek at the coronary arteries that is the gateway to a stent procedure william oneill dean of clinical affairs at university of miamis miller school of medicine says stent patient traffic is beginning to pick up in south florida still restoring luster to the popular device is likely to be an uphill battle currently about of stent patients get the drug eluting version down from nearly months ago the rest get bare metal devices technology of the s dr leon says stent makers and analysts tell him drug coated stents may recover to a share next year perhaps bolstered by the anticipated arrival of medtronic inc s endeavor stent but the total number of angioplasty procedures is likely to remain flat europe court may curb politicians at vw boosting porsche by stephen power decades of german politicians influence over volkswagen ag are expected to crumble next tuesday when a european court issues a long awaited ruling on germanys "volkswagen law " possibly opening the door to a full takeover of europes largest auto maker by its biggest shareholder porsche ag the fight over how much influence german politicians should have at volkswagen is widely seen as a litmus test of the european unions effort to create a single market the eus executive arm has for years fought to abolish laws in member countries that shield companies from hostile takeovers but the volkswagen case is drawing to a close amid new efforts in europe to create national champions and signs that the broader "one share one vote" movement in europe is losing steam officially the case before the european court of justice centers on whether a decades old german law that caps volkswagen shareholders voting rights at violates eu rules on the free movement of capital the law has long been seen by german politicians and labor representatives as vital to protecting one of germanys biggest corporate employers from the threat of a hostile takeover and ensuring the clout of its second biggest shareholder its home state of lower saxony in boardroom debates about plant closings and job cuts in practice volkswagen has already been taken over by porsche which has spent more than billion euros &# billion since to amass a stake compared with lower saxonys roughly stake worried that porsche will raise its stake to more than and absorb volkswagen under its corporate umbrella volkswagens labor representatives are suing porsche to ensure their influence in a new organizational structure porsche officials say the fuss is premature the company has acknowledged acquiring options to significantly raise its vw stake but has declined to say whether or when it might exercise them porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking has publicly expressed confidence that the volkswagen law will be struck down and has argued that his companys voting stake should be consistent with the size of its holding in volkswagen in volkswagens boardroom porsche already has the upper hand two members are porsche managers and a third vw chairman ferdinand piech belongs to the family that controls the sports car maker leaving the boards two lower saxony representatives perpetually outnumbered although volkswagen has for now ruled out job cuts analysts estimate its european factories are operating well below capacity enough to leave german labor leaders nervous meanwhile efforts to create national champions in other sectors of europes economy continue amid high energy prices and concerns about a potential expansion into eu markets by russian natural gas monopoly oao gazprom french president nicolas sarkozy last month shepherded the merger of gaz de france sa and suez sa creating a french natural gas leader although eu regulators are crafting legislation to make the blocs energy market less dominated by national monopolies they are rethinking the wisdom of insisting on a single pan european system limiting shareholder voting rights to one vote per share as some investor rights groups have advocated eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy told the european parliament earlier this month that there was no evidence that unequal shareholder rights reduce the economic performance of companies technology apple stays fresh to keep in lead by nick wingfield each year apple inc sweeps out its old line of gadgets to make room for an even spiffier group of products for the holidays and each year around this time apple rivals and others dumbfounded by its multiyear winning streak in the electronics

including microsoft corp in early september apple dumped its old ipod nano the skinny device that was its best selling music player replacing it with a chubbier model apple fans quickly nicknamed it the "fatboy" nano that plays video it also ripped the cellphone and other features out of the iphone to create the new ipod touch with its large touch sensitive screen early signs suggest the new ipods are a hit "they had just a tremendous september " says tony berkman an analyst for majestic research a financial research firm that uses internet sales figures from various sources to determine a companys overall performance in a potential red flag for the current holiday quarter mr berkman said majestics research shows ipods sales slowed considerably in the first two weeks in october but he says its tough to read deeply into what that means apple will likely give a sign of its confidence when it provides financial forecasts for the current quarter which ends in late december the iphone appears to be selling well too especially after apple dropped the price by &# to &# in early september analysts believe apple will report about one million iphones sold in the quarter ended late september on top of the they sold in the hours it was available during the prior quarter much hinges on the iphone a potentially huge new category for apple the companys shares are up approximately

cellphone market based on sales so far and the high probability of new iphone models from apple next year mr berkman says it isnt a stretch for them to meet that goal
