web of politics the deadline for the internet tax moratorium is coming fast on november and this week the house passed a four year extension senate majority leader harry reid now has a chance to go one better and do what republicans never did which is make the ban permanent many of his own democratic members are pushing him to do so in the house one of only two members to vote against the four year extension was tax ban champion anna eshoo the california democrat had assembled an overwhelming majority in the house to support her bill for a permanent ban but democratic leaders wouldnt allow a vote meanwhile in the senate moratorium co author ron wyden d oregon watched his permanent ban be shoved aside in the commerce committee even though it was clear he had the votes to win now antitax stalwarts on the republican side led by senators john sununu mitch mcconnell and trent lott are seeking a floor vote for permanence mr reid should consider jumping in front of this parade moratorium backers have won the policy argument the internet is an essential instrument of interstate and international commerce and an engine of u s productivity growth new taxes would disproportionately harm low income and middle class americans slapping telephone taxes which can range above on everyones internet access bill will only discourage broadband deployment the only question is why the most valuable of all online consumer protections should carry an expiration date the answer seems to be that state and local government lobbies want to keep open the possibility of pouncing on the net as a revenue source eventually when theres a ripe political opening their allies in the senate are former governors like tom carper d del and lamar alexander r tenn who never met a state tax they didnt like is there likely to be a time in the future when americans decide that we dont benefit from innovation and productivity growth will new taxes on the poor and middle class be a good idea in allowing more than state and local taxing jurisdictions and countless others around the globe to target the internet with new taxes that dont exist offline will never be a good idea mr reid should recognize the political opportunity and the chance to enact a pro consumer pro growth policy that will be a model for the world see related letter "letters to the editor internet bill wont open the door to new taxes" wsj oct
