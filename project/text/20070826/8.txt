smartmoney com timing a car purchase bargain hunters in the market for a new car face an unusual decision these days should they take advantage of end of summer car sales or gamble and wait for possibly better deals in the winter conventional wisdom says summer is the best time to strike when looking for bargains at the car lot thats because dealers are trying to clean up older inventory to make way for the new models that come out in september but this year things are different auto makers have suffered through two months of disappointing sales a slump that could very well continue in this uncertain economic environment in july alone new car sales dropped industrywide compared with the same month last year according to autodata detroit suffered most chrysler sold fewer cars ford motor and general motors a whopping toyota and honda sales dropped roughly thats bad news for car makers but for car shoppers that means bargains could be sweetened and they could last well after labor day the auto makers have blamed the slump on a soft housing market and higher gas prices all of this is quite a change from the past several years when consumers frequently bought new cars not because they needed them but because they wanted them the average time between purchasing a car and selling it dropped from roughly months in to fewer than in according to deutsche bank securities research in the trend reversed and the average "trade cycle" went up to months its a trend that will likely continue this year and next year says sophia koropeckyj an economist with moodys economy com over the past several years car buyers have been spoiled by the generous cash back and low interest offers that dealers were slapping on pretty much any car in the lot "people became addicted but also impervious to those incentives " says robert gentile director of car information products at consumer reports as incentives became a less effective marketing tool to drive buyers to the dealerships the manufacturers naturally tried to trim wide scale promotions this was yet another reason for the sales slump this summer the industrys new approach has been more strategic the companies are focusing on models that have fallen out of fashion with consumers like gas guzzling trucks suvs and larger sedans "now youll see fewer rebates in terms of volume but the rebate amounts could be higher " mr gentile says obviously thats great news if youre in the market for a truck but if youre shopping for a smaller car such as the fuel efficient toyota corolla or nissan versa consider yourself lucky to get a &# rebate at best whether manufacturers will revert to the more generous incentives of prior years is yet to be seen but there is one encouraging sign for consumers some car models now hitting the dealerships are coming with incentives attached "it used to be we wouldnt see incentives for new model years this early in the model year " says jesse toprak edmunds coms executive director of industry analysis so should you take advantage of these deals now or wait it out "if youre looking purely for the best deal money wise then wait until the end of the year " mr toprak says but you run the risk of having fewer choices of color configuration and other extras if you have your heart set on certain amenities or a certain model waiting for a better deal might just leave you driving off the lot in your old set of wheels then again given the prognosis for the housing market and its effect on consumer budgets it might simply be wiser to wait if youve had your car for five years or less chances are it still has many healthy miles ahead
