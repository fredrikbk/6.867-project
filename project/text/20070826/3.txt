housing stocks in the bargain basement as home prices decline and the availability of mortgages grows tighter home builders are hurting more each day analysts and investors who began the year hoping the housing market would rebound have grown concerned about whether some builders will be able to survive the downturn the ailing housing market has also created concerns about the commercial real estate market many investors have been dumping shares of real estate investment trusts or reits which are publicly traded real estate companies with share prices of real estate companies having plummeted they might look tempting to investors in search of a bargain the dow jones wilshire u s home construction index which includes the largest builders is down since year end last week that index fell as the dow jones industrial average rose its best week in four months for the year to date the dow industrials are up the nasdaq composite index which rose last week is up so far in generally investors should be cautious about the real estate sectors because they could have further to fall but discerning and patient investors might be able to find some gems amid the wreckage here are some things to look for as you navigate these often volatile stocks book value when home builders are trading at or below book value which is a rough estimate of a companys liquidation value its long been considered a good opportunity to buy some builders such as beazer homes usa bzh and hovnanian enterprises hov are trading at or below of book value according to citigroup but analysts have become wary of this rule of thumb because the book value of the builders could erode further a big reason the largest assets on the builders books their land holdings and housing subdivisions are declining in value "i dont know why you would want to buy the stocks here " says rick murray an analyst at hovde capital advisors a hedge fund in washington d c "obviously asset values are at risk and write downs are likely to continue " balance sheets investors are focusing more on the builders balance sheets to sort out which builders will survive this downturn mr murray notes that of the publicly held home builders sought bankruptcy law protection during the previous housing recession in the early s "i would expect in this cycle you will have at least as many if not more " cash flow is a critical issue the conventional wisdom among many analysts had been that builders would become "cash machines" in a downturn because they would pull back on building homes and buying land but the builders have stockpiled less cash than expected as of april hovnanian still had negative cash flow that worries analysts because the builders need cash to reduce or at least service their debt hovnanian says it expects positive cash flow in the fourth quarter one thing eating into cash flow is that builders have to keep working on large housing developments that were under way before demand plunged leaving half developed subdivisions risks angering home buyers and local officials also reducing cash flow is the sharp drop in builders profits which are being squeezed as many companies cut prices and use lavish incentives to move houses with cash in short supply investors are also growing concerned about the debt levels at a growing number of companies share prices of the companies with the highest leverage such as beazer standard pacific spf meritage homes mth and hovnanian have been hammered in recent weeks as investors fret about liquidity issues hovnanian has net debt equal to of its capital a common measure of leverage standard pacific has beazer is at and meritage at according to citigroup the median level among builders is bright spots there are a few bright spots in the group citigroup analyst stephen kim recently upgraded kb home kbh to "buy" from "hold" because the builder has good cash flow fueled by the recent sale of its stake in a french home builder j p morgan analyst michael rehaut has an "overweight" rating on m d c holdings mdc partly because its cash balance increased to &# million in the second quarter while its net debt to cap declined to outpacing many of its peers mr rehaut also likes that m d c is carrying a low amount of land on its books luxury home builder toll brothers tol reported strong cash flow and low debt last week over the longer term mr kim believes that buying many home builders at their current values makes sense "if you have a one to two year time horizon you will be fine " says mr kim "but many investors dont have a one to two year time horizon " solid reits while not as dire as home builders reit stocks have also come under pressure they had a negative return from feb to aug according to snl financial many investors are worried that rising borrowing costs could slow the pace of reit property acquisitions others simply think the trend of the past few years when annual returns for reits averaged is unsustainable analysts say the pullback has created bargains they point to self storage reits like public storage psa and retail reits like simon property group spg and kimco realty kim as solid buys shopping mall company simon property the biggest reit by market value looks like one of the best bargains it currently trades at nearly a discount to its consensus net asset value a key measure of the underlying worth of the companys real estate according to bmo capital markets public storage and kimco are extremely cheap too while public storage benefits somewhat from people moving investors may have overreacted to fears that the company was vulnerable to the slowdown in the housing market kimco is praised for its ability to generate fees and continue to acquire shopping centers despite high market prices for grocery anchored centers
