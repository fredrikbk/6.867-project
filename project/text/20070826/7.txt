on investing some safer funds miss the mark the recent turmoil in the mortgage market has roughed up some mutual funds designed as a safe place for main street investors to stash their cash some ultrashort bond funds "have shown themselves to be more risky more volatile than most people would have hoped " says lawrence jones an analyst at research firm morningstar while the average ultrashort fund has returned so far this year through thursday state street global advisors yield plus fund ssypx is off and fidelity ultra short bond fund fusfx is down bank loan funds which are slightly riskier have also struggled through thursday they were down an average over one month but narrowly positive for the year to date according to morningstar while the losses have so far been slight such funds are generally intended to keep investors wealth intact sometimes even earning comparisons to cash like holdings such as money market mutual funds many holders have recently bailed out of ultrashort and bank loan funds other investors may want to stick it out hoping values will rebound and returns recover to past levels but theyve clearly seen that investments that promise attractive yields but still tout themselves as conservative are almost always riskier than stalwarts like money market funds and certificates of deposit ultrashort action ultrashort bond funds do what their name suggests invest in very short term bonds these are considered safe because such bonds lose far less value than do longer bonds when interest rates rise while a majority of ultrashort funds have weathered the credit storm so far its been tougher for a few funds that invested in securities backed by subprime mortgages loans to homeowners with less than stellar credit a fidelity investments spokeswoman says fidelity ultra short "has solid long term performance " and she notes the funds subprime holdings typically got high scores from agencies that rate bonds state street didnt return a call seeking comment some mortgage securities that included subprime loans were until recently considered sterling investments thats partly because thousands of loans were pooled together and investors believed overall default rates would be predictable and therefore less risky lately however default rates on subprime mortgages have risen more sharply than expected and the securities prices have fallen still investors who own subprime mortgages indirectly through their bond funds shouldnt panic while any significant losses from these supposedly stable funds count as something of a failure many funds do not hold subprime mortgages at all those that do may own them as just a small part of their overall portfolio if youre concerned rob williams a financial planner at baltimore washington financial advisors in columbia md suggests contacting your fund "most fund companies have someone you can call to ask what exposure to mortgages they have and what exposure to subprime mortgages " bank loan portfolios over the past month bank loan funds have declined more than all but one other category of taxable bond funds those geared toward highly volatile emerging markets according to morningstar highland floating rate fund xlfax down in the past month and van kampen senior loan fund vslax off were among the hardest hit highland didnt return a call seeking comment howard tiffen lead manager of the van kampen fund said "recent volatility has actually introduced more discipline structural improvements and a better risk reward tradeoff for senior loans " bank loan funds invest in bank loans that are issued to corporations and then resold to institutional investors while these corporations havent defaulted at unusually high rates debt buyers have grown much more wary of all types of credit risk making it harder to sell these loans and sending prices southward bank loan funds had been a hot corner of the mutual fund business recently collecting billions in assets as investors snapped them up as an alternative to holdings such as certificates of deposit that offer comparatively low yields companies that take out this type of loan are like subprime mortgage borrowers considered relatively risky however like the mortgage pools bank loans are packaged in ways that have made them palatable to conservative investors bank loan funds "are marketed as a low risk alternative " says larry glazer managing partner of mayflower advisors in boston who has bought them on behalf of clients a big part of the appeal to investors is that the interest corporations pay on bank loans usually floats with the market minimizing the painful effect of rising interest rates in addition bank loans rank higher than bonds on the credit ladder so if a borrower does default loan holders get paid back earlier than the investors holding bonds other income options bonds that pose the least repayment risk have benefited as investors move to higher ground inflation protected bond funds which primarily hold treasury inflation protected securities or tips are up on average so far this year according to morningstar short term government bond funds have climbed in addition investors poured more than &# billion into government money funds during the week ended aug while withdrawing &# billion from "prime" money funds according to imoneynet a company which tracks fund flows government money funds focus on government obligations while most other money funds also buy short term corporate obligations which can include some backed by mortgages mr glazer says the tips funds recent surge has been a boon to some clients portfolios designed by his firm typically include both tips and bank loan funds in order to balance the higher yields with the safety of government securities "just a few months ago we had a lot of resistance to tips " he says with many investors wanting to bulk up on the riskier bank loan investments "its the classic example of why you dont do it "
