getting going whats at the heart of happiness no happiness isnt a lottery ticket away i am fascinated by academic studies of human happiness because they bring scientific rigor to issues we all grapple with we think more money will make us happier and yet studies suggest americans are no more satisfied than they were three decades ago when the standard of living was much lower so if winning the lottery wont do the trick what will here are seven key lessons from happiness research it is indeed possible to boost our happiness but itll take more than a fat wallet  what matters is what we focus on those with higher incomes arent necessarily happier but when asked how satisfied they are with their lives high earners are more likely to say theyre happy why the question makes them ponder their position in society and they realize theyre pretty lucky the implication if you have a hefty portfolio or hefty paycheck you can probably bolster your happiness by regularly contemplating your good fortune meanwhile if you are less well off avoid situations where you feel deprived and seek out those where comparisons are in your favor rather than buying the cheapest house in a wealthy neighborhood settle for a town where people have similar salaries when you think about your net worth forget your well heeled sister and focus on your cash strapped brother  dont go it alone studies have found that married folks are happier than those who are single "marriage provides two sources of happiness " says andrew oswald an economics professor at englands warwick university "one is sex and the other is friendship marriage has one of the largest impacts on human well being " similarly spending time with friends can boost happiness studies indicate that commuting is one of lifes least enjoyable activities that looking after the kids is more of a struggle than we like to admit and that eating is one of lifes great pleasures but all of these things can be enhanced by adding friends commuting with others will make the trip less grim playing with the kids will be more fun if theres another adult along and eating with others is better than eating alone  we like to feel secure midlife is a period of relative unhappiness this dissatisfaction may stem from the lack of control felt by those in their s as they juggle raising children and the demands of work by contrast employees in senior positions retirees and those with good job security often report being happy one explanation they have greater control over their daily lives "theres a profound link between insecurities of all kinds and human well being " prof oswald notes "supervisors are happier than those who are supervised job loss is an enormous negative and job security is an enormous plus to mental health "  we enjoy making progress studies suggest we prefer leisure to work but that doesnt mean work is always a source of unhappiness we like the feeling of performing a job competently and being in the flow of work "there are definitely better and worse jobs " says david schkade a management professor at the university of california at san diego "if youre in the flow more often thats going to be a better job " but prof schkade says works real pleasure may come from the sense of accomplishment we feel afterward "we know progress makes people feel good " he says "you should design a life where you have that feeling of progress " work also has the benefit of making leisure seem sweeter prof schkade adds this may be the reason seniors who set out solely to relax and have fun are often disappointed by their retirement  we adapt to improvements in pursuit of progress we strive for faster cars fatter paychecks and winning lottery tickets yet when we get what we hanker after we quickly become dissatisfied and soon were lusting after something else academics refer to this as the "hedonic treadmill" or "hedonic adaptation " we may however be able to slow the process of adaptation if we go out and celebrate our recent promotion we will hang onto the good feelings for a little longer if we bought a house last year we may recover some of the initial thrill by pausing to admire our new home we should also think about how we spend our money it seems we get more lasting happiness from experiences than goods if we buy a new car it will eventually go from being our pride and joy to being a scruffy set of wheels with an irritating rattle but if we spend our money on meals with friends or vacations with family we will be left with fond memories that may grow even fonder with time  we also adapt to setbacks while adaptation can work against us when good things happen it saves us from misery when bad times strike if a close friend dies we imagine we will never laugh again but adaptation rides to the rescue oddly enough it seems we adjust more quickly if a setback is large or irreversible if we become disabled we will likely adapt with surprising speed if our spouse is a slob we may never get used to it one reason we figure theres still a chance our spouse will change his or her slovenly ways  we enjoy behaving virtuously if we volunteer give to charity or behave politely we usually feel pretty good pure altruism it may instead be our ancient instincts kicking in good behavior paid big dividends in ancient societies notes boston money manager terry burnham co author of "mean genes " "virtue is built into us because virtue was rewarded " he argues "in small scale societies where you are well known there are rewards for being a good citizen and severe punishments for being a rule breaker " still whatever our true motivation behaving virtuously is almost always a good thing and it will likely make us happier
