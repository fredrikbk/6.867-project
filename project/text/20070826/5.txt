love &amp money getting ready for a difficult role my grandmother called me a few weeks ago she had she said "some papers i want to show you " so i drove over one morning a few days later knowing fully what to expect ive had this conversation with her several times her "papers i want to show you" phrase is her euphemism for "i want to talk to you about the day that i die so you know where to have me buried and you know where all the insurance policies and bank accounts are " i understand why she does this shes years old and i am effectively her son given that she raised me from about the fifth grade on my mom my grandmothers only child has never had a strong financial bearing moreover she has retired to india to stretch her relatively small nest egg as far as possible that leaves me responsible for everything though i dont necessarily mind i was struck by a thought while driving back after that morning meeting with my grandmother i have no clue what ill actually need to do once that final day arrives before id generally brushed aside her "when im gone" talks but for whatever reason this one stuck sure i know where all her papers are i think but what does it really mean to be her executor what is expected of me what if i screw it up and more important to me how would i even begin dismantling what remains of the life she lived how do you handle all this stuff youre going to be faced with when a parent has charged you with managing the affairs of life after death i know this happens every day elderly moms and dads call their offspring to stop by and discuss the big inevitable and we kids are sober if reluctant participants reassuring our parents that all will be handled well when theyre gone but inside were cringing hoping this little talk will quickly run its course and we can get back to not thinking about this for both sides there is the obvious distaste of having to consider a parents death but for offspring theres also an element of anxiety about the responsibilities that will follow paperwork must be filed with insurers and former employers and the government accounts must be closed and new ones opened to manage whats left of her money as she has requested i worry about whether im really up to that task i was talking to a friend about this and he wondered why i would consider writing about this now instead of after the fact when im grappling with it in the moment i asked that same question of a financial adviser ive known for years in alabama stewart welch iii he deals with this subject with his clients all the time and says theres a very good reason to get a handle on as much as possible now from having the initial conversation to understanding the role of executor "you will be a lot happier doing this while your grandmother is alive instead of trying to figure it out after the fact " he says more often than not he adds people want to shy away from the whole subject "because it is an extraordinarily uncomfortable conversation to open " thats what my wife amy told me she faces when i told her what i was writing about this week she said she has similar worries but sees this issue from a different angle she wants to be able to prepare for whats coming "but my mom doesnt want to talk every time i ask she wont say much and i dont know how much i want to press her " through the years ive helped my grandmother put her affairs in order meaning ive worked with her and her attorney on various accounts she wants in place and how she wants me to manage the small sum shes leaving to my mom but id never ventured beyond that to the aftermath when i walk into her house where she and my late grandfather raised me to weed through her tan file cabinet for the papers she has talked about all those years its going to be hard to focus on what i have to do even if i know what im doing so im trying to prepare for it now i dont want to feel that in the frenzy and emotional upheaval of the moment im making misguided decisions or overspending on necessary services and the question i had for stewart was "what do i need to know " the two biggest issues i worry about are having a handle on my role as executor before talking to stewart i had no clue about what to expect and i dont want to screw it up and feeling confident that i have all necessary information to wrap up my grandmothers life while she has told me about her accounts and shown me her filing cabinet i didnt take notes and im not sure that she documented everything i might need to know her financial life isnt complicated nor is her estate but i didnt know for instance that the executors job can easily last six to eight months among other duties im supposed to gather her assets file tax returns file a notice of her death for any creditors and prepare a final accounting for the court sure all of this i could have learned after the fact from an attorney who could help me for a fee but knowing what i need to do beforehand means i can manage some of this stuff on my own without added costs and without being as likely to make mistakes and apparently i can screw it up if i dont act as a fiduciary meaning in the best interest of heirs my mom i can be sued i dont want to be sued so im now prepared to be extraordinarily vigilant in documenting my actions and obtaining fair market valuations for whatever assets exist before i dispose of them and disburse the proceeds stewart also gave me an "essential document locator " a two page sheet he distributes to clients for them to list a long variety of records policies assets investments and the like once completed the locator will essentially tell me what files and accounts and assets do exist and where all the pertinent information can be found i gave it to my grandmother to jog her memory and to list for me what she has and where it all is obviously im still not looking forward to this day and honestly i still have worries particularly related to serving as trustee for money my grannys leaving to my mom but i do feel i have a better grasp on whats expected of me when the day finally comes that i must call upon all those papers my grandmother has wanted to show me
