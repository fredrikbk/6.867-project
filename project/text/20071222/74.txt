president the second democratic election in the countrys history it is also the first time that voters have a chance to choose between two viable candidates the fact that the challenger has a chance at victory is an unusual occurrence in african politics where the incumbent typically wins without a contest the incumbent mwai kibaki is running against populist raila odinga who in recent months has gained steadily over mr kibaki mr kibaki came to power in with a landslide victory over the ruling party headed by longtime dictator daniel arap moi he introduced free primary education paved rutted roads and reined in the minibus taxis known as matatus that once careered around the city belching black fumes and bilking passengers but the staid and serious mr kibaki and his party of national unity have slipped in the polls some members of the kibaki cabinet have been accused of corruption and many of the poor havent felt the ripple effects of the economys booming growth mr kibakis critics

democratic movement kenyans eager for real political choice have engaged this election like never before nairobi is plastered with political posters and trucks with mounted loudspeakers trundle through the city streets blasting campaign songs and slogans mr odingas supporters drape themselves in his partys neon orange even some maasai pastoral people who maintain their traditional way of
