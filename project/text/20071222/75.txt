the weekend interview with michelle rhee schoolhouse rock i see it as a social justice issue i want them all to be in excellent schools the kids in tenleytown are getting a wildly different educational experience than the kids in anacostia so our schools are not serving their purpose " so says d c schools chancellor michelle rhee who has brought an unusual sense of urgency to her new job one of her first decisions was to get rid of the furniture when she arrived last summer she says there was a whole area complete with couch and chair and tv for lounging in her sprawling pink carpeted office wasted space she thought "when am i ever going to have time to sit " that was a pretty good prediction for a woman whose first five months on the job have been a whirlwind of jousting with the dinosaurs in the citys education bureaucracy so far in her quest to turn around the public school system shes taken on the unions the city council and most recently hundreds of angry central office workers this week the city council gave preliminary approval to chancellor rhees request for authority to fire nonunion employees in the central office she knew it was going to be a political firestorm but shes worked hard to convince her skeptics that protecting an ossified bureaucracy isnt in anyones best interests "i think its a critical piece of this equation " she says of the personnel legislation "and if someone like me can come in guns blazing and make all the hard calls we can actually see how much progress we can make for the kids " in a chic gray suit with her black hair long and loose the year old korean american does not fit the profile of the usual urban school superintendent nor does she have the most first hand experience with the education bureaucracy she is trying to wrangle after teaching for three years in a tough school in baltimore she spent the majority of her career running the new teacher project a group that studies best practices in school systems nationwide she figured her value was as an external player poking and prodding from the outside and her first thought about the chancellor job was "absolutely not " the reason she changed her mind was washington d c mayor adrian fenty her name first came to mayor fentys attention through joel klein the chancellor of the new york city school system she was known as an out of the box thinker a relentless advocate of reform and that made her just what the young mayor was looking for the alliance she and the mayor formed that day is now one of the strongest cards in the chancellors hand their agreement was that as long as she acted in the best interests of the kids he would back her up no matter how loud the screaming of the unions and community groups "and since then he has been unwavering " ms rhee says with a note of awe in her voice "he has never ever said to me well we need to think of the political ramifications " that commitment is facing one of its toughest public tests with the chancellors plan to close schools citywide more than any other chancellor in the citys history dared propose parents and community groups are screaming bloody murder the night before our interview ms rhee and her staff held their first local meeting to hear from her constituents directly when several hundred irritable residents showed up her staff was mapping the exits "i came out of it and i was like that wasnt that bad" the chancellor laughs now "my staff looks at me like you are crazy " yes she understands the grieving process "people have to have the opportunity to vent to be angry and they want to do that at me specifically " she says less tolerable is the politics that always seems to run against real reform "i sat in a meeting where one of the city council members said you can close down as many schools as you need to just not in my ward " when shes not closing schools with low enrollment shes building on those that are succeeding with expanded campuses and courses from music classes to gifted programs one she looks to as a model is langdon elementary where the percentage of poor minority students is very high and so are achievement levels why the answer begins with a committed principal communicating her priorities and standards to her staff another is peabody a small school on capitol hill thats pre kindergarten through second grade and running a program for three and four year olds that has a long wait list "people cry when they dont get in and that sort of thing " she says with ms rhees help the schools leadership and faculty are expanding to four more sites "why wouldnt we " to be effective ms rhee believes reforms must begin with the people closest to the children when she first took the job she made time to meet individually with all principals in the school system "people thought i was crazy and it was very time consuming " she says "but it was the best use of time it was very telling " telling of what ms rhee quickly came to the conclusion that principals who were succeeding in their schools were her best resource they were the ones who could tell her what she needed to do she called in a group of top tier principals and asked them for their wish lists "i called them together and told them youre the unsung heroes this place creates such a bureaucracy that you cant get stuff done efficiently be creative tell me what you want to do " at first the principals looked at her blankly "they were like what and then when they got it they were so excited " one principal asked for permission to run her school as a stem school focusing on science technology engineering and math and she said that she wanted to keep her kids all the way through th grade she explained that if parents had a school they believed in theyd be less likely to take them out of the public system those are important strides being made on the ground level but reform also means inevitably taking an axe to dead wood elsewhere in the system in the case of the plan to reclassify the central office workers as "at will" employees ms rhees plan for reform is on delicate ground with the citys powerful public sector unions though the administrative workers arent union employees her plan hasnt sat well with labor leaders including those for bus drivers cafeteria workers and clerical workers explains ms rhee they said "were opposed to this because our job is not just to protect our members but to protect the rights of all workers we think youre going to start with them and then were going to be next " she says she respects george parker head of the teachers union "i believe he has the best interests of the kids at heart" and supports reform but its a struggle to bring along his rank and file and the forces of inertia "i think that somebody like me coming along has probably made his life more difficult " ms rhee grew up in toledo and went on to school at cornell and harvard before joining teach for america the program that landed in her at harlem park elementary in baltimore she taught second grade and the kids in her class ran her ragged "it was a life altering experience for me and the reason im here today " she says that she and a colleague worked day and night to prepare for their classes and saw their group of kids go from the bottom of the heap to where of them were scoring above the th percentile "i dont believe you can do this work or be engaged in it at any level unless you believe in your core that poor minority kids can achieve at the highest level despite all the obstacles " ms rhee says that her mission is not incremental change and she doesnt plan on making being a school superintendent a career "this is a one time gig for me " she laughs "so i can make every single decision in a way in which i think is in the best interests of the kids without the politics without owing people just with that in mind " and her motivation shes a working mother with two daughters in the school system "that gives me a different sense of urgency about my work " mayor fenty is the first d c mayor to have direct control of the city schools in lieu of a school board a set up thats also been key to turnaround efforts in chicago new york and boston theres a powerful demand for quality education in the nations capital that hasnt been met by the public school system as evidenced by the of the districts kids who attend charter schools "for way too long in this country choice in education was something that was reserved for rich people in the suburbs " ms rhee says that same desire for innovation in the schools has been behind the success of the districts opportunity scholarship program the countrys first federal voucher program signed by president bush in the program gives around students from low income families up to &# to attend private schools of their choice the five year pilot program is up for renewal next year but ms rhee doesnt see school choice as a threat to her mission in the public schools she shakes her head "i would never as long as i am in this role do anything to limit another parents ability to make a choice for their child ever " instead she sees the competition presented by school choice and charter schools as part of the process of raising standards in the public school system at large "we have an excellent choice dynamic for parents here im a huge proponent of choice but im also an unbelievably competitive person and my goal is to create schools within the system that i believe are the most compelling choices " people have tried to get her to commit to a ratio of public schools to charter schools ms rhee wont play that game "i dont enter this with defensiveness about protecting d c public schools share of the market i believe we should proliferate whats working and close down whats not period " she says she keeps hearing from worried city council members that some teachers and administrators are frightened of her they are feeling pressure and thats a problem her answer get used to it "im going to hold people accountable and im going to hold their feet to the fire if theyre feeling pressure good i feel pressure every day because i have the education of kids in my hands " ms levy is a senior editorial writer at the journal based in washington
