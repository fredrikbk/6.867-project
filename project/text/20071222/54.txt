politics &amp economics gridlocked congress is good for oil and other industries washington for all the lamenting about gridlock on capitol hill this year congresss tortured year did create some winners the companies and industries that avoided tax increases and subsidy cuts as legislation was blocked or narrowed from cigarette makers and hedge fund managers to health insurers and oil companies many of the business interests targeted by democrats when they took control of congress made it through the year without taking financial hits intensive lobbying by the affected industries was a factor especially as they were able to take advantage of discord between democrats and republicans and between congress and the white house on a slew of issues a &# billion effort to provide health insurance to more children died under president bushs veto pen giving tobacco companies a reprieve from a federal tax increase on their products that was supposed to fund the expansion private equity and hedge fund managers averted boosts in their tax bills after democrats acceded to republicans demands to suspend the alternative minimum tax for one year for middle income taxpayers without replenishing the &# billion in lost revenue oil and gas companies avoided the loss of &# billion in tax incentives as democrats effort to broaden the energy bill collapsed "id say santa claus visited everybody in the business community this year or at least nobody got a lump of coal " said frederick h graefe a lobbyist with health care clients many industries started the year as targets especially after democrats reinstated a budget rule that requires new spending increases and tax cuts to be offset with either spending cuts or revenue increases congress was then on the hunt for politically palatable ways to fulfill this vow health insurance companies that cover medicare patients quickly became a focus democrats complained that government spends more on average covering patients in the private plans than it does through the traditional federal medicare program the house passed &# billion over five years in payment cuts to the insurers which include companies such as unitedhealth group inc and humana inc to help fund legislation expanding health insurance for children and to increase medicare payments to physicians other offsets in the bill an increase in federal taxes on tobacco products and a policy that would reduce medicare spending on amgen inc s epogen an anti anemia drug used by dialysis patients the senate also backed the tobacco tax increase as a way to fund the childrens health program but president bush vetoed that bill twice this year in a philosophical and political showdown over the governments role in funding health care the cuts to health insurers continued to be discussed in the senate as a way to pay for a one year increase in payments to doctors but ultimately republican objections and veto threats from the white house scuttled this plan too before heading home congress passed a six month boost for doctors but the narrower package avoided cuts to health insurers payments and the reduction for epogen the private equity industry spent much of the year fighting a proposal to increase taxes that its managers pay on carried interest a part of their compensation thats now taxed at the rate of long term capital gains many lawmakers during the spring and summer were expressing alarm at the vast amounts of money some top managers make and the fact that much of it isnt taxed as regular income the industry not much of a presence in washington before hired dozens of lobbyists who argued that a tax increase would harm the economy by the end of the year the sentiment didnt result in policy changes amid opposition from most republicans and the white house the house passed a bill raising taxes on carried interest to regular income tax rates of up to in order to replace the revenue lost to amt relief another proposal in the house bill would limit hedge fund managers ability to defer taxes on their pay by holding it offshore neither went anywhere in the senate and congress passed amt legislation that ignored its own budget rule just before heading home a third proposal affecting private equity would have required firms that go public as blackstone group lp did this year to pay a tax rate at the entity level as corporations do this didnt end up in any bills either despite this years reprieve many industries are expecting many of the same proposals to resurface next year democrats say they will continue to pass bills that include similar offsets and congress will have to deal with several must do items that have big price tags including another increase for physicians another year of amt relief and renewal of expiring tax provisions such as the research and development tax credit complicating democrats task the politics of next year will be complicated by the general election campaign which could make it much harder to pass substantive or controversial legislation
