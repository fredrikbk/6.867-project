insurer woes put munis in bargain bin bad news about bond insurers in recent days sent mutual fund managers racing into the market scooping up insured municipal bonds at a steal individual investors too might want to follow suit but only if they can stomach some surprising chaos in this traditionally sleepy corner of the market in recent months bond insurers which guarantee the principal and interest payments on various types of debt have gotten clobbered amid uncertainty about some messy types of mortgage securities they have backed the situation is raising questions about whether the insurers are financially strong enough to cover any potential losses on friday fitch ratings said it is reviewing bond insurer ambac financial group inc for a potential downgrade it also put the triple a rating on mbia inc s insurance business on review thursday uncertainty about insurers like these is hurting the prices of the bonds they insure including muni bonds even though they remain relatively safe given the rarity of their defaults the upshot its a potential buying opportunity particularly in the market for insured municipal bonds munis are government issued debt to finance projects such as road or other improvements not all carry bond insurance but those that do usually trade at higher prices than their uninsured cousins because of the extra protection offered now in some cases the opposite is true because of the troubles at bond insurers some mutual fund managers say they have never seen such deep price discounts for a more aggressive bond investor this could spell opportunities to lock in attractive muni bond deals "weve kind of gotten sucked into this whole flurry of credit concerns thats unduly affected some very high quality securities " says reid smith of the vanguard group monday mr smiths team noticed that california economic recovery bonds insured by bond insurer financial guaranty insurance co were trading at a lower price and percentage point higher yield than a similar bond without insurance nuveen investments municipal bond fund manager john miller says he has similarly been buying mbia insured bonds now trading at attractive prices "insured municipal bonds in general over the last several weeks have continued to get cheaper " he says adding "this is the widest spread i can recall " referring to the difference between certain yields in particular offerings such as some investment grade hospital bonds have been hammered he says the opportunities come just as municipal bonds are also trading at a particular bargain compared with u s treasury bonds municipal bonds typically yield less than u s treasurys because of the fact that they have some tax advantages however in recent days municipal bonds have posted yields at a premium to u s treasurys in the second half of november municipal bonds traded at about the same yields as u s treasurys or higher for two weeks then hit a comparative high nov according to a report from creditsights "right now you have muni bonds that are yielding what treasury bonds are yielding despite the fact that they give tax free income " says lewis altfest a new york based fee only planner thus on an after tax basis their yields are much higher despite the buys in the municipal market so far investors arent biting this past week municipal bond funds reported their sixth straight week of net outflows the longest string of consecutive weeks in two years meanwhile the average high quality municipal bond fund is set to have its worst calendar year return since up only so far this year through wednesday according to morningstar inc for individual investors the opportunities presented in municipal bonds right now can be confusing because in many ways their market is moving counter to typical patterns risks still remain including that municipal bond prices could continue moving lower because of bond insurers challenges the risk to investors is that they jump in too early if insurers do get downgraded as aca capital holdings inc did in the past week it could trigger waves of repricing for the municipal bonds they insure some investors are also beginning to see dangers in other types of structured securities held in municipal offerings like complex tender option bonds or variable rate demand obligations according to creditsights many fund managers are cautioning investors to separate the risks associated with the bond insurers falling stock prices from those of the actual municipal bonds that the insurers guarantee the year default rate on investment grade municipal bonds is about according to moodys so far there havent been signs that local issuers are having trouble making payments on their municipal bonds as was the case this year with some bonds backed by mortgages recent events are even prompting some money managers to debate the need for municipal bond insurance they point out that the insurance coverage which should enhance the bonds appeal "is actually making things worse " says vanguards mr smith a huge chunk of the bonds insured by the insurance companies are already rated investment grade by third party rating firms "it really starts to make you question whether you need insurance " says brian kazanchy of regentatlantic capital advisors llc in new jersey investors whose funds have had a negative net asset value this year may consider harvesting capital losses by selling the funds this year and then returning to the funds after days mr kazanchy suggests that for the interim month investors may park the money in a municipal exchange traded fund like the ishares s&amp p national municipal bond exchange traded fund several such municipal bond etfs have come to market this year
