fed to extend auctions as long as needed the federal reserve after completing two successful loan auctions said it will continue biweekly offerings "as long as necessary" to mitigate pressures in credit markets extending the auctions beyond the two planned for january will give central bank officials a new tool to reduce strains from the credit crisis one of the feds initial responses to the credit crisis a modified program for direct loans to banks has been met by tepid interest since its launch in august the central banks second offering under its term auction facility conducted thursday drew banks submitting &# billion in bids the fed said friday it will award a total of &# billion in day loans at the first auction on monday awarded &# billion at after banks submitted &# billion in bids "the fact that youre seeing banks bid confirms the idea that there is a lot of demand throughout the banking system and not just from the top banks " said lehman brothers economist drew matus the fed unveiled the auctions as part of a coordinated effort with central banks around the world to respond to banks unwillingness to lend to each other for more than a couple of days the clearest symptom of the credit crisis has been a sharp rise in market rates for such interbanking loans those rates remain elevated but they have edged down since the central banks began their response this month the final rate in both auctions settled just below the discount rate suggesting neither broad based desperation nor widespread efforts to secure funds near the minimum rate at which they could be lent out for a greater profit the final rate the highest bid needed to cover the total offer amount is given to all bidders above that rate that means some banks may have bid higher than the discount rate to ensure they would receive funds "people are bidding high because they really want the money " mr matus said by using the auction process banks were able to avert the stigma that has been associated with the little used discount window to encourage borrowing there the fed in august slashed the spread between the discount rate and the lower federal funds rate the benchmark target rate for overnight lending between banks by half a percentage point fed officials dont expect the discount window to disappear banks still may need to tap the discount window as an emergency source of funds without going through an auction to maintain reserve requirements at the end of two week maintenance periods or if they have misjudged funding needs unlike european banks u s banks can borrow and have been borrowing from the federal home loan bank system as of sept the federal home loan bank system had lent banks &# billion up from dec the total likely has risen since then
