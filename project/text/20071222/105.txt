zero hour with a soviet style sugar program tariffs on brazilian ethanol guarantees for cotton growers that impoverish african farmers and a subsidy laden farm bill the u s is having a hard time leading in the world trade organizations doha development round but next week things will get even worse if the commerce department misses a december deadline to comply with a wto ruling to change its methodology for measuring if foreign producers are guilty of selling at artificially low prices in the u s the practice in question goes by the arcane term "zeroing " if that makes your eyes glaze over focus on this with the u s economy relatively open these days the ability to assail a foreign competitor for "dumping" i e selling below cost into the u s market is now the most important tool protectionists have to block imports currently more than u s antidumping orders apply to imports from countries and a study by the international trade commission found that more than &# billion in imports were affected by antidumping duties between and the idea that so many producers consistently engage in selling below costs is preposterous so how is it that commerce has uncovered so much "dumping" the answer is fuzzy math when commerce investigates an allegation it compares the products price in the u s market to the normal market value of the same good across all transactions then it throws out or zeros any comparisons that show the price of the goods sold in the u s to be higher than the normal market value comparisons where the price of the good is lower are counted as evidence of dumping the average of the transactions that fit commerces definition of dumping are then used to come up with the dumping margin by sorting only for examples of below cost transactions commerce all but guarantees that protectionist complaints will prevail on thursday a senior u s trade official told us the u s still believes zeroing is "permitted under wto rules " however for initial "investigations" of dumping commerce has already discontinued zeroing and has capitulated in two previous disputes with ecuador and the eu agreeing to rerun the numbers the results demonstrate what a rigged game commerce is playing in a case the u s agreed to recalculate prices of ecuadorian shrimp without zeroing voila the dumping margins disappeared and the antidumping duty was revoked in a similar exercise in involving european steel producers dumping margins were entirely eliminated for eight companies that had been previously found guilty eight other eu steel exporters had their dumping margins reduced and the average decline in margins for all the steel companies investigated was almost the pressure from protectionists to preserve zeroing is high and word around washington is that the u s steel industry believes that saving "zeroing" is more important even than promoting a weak dollar but what about the price paid by everyone else by rigging the game commerce is raising costs for u s consumers and businesses by flouting wto rules it is also encouraging other countries to use the same tactic against u s exporters it ought to be zero hour for zeroing
