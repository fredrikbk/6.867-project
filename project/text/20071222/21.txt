cuban revolution yoani sanchez fights tropical totalitarianism one blog post at a time havana cuba on a recent morning yoani sanchez took a deep breath and gathered her nerve for an undercover mission posting an internet chronicle about life in fidel castros cuba to get around cubas restrictions on web access the waif like year old posed as a tourist to slip into an internet cafe in one of the citys luxury hotels which normally bar cubans dressed in gray surf shorts t shirt and lime green espadrilles she strode toward a guard at the hotels threshold and flashed a wide smile the guard a towering man with a shaved head stepped aside "i think im able to do this because i look so harmless " says ms sanchez who says she is sometimes mistaken for a teenager once inside the cafe she attached a flash memory drive to the hotel computer and in quick intense movements uploaded her material time matters the &# she paid for a half hour is nearly a weeks wage for many cubans ms sanchez has done this cloak and dagger routine since april publishing essays that capture the privation irony and even humor of cubas tropical communism "stalinism with conga drums " as she and her husband jokingly call it from writing about the book fair that blacklisted her favorite authors to the schoolyard where parents smuggle food to their hungry children ms sanchez paints an unflinching and deeply personal portrait of the cuban experience while there are plenty of bloggers who dish out harsh opinions on mr castro most do so from the cozy confines of miami ms sanchez is one of the few who do so from havana "what makes her so special is that she is fresh observant and on the scene " says philip peters a former latin america official at the state department who now studies cuba at the lexington institute a washington d c based think tank "almost all of the cuba blogs are written by people who travel there occasionally or by people who havent seen the island in forty years if ever " he says not only does she write from cuba she even signs her name and posts a photo of herself on her web site most havana bloggers are anonymous "once you experience the flavor of saying what you think of publishing it and signing it with your name well theres no turning back " she says "one of the first things we have to do a great way to begin to change is to be more honest about saying what you think " the problem is saying what you think in cuba can be dangerous in cuba imprisoned dozens of journalists who declared themselves dissidents and published criticisms of the regime many are still there most cubans are so afraid of being labeled a critic that they are reluctant to utter the words "fidel castro" in public instead they silently pantomime stroking a beard when referring to their leader ms sanchezs writing is direct on oct she wrote about mr castros regular newspaper editorials which usually focus on international politics rather than the problems of cuba "the latest reflections of fidel castro have ended my patience " she wrote "to try to evade or distance oneself from our problems and theorize about things that occurred thousands of kilometers away or many years ago is to multiply by zero the demands of a population that is tired disenchanted and in need today of measures that alleviate its precariousness " the fact that ms sanchez has avoided jail is a source of great intrigue for global cuba watchers and the cuban exile community in miami some experts say it signals new tolerance by raul castro who has taken over day to day leadership from his brother because of fidels deteriorating health since taking temporary power in july raul castro has called for an "open debate" on the countrys economic policies and promised agricultural reforms to bolster the food supply cuba experts debate whether rauls promises suggest a true re examination of cubas economic model or are simply rhetoric others especially the exile community cant quite believe ms sanchez gets away with what she does they wonder if she is an unwitting dupe or a complicit agent in a campaign to make raul castro appear more tolerant as he seeks greater foreign aid "from the bottom of my heart i want her blog to be legitimate and be the seed that grows into something in cuba " says val prieto a year old miami based architect who edits an anti castro blog called babalu "the reason the exile community is wary is that weve been bamboozled time and time again you never can tell when it comes to castro " there may be a simpler explanation some experts say cuban authorities are mainly concerned about what people on the island think and since the vast majority of cubans dont have internet access the government is less alarmed by a web site available primarily to outsiders ms sanchez seems surprised by the debate "its funny but it seems that the only way some people will believe i am authentic is if i am thrown in jail " she says "im not sure i want to provide that kind of proof " its easy to see why ms sanchez is such a mystery in a place known for bombastic gesticulation she makes her points with subtle wit she is passionate about cuban culture but doesnt care for signature elements like baseball and cigars though a critic of the government she hasnt affiliated with the islands official political opposition perhaps most surprising on an island that many risk their lives to flee she left cuba in only to return two years later her blog is called generacion y www desdecuba com generaciony the title refers to a fad for names starting with "y" that began in the s cubas boxing team for instance has members named yoandry yuciel yampier and yordenis roughly between and today people in this generation are the offspring of the revolutionaries weaned on soviet cartoons and communist slogans about a "luminous future " they came of age amid shortages of food clothing and soap as the economy crumbled this group will play a critical role in forging a new cuba once mr castro is gone many expect a showdown between ms sanchezs broadly disillusioned generation and an older group of hard liners who will try to keep a version of the castro model going after he dies her writing has become required reading for cuba experts seeking insight into the psychology of this group her blog received a half million hits in october the blog reads like her interior monologue as she goes through her routine in havana collecting the daily ration of bread one bun per person per day taking her son to school and running errands often trekking on foot to avoid riding the "camel " a bus pulled by a soot belching tractor trailer cab walking through the city on a recent day she became lost in thought looking at graffiti and later at a market stall where oil and vinegar are sold in plastic bags she noticed growing numbers of canine police on havanas streets and concluded crime is rising though statistics are seldom reported away from the brightly painted tourist center of "old havana " ms sanchez walked along streets where once impressive homes lie in disrepair she commented on how few new buildings have been built since the revolution "the homes in this city speak for themselves " she said "they are the best example of how things have functioned in reality despite all the political propaganda " a recurring feature is her year old sons school recently he participated in a military shooting exercise there her son enjoyed playing soldier but she was outraged in another entry she described how parents congregate at the schoolyard at lunchtime to secretly pass food to their children who dont get enough to eat she described her sadness at seeing children whose parents who dont turn up and will go hungry an oct entry talked about how her sons teacher told the class that one student had been secretly designated an informer charged with keeping a list of good and bad kids that the teacher could use to mete out punishment "so young and these children experience the paralysis generated by the feeling of being watched " she wrote "i look around me and confirm that the successive irrigations of paranoia have worked our fears are populated by cia agents and members of the secret police " ms sanchez believes fear and paranoia are key elements in the castro government playbook to stay in power fear of cubas own secret police and fear of an imminent u s invasion are perennials fear leads cubans to restrict what they say and do ms sanchez says for instance while cubas hotels and resorts are for tourists only there is no law that a cuban citizen cant walk into a hotel and use the internet cafe hotels however generally bar cubans from entering to avoid running afoul of authorities writing her blog is one way to shed her "internal policeman " ms sanchez says "i am trying to push the limits to find the line where the internal limits end and the real limits begin " she thinks more cubans are pushing nowadays too lately in bread lines and other informal gatherings shes witnessed cubans publicly complaining about things like corruption low wages or the decaying health system "perhaps its just wishful thinking that things are changing that has me noting a certain tendency toward collective catharsis " she wrote on sept "whereas once there were shrugged shoulders and turned faces i now see fingers pointing out the problems and mouths emanating inconformity " the reason people feel more confident about openly complaining is economic she says the downturn of the early s forced cuba to allow some private enterprise such as letting people open small restaurants in their living rooms or rent out rooms that plus cash transfers from cuban exiles has made locals less reliant on the government for jobs a measure of economic independence has brought a measure of political independence she says but there are limits in a may entry she recounts how eight strangers in the anonymity of a pre chevrolet taxi began to talk freely of their discontent but the complicity ended abruptly when the taxi arrived at its destination the passengers departed ignoring each other and resuming their public silence ms sanchez grew up in havana the daughter of a railroad worker and a housewife as a girl the egalitarian future of economic equity envisioned by the revolutionary che guevara seemed in reach she was a "pioneer" cubas answer to the scouts and recited its pledge "i am a pioneer for communism we will be like che " the family was plunged into poverty by the collapse of cubas economic sponsor the soviet union in mr castro declared a "special period" of drastic reductions in food and other rations average daily caloric intake fell by eventually optic neuritis a rare eye disease caused by poor nutrition swept the island when friends got together during those times ms sanchez recalls a single topic dominated conversation food to stave off hunger pangs ms sanchez gobbled spoonfuls of sugar scarcity of soap shampoo and sanitary napkins added to the trauma for an adolescent becoming aware of her body many basics were scarce "you wanted to go out but you had no shoes " she says the special period transformed ms sanchez from true believer to cynic she recalls witnessing her parents fall into despair a shared experience for many in her generation "it was a deep psychological blow for our parents because theyd given their best years to the revolution and things werent as theyd imagined " she says "my parents suffered the desperation and panic of not being able to give their children enough to eat " ms sanchez attended one of cubas revolutionary rural high schools created to forge a new generation in the atmosphere of farm life the school was named for the socialist republic of romania even though romanias socialist government had fallen by the time ms sanchez arrived in at school students hoarded scraps of food under their mattresses attracting rats to the bunks at night she says ms sanchez says she was eventually admitted to the university of havanas faculty of philology the study of language and literature where she nurtured a love for latin american writers but her thesis topic dictatorships in latin american literature caused a scandal her academic career ended before it began "the thesis wasnt overly critical but the mere act of defining what a dictatorship is in an academic paper made people really nervous because the definition was a portrait of cuba " she says she met and fell in love with reinaldo escobar a cuban journalist nearly three decades her senior in the s he was forced out of journalism after trying to publish a few critical articles he began a new career teaching spanish to tourists and developed a network of friends in germany and switzerland ms sanchez and mr escobar had a son in in ms sanchez obtained government permission to leave and moved to switzerland thinking shed never return she was later joined by her son and husband cuba allows some people to leave the country each year but the family decided to return to cuba in after ms sanchezs husband who recently turned had trouble finding work "its much easier for someone my age to start over " she says "i didnt want to condemn him to a life of informal labor at that age and breaking up the family was unacceptable " returning to cuba was a difficult decision says ms sanchez what made it possible she says is a deep attraction to the beauty of the island and the energy of its people "i came to some kind of internal understanding that i am going to go back but i am not going to accept things as they are " she says "i am going to try to do something " in addition to publishing her blog she talks freely about taboo subjects she tells neighbors that she doesnt vote a shocking admission in cuba she isnt a member of any of cubas quasi compulsory political organizations "there are many ways to pretend in cuba you can say things that you dont believe or you can stay quiet about the things you dont like " she says "i have the tranquility of being able to look at my son and he knows that i dont fake it " at the same time she tries not to cross a line that will give the government a reason to shut her blog down she uses only public internet sites instead of trying to set up an illegal internet link from home as some cubans do the family lives on between &# and &# a month she says earned from working with tourists she confines her writing to the web critiques published on paper are considered propaganda while the internet is a gray area still there is no guarantee that ms sanchezs activities wont land her in legal trouble even if jailed ms sanchez says she would find ways to publish her blog "you have to believe that you are free and try to act like it " she says "little by little acting as though you are free can be contagious "
