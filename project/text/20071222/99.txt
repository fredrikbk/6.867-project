weekend journal sports golf journal fairway of dreams amateur duffers can experience what might have been at a price of all sports golf is perhaps the most susceptible to the coulda woulda fantasy that many of us especially men indulge namely that had our lives unfolded just a bit differently we too could have been pro athletes in golf we play the same game as the pros with more or less the same equipment sometimes even on the same courses and every once in a while we inadvertently squeeze out shots that even the top tour players couldnt improve upon our affinity with the pros has not been lost on marketers it underlies virtually all the ad campaigns for clubmakers and also sustains the pro am business and corporate outings with the pros but now theres a new twist in walter mittydom so called tour experiences at tpc sawgrass in ponte vedra fla site of the pga tours annual players championship golfers can book a "tour player experience" for prices starting at &# per player in low season for that you get a professional caddy who will wear your name on his bib during the round the chance to hit balls and get instruction at the practice facility normally reserved for tour players access to a special locker room adjoining that used by the pros plus such amenities as a room at the marriott and lunch starting in march taylormade will offer an even more elaborate opportunity for anyone with &# to spend its tour experience will take place at reynolds plantation a high end hole golf residential community miles east of atlanta where the company has built a second iteration of its training and club fitting facility for tour pros called the kingdom the first is at the company headquarters in carlsbad calif the three to six participants in each session will spend three nights at the ritz carlton there and receive two days of fitting and instruction with some of the same experts who work with taylormades tour pros including sessions in the companys super high tech swing analysis laboratory all participants get a set of top of the line taylormade clubs built overnight to their own specifications theres a round of golf included plus dinner and breakfast with a tour pro the company lists hale irwin david toms and kenny perry as possibilities last week i along with five other media types were guinea pigs for this experience our tour pro was pga champion shaun micheel taylormade acknowledged that it still has some details to work out for instance it wasnt yet able to build complete sets of clubs for us overnight but the level of expertise by the fitters and instructors was superior even if some of the technology wasnt as useful as it might have been in keeping with the wall street journals guidelines the paper paid for all trip related expenses and i didnt keep the clubs i tested the centerpiece of the first day fitting was minutes in the matt motion analysis technology by taylormade lab there i attached sensor imbedded swatches of neoprene to my feet knees arms chest and head and hit balls with sensor laden clubs nine high speed cameras recorded the swings and software morphed the data into a weird silvery figure on a giant screen it looked just like me if i were made of mercury and didnt have a face the fitter can view the swing at any speed and from any angle including from directly underneath apart from being cool this technology has two purposes the most useful frankly was instructional two flaws that i thought i had eliminated a few years ago one relating to swing plane and the other to impact position had returned and were worse than ever denial is possible watching video but not when youre rendered as tron and can watch yourself making the same mistake over and over from every possible angle the other purpose is for club recommendations but in my case the specifications the computer spat out were overruled that afternoon on the outdoor range a few shots there convinced a human fitter that i needed a significant three degree change in the lie angle of my irons lie angle describes the relationship between the clubhead and the shaft if a club is too flat or has too great an angle balls will tend to fly to the right for a right handed golfer if the club is too upright balls will fly left another fitter with the help of a sophisticated trackman radar device also changed the prescribed loft on my driver clubhead it seems that machines especially indoor ones are not yet the equal of human expertise on the range in fact of all my sessions at the kingdom i was most impressed with the wedge fitting a black art if ever there was one in less than minutes a wizard named charles mclendon had me in a degree wedge that not only hit the ball farther than my degree wedge which its supposed to but also higher which its not it also dragged less through the turf and had more control he told me how he accomplished this and i have it on tape but i still dont understand my conclusion magic the second day was devoted almost entirely to instruction both short game and long led by the resident top instructor charlie king is the tour experience worth &# as with buying a yacht if you have to ask probably not matt fittings for instance are available at eight other locations around the country for a few hundred dollars by my calculations the clubs bag and other party favors would cost around &# retail the food accommodations and round of golf would total maybe another &# that means you pay about &# for the "experience" the fitting instruction hang out time with the pro and ambiance thats comparable to the cost of playing in a pro am at top pga tour events but i will say that our private dinner with the candid mr micheel was more revealing than any walk down a fairway with a pro is likely to be he told us for instance that he cant believe he won &# last year playing as poorly as he felt he did and that no matter what anyone says every pro on tour stands in awe of tiger woods
