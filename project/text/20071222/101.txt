what you can learn from a gene scan our newfound ability to have a genome scan promises a revolution in medicine for as low as &# individuals can choose from one of three companies to analyze one million changes in their dna coding letters the scan requires just a small amount of saliva or a swab of the inside of the cheek and a credit card in we could only analyze one dna letter change known as a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp at a time today we can rapidly assess one million snps because research has broken the genome down into a few hundred thousand "zip codes" or locator bins that are inherited as blocks the window of a million snps provides some valuable insight into the vast majority of the three billion dna coding letters we are in the midst of a genomics gold rush with discoveries of common snps associated with of the most important diseases such as heart attacks diabetes and breast cancer but there is a long way to go most disease risk genes have not yet been found the genes which cancel out the risk known as "modifiers" are still largely unknown and many diseases and conditions have not even been studied the web sites of the three whole genome analysis companies decode and me and navigenics say that having your genome scanned can be good for your health but it is too soon to tell for heart attacks to give one example we only know one common snp and there are likely several not yet identified so if an individual gets his or her dna tested and is negative for the heart attack snp this can provide a false assurance that there is no risk the test is only conclusive if it is positive having two copies of the coding letter change increases the lifelong risk of a heart attack by we know of over gene markers that increase the risk of diabetes but we know nothing of how these coding letter changes interact with one another or are affected by ones lifestyle and environment furthermore virtually all of the primary research is based on individuals of european ancestry so consumers of asian and african ancestry who have their genome scanned are getting shortchanged and may not realize that so much of our disease related genomic knowledge is limited to one ancestry one reason the three companies have launched a direct to consumer approach is for privacy if a doctor ordered a genome wide scan for an individual it would become a part of his medical record and the information would potentially be accessible to health insurance providers or employers but even this new approach offers no protection against the abuse of private information a bill in congress the genetics information non discrimination act has been put on hold despite having been passed overwhelmingly by the house such legislation has been waiting for years to pass and the new personal genomics movement only highlights the importance of privacy protection now for the upside in the baby boomer "me centric" world what could be better than having knowledge about ones own dna the individual becomes empowered with information which if used in the right way could possibly lead to weight loss better nutrition or more exercise if genomic scans lead to sustained healthier lifestyles for certain individuals then they have served a useful purpose after all non pharmacologic non surgical approaches to prevention are sorely lacking in american medicine the revolution will have a great impact on the medical community when a consumer arrives in his or her doctors office to get help in interpreting the genomic data the doctor is likely to respond "whats a snp " this reflects the remarkably little amount of knowledge about genetics in the medical community pressures from patients and consumers may help drive the vital need for education of doctors and health care professionals who are simply not ready for the personal genomics era while we are waiting for doctors to catch up the consumer can look up all the information on each relevant snp on a "snpedia" web site modeled after wikipedia advances in dna research and internet technology combined with an increasingly empowered public could trigger long overdue changes in the way medicine is practiced the revolution is far from complete but it offers exciting possibilities if all the information from the tens of thousands of individuals who get genome scans were used for research this could accelerate the creation of a new form of health care and prevention and help realize the potential of individualized medicine dr topol is the director of scripps genomic medicine and a cardiologist at the scripps clinic in la jolla calif
