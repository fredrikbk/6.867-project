weekend journal books the striver assessing the secretary of state even as her quest for success goes on the department store clerk didnt know what he was in for when he scolded young condoleezza rice for touching one of the hats on display this was birmingham ala in the early s and a black kid simply wasnt allowed to touch the merchandise like that ms rices mother however had other ideas incensed by the treatment of her daughter she sent the little girl on a store wide mission "i went happily around touching every hat " ms rice recalls ms rice was born into the racist cauldron of bull connors birmingham but her parents did everything in their power to make sure she didnt see much of it no segregated lunch counters they ate at home no use of segregated drinking fountains or bathrooms angelena and john rice didnt want their only child to realize that white birmingham considered her a second class person they lived at the end of a cul de sac in titusville one of the most well off black neighborhoods in the city in general she stayed there as jack straw britains foreign secretary remarked in amazement when he visited ms rices childhood home in "she didnt know any white people " ms rice left alabama at age for the whiter neighborhoods of denver but elisabeth bumillers "condoleezza rice an american life" shows that ms rices time in alabama did much to shape the public figure she would become rearing condoleezza to be "twice as good" as any white kid was the life ambition of both her parents she was brought up to be well dressed disciplined and above all successful the piano classes began at age and ballet tap dancing and french followed soon after as her elementary school band teacher tells ms bumiller "she was more mature than the others and very very very how can i explain it for a kid very focused " her drive intensified in denver where she started eighth grade when she was just years old and began taking college courses at the university of denver as a year old all the while training to be a competitive figure skater rising at a m to be at the rink by and a concert pianist one great crisis of ms rices life she says was the realization that she was not gifted enough to succeed as a world class musician ms bumiller has written a serious even handed biography of condoleezza rice one that is neither laudatory nor overly critical no small feat when writing about a washington figure who stirs intense emotions ms rice one of the few power players today who has genuine star power has survived vicious attacks by those who blame her for everything from and the war in iraq to the state departments supposed appeasement of north korea and other hostile regimes often it is liberals who throw the stones but most recently it was john bolton an ex state department colleague and former u s ambassador to the united nations who declared that president bushs foreign policy is "in a free fall" because he has "fallen under the influence of secretary of state condoleezza rice " like many others who have written about ms rice ms bumiller has negative reviews for her work as national security adviser in mr bushs first term in the authors telling ms rice failed to mediate the policy differences among the outsize egos rumsfeld powell cheney on mr bushs national security council the results were disastrously poor management of post invasion iraq and incoherent policies on north korea and iran ms bumiller asks ms rice to assess her own performance as national security adviser and gets an atypically uncertain answer "i dont know she said quietly i think i did okay " ms bumiller sees ms rices secretary of state tenure as in large measure an effort to undo the damage done to americas diplomatic standing while she was national security adviser ms rice has opened up negotiations with north korea followed frances lead on talks with iran about its nuclear program and re launched the long dormant middle east peace process in short ms bumiller admires all the things that drive the likes of john bolton crazy trying to figure out ms rices ideology isnt easy she came into politics as the protege of former national security adviser brent scowcroft a pillar of the realist school of foreign policy during the campaign she outlined a vision for president bush consistent with everything that mr scowcroft taught her "to be sure " she wrote in the journal foreign affairs about candidate bushs foreign policy "there is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all humanity but that is in a sense a second order effect " but as secretary of state she has been a fervent advocate of the pro democracy foreign policy outlined in president bushs second inaugural address "the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world" the shift has left mr scowcroft bewildered ms bumiller quotes a senior european diplomat saying of mr scowcroft "he told me several times i dont understand how my lady my baby my disciple has changed so much " ms bumillers theory is that ms rices philosophy has less to do with politics and more to do with her upbringing "it was obvious from rices many metamorphoses that her real ideology was not idealism or realism or defending the citadels of freedom although she displayed elements of all of them her real ideology was succeeding " in the bush white house that has meant becoming the presidents single most trusted adviser ms bumiller however doesnt seem particularly interested in ms rices time as americas top diplomat spending a mere pages on her work as secretary of state thats where glenn kessler picks up the story in "the confidante condoleezza rice and the creation of the bush legacy " a reporter for the washington post mr kessler is one of the most aggressive journalists on the state department beat he broke the story of israels strike in september on an alleged nuclear facility in syria he offers an exhaustively detailed description of ms rices work so far at the state department where her close relationship with the president has made her for good or for ill one of the most influential secretaries of state ever at times mr kesslers book reads like a polemic ms rice he says "is in a desperate race to save president bushs foreign policy legacy and her own almost as if she is trying to erase the previous six years " he declares that ms rice has no strategic vision and that the results of her efforts at the state department "have been disappointing and sometimes devastating to u s interests " the devastation that mr kessler sees includes a more unstable middle east an increasing hostility to the u s around the world and a failure to curtail by whatever means irans and north koreas nuclear programs mr kessler does such a thorough job of reporting that his book despite the invective will be a valuable resource to anybody who wants to assess ms rices performance as secretary of state including those who like her he explores for example the under reported story of ms rices efforts to transform americas historically chilly relations with india her goal was to make india one of americas two or three most important partners and in the process turn the second most populous country in the world into a counterweight to china she solidified the relationship with a deal to provide india with civil nuclear technology and managed to get the deal approved by a skeptical congress as mr kessler begrudgingly acknowledges ms rices efforts "allowed her to achieve a breakthrough that had eluded other policy makers for years " the problem for both ms bumiller and mr kessler is that it is too early to write the definitive story about condoleezza rice presumably she has another year to go at state and it wont be possible to judge the success or failure of her efforts until long after she is gone will the u turn on north korea that she engineered be an embarrassing failure or a master stroke that causes kim jong il to give up his nuclear weapons will the middle east peace effort she initiated lead to something or turn out to be a dangerous waste of time and the biggest question what will iraq look like in five or years on iraq both books may already be overtaken by events they were sent to the publishers with tones of caustic fatalism iraq is a deepening "morass" for mr kessler a scene of "hopelessness" for ms bumiller before the current success of the troop surge became apparent ms rice says shell go back to stanford when she leaves the state department if the job were ever offered she says shed like to become commissioner of the national football league that may be another way of defining success mr karl is senior national security correspondent for abc news
