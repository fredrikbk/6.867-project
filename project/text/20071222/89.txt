weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink a quaff fit for kings the iconography of christmas owes much to northern climes snowmen reindeer fir trees the fur suit on the fat man with the sleigh the presumption of a frigid yule applies no less to holiday drinks the preponderance of which are served hot the traditional british bowl of bishop seethes and smokes tom &amp jerry bubbles and froths wassail glogg and mulled cider are all served steaming and yet one of the most christmasy places in the world just happens to be a caribbean island where one needs a cup of warming cheer about as much as a down parka puerto rico there the local christmas custom revolves around a drink that is a sort of cross between eggnog and a pina colada a chilled holiday quaff called coquito what makes puerto rico such a robust christmas culture for starters sheer duration the festivities get going after thanksgiving and continue well past new years day the traditional puerto rican holiday season has long culminated in a celebration of the epiphany or three kings day on jan on the night before el dia de los tres reyes magos instead of hanging stockings island children fill shoeboxes with straw and leave them under their beds so that the kings camels will have something to eat in the morning the hay is gone and the boxes are filled with presents even as santa claus has given the magi a run for their money in puerto rico and dec has become a gifting occasion as well islanders have managed to stretch the season even further into the new year they celebrate the eight days or octavitas after the epiphany finally bringing christmastide to a close on jan puerto ricans throw themselves into the holiday spirit with their own rambunctious brand of christmas caroling roving parties fueled by coquito on any given night during the lengthy season groups of musicians will venture out to ambush their sleeping friends and neighbors the groups are called parrandas and woe be to those who arent prepared for their assault it is a lamentable social faux pas not to be ready with food and drink for the carolers who expect meat pies roast pork rice and pigeon peas and above all coquito the impromptu party lasts half an hour or so before the hosts join in the parranda as it moves on to another house the ranks of carolers swell into a mob by the time they hit their final stop often about or in the morning but first at each house the parranderos must earn their refreshment not with the regular gringo carols put to a latin beat but rather by performing island folk carols called aguinaldos originally these were performed in the rustic style of the mountain peasants using traditional instruments the small bands would be anchored with the strumming of a guitar over which a cuatro a small stringed guitar that is almost zither like in its twangy timbre arpeggiates a descant add the rhythmic ratchety sound of a guiro along with a singer or two and you have a basic parranda but any instruments will do a friend of mine jazz musician antonio orta grew up in the coastal town of guanica and put his saxophone to use in his many years as a parrandero antonio says the old aguinaldos persist but they are now often performed in more modern styles with merengue or salsa grooves whatever the beat or instrumentation the aguinaldos seamlessly blend the sacred and the secular "ay dona maria ay compadre jose open up the door you both i want to see " goes one of the old songs "were down from the mountains to invite you to eat suckling pig on the spit and rum coquito to drink " how to make the coquito there is no one standard recipe just ones own family methodology says oswald rivera author of the cookbook "puerto rican cuisine in america " traditionalists start by making their own coconut milk a laborious process that involves blanching the coconut meat then grating and squeezing it but there is no shame in using canned coconut milk which thanks to the popularity of thai cooking is now readily available in stateside supermarkets or you can use the sweetened coconut cream such as coco lopez that many puerto ricans favor in their coquito to your coconut preparation of choice add evaporated milk sweetened condensed milk egg yolks cinnamon vanilla or not and blend it all with rum the amount of rum is the most highly variable variable some recipes call for as little as a quarter of the mix to be rum others such as mr riveras mothers recipe push the liquor to about half the total volume and use whoppingly alcoholic proof rum at that no wonder mr rivera says that coquito should be sipped in small quantities i lean away from the more potent style however because coquito tastes too good to be limited to a thimble sized portion make a batch of coquito ahead of time and chill it well in the refrigerator when the time comes to serve it give the coquito a good shake or stir and then pour it into smallish cups though it may not be in strict accordance with island tradition i like to dust the top with a little nutmeg or cinnamon now were ready even if the local carolers show up in the wee small hours and best of all coquito gives us a good excuse to follow puerto rican custom and keep the holiday season going well into the new year after all we wouldnt want the visiting magi to go thirsty email me at eric felten wsj com coquito  can oz coconut
