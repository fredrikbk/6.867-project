weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings now that its official what the philharmonic should and shouldnt play in pyongyang how can symphony orchestras help inexperienced listeners open their ears to difficult pieces of classical music the new york philharmonic experimented last week with a new kind of concert program developed by musicologist gerard mcburney and the chicago symphony to familiarize audiences with unusual works mr mcburneys "inside the music" presentation of dmitri shostakovichs fourth symphony began with an hour long multimedia show in which the philharmonic played excerpts from the symphony as accompaniment to a fast moving montage of archival photographs and clips from soviet propaganda films in between these sequences mr mcburney and f murray abraham "amadeus" told how the premiere of the fourth symphony was canceled after shostakovich had a run in with joseph stalin their purpose was to place the symphony written in in the wider context of the "great terror" that stalin was then inflicting on the russian people if last fridays concert is any indication mr mcburney is onto something the audience sat riveted as he and mr abraham told the tale of the timid composers terrifying encounter with the murderous dictator and the nightmare that was unfolding all around him as stalin and his executioners piled up mountains of corpses and plunged the soviet union into a river of blood and fear the performance that followed was all the more effective as a result the fourth symphony can be a tough nut for unprepared listeners to crack but this time around everyone was ready for its shocking contrasts of violence and slate gray despair ive never heard a more heartfelt ovation for a shostakovich symphony yet it seems highly likely that more than a few of the people who were clapping so enthusiastically were also looking at the players onstage and asking what are they thinking for three days earlier zarin mehta and paul guenther the president and chairman of the philharmonic had shared a platform with pak gil yon north koreas ambassador to the united nations and announced that americas oldest orchestra would be playing in pyongyang next february it horrified me no other word is strong enough to see them sitting next to a smirking representative of kim jong il the dictator of a brutally totalitarian state in whose soviet style prison camps political prisoners are currently doing slave labor in public as well as in private the management of the philharmonic has made it clear that the orchestra is going to north korea with "the encouragement and support of the u s department of state" to quote from the press release announcing the trip while mr mehta went out of his way to say that no pressure was put on the orchestra its widely believed that the white house means to use the concert as a bargaining chip in its continuing negotiations with pyongyang i leave it to more qualified observers to predict whether anything of value will emerge from these negotiations but it is not the job of the new york philharmonic to enact foreign policy much less to besmirch its own honor by taking part in what in a previous column on this topic i called "a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime " nor do you have to be a diplomat to know that mr guenther was blowing smoke when he compared the trip to the concert that leonard bernstein and members of the philharmonic gave at the soon to be dismantled berlin wall nobody is tearing down any walls in north korea that wasnt the only foolish statement made last tuesday asked whether the philharmonic would be handing north korea a propaganda victory by playing in pyongyang mr mehta replied "were not going to do any propaganda were going there to create some joy " somehow i doubt that playing gershwins "an american in paris" and dvoraks "new world" symphony for hand picked servants of the regime will bring joy to the inmates of the north korean gulag i find it especially disturbing that lorin maazel the orchestras music director will be leading the concert mr maazel is the composer of an operatic version of " " george orwells great novel about life under totalitarian rule now hes going to make music for big brother what could he be thinking how might the philharmonic emerge from this misbegotten venture with its honor intact the answer came from the musician who accompanied me to last fridays concert in the hush that followed the rage and anguish of the first movement of shostakovichs fourth symphony she leaned over to me and whispered "forget gershwin this is what they ought to play in north korea " and so they should instead of handing out musical bonbons to kim jong il mr maazel and the philharmonic could pay tribute to his innocent victims by performing a piece that speaks with shattering eloquence of the devastation wrought on an equally innocent people by an equally vicious tyrant music mr guenther told us last week is "a universal language " if so the philharmonic would do well to change its pyongyang program so that the right message will come through loud and clear mr teachout the journals drama critic
