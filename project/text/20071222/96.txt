weekend journal politics campaign presidential playlists presidential hopefuls are turning to pop songs to pump up their campaigns but the messages in the music may be beyond their control mitt romneys choice in theme music could seem incongruous for a presidential candidate trying to shore up his conservative credentials he often mounts the stage to a remixed version of "a little less conversation " in which elvis presley urges a lover to stop talking and just "satisfy me baby " mr romneys camp doesnt see the song as racy "the theme it conveys is that washington needs a little less talk and a lot more action " says spokesman kevin madden in rotation at john edwardss events a john mellencamp song first heard in chevy truck ads rudy giuliani a native new yorker and opera buff has been cuing up country act rascal flatts hillary clinton has taken a shine to a rock song originally written for a space shuttle launch using popular songs for political purposes is a twist on a tactic that goes back to george washington the increasing use of such songs is an outgrowth of the fact that in an age when voters are pulled by a growing number of media sources politicians are looking for tools to help them cut through the clutter there are trade offs however including potentially loaded lyrics and the chance of artist backlash john mccain had been playing "i wont back down " but rocker tom petty asked him to do just that and stop using the tune for his campaign another danger with songs picked to trigger baby boomer nostalgia or heartland appeal most candidates are drawing on a well of material that has already been plumbed for television commercials and soundtracks "suddenly i see " a chugging ode to self determination by scottish singer kt tunstall is one of the songs attached to mrs clinton and a score of tv shows including "ghost whisperer" and "ugly betty " most candidates havent named "official" theme songs for their campaigns that move usually follows a party nomination instead they are using these playlists to amp up crowds signal a candidates approach to the stage or accompany the handshaking marathons that follow so far the soundtrack of the presidential race is loaded with populist anthems from classic rock and country music rap is absent though there is a sprinkling of alterna pop for the young electorate the goal strike a visceral chord with listeners piggyback on the literal message in the title or chorus and hope people dont analyze the lyrics too closely musical selections can attract more scrutiny than position papers on health care mrs clinton was subjected to some criticism last summer when based on a public internet poll she chose celine dions "you and i" as a theme song in the song ms dion sings about clouds stars and the "wings of love" over an undulating soundscape political detractors pounced on ms dions canadian citizenship air canada used "you and i " written by an ad agency as a theme song about three years before mrs clinton picked it up and many music aficionados did what they often do deride ms dions music as generic and treacly lately "you and i" has fallen out of the rotation at mrs clintons events a spokesman said songs are routinely swapped out to keep things fresh though he doesnt have a canned soundtrack mike huckabee occasionally thumbs an electric bass with his cover band capitol offense at an iowa straw poll and a new hampshire fund raiser the group ran through rock staples like "mustang sally " such songs seem intended to balance mr huckabees baptist preacher image not double as talking points but the former arkansas governor could be sending inadvertent messages says joe mathieu program director for potus an xm satellite radio channel dedicated to the presidential race consider the lynyrd skynyrd epic "free bird " a huckabee favorite "isnt that a song about being unable to commit " mr mathieu says "you look at the title and its great but when you read a little further down you find little land mines " a los lobos tune that bill richardson picked sounds sunny if you dont listen to the words released near the end of the reagan administration "mess were in" paints a grim picture with lines like "old man dying from too much drink blood and glass in the bathroom sink " the chorus however is uplifting "the smoke is clearing and we see a light coming together for a different fight " spokesman tom reynolds says richardson "is a personal fan of the song" and thinks the upbeat tempo is perfect to energize a crowd after popping up in the soundtrack for the movie "the devil wears prada " us triumphant "city of blinding lights" also announced barack obamas recent appearances with oprah winfrey it was savvy for the illinois senator to go with u "a proven entity with a hipness attached to them " says josh rabinowitz director of music at grey group an advertising agency mr obamas team has also been known to play "unwritten " a bubbly directive to keep things real by british pop star natasha bedingfield young listeners would already know it from the pantene shampoo ads mr rabinowitz helped place it in or as the theme from the catty mtv reality hit "the hills " soul songs from the civil rights canon including curtis mayfields "move on up" and "give the people what they want" by the ojays let mr obama make a statement about race without putting it in words "the music we choose is a reflection of who he is and the kind of music he listens to " says obama spokeswoman jen psaki in the same way songs like mr pettys "american girl" deliver a girl power theme for mrs clinton original campaign compositions are scarce save for those from online satirists epitomizing the genre is "i got a crush on obama " featuring a sultry lip synching model who pines for her candidate to an r&amp b beat it has been viewed more than four million times on youtube since it first exploded over the summer the clip isnt endorsed by the obama campaign some songs pop up on multiple campaign playlists this past week mr romneys team added lots of country music into the mix to set the mood in a south carolina airplane hangar the set kicked off with alabamas "dancin shaggin on the boulevard " a laid back tune that depicts a place "where the girls are sunnin and a lookin good " later mr romney strode in to the strains of "only in america " taken from a brooks &amp dunn album called "steers and stripes " between fist pumping choruses the song celebrates a nation where "one could end up going to prison one just might be president " that song also served as handshake music after a recent obama speech in waterloo iowa another number from the romney rally was the rascal flatts song "life is a highway " which mr giulianis organizers also favor so did the folks who picked music for the animated blockbuster "cars " songwriters rarely get a say in how politicians use their work that is because the songs typically play at live events often in venues whose owners pay a blanket license fee to ascap and bmi organizations that collect royalties on behalf of songwriters using songs in a commercial or a radio ad on the other hand requires permission from the copyright holder and triggers a different set of fees some musicians make noise when politicians borrow their music bruce springsteen protested ronald reagans use of "born in the u s a " and bobby mcferrin told george h w bush to drop "dont worry be happy" in the presidential race isaac hayes didnt like it when "soul man" was rejiggered as "dole man" on behalf of bob dole a spokeswoman for mr obama says the process of picking songs "isnt an exact science " sometimes they come from a connection with a celebrity supporter such as mr mellencamp who last month brought mr edwards out during a concert to the tune of "small town " and fred thompson the former republican senator from tennessee has linked himself to a parade of country music stars including john rich of the duo big &amp rich mr richs musical partner "big" kenny alphin donated &# to mr obama according to federal election commission records sometimes songs come in through the request line eileen deparrie is a former al gore campaign staffer and a friend of the band big head todd and the monsters a blues rock group whose popularity swelled in the early s over dinner with one of mrs clintons field directors ms deparrie suggested the bands song "blue sky " and the message was relayed up through the chain of command todd park mohr the lead singer of big head todd and the monsters wrote "blue sky" about two years ago after a friend at the national aeronautics and space administration told him the agency had been borrowing elton johns "rocket man" to herald shuttle launches mr mohrs song features soaring instrumentals and references to "reaching for the distant light " thats translated into running music for mrs clinton who often talks about her th grade correspondence with nasa which informed her in a letter that only men could be astronauts mr mohr says "id be psyched if it could become a dont stop " referring to the fleetwood mac hit that famously fueled bill clintons run to the white house political pundits agree that his use of that tune remains the gold standard for campaign anthems george washington didnt need a fight song to win the presidency he got of the electoral votes but he had already been celebrated in verses tacked on to familiar tunes like "yankee doodle" and "god save the king " "weve been doing that since the country was settled " says folk musician oscar brand years old whose album "presidential campaign songs " features his versions of the campaign tunes of dozens of politicians from washington to clinton the campaign theme song came into its own around when modern election strategy took shape before the dawn of radio ensembles with names like the hoi polloi glee club and uncle abes choir joined brass bands at rallies according to "songs odes glees and ballads a bibliography of american presidential campaign songsters" by william miles voters got to know a candidate by seeing his portrait on songbooks and hearing his character extolled or torn down in verse abraham lincoln was the "rail splittin statesman " a compliment grover cleveland "sowed his wild oats all around " not so much amy chozick and elizabeth holmes contributed to this article grass roots groove ron paul has embraced a song written just for him the texas congressman has been lagging behind in the polls but has some enthusiastic grass roots supporters including steve dore a musician in san jose calif who first became enamored of mr paul after hearing him address a conference on hard assets after years of songs about love mr dore says mr paul "took over my creative life " first came "president man " a funky number reminiscent of new orleans bluesman dr john and then more songs including "hope for america " featuring a twinkling synthesizer a slow dance tempo and lines like "if we are to save our republic were really going to need ron paul " not long after he posted his songs on a web site called dailypaul com mr dore got a call from the candidates grandson who asked permission to use "hope for america" on the campaigns myspace page since then it has become a staple at live events where it "lends a nice a cathartic tone to the rallies " says spokesman jesse benton na na na obama the obama effort has put doug levitt to work a recording artist who rides greyhound buses and writes songs about his fellow riders mr levitt was brought into the obama fold by a friend who married campaign spokesman bill burton in september the obama camp flew mr levitt to new hampshire where he performed at events like a a m "coffee and guitar" gathering for about people in peterborough he closed with a song that he wrote for and cleared with the obama campaign composing "today " which urges action and concludes with a "na na na" singalong posed an artistic challenge for mr levitt who had never tried to lift political spirits before "im good at hopeless and im pretty good at breakup ballads " he says re election rock john hall has been on both sides of the campaign song fence he is a former member of the s band orleans and co wrote the groups mellow hit "still the one " which was used to rally crowds during george w bushs re election bid in mr hall and his bandmates fired off a complaint to republican organizers who pulled the song that brought mr hall a democrat back into the spotlight and helped inspire his successful run for congress in new yorks th district his theme song "i am a patriot " performed by his friend jackson browne mr halls re election campaign wont rev up for a few more months but he already has a potential anthem "next time around im tempted to use my own song "
