a year end gift for investors many closed end funds sell at steep discounts consumers usually have to wait until january to get the best deals in stores but on wall street one of the best bargains around is available right now market turmoil and a wave of tax loss selling has driven many closed end investment funds down to levels rarely seen many are now selling for a discount of or even better below the underlying value of their investments "this is one of the best year end buying opportunities ive seen in a decade " says thomas j herzfeld an investment adviser in miami and expert on closed end funds "were seeing some of the widest discounts in years " closed end funds are the lesser known relations of hugely popular mutual funds there is &# billion invested in u s closed end funds while open ended bond and equity mutual funds hold &# trillion estimates financial research corp both types of funds are regulated and professionally managed often by well known investment companies like eaton vance corp blackrock inc or cohen &amp steers inc but mutual funds issue and redeem units as investors come and go which is why theyre called open ended closed end funds issue a fixed number of shares which then trade more or less like stocks one result is that a closed end funds share price and investment performance can move in different directions depending on demand for the shares in some cases the funds price can go down while its investments rise it seems like a bizarre anomaly that wouldnt persist in a liquid market but for a host of technical reasons it does and right now the anomaly is bigger than usual closed end share prices have been hard hit by the stock market turmoil because they are mostly held by retail investors many rush to liquidate investments at the sign of trouble funds have also been hit by a wave of tax loss selling the closed end universe has been swamped with new funds in the past few years and many who invested in the initial public offerings are now sitting on losses they want to realize those losses before the year end to offset capital gains elsewhere in their portfolios but their selling makes the current downturn worse "this is the worst tax loss selling weve seen in five years " agrees larry glazer vice president and portfolio manager at mayflower advisors in boston "thats why the closed end discounts are so wide " these value gaps will probably narrow next month after the wave of tax loss selling ends "i think the tax bounce is a pretty safe bet " says mr glazer but dont assume the gaps will vanish completely closed end discounts can persist for years one approach can work even if your fund remains discounted buy closed funds with high dividend yields as long as the discount exists to net assets you just get more dividends for your money there are caveats many closed end funds seek to boost their returns with leverage often borrowed at short term rates that can leave payouts vulnerable to a spike in interest rates and many funds often with names like "enhanced" or "premium" income boost payouts using an options strategy that can cap profits if the stock market takes off as usual the best approach is to stick to well managed funds
