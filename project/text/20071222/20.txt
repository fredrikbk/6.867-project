cross country free to die in iowa iowa city iowa its the time of year when the frank capra classic "its a wonderful life" is aired on cable channels at all hours you know the story how george bailey played by jimmy stewart arrives on a bridge in a fit of despair ready to take his own life how the angel clarence steps in and gives him a glimpse of what bedford falls would be like if he had never existed how in the end the town comes together to save george from financial ruin and the angel clarence gets his wings well after the death of sonny anthony iovino a year old mentally ill vietnam veteran who froze to death here last month under the benton st bridge i dont think ill ever see "its a wonderful life" in quite the same way there was no kindly angel to rescue this man who suffered from chronic schizophrenia he wasnt standing on a bridge thinking of ending his life he was huddled beneath one trying to stay alive his community my community didnt come together to save him from ruin instead it refused him shelter refused him even the most basic of medical care when he needed it most on nov at p m police responded to a report of a body under the benton st bridge upon arrival they found iovino nearly naked dead the johnson county medical examiner determined the cause of death to be hypothermia local police officers had tried to get iovino the care he needed just hours before his death but he was refused a bed at the local homeless shelter and then turned away from the veterans affairs medical center here because he was "uncooperative " after iovinos death a spokesman for the va medical center told the cedar rapids gazette "if somebody doesnt want to be treated you cant treat them " this is simply not the case given his debilitated state the va psychiatrist on duty could have forced iovino to receive the treatment that might have saved his life most states including iowa have passed assisted outpatient treatment aot laws according to these statutes "you must continue to take your medication or you may be committed " says dr e fuller torrey author of "surviving schizophrenia" and president of the treatment advocacy center a nonprofit dedicated to eliminating barriers to the treatment of mental illnesses dr torrey notes however that states often fail to use aot laws because of strict commitment standards and poorly outlined procedures in fact iowas commitment standard is better than many states which demand that a person be an "imminent" danger to himself or others in iowa however to be eligible for aot a person must lack sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions concerning treatment and be either a danger to self others or unable to satisfy the need for "nourishment clothing essential medical care or shelter so that it is likely that the person will suffer physical injury physical debilitation or death " when iovino was picked up by police just two days prior to his death he was digging up the earth with his bare hands talking to himself barefoot in frigid weather and huddling near a buildings exhaust vent to stay warm he was at the very least a danger to himself police convinced iovino to put his shoes back on and cited him for trespassing they received another call a few hours later and found that he had removed all his clothing but his pants they again helped him get dressed and sent him on his way when called back a third time they took him to the va medical center where he asked for medicine when the va did not admit him the officers took him to the county jail which also refused him saying he needed immediate medical care "it happens increasingly often " says dr torrey "as many states iowa included shut down beds for mentally ill patients then theres two places they can go the streets and jails our nations jail keepers are tired of being their communities primary mental health facility " but thats precisely what they are according to a study by the justice department last year of state prisoners of federal prisoners and of local jail inmates suffer from mental illnesses there are now more mentally ill americans behind bars than in hospitals nevertheless civil libertarians seem more concerned with a patients civil rights than his very survival for example despite a study released in by the new york state office of mental health showing a marked decline in arrests hospitalizations incarcerations homelessness and threats of violence and suicide for patients under that states "kendras law " the new york civil liberties union lobbied against the laws renewal that same year even without a well functioning aot program iovino didnt have to die that november night the va medical center could have filed what is called an "emergency petition" and held him for several days "there is no question that the va doctors could have done a short term commitment " says dr torrey "that generally keeps a patient in the hospital up to hours " once a patient is held under emergency petition court commitment procedures can go forward so why wasnt iovino held and treated at the va medical center where he had asked for medication a va spokesman assures me they are "aware of what the law says " but perhaps theyre not fully aware or perhaps theyd just grown tired of his antics its hard to say one things certain no kindly angel received his wings the night sonny iovino froze to death mr judge an iowa based freelance journalist is a contributing editor at the far eastern economic review
