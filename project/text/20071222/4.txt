banks abandon effort to set up big rescue fund treasury backed idea as response to crisis boost from foreigners one of the federal governments signature efforts to ease financial instability caused by the subprime mortgage crisis collapsed as the nations three biggest banks gave up on a fund intended to rescue tens of billions of dollars in troubled investments the banks had been trying since september to set up a fund that would buy securities tied to mortgages and other assets that were controlled by banks in off balance sheet funds but events overtook the effort by the time it began to try to gather assets banks were already handling the problem themselves benn steil senior fellow at the council on foreign relations a nonpartisan think tank said the plan was based on the flawed notion that the fund would pay more for tainted securities than would the banks themselves "im not surprised that this didnt happen " he said "i never believed the proposal made much sense " banks and wall street bond manager blackrock inc which was overseeing the fund issued a statement late friday saying they no longer see the need for it they said banks could reactivate the fund if conditions worsen instead of the fund the biggest boost to wall streets confidence in recent weeks has come from government linked investors in asia and the middle east who have poured money into big financial firms the latest cash infusion may come from a singapore government investment fund that is in negotiations to invest &# billion in merrill lynch &amp co which has been hard hit by subprime mortgage losses news of the possible merrill investment and similar moves helped push stocks up friday the dow jones industrial average rose points or to the now collapsed effort was intended to rescue bank linked funds known as structured investment vehicles or sivs the sivs issued short term debt at relatively low interest rates and used the proceeds to buy longer term debt carrying higher rates including debt backed by mortgages banks aimed to profit by pocketing the difference between the rates at their peak sivs held some &# billion in assets a figure that fell to &# billion by early december as they sold off some holdings when debt markets froze up in august the fear was that the sivs would be forced to unload their assets in a panic that would create big losses the theory went and set artificially low market prices for the assets forcing financial institutions to take huge write downs the treasury department encouraged banks to set up a "super siv " dubbed the master liquidity enhancement conduit that would buy the assets in an orderly way the three banks leading the effort were bank of america corp citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co ultimately the feared fire sale never happened because most of the big banks with sivs in particular citigroup ended up taking the siv assets and liabilities onto their own balance sheets originally envisioned as a &# billion operation the organizers repeatedly reined in their expectations most recently predicting that the fund would contain roughly &# billion some say the proposed super siv did its work because it prevented a panic "i think it did boost market confidence enough for people to get out" of their siv exposure said chip macdonald a partner in the capital markets group of law firm jones day "it probably had the intended effect without ever being implemented " still the government effort did little to end the larger crisis of confidence that has caused markets for bonds and other securities to freeze up the treasury department also invested considerable time and prestige in pushing the super siv as recently as last monday treasury secretary henry paulson said he was "still optimistic" about progress being made on it a treasury spokeswoman responding to the banks announcement said the department welcomes "market based solutions to facilitate liquidity and orderliness" in debt markets the super siv was one of the two main elements of the bush administrations response to the subprime mortgage crisis the other announced this month by president bush was an agreement among mortgage industry participants to expedite new mortgages or interest rate freezes for some subprime borrowers whose rates are due to rise over the next two years separately the federal reserve has tried to thaw frozen credit markets by making it easier for banks to borrow an initial effort in august proved ineffective a new lending program unveiled on dec appears to be off to a more successful start as banks bid enthusiastically for &# billion in one month loans from the fed the newly available cash helped push down short term interest rates which had risen as banks tried to hoard cash towards the end of the year citigroup was the biggest siv player with nearly &# billion in assets on dec citigroup under new chief executive vikram pandit brought about half of those assets back onto its balance sheet saying it would provide emergency support to the vehicles if it couldnt find buyers for their debt hsbc holdings plc made a similar move that left only two major banks germanys dresdner bank a unit of allianz se and bmo financial group and its bank of montreal unit that hadnt yet moved to restructure their sivs wachovia corp chief executive g kennedy thompson noted on dec "the market seems to be taking care of the siv issue the importance of it in my view is less today than we thought it would be days ago " among the latest to bow out were three major japanese banks mitsubishi ufj financial group inc mizuho financial group inc and sumitomo mitsui financial group inc which saw their share prices fall when investors thought they might participate one reason for the plans downfall was that it would only buy the highest quality assets from the sivs that gave banks with sivs less motivation to create a super siv because the assets they most wanted to unload were those backed by more troubled slices of mortgage debt although the banks and blackrock insisted as recently as last tuesday that the super siv was on track and would be formally set up in a few weeks they decided in the past few days that it was no longer necessary according to people familiar with the matter "weve heard loud and clear from the market " said one person involved in the process those exposed to the lower quality holdings have had to handle them themselves this includes taking losses on such holdings as many asset management units of banks have done this past week morgan stanley reported a &# million loss related to siv holdings in cash funds in its fourth quarter results the abandoning of the super siv could be costly for blackrock given the amount of time effort and technology it has invested in the initiative the work is "taking some capacity away" from its ability to take on other assignments blackrock chief executive larry fink said recently
