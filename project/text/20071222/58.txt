politics &amp economics u s may look to send more troops to afghanistan washington the u s might send more combat troops to afghanistan to reverse a surge in violence there even as conditions in iraq begin to improve defense secretary robert gates said the u s led coalition in afghanistan needs about more troops half to battle taliban militants and half to train the fledging afghan national army mr gates told reporters at the pentagon he said fresh u s forces could be deployed to afghanistan to help meet that goal a senior pentagon official said sending additional u s troops to afghanistan was "clearly something that is being strongly considered " he said it likely would be several months before any new forces were deployed given the militarys manpower strains because of the iraq war mr gatess comments highlight mounting unease in the white house and the pentagon about afghanistan where the resurgent taliban have killed hundreds of u s troops and steadily eroded the reach and authority of president hamid karzais weak central government u s commanders are weighing an option that would have seemed unthinkable six months ago sending additional forces to afghanistan even as the u s begins to withdraw tens of thousands of troops from iraq mr gates said friday that troop levels in iraq would drop next year if the countrys security situation continues to improve though he declined to offer a specific number the u s already has announced plans to withdraw about troops by next summer mr gates previously has said troop levels could fall to about by the end of but many senior u s commanders believe there are far too few troops in afghanistan the country is bigger and more populous than iraq but has less than one sixth the number of u s military personnel soldiers and marines compared to more than in iraq compounding the problem the u s has had enormous difficulty persuading allies to expand military operations in afghanistan the north atlantic treaty organization commands a person force there but several countries contributing forces refuse to allow them to take part in combat operations mr gates has spent months publicly pressing nato and european leaders to send more combat forces helicopters and training personnel to afghanistan but has had little success this past week he told the house armed services committee he felt frustrated u s allies are "not being able to step up to the plate " he took a somewhat more conciliatory approach friday telling reporters he understood it would be politically difficult for many allies to significantly expand their presence in afghanistan or take on additional combat duties "continuing to publicly go after our allies to do things that politically are just impossible for them is probably not very productive " he said instead mr gates said that the u s is looking for "creative ways" for combat wary countries to contribute either by contributing money or carrying out reconstruction work in secure areas of the country that means any additional fighters would likely have to come from the u s itself asked if sending more troops to afghanistan would be a hard sell mr gates demurred "i dont think theres a political constraint " he said
