hot topic amt fight previews tax showdown congress completed its session and left washington this past week but not before passing legislation to keep taxpayers from facing a bigger tax bite as a result of the alternative minimum tax or amt democrats and republicans engaged in a weeks long standoff that threatened to derail the annual amt "patch" because of differences over whether congress should make up the lost revenue without the legislation some million taxpayers would have faced an average &# increase in their tax bills next year but the bill will add &# billion to the national debt rather than risk infuriating millions of taxpayers house democrats eventually retreated from demands that congress raise taxes to offset the cost of the patch the debate over how congress should pay for lower taxes foreshadows a bigger battle that looms whether congress should make permanent president bushs tax cuts heres a closer look why does the amt exist the amts origins date back to when congress decided to act to prevent a handful of the wealthiest americans from using special deductions to legally avoid paying income taxes but the amt wasnt indexed for inflation and it has ensnared rising numbers of middle class taxpayers the amt operates as a separate system from the income tax taxpayers who might be eligible for the amt must calculate their taxes under both the income tax and the amt and pay the higher amount congress usually raises the amt patch each year to keep more taxpayers from being hit by higher taxes but those "patches" have become more costly as more individuals are exempted from the tax who pays the amt some four million taxpayers faced the tax last year and the patch primarily will benefit income earners who make &# to &# since the amt doesnt allow deductions for state and local taxes or for dependents taxpayers with large families and residents of high tax areas in the northeast or california are most likely to be affected why did congress delay in approving an amt patch to conform with the "pay as you go" budget rules congress passed earlier this year house democrats argued that the &# billion cost of the amt patch should have been offset by other tax increases either by targeting carried interest paid by private equity managers or by limiting the ability of hedge fund managers to use offshore shelters to defer taxes on their compensation republicans opposed those measures because the government they argued was never intended to rely on amt revenue the standoff sets the stage for future debates about whether president bushs tax cuts should be extended before they expire in "there is a broader interesting message here its very tough to raise taxes its not the s " says chris edwards the director of tax policy at the libertarian cato institute both parties support a permanent "fix" for the amt which is projected to bring in &# trillion over the next decade an extension of the tax cuts would cost an additional &# trillion through according to white house figures and sticking to pay go rules would complicate efforts to extend those cuts what are the consequences of the delay millions of federal income tax refunds may be late this year because congress waited so long to take action the internal revenue service says it needs time to reprogram its computers to reflect the changes as of late friday the irs hadnt disclosed details of how many refunds may be delayed nick timiraos points of view there is no disagreement over protecting the middle class from the amt the question is will we do so responsibly

american people expect " rep eric cantor r va facts the irs generally has days to mail tax refunds before paying interest in tax day was pushed back to april from march to spread out the peak workload
