weekend journal review theater the joan didion show new york it surprised me when joan didion published "the year of magical thinking " for i identified her so completely with california in the s that id almost forgotten she was still alive of course she continued to publish a fat volume of her collected essays came out last fall but somehow i had come to see her as a figure from the distant past a chronicler of strange days for which i felt no nostalgia whatsoever then her daughter got sick and her husband died of a heart attack and she wrote a best seller about it and all at once she was back now ms didion has turned her much discussed memoir into a one woman show in which she is played by vanessa redgrave sort of ms didion has said that ms redgrave isnt "portraying" her but unless you know joan didion which i dont theres no way to know whos who and since the woman on stage is delivering a first person monologue about a year in the life of joan didion well you figure it out all of which matters precisely because "the year of magical thinking " both on paper and on stage is personal in a way that made me acutely uncomfortable though i had to read the book twice before i was able to put my finger on the problem let me stipulate up front that the death of a loved one is among the most devastating things that can happen to a human being and that ms didion is to be pitied for having been forced to swallow a double dose of it quintana her daughter died shortly before "the year of magical thinking" was published and ms didion has added a scene to the stage version describing her final illness it goes without saying too that a writer to whom such a catastrophe happens is likely to want to write about it at some point and theres nothing wrong with that its what writers do yet i found it hard to shake off the disquieting sensation that ms didion for all the obvious sincerity of her grief was nonetheless functioning partly as a grieving widow and partly as a celebrity journalist who had chosen to treat the death of john gregory dunne as yet another piece of grist for her literary mill all the familiar features of her style hardened into slick self regarding mannerism after years of constant use were locked into place and running smoothly and i felt as though i were watching a piece of performance art or reading a cover story in people joan didion on grief is this unfair probably after a certain point in his life a writer writes the way he writes and ms didion has been doing it for so long that you wouldnt have expected her to start doing it differently overnight yet i couldnt help but recall "a grief observed " the blunt little book that c s lewis wrote in after the death of his wife yes the style was recognizably his but the book didnt sound like another product brought to you by c s lewis inc it was rather a shocking howl of pain that was all the more shocking for its rawness and it was initially published under a pseudonym "n w clark " not that it needed to be for you never feel while reading it that lewis was trading on his fame all you hear is the voice of a man who just happens to be famous telling you about something terrible that might have happened to anyone would that the stage version of "the year of magical thinking" were an improvement on the book but it isnt in one way its much worse for it starts off with a speech that has all the subtlety of the proverbial blunt object "this happened on december that may seem a while ago but it wont when it happens to you and it will happen to you the details will be different but it will happen to you thats what im here to tell you " why on earth did david hare the stage savvy director let ms didion get away with so crude and undramatic a gesture if the rest of the play doesnt make that point nothing will nor did mr hare insist that his debutante author this is ms didions first play ram a theatrical spine down the back of her fugitive reflections on death and dying as a seasoned playwright he should have known better "the year of magical thinking" doesnt go anywhere it just goes and goes inching from scene to scene and when ms didion finally gets around to telling us an hour and a half later what she learned from the loss of her husband and daughter it turns out to be a string of portentously worded platitudes "grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it we all know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a time when we must relinquish the dead let them go keep them dead " now look at the gut punching first sentence of "a grief observed" "no one told me that grief felt so like fear " thats dramatic not to mention modest vanessa redgrave is of course a great actress and thats whats wrong with her performance in "the year of magical thinking" she never lets you forget that shes acting instead of letting ms didions words speak for themselves she pumps up the volume turning the narrator into a capital c character a twitchy snooty famous writer who lest we forget isnt really j n d d n only we know she is because she ostentatiously pulls out a copy of "the year of magical thinking" and reads from it at plays end after which the lights obligingly go up on a billboard sized reproduction of the glossy dust jacket photo of the author and her family i half expected ms didion to be signing books in the lobby after the show it strikes me that ms redgrave would have profited from seeing "primo " sir anthony shers one man stage version of "if this is a man " primo levis harrowing memoir of life and death in auschwitz unlike her sir anthony played his part with understated transparency you never saw the teller only his terrible tale on the other hand such self effacing simplicity might well have been out of place in "the year of magical thinking " in which ms didion is constantly on display so much so that you never get a clear sense of what her husband and daughter were like its all about her i assume by the way that mr hare is to blame for the fact that ms redgrave plays the first hour and a quarter of "the year of magical thinking" seated in a chair thats inverted showmanship an engraved invitation to admire a performer so charismatic that she doesnt have to move around the stage to hold your attention alas its but one of the many distracting pieces of notice
