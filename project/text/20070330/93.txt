weekend journal drivers seat the stealth minivans if you count yourself among the many who swear youd rather be run over than drive a minivan chances are you either dont have children or own a sport utility vehicle if the former applies may you be blessed with the good sense to buy a sports car lest you find yourself one day alone on your deathbed thinking back on four decades of commuting in camrys for the rest of you be alerted that general motors wants to sell you a new vehicle targeted at your conceit the buick enclave gmc acadia and saturn outlook are the three flavors of this neapolitan suv one thats more of a minivan without sliding doors than a traditional truck like those americans have been gorging themselves on the past decade before continuing we should acknowledge that yes a few of you parents have demonstrated considerable good taste by continuing to embrace the family car forcing the offspring to squeeze into cramped and spartan rear confines where they are sheltered from the orgy of multiple cupholders dvd players and backseat audio and climate controls bully for you the greater procreating populace however are comfortable only when traveling with all the comforts trappings and square footage of a college dorm room hence the features list for gms new suv family which contains all of the aforementioned stuff plus such how did we ever get along without it extras like remote starting a power liftgate and cargo area audio controls presumably for tailgating unless you buy groceries with a particular affinity for classic rock the list continues with a l v and a six speed automatic transmission plenty of airbags stability control a navigation unit and a rear parking assist system theres little difference between the gmc and saturn nameplates now on sale the buick will be available later this year as a model save for a few minor equipment choices restricted to one or the other the acadia and outlook are mechanical twins available with or without all wheel drive on the road they perform perfectly well for what they are riding quietly and comfortably the horsepower engine five horsepower less in the base saturn provides decent acceleration at legal speeds and the suspension minimizes the listing that tends to plague vehicles that weigh over pounds as both the acadia and outlook will once theyre loaded with passengers if you find yourself longing for more power or better handling perhaps you ought to slow down and consider the kids in the back for all their similarity the acadia and outlook have unique styling sharing only a few parts including the doors and windshield the saturn is the more attractive with cleaner lines on the inside it has a nice no frills design with tight gaps between trim pieces proof that gm continues to get its act together when it comes to interiors by contrast the gmc is bedecked with plenty of superfluous fake chrome a styling theme that unfortunately continues inside to even worse effect both suvs struggle to appear less out of proportion than they actually are and neither really succeeds as the combination of a inch wheelbase and plus inch length creates quite the dachshund effect but the long wheelbase and a car like unibody construction make for an enormous interior that allows for three real rows of seats compared to gms similarly sized chevrolet tahoe an suv built with a truck style body on frame design the acadia and outlook offer superior cargo capacity and a much more spacious third row configured with a second row bench the vehicle can seat eight but the more desirable setup is to choose captains chairs in the middle row this makes it easy for the way back passengers to clamber aboard while allowing parents to keep car seats strapped in if this sounds like the seating configuration of most minivans youve figured it all out gm disclosed last year that it would be quitting the minivan business leading the pundits to weigh in with the usual heaping dose of criticism much of it deserved gm hasnt built a first rate minivan from day one thats two decades and four design generations of mediocrity while these new gm suvs cant compete feature for feature with the state of the art in minivans what with all those storage compartments and seats that fold into the floor the acadia and outlook serve as mostly capable stand ins with the traditional minivan market in decline it seems fairly astute for gm to seek a larger percentage of minivan haters with these new products the move is even a logical extension of gms last minivan redesign which tried to disguise the models as suvs by giving them truck like snouts if gm deserves credit for continuous improvement here it fails in another of its historically weak areas pricing the least
