the daily fix georgetown ohio state florida ucla prepare for star studded final four online edition what a weekend the final four and the beginning of the baseball season as a chaser tomorrow night georgetown and ohio state clash in the opener followed by florida and ucla roy hibbert jeff green and jonathan wallace give the hoyas a patient offense that can grind down opponents and make up ground in a hurry witness the way they jumped out of the coffin against vanderbilt and unc but the buckeyes showed the same cool in coming back against xavier and tennessee have a big man of their own to match mr hibbert in greg oden and boast a great supporting cast that includes ron lewis and freshman mike conley jr florida is defending a title not florida state ugh with all five starters returning led by the trio of joakim noah corey brewer and al horford who decided together to pass up a shot at the nba their game will be a rematch of last years championship game against ucla which brought back key players of its own in arron afflalo luc richard mbah a moute and lorenzo mata both teams are known for stingy defense with the gators given the edge in rebounding in the st louis post dispatch bryan burwell is happy with the lack of underdogs this years final fours roster is two seeds and a pair of s "while part of the ncaa tournaments infinite charm is the possibility that the high and mighty can fall every once in a while we need a little break from the bracket busting " he writes "no charming cinderellas no fun loving little guys no surprise upset picks that turn my brackets into disaster areas every once in a while we need a little chalk sprinkled over the proceedings so here we are in the big peach and im clearly getting my wish this is the chalkiest final four in years no little guys allowed everything about the final four is larger than life grossly exaggerated and bloated to the extreme " that said mr burwell rejects the idea that were seeing signs of a new power structure "whats closer to the truth is that last years final four might have been a fluke too " he writes "that final four with nos and seeds was the second highest combination of seeds since the tournament field expanded to in in other words over the long haul it all evens out " the kansas city stars blair kerkhoff sounds happy with this quartet as well noting that messrs horford noah brewer afflalo green hibbert and oden could all be first round picks for the nba "old school is the feel of this final four " he writes "in the day the best players got their teams to the final weekend those teams didnt always win the championship but wilt chamberlain elgin baylor jerry west oscar robertson elvin hayes larry bird ralph sampson and akeem olajuwon commanded the spotlight others did win lew alcindor bill walton david thompson magic johnson michael jordan james worthy and patrick ewing clipped nets and received rings the point being there was a time when the best college players brought the best teams to the championship weekend and the next you heard of them came in the early moments of the nba draft the game had gotten away from that recently " in the washington post michael wilbon writes that georgetowns john thompson iii has had a luxury his father never had he gets to just be a coach not a crusader "when john iii leads the hoyas into the georgia dome today and talks to reporters about georgetowns trip to the final four he wont be a lightning rod for controversy or social issues " mr wilbon writes adding that "the son wont be asked how it feels to be the first black coach to bring a team to the final four because pops already did that dont get me wrong the son will face perhaps a thousand questions about himself his family and his players between now and whenever the hoyas leave atlanta but it wont amount to an inquisition to one long accusation yes big john and john iii are different very different but so are we so are the times the culture our level of tolerance and understanding " georgetowns coach is a disciple of pete carril who led princeton to ivy league titles during his long coaching career but mr carril cant understand the fuss over his princeton offense in fact he wont even call it that "to him it is only basketball and it is not complicated " john branch writes in the new york times "carril does not understand why no one talks about other offenses the way they do about princetons but people are calling him and they are suddenly curious as if there is some mystery to be unearthed a round ball archeological dig looking for the key to georgetowns success i dont know why this has happened carril said i resent it and i know john resents it more he softened his words he was in a good mood i dont resent it he said but it seems ridiculous " inevitably florida vs ohio state has become a referendum on how long nba bound players should stay in college ohio states mr oden is widely expected to opt for the june draft while florida has returned to the final four in large part because messrs brewer noah and horford delayed going pro in the los angeles times bill plaschke invites us to meet the brewers "in a patch of farmland on the edges of this tiny hill town theres a pristine subdivision with two story brick houses deep lawns and backyard pools " he writes "the brewers live across the street in a matchbox house with a weed choked yard and a backyard beer tub in the subdivision smooth driveways lead to fancy garages on which are mounted basketball hoops the brewers have a gravel driveway no garage for their mile cars and a couple of warped lawn chairs around that beer tub every morning when glenda brewer leaves for her job as a special education teacher and pee wee brewer wheels himself outside to visit friends they look across the street into that fancy subdivision every night they phone the son who could have put them there and they tell him they love him because he didnt " ucla wont have kevin love on the court tomorrow night but espn coms bill simmons cant wait to see the recruit play for the bruins predicting after watching wednesdays mcdonalds all american game that mr love "will become a revelation for a whole new generation of fans " thats in stark contrast to usc bound o j mayo whom mr simmons also watched wednesday and decries as having "a legitimate chance to replace vince carter as my least favorite nba star of all time before everythings said and done " the two players contrasting styles lead mr simmons to a passionate unflinching examination of basketball philosophy race and his insistence that this is about much more than race "with mayo joining a loaded usc team and love playing minutes away for a final four team thats looming as a dynamite rivalry and the most intriguing media subplot for the season " he writes "after all love represents everything good about basketball unselfishness teamwork professionalism and mayo represents everything weve come to despise showboating selfishness over hype if love were black this would be a much easier topic to discuss but hes white so even though theres a natural inclination to embrace loves game and disparage mayos game you know assuming you give a crap about basketball and care about where its headed as a sport theres also a natural inclination to hold back because nobody wants to sound like the white media guy supporting the great white hope over the black superstar du jour so heres the answer to make it easier for everybody theres room for both guys "
