weekend journal tastings americas great white finding top chardonnay isnt easy even for &# grand tastes elegance sadder words were rarely spoken during a wine tasting we were in the middle of a very disappointing tasting of american chardonnay under &# earlier this year when dottie said it "i think maybe ive forgotten what good american chardonnay tastes like " it was like a dagger to our hearts where american chardonnay has a very special place when we were growing up with wine in the s the most profound american wines we tasted were cabernet sauvignon beaulieu heitz mondavi and more but chardonnay was our love partly it was because it tasted like a blanket of white velvet that enveloped us in a special way but partly it was because it was so aggressively american it didnt try to be anything other than what it was a massive proud showy wine that commanded attention we remember so clearly every sip of our first fisher with sweetbreads our first kistler at a concert in central park our first bacigalupi at room temperature and our first peter michael so memorable that almost years later we still keep in touch with the sommelier who recommended it but chardonnay even expensive chardonnay has suffered over the years american chardonnay was blasted by critics for being too big too aggressive too hard to pair with food why cant it be more like white burgundy they asked in our minds and to our palates california chardonnay lost its way it wasnt white burgundy with elegant restraint and marvelous terroir but it lost its confident american ness too and the prices for the price of a top notch american chardonnay we could have a finer burgundy or two americas modern wine industry is very young however it changes quickly wineries winemaking regions and wines themselves are still finding their way in the past couple of years weve sensed some return of confidence at the higher end of the chardonnay scale so when dottie voiced her deepest fear we knew it was time to break the bank and find out if even at the high end real american chardonnay still exists and if so how hard it is to find we decided to buy every american chardonnay we could find over &# from the vintage we chose that year because its the most widely available and was a good year there are more expensive chardonnays out there than you can imagine in fact as far as we can tell if a winery wants its new chardonnay to be taken seriously it needs to charge at least &# and probably more each high end chardonnay patz &amp hall paul hobbs kistler and ramey to name a few then has its strident partisans we bought more than in many cases these wineries make more than one chardonnay each year from different vineyards so in some cases we bought two bottlings from a particular winery even at these prices some prized chardonnays are just about impossible to get we had to go to a restaurant to try the littorai and paid &# for it it really is a special wine with tremendous confidence that makes it big proud and yet surprisingly easy to drink and pair with food "deft hand " we wrote in our notes it wasnt a part of our official blind tasting though because we tried it at a restaurant how were the ones we tasted blind far too many were disappointing they tasted like inexpensive chardonnay that had been packaged beautifully and then overpriced to sell the one thing that was immediately clear in our tasting is that paying &# or more for a chardonnay does not guarantee you a wine thats worth the money however and this is a major however we tasted more than we expected that really did make our socks roll up and down to us a special american chardonnay should have super rich luscious fruit that is then kept in sharp focus by abundant acidity it should taste pure and true it shouldnt be afraid of oak but the oak flavors should be held in check the wine can have some lime like sourness and probably will have hints of cinnamon nutmeg vanilla and all sorts of tropical fruits most of all the wine should hold interest throughout the whole bottle at the price these should be wines that you want to talk about because they are interesting and complex enough that they change and grow throughout the night even though they offer grand tastes they should also have elegance and balance a big man who can dance that doesnt mean that they have to be wines that we love but they should be wines of personality and verve which means that we should be able to appreciate them even if theyre not exactly our cup of tea its fine if theyre controversial check out the notes on our favorites in the attached index note how each one is different some bigger some more restrained some with more tastes of this or that this is what makes wine drinking fun excellent wines from the same country and from the same grape made by winemakers who have different visions our favorite peter michael we wrote of this one "intense with great fruit oak balance and bell ringing acidity juicy tightly wound ripe fruit its like a meal with spices especially nutmeg and earth classy american wine huge yet elegant a complete wine what chardonnay can taste like " while the rap on american chardonnay is that its too big and fat to pair with food our favorites have the kind of acidity and complexity that disprove that criticism for instance we generally have felt that american chardonnay is a bad match with lobster because its just richness on top of richness but most of our favorites would be excellent with simply prepared lobster not to mention stone crab claws when we called the brewer clifton winery to ask how the winemakers there achieved so much power and yet so much finesse in their chardonnay steve clifton who owns the winery and makes the wines with greg brewer said "its all about santa rita hills " the cool temperatures in that region of santa barbara provide a long growing season that enables the grapes to maintain "great acidity " he explained "so you get unbelievable ripeness and youre able to balance out both the acidic and lean qualities and have the kind of flesh that gives that plushness thats enticing "our first goal is to make wines that complement the table and work with food " he added "our second goal is to have people really have to ponder over them " were glad to have reacquainted ourselves with truly memorable american chardonnay we feel that chardonnay on the higher end is on the upswing again and even though these are expensive and even though there are fewer great ones than there should be its important that someone continues to set the standard we hope more winemakers will rediscover what chardonnay can be and shoot for it at all price ranges in the meantime wed urge you to choose carefully among expensive chardonnays but dont give up on them you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones very expensive american chardonnay index in a tasting of american chardonnays from the vintage that cost from about &# up these were our favorites these are very young and would benefit from at least a couple of years of age ted lemon the owner winemaker at well regarded littorai wines says hed guess that his will improve for at least another five years if well kept and that sounds about right to us though wed certainly like to try it in if you open them now wed suggest decanting unless you have all night to drink them but taste first before you decant they are better at cellar temperature than chilled and then in many cases even better as they slowly warm toward room temperature these demand elegant meals but wed keep the preparations simple say steamed lobster because the wines themselves have so many layers and such complexity that they should be the stars of the show these are hard to find and therefore prices
