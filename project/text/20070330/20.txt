dont give up securities class actions yet peter wallisons otherwise convincing arguments for reducing securities class action risk as the best way to improve u s financial competitiveness "capital complaints " editorial page march contain two assertions that require a response first if its true as mr wallison asserts that class action litigation is leading many public companies to decide their purpose is "to issue accurate financial reports rather than to add value for shareholders " that means gaap compliant financial reporting no longer has much to do with whether companies are adding value for their shareholders that may well be the case arthur levitt argued as much in his march journal editorial page piece on how the fasb has fallen down on the job "standards deviation" but one would think that would be a reason to encourage the accounting profession to do a better job rather than calling for the elimination of securities class actions mr wallison doesnt do that though instead he argues that the most "significant" reason something needs to be done about securities class actions is that "a single successful class action judgment could result in the destruction of one of the big four auditing firms a catastrophic loss for the global financial community " how does mr wallison know that the big four are all llps so no one knows what their profit margins are so none of the many calls that are now being made to give them liability protection including mr wallisons are convincing indeed kpmg and ernst &amp young the two smallest firms in the big four have been able to afford in recent years single settlements of more than &# million and &# million each respectively without collapsing which suggests that the big four may in fact be fully capable of withstanding everything that future class actions may throw at them especially given the fact that as mr wallison notes settlements tend to come in at only around of the original claims more importantly though wouldnt protecting the big four against class actions give them even fewer reasons than they already have to work with the fasb the sec and the pcaob on making gaap based accounting and auditing relevant again the owners of public companies rely on big four accountants and auditors to do a "professional" job protecting their interests being "professional" means making accounting and auditing practices and standards relevant again and following those practices and standards or "principles " if you wish on the job when a big four firm fails to perform "professionally" in that way securities class actions represent one of the admittedly painful mechanisms that can serve to "help" them recover that professionalism christopher hanks santa monica calif
