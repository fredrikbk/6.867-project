weekend journal travel class warfare at the infinity pool resorts bring elite perks into open stirring envy defying the bracelet code in the latest twist on hotel service some guests are better than others while luxury resorts have always offered pricey room options like a presidential suite service outside the room has generally been the same now some resorts are rolling out fancier service tiers that come with benefits blatantly visible to other guests from private pools and beach areas in the middle of the grounds to guaranteed spots at crowded restaurants elite guests who pay an additional &# to &# or more per night also get nicer rooms and full access to the main resort to distinguish them from the regular guests many of whom are paying hefty rates of &# to &# a night they

where they paid &# a night for a junior suite when they first visited the resorts main pool dozens of sunbathers clogged the chairs a volleyball game was under way in the water and a latin style band played american hits by the bar two days later they stumbled on a quieter pool where an attendant was circling with cold towels among the or so guests but as soon as the couple set down their towels the attendant asked them to leave "he said oh im sorry but this pool is only for royal service guests " says mr rooksby a year old law student at the university of virginia "you dont expect for that kind of money to be treated like a second class citizen " the hotels are taking a cue from the success of club floors which first appeared a few decades ago on the top floors of urban hotels and were geared at business travelers the floors generally offered the same quality rooms as the rest of the hotel but included extras like a faster check in fancier bathroom amenities and lounges with complimentary food fairmont hotels &amp resorts offers "gold floors" at properties those rooms which cost about &# to &# more a night have occupancy rates an average nine to percentage points higher than rooms on other floors hotels are also responding to higher demand thanks to the strong economy the unprecedented number of u s millionaires and the growing number of retiring baby boomers average luxury room rates rose about in over the year before according to smith travel research adding more expensive enclaves allows hotels to increase profits without having to build a whole new luxury property which takes an average of five years "they are observing that even at the upper levels you can dissect the guests even more " says rogerio basso senior manager with ernst &amp youngs hospitality advisory group he expects more hotels to pick up the concept over the next five years but as resorts serve two tiers of guests on one site akin to throwing aside the curtain between coach and first class some regular guests are resisting the treatment theyre crashing the pools posing as the elite and leaving their low rank signifiers behind barbara watters who paid about &# a night for an ocean view room at the el dorado royale on the riviera maya in mexico last month was constantly reminded of her lesser standing during her two night stay guests in the resorts casita suites which cost about more have private pools exclusive use of certain beds on the beach and restaurant reservation priority for identification casita guests get beige striped towels while regular guests have

pool after swimming they "dried off in the sun " says the year old executive secretary from grand rapids mich "if you were staying in a casita you were treated like royalty if you werent in a casita you didnt count " pamela johnston a spokeswoman for el dorado royale says "all of our guests are important to us and we aim to exceed all of their expectations " at the el conquistador resort in

courses for a pharmaceutical company and her cousin visited the pool twice around dinnertime when there werent any attendants around "we walked in like we owned the place " she says hotels are trying to enforce the boundaries "it is an issue " says stan soroka managing director of el conquistador and las casitas village the hotel has tried measures to keep the uninvited out of the las casitas infinity pool like asking people for their key or room number every hour and a half that didnt go over too well "a lot of people would say i didnt bring my key and i dont want to answer those questions " he says mr soroka expects to launch another solution later this spring a gate around the pool with a key swipe system hes not sure it will be fail safe though "its going to be a very short gate " he says and people could jump over it "i think if you are going to have a resort everybody should be treated equally " says sandra jarvis a year old commercial real estate broker from indianapolis who went with her boyfriend to the paradisus riviera cancun last october after she was asked to leave the less crowded royal service pool she had walked into one afternoon ms jarvis went to the front desk to complain and received an explanation of the upper tier perks she returned to the main pool still unsatisfied "we have our own private plane and they are telling me to leave the pool " she says later that day she ripped off her white standard guest bracelet and carried it in her pocket for the rest of the trip her boyfriend lawyer tom bedsole says he didnt book royal service because when he visited the web site he thought the hotel was touting service given to all guests "i didnt realize the royals were a separate class " he says while many acknowledge its a balancing act hotels say they do try to keep everyone happy andre gerondeau an executive vice president for sol melia hotels &amp resorts which owns the paradisus resorts says royal service pool attendants wouldnt ask regular guests to leave unless the pool was full and that royal service areas are more set apart at larger properties guests can upgrade if space is available in late the puntacana resort &amp
