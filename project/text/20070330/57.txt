options sleuths own slip in backdating probes navigant consultings work is close to home navigant consulting inc has been hired by dozens of companies in recent months to sift through corporate records for signs of improper stock options backdating aimed at giving recipients bigger payoffs perhaps the chicago based firms forensic accountants should be inspecting their own companys options a review of its grants reveals six instances between and when option awards were dated at yearly or quarterly lows in its stock price that pattern raises questions about whether some of navigants top officials benefited from the practice the firm now investigates for other public companies a navigant consulting spokesman dismisses the issue as "ancient history " after an internal probe the company in disclosed that about options had been granted at below market prices the company whose stock trades on the new york stock exchange reduced its reported corporate earnings by &# million over three years to account for the extra compensation cost of the bargain priced options "we believe it was fully taken care of and cleaned up in " says navigant spokesman andrew bosman he added that the company lacks specific information about those events because of a complete change in management since then the navigant tale is the latest twist in a scandal that has prompted federal investigations of companies and criminal prosecutions of individuals stock options give employees the right to buy shares at a "strike" price typically set at the market price on the day the option is granted the employee is supposed to profit only if the stock rises backdating the grant date to an earlier date when the price was lower gives the recipient an added potential benefit the backdating scandal has spawned a mini industry of lawyers accountants and forensic sleuths paid to clean up the mess navigant is a player in that business with a stock market value of about &# billion the firm has employees including a former acting chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission and ex partners of big four accounting firms navigants disclosure in a regulatory footnote left some questions unanswered it didnt say whether the options problem was related to backdating explain how it happened identify the tainted grants recipients or say whether senior executives got any a review of options grants from that period shows that top managers received about million that were dated at yearly or quarterly lows quadruple the number of options that the company found at fault in the unusual timing of navigants grants appears to have stopped after a purge of senior management two current outside directors received options priced at the stocks annual or quarterly lows in that period both were on the boards compensation committee at the time of some of the grants one is james r thompson a former governor of illinois and former u s attorney in chicago the other is peter b pond a former investment banker both continue to hold some of the options navigant says "to the best of our knowledge" no grants to directors were faulted in the inquiry gov thompson and mr pond didnt return calls navigants mr bosman said it would be "inappropriate" to comment on their behalf the company says it has been hired to assist internal options backdating investigations at about companies including bed bath &amp beyond inc cnet networks inc vitesse semiconductor corp and quest software inc navigant helped those four companies determine that backdating or misdating explained their unusually fortunate stock option patterns once known as metzler group navigant started selling shares of itself to the public in and has grown through acquisitions its services include conducting internal fraud probes and it has done such work for krispy kreme doughnuts inc auto parts firm visteon corp and for profit education company career education corp revenues last year totaled &# million the backdating controversy is the "biggest single event on the investigative side that weve ever had " says john geron a navigant managing director "the number of companies involved was mind boggling " he said the company now has about backdating related clients including executives fighting civil or criminal legal actions related to questionable options the company also has published a "technical accounting" brief on backdating and sponsored a legal seminar in july titled "what the options backdating controversy means to you " wall street analysts cited navigant as a beneficiary of business generated by the scandal when doing internal options backdating probes for client companies navigant consultants pore over emails and documents and often sit in on employee interviews about accounting related issues mr geron says navigant accountants sometimes help clients explain findings to sec enforcement staffers in the year after going public navigant granted a total of stock options to two officials including then chief executive robert p maher a former ernst &amp young consultant the company said in sec filings that the options were "granted on may at the fair market value" of the stock on that date &# per share that was the stocks lowest closing price for the year it rose in the month afterward mr maher declined to comment saying he had no recollection of events from more than seven years ago mr pond then on the boards compensation committee received options bearing the same favorable may date last month mr pond cashed in those options for a &# profit not long before they were set to expire mr maher also received grants in january that were dated at the yearly low and in october that were dated at the fourth quarter low also receiving grants at that october low were mr pond and mr thompson who by then had joined the compensation committee and four other top executives mr thompson also received options dated at that years third quarter low in navigant granted options to top officials on three occasions two at quarterly lows in march and july in late mr maher resigned under pressure and two other top executives were fired after directors found evidence of what they called "inappropriate" stock transactions unrelated to backdating following mr mahers departure the company convened a special board committee to investigate messrs thompson and pond were two of the special committees three members the probe uncovered some problematic options which the company disclosed in a footnote to an amended filing in may the footnote said that people including five nonemployee relatives of mr maher had received options granted at below market prices navigants mr bosman says the company hasnt specifically told any of its backdating clients about its history of stock options problems because "everything was fully and publicly disclosed back then " the issue he adds has no bearing on the companys ability to investigate backdating because "the professionals working with clients werent with our organization in "
