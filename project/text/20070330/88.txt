tribune suitor zell is used to bucking trends like other real estate swashbucklers sam zell is proud to be a contrarian its just as well to complete his come from behind effort to buy tribune co hell have to be as tribunes special committee gathers today for a lengthy meeting that could decide the future of the company the leading proposal is an aggressively leveraged offer from mr zell who proposes buying the company and transferring control to an employee stock ownership plan an approach rife with tax benefits a last minute wrinkle california businessmen ron burkle and eli broad have come up with a revised offer to beat mr zells &# a share proposal according to someone familiar with their plans the two men sent a letter last night to tribunes board saying they are more than happy to structure a deal using an esop model they value their new deal at &# a share including &# million in cash this person said in exchange for warrants that deliver control of a tribune stake both the zell and burkle broad offers propose that the buyer would become chairman or co chairmen of tribune but time may be running out for the broad burkle team tribunes board is becoming increasingly agitated about the length of the sale process and will be seeking hard commitments from the duo before it extends the process any longer assuming he completes the deal mr zell is going to be charged with reviving the fortunes of a set of particularly beleaguered assets including the los angeles times and the chicago tribune whose value has dropped in recent months as newspaper industry ad revenue has deteriorated sharply mr zell though has encountered such situations before "ive spent my life listening to people explain to me "sam you dont understand " he said in an interview in his chicago office last month on the day shareholders approved the sale of his equity office properties trust to blackstone group for &# billion excluding debt "ive noticed in the last few years that the number of people who say that to me has decreased but nonetheless that has been a constant theme my entire business career ive always gone left when everybody else has gone right i bought an awful lot of real estate when people said "sam you dont understand its never going to come back " mr zell hasnt spoken much publicly about his interest in tribune but he said on that day the same day the news of his interest in the company surfaced in the chicago tribune that an acquisition would be an interesting opportunity "if structured correctly " he seemed unruffled by the idea that the newspaper industry was struggling this is after all the man who is known as "the gravedancer" for his history of taking distressed properties turning them around and selling them at vast profits mr zells pattern fits his background like a lot of other real estate investors hes comfortable buying distressed unfashionable properties often by taking on a substantial debt load and providing relatively little equity compared with other businesses then he spruces up the properties and waits for the market to cycle back but the newspaper industry pounded by internet competition for readers and advertisers has been riven by doubts about whether its problems are not cyclical but permanent in this case mr zell is expected to put in less than &# million of equity a fraction of the companys total value of about &# billion not counting tribunes existing &# billion of debt while details of his offer remain subject to negotiation the structure would involve a few steps according to a person familiar with it in the first step mr zell would invest his equity and receive convertible preferred stock in tribune this person says then tribune using borrowed funds would pay out about &# a share to shareholders in the next step tribune would create an employee share ownership plan tribunes esop could then roll future company contributions to employee k funds into the esop effectively providing capital for the buyout without increasing tribunes debt at the end of tribunes retirement savings plans included at least &# billion of which &# million or was already invested in company stock mr zells strategy for tribune isnt known although he has said he doesnt plan to break up the company whose assets include a string of tv stations and the chicago cubs baseball team as well as the newspapers whats clear say real estate experts is that he isnt making a play for the real estate assets held by tribune including the buildings that house the tribune and los angeles times newsrooms the value of tribunes properties estimated at less than &# million simply isnt big enough to justify being the driver of the deal they say even the tribune tower a neo gothic beauty near the chicago river and the los angeles times building which boasts mosaic floors and foot high murals wouldnt translate into enough money even at a time of record sales prices to validate buying the company these experts say "i dont think hes buying it for the real estate i suspect he wants to change and get into something else " says zaya younan chief executive of younan properties an investor in chicago real estate in any case mr zell isnt as much of a real estate investor as many believe even before he sold his interest in equity office real estate represented only about of his total personal holdings through the years his investments have included companies that made rail cars mattresses containers and dredging equipment but some of these forays have tripped him up one of the few investment mistakes mr zell is known to have made was to buy schwinn bicycle co another venerable chicago company with a strong brand name hurt by a flood of asian imports and a heavy debt load schwinn was in bankruptcy proceedings in when mr zell acquired it through his vulture zell climark fund l p he immediately set about trying to revive the company with a marketing campaign emphasizing that schwinn was being fixed that was a mistake according to richard schwinn former vice president of manufacturing and engineering for the company and now an owner of waterford precision cycles mr zell should have spent much less time focusing on the companys image and more time understanding the economic problems facing the industry mr schwinn says "i think zell had the impression this was easy pickings he may not have been aware of the structural problems facing the industry " still an old friend of mr zells neil bluhm founder of the chicago based private equity real estate investment firm walton street capital says that even though he hasnt talked to mr zell about his bid for tribune hes sure mr zell understands the depth of the problems facing the newspaper business "hes a very bright guy " says mr bluhm "i can remember when people were saying that shopping malls were going to be devastated by the internet " mr bluhm says that one hallmark of mr zells personality beyond the flash of the motorcycles he rides and the lavish parties he throws is that hes a man of his word thus mr bluhm says if mr zell says publicly that he doesnt intend to bust up tribune co and sell it off in pieces he surely means it "of course " mr bluhm adds "he could always change his mind " theo francis contributed to this article
