accountability act congress leaves for easter recess today with democrats congratulating themselves for having endorsed by the narrowest of margins "a deadline" for withdrawal from iraq the press corps is also praising their "cohesion " wonderful now that moveon org is happy maybe congress will finally fund the troops democrats are calling this in short form the "iraq accountability act " but the key word in that construction is the last one this is all an act this week the senate joined the house in passing a "deadline" for iraq withdrawal that members know has no chance of becoming law president bush has promised a veto and the eye lash victories in both houses show that his veto will be sustained with ease senate minority leader mitch mcconnell could have filibustered the senate version but he chose to let the majority proceed in order to speed along the inevitable so the troops wont have to wait even longer to get their money democrats offered their deadline language which passed when republican chuck hagel of nebraska shifted his vote to endorse what senator john mccain rightly called an enforced "surrender" date once upon a time mr hagel voted for the war but now hes against it at least until he changes his mind again such conviction is sure to impress voters if he ever makes up his mind about running for president mr bush has been warning about his veto for weeks but democrats have moved ahead anyway because the vote is really about political theater democrats need to appease their antiwar base and the "benchmarks" and "deadline" lingo is the minimum that moveon org and friends would accept none of this is real "accountability " however because democrats lack the nerve to truly stop the war by defunding it having criticized the bill at first moveon org and the antiwar caucus turned around and endorsed this theatrical fallback once they realized they lacked the votes to stop the war this vote allows democrats to claim they opposed general david petraeuss plan to stabilize baghdad even as they let him fight the troops must be pleased with that indulgence if the plan fails as democrats expect mr bush will get the blame if it succeeds well they figure no one will remember their pessimism a year from now either way "accountability" is the last word to use for this exercise meanwhile the troops on the line are waiting for their money and theyll have to wait a while longer when they return from their holiday house and senate leaders will have to "reconcile" their bills which could take more weeks because the bills are packed with some &# billion in pork as well as differing versions of a minimum wage increase the members will be fiddling over their domestic priorities rather than financing the war then they can finally present their "message" to the white house for mr bush to veto at which point theyll get to start all over the spectacle qualifies as a textbook example of why congress cant be trusted to micromanage much less lead a war its a committee of lilliputians whose main contribution is to tie down the president so that his policy fails few bills deserve a veto as much as this one and once mr bush dispatches it we hope congress will fulfill the one war power it does have which is to appropriate enough money so our troops can accomplish their mission
