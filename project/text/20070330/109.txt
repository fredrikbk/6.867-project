weekend journal the wealth report billionaires gift stirs distrust some hawaiians see bid to undermine home prices a weird reality show in hawaiis exclusive neighborhood of kahala wealthy residents generally keep to themselves inside gated estates and beachfront mansions but last week they couldnt help but notice their newest neighbors a group of homeless hawaiian families in one unusual experiment between rich and poor a reclusive japanese billionaire has handed the keys to three of his multimillion dollar houses to needy hawaiian families the billionaire genshiro kawamoto told the local press that he hoped the gift would offer hope and opportunity to families who had little of either he also said his experiment would encourage kahalas rich to reach out to homeless families and give them jobs and assistance the families were chosen from more than people who wrote to mr kawamoto hoping to be chosen for the houses which he purchased during the past two years they will pay no rent and be responsible only for maintenance mr kawamoto who retains ownership of the houses has said he may offer eight or nine homes in total to homeless families in coming months "they will be living in heaven now " mr kawamoto said as he handed over the keys to a &# million five bedroom mansion to a homeless family last week "affluent people can help the least affluent people " yet while many hawaiians are celebrating mr kawamotos gift others are dubious mr kawamoto has spent an estimated &# million to buy more than houses in kahala a hushed honolulu neighborhood of tudor beach mansions and rolling estates thats considered the beverly hills of hawaii mr kawamoto hasnt said what he plans to do with the properties other than provide the homes for the homeless and perhaps open a museum or two for his art collection but some worry that the eccentric real estate magnate better known for evicting low income tenants than offering them free rent may be using the homeless to drive down property values they say mr kawamoto an avid land speculator plans to buy more kahala houses at a discount so he can later sell them for a bigger profit "he may be trying to knock down prices so he can pick up land more cheaply " says richard turbin an attorney who lives in kahala "im sure the homeless families are lovely people but this is a recipe for disaster " at the very least its a recipe for a culture clash between those at the top and bottom of hawaiis extreme wealth gap in his statements mr kawamoto said he hopes the families will bring a more "local" feel to the neighborhood which is dominated by vacation homes for out of towners mr kawamoto says he wants more singing dancing parties and "polynesian flair " hes calling his new homeless settlement the kahala ave mission "its going to be my extended family " the media shy mr kawamoto told reporters he declined to answer questions emailed to his attorney kahala residents dont know quite what to make of their new neighbors some have started driving or walking past the homes to gawk at the new families who are often out playing in the yards others are commenting on the homes swimming pools which mr kawamoto had filled in with rocks to lower the maintenance costs on an island where gardeners can cost &# an hour and plumbers charge &# just to show up some locals wonder how the poor families will be able to foot the remaining maintenance bills "putting these families in kahala is like a weird reality show " says joanne lundstrom chief executive of mental health kokua which provides services to the homeless "it will be interesting to see what happens when these kids start going to school with the kahala kids " some of the wealthy arent waiting to find out carl smigielski a kahala real estate agent says one of his clients pulled out of a deal to buy a &# million house in kahala after he heard about mr kawamotos plans other real estate agents and some homeless advocates say that if mr kawamoto truly wanted to address hawaiis growing homeless problem he would sell the kahala homes and build low cost houses in the islands less affluent areas with the proceeds with hawaiian real estate now among the worlds most expensive low income residents are increasingly forced to live in tent communities at beaches and parks "if he invested say &# million in structures that werent so high end you could accommodate more people " ms lundstrom says one reason locals are so skeptical is mr kawamotos past mr kawamoto the son of a kimono maker who once owned more than nightclubs and bars in tokyo became the poster child for japanese land grabbers in hawaii during the late s he was famous for trolling the streets in his "kawamotomobile" limousine to buy properties on the spot for cash he scooped up more than homes in oahu which later fell into disrepair and became a blight mr kawamoto said it was the job of his property managers to maintain the houses but the managers say he refused to authorize necessary repairs he sold many of the houses in mr kawamoto also bought more than homes in northern california in the late s yet in he notified hundreds of his tenants that they were being evicted and had days to leave the move sparked such an outcry that the state passed legislation forcing landlords to give tenants at least days notice before an eviction but for now theres little the kahala residents can do to oppose his homeless plan "we can only make sure he follows all the health and building codes " says mr turbin the attorney "theres no law that says you cant rent your homes to homeless people "
