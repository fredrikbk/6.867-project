iran escalates president reagan once famously quipped that his strategy in confronting the soviet union was "we win they lose " today we need a similarly clear strategy to confront iran if we are to successfully counter its aim to drive the u s from the middle east and as we see with the british sailors the iranians have taken hostage attempts to intimidate western powers into inaction that strategy begins not with the kabuki dance now underway at the united nations turtle bay is usually and seems destined to be again in this case a diplomatic sideshow meant more to distract us than to disarm a rogue regime while we dither the iranians will acquire nuclear weapons give support to our enemies in iraq and undermine our credibility with our european allies we need to demonstrate now that there are viable military options in dealing with a rogue regime in tehran and that not all of those options will leave us embroiled in a shooting war with yet another large sprawling nation in the middle east i believe that our options for dealing with iran are more numerous and could be more productive than many washington policy makers have heretofore argued let us remember that iran is a very diverse nation whose population is only persian the rest is azari kurdish and a mix of other ethnic minorities including turkman arab and others this is a rich environment for unrest and one reason why there were an estimated protest demonstrations in alone in recent weeks we may have benefited from another form of protest former iranian deputy defense minister ali reza asgari appears to have used a trip to turkey to defect with his family if he is now talking to western intelligence officials well soon know a lot more about the inner workings of the iranian regime and the middle east itself is no monolithic bloc of support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad israel of course is a natural ally in gaining intelligence and lining up support against the iranian regime but iran is bent on destabilizing and dominating the arabian peninsula from lebanon through gaza into iraq with a stopover in bahrain that makes saudi arabia as well as jordan potentially strong if not overt allies in countering iranian influence the situation has gotten so serious that king abdullah of jordan called it a shia crescent sweeping across the arabian peninsula and king abdullah of saudi arabia summoned vice president cheney to riyadh last fall if we demonstrate that we are sufficiently serious in countering iran we could form a coalition of the willing with saudi arabia jordan egypt the gulf states turkey australia and those european allies with the courage to consider what their future will look like with a nuclear armed iran within missile range no more denial or hoping iran will negotiate their nuclear weapons development away the criteria for joining this coalition would be to join in making the following demands of iran stop developing fissile material submit to unambiguous international atomic energy agency inspections turn over all al qaeda operatives within your borders and stop supporting hezbollah the hard part of course of forming any meaningful coalition is the consequences of noncompliance and this case is no different the obvious punishment for a defiant iran could be an air strike that aims to destroy its nuclear development facilities and overt support for iranians working to overthrow their government this is where the discussion of taking stringent actions against iran usually breaks down few people believe saudi arabia and other middle eastern nations would join a coalition that carried out a military strike and there is little reason to believe many european nations would either this is where president reagan in confronting the soviets is instructive the gipper was elected in at a time when it appeared inevitable that the soviet union would dominate world affairs and just as inevitably that the u s was unable to do anything about it short of waging a bloody military campaign that would have few allies in fighting and not every chance of success in the end as they say reagan won the cold war without firing a shot we have similar options now one of which is to enact drastic economic sanctions that oddly would involve forcing a gasoline crisis in iran tehran is kept afloat on oil revenues but it has done so at the expense of its oil industry while it exports large quantities of crude oil iran imports of its domestically consumed gasoline and each gallon at the pump is heavily subsidized shutting off or even restricting the supply of gasoline flowing into the country would put the regime in a crunch and drive up public discontent without creating a corresponding humanitarian crisis we could also apply minimal military pressure without straining our relations with our allies to date iran is responsible for killing more than american soldiers and wounding over through the introduction of what the u s military calls explosively formed penetrators these efps are shaped charges specifically designed to pierce the hulls of our armored vehicles and are much deadlier than what al qaeda and run of the mill insurgents could have come up with on their own in iraq enough is enough we could develop a tit for tat strategy for each efp that is detonated in iraq that could target nuclear support facilities or iranian leadership or other targets calculated to put heat on the regime without endangering civilians many of these responses may be written off as mere happenstance or accidents in a dangerous part of the world but even as iran becomes the unluckiest country in the world our allies in the region could hardly blame us for a calculated response the u s can also assemble a large scale force capable of an air offensive this would serve a similar role to reagans military buildup forcing the soviets into an arms race that they ultimately couldnt maintain the immediate strike force could be composed of some stealth attack aircraft bs fs and the fs and some nonstealth fs fs bs bs and three carrier battle groups these carrier battle groups are composed of over fs and cruise missiles galore we also have over uavs for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in iraq today there is more than enough to support a campaign aimed at demonstrating to the iranian regime that with hours we could hit its nuclear development facilities command and control facilities integrated air defenses air force and navy units and the shahab missiles using over aim points back in washington congress also needs to exercise its responsibility and fund missile defenses bunker busters and other technologies specifically designed to counter the iranian regime tehran has the world scrambling to respond as it sets about assembling a nuclear weapon that may be more advanced than fat man and little boy but which is still far less technologically advanced than the weapons systems we trust somethings to operate every day in our military forcing iran to expend its resources to keep pace with our technological advances is central to any strategy of defeating them we dont need to drop leaflets from the air spelling it out for the regime in tehran that if we were to carry out an air campaign it would probably unleash a new iranian revolution but the leadership in iran has to first come to understand that we neither fear a hezbollah uprising over such a strike as hezbollah is already carrying out terrorist attacks wed welcome an open fight on our terms nor would we need the main line coalition ground forces we used in iraq instead we could simply use the afghan model of precision airpower supporting covert and indigenous forces were the united states of america we dont threaten any nation what iran must come to realize and we must now decide for ourselves is that we are in this confrontation to win it lt gen mcinerny is retired assistant vice chief of staff of
