law firms work on tax shelters leads to demise litigation penalty fell jenkens &amp gilchrist an orderly transition a dallas law firm that once numbered attorneys is closing its doors after reaching a settlement with prosecutors over its sale promotion and blessing of improper tax shelters jenkens &amp gilchrist a nationwide firm that counted banks energy tycoons and media companies among its clients buckled under the combined weight of former clients lawsuits and a protracted debilitating fight with the government jenkens said it would shut down by the end of the month and pay the internal revenue service &# million it is avoiding prosecution as part of an agreement with the u s attorney for the southern district of new york it is rare for a law firm especially one of jenkenss stature to find itself in such circumstances but in the end the huge hit to its reputation and bottom line from the settlements and penalties that followed a key legal defeat and the ensuing exodus of partners and clients spelled the firms end "what happened here is the aggressive development and marketing of abusive shelters it had a corrupting influence on the practice of the law " said irs commissioner mark w everson for that he added jenkens "paid the price " the firms trouble began in the late s and grew when it added a group of chicago tax lawyers as competition spurred the firm to try to expand and diversify its practice at the same time an army of newly minted dot com millionaires were looking to shield some of their windfall from taxes many lawyers and accountants sensed an opportunity and began churning out tax shelters designed to be mass marketed jenkens dived wholeheartedly into the lucrative area where fees based on the amount of tax savings involved could range as high as &# million the shelters it promoted along with similar ones sold by other law and accounting firms involved transactions that seemed to generate paper losses that could then be used to offset taxable income jenkens primarily helped to structure along with banks and accounting firms shelters that acted as investment vehicles and provided letters asserting a shelter was more likely than not to withstand irs scrutiny improper shelters sold by jenkens and other law firms accounting firms investment banks and others allegedly deprived the government of more than &# billion of tax revenue the firms strategy soured after the irs and then the justice department began to clamp down on shelter sales earlier this decade the government argued that the products cloaked as investment vehicles were designed purely to evade tax and lacked any sort of economic purpose a court battle ensued and "the firm fought the irs tooth and nail in terms of complying with legitimate document requests " mr everson said the firm refused to comply with irs summonses when the agency was looking into what it believed were different kinds of abusive shelters set up and promoted by jenkens since at least the beginning of according to court documents jenkens claimed much of the material being sought was protected by attorney client privilege the justice department ultimately won the point dealing a huge blow to the firm and to other tax shelter purveyors hoping to similarly shield their activities the loss was devastating to jenkenss defense against government actions and civil suits indeed one reason law firms have largely sidestepped the major damage suffered by some big corporate clients is the nature of the attorneys work "a good part of what lawyers do for clients is out of sight " said stephen gillers a legal ethics professor at new york university school of law "documents are kept confidential so the public and therefore regulators and prosecutors have a hard time discovering potential wrongdoing by lawyers " jenkenss meltdown is all the more startling because accounting firm kpmg llp a major player in developing and promoting tax shelters later challenged by the government managed to avoid a similar fate kpmg narrowly dodged criminal indictment in when it admitted wrongdoing in connection with its shelter sales entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid a &# million penalty like jenkens kpmg had fought irs demands to turn over shelter related documents and lost a deferred criminal charge against kpmg as part of its agreement with the government was dismissed by a federal judge in january "the centerpiece of all the corporate tax shelter efforts was to disabuse attorneys of the idea that when developing and marketing tax shelter products that this was subject to the traditional attorney client privilege " mr everson said yesterday "that in and of itself was a significant development that the government stepped in and the justice department supported the irs in confronting those privilege claims " founded in jenkens began as the in house counsel to the murchison family which made its fortune in oil clint murchison jr co founded the dallas cowboys jenkenss co founding partner henry gilchrist still practices at the firm which had revenue of &# million in fiscal down from the previous year according to american lawyer magazine average profits per partner were &# by the firm had grown to lawyers in nine offices and its clients included the dallas morning news and compusa but the irss victory in the privilege fight helped set the stage for jenkenss downfall once the agency won access to the firms records it was able to identify more than wealthy individuals who had used the shelters and then to seek back taxes interest and penalties from them many of these people sued the law firm creating a huge financial strain and giving jenkens attorneys reason to head for the doors the claims were settled for about &# million still the departure in of lawyers from its new york office to troutman sanders was a major blow the firm realized last summer that it needed to evaluate its future rather than try to rebuild jenkenss leadership decided the best course would be to dismantle "we ultimately determined that facilitating an orderly transition served our lawyers and clients best " said spokesman eric fletcher by last month jenkens was down to about attorneys and had experienced a sharp decline in revenue the departures have come fast and furious in recent weeks lawyers left the san antonio office to join jackson &amp walker llp four partners left the houston office to join porter &amp hedges llp some lawyers in los angeles joined the l a office of baker &amp hostetler llp and in chicago a group of lawyers left to start a chicago office for nixon peabody llp nicholas simms a former jenkens partner who left last month for porter &amp hedges says jenkenss houston office will likely close today there is a reunion party planned there for alumni "its sad that what happens with a small group of lawyers in one office of a firm can affect offices around the country " he said for its part the firm was contrite about its actions "the chicago tax shelter practice seriously undermined this firms longstanding reputation revenues and stability " it said in a statement "we deeply regret our involvement in this tax practice and the serious harm it caused to the united states treasury " it also has been supportive of its lawyers moves "for several months we have been working closely with our los angeles office as we have jointly explored strategic options for the firm as a result of these efforts jenkens &amp gilchrists los angeles office will be moving their practice to baker hostetler effective march " jenkens said in a recent statement many of the remaining dallas lawyers are expected to end up at hunton &amp williams llp though that firm declined to confirm any hires it is unclear how much liability individual partners jenkens calls them "shareholders" could bear for the &# million penalty harry joe a former jenkens lawyer who this month joined winstead pc in dallas says the firm has set aside money to pay it he wouldnt elaborate on what that meant for individual partners neither the firm nor the government would comment generally speaking in situations where law firms face judgments how financial penalties are paid depends partly on what insurance covers insurance may not pay when acts of wrongdoing are involved also the government sometimes doesnt agree to let a firm use insurance to fund penalties which was the case with kpmg innocent individual partners often dont face personal liability rather the assets of the firm are at stake which can include for example accounts receivable according to attorneys who defend and advise law firms peter lattman and ashby jones contributed to this article
