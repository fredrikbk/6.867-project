weekend journal taste de gustibus rankings rancor who controls the information michael crow president of arizona state university in tempe may get &# tacked on to his salary this year if he can manage to improve his schools ranking in the u s news &amp world report annual college survey talk about pay for performance according to phoenixs east valley tribune which reported the story last week mr crow will be charged with pulling the school from the third tier into the second mr crow apparently supported this unique bonus clause but a few of the schools board members were skeptical "its an image thing that personally im not that enamored with " the asu board president robert bulla told the tribune hes not the only one its hard to throw a library book these days without hitting someone who has a complaint about the supposedly pernicious influence of the u s news survey on the college admissions process and the education of americas youth for the surveys detractors asus incentive clause is just a brazen example of the rankings corrupting effect parents of students at elite high schools blame u s news for the high stress levels of their children who strive for the highest rated colleges guidance counselors blame the magazine for the cutthroat competition at their schools college administrators blame u s news for forcing them to focus too much on applicants test scores discouraging racial diversity on campus and causing them to waste a lot of energy on efforts to beat the system these administrators have long held a trump card however now some of them are trying to play it a dozen college presidents are reportedly circulating a letter that would announce their decision not to provide u s news with the data on their institutions thus denying the magazine the chance to rank their institutions will this plan work in a recent washington post op ed michel tolela myers the president of sarah lawrence college described a conversation she had with the director of data research at u s news when her school decided not to submit its incoming class sat scores because the school was not requiring applicants to take the test according to ms myers the research director told her that "absent students sat scores the magazine will calculate the colleges ranking by assuming an arbitrary average sat score of one standard deviation roughly points below the average score of our peer group " in other words ms myers wrote "in the absence of real data they will make up a number " u s news didnt exactly deny this fairly shocking claim a spokesman merely said that the editors hadnt decided which approach they would take if sarah lawrence withheld its scores if the magazine wants to sabotage the status of its survey it should by all means punish recalcitrant schools by using imaginary data but why do things have to get so nasty in the first place is it just possible that the u s news rankings are not so evil it is more than possible but the survey does have some obvious problems first colleges do devote too much energy to manipulating their ranking number economist susan lee compares the u s news survey to the forbes noting that some wealthy folks deploy their assets in certain ways to get on the forbes list this paper reported recently on colleges requesting that seniors spread out their senior gift over the five years following graduation so that the schools can report a higher percentage of alumni giving second of a colleges rank is determined by what other presidents provosts and deans think of a particular school obviously parents are concerned about a schools reputation but just because an administrator at okefenokee state is impressed that an institution has stolen stanley fish or cornered cornell west doesnt mean that your childs education will be affected in the least third the u s news rankings may not tell you much the top or so schools were tops before u s news came around and as george mason economics professor tyler cowen explains mid level schools are competing to move up a couple of rungs on the ladder but "there is really no difference at all between a school ranked and one ranked " and dont expect to see much change from one year to the next mr cowen notes that the rankings are stable over time since a schools reputation which counts for so much is unlikely to shift suddenly last the rankings emphasize output rather than input a few parents might wonder not just which colleges graduates command good salaries but whether johnny learned anything in four years the collegiate learning assessment cla developed by a subsidiary of the rand corp assesses the writing skills of students when they are freshmen and again when they are seniors to see if they are any better able to analyze and critique arguments after college than before ben wildavsky used to edit the u s news survey and now works for the missouri based kauffman foundation which supports the cla he says that he would be "more sympathetic to the dissenting college presidents if they were clamoring to come up with better measures of student achievement to participate in the cla for instance and make their results public " perhaps that is the heart of the matter the fight between the college presidents and u s news is a fight over information if the magazine has done nothing else over the past years it has forced colleges to be more transparent about their application process their finances and the ways by which the academy judges itself it has helped would be college students and parents sort through the thousands of options that american higher education has to offer what is needed are more such rankings we already have college guides from national review and the washington monthly they judge colleges according to a particular cultural outlook a useful thing to do but it is the supposedly "scientific" nature of the u s news rankings that give them such prominence another publication might assign the same data different weights arriving at different results nothing could be more welcome for students parents and even balky college presidents ms riley is the journals deputy taste
