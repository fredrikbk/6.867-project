weekend journal review film a for hilarity ferrell scores in blades of glory ice skating sendup is seriously ludicrous a successful wedding if success has many parents so does procrastination when i sit staring at my computer screen instead of writing a review its usually because the movie is bad and id rather not deal with it but in the case of "blades of glory " with will ferrell and jon heder as champion figure skaters its because i keep switching to the web site to savor the clips and trailer once youve seen the movie which is blissfully silly triumphantly tasteless and improbably hilarious its nice to reconnect with a few choice moments everything flows from the sly audacity of the premise rival champions who join forces to become the first male male pair in figure skating history mr ferrells chazz michael michaels is as frowzily macho as mr heders jimmy macelroy is ethereally fey and though the plot twists that unite them are ingenious the genius of the production directed by will speck and josh gordon lies in its performers who play their ludicrous roles with fervent seriousness theres no way of knowing who did what with the script which is credited to five writers craig cox jeff cox busy philipps john altschuler and dave krinsky will ferrell wins the w c fields prize for dissoluteness whether chazz is off skates moving like a tree stump and dominating a therapy group for sex addicts or on the ice where he raises crotch jokes to new heights and thanks to the wonders of computer generated effects does spectacular leaps and glides with his mismatched partner remarkably mr ferrell has scored two consecutive comic coups chazz is right up there with ricky bobby in "talladega nights " but something of the same goes for jon heder who could have guessed that the winsome nerd of "napoleon dynamite" would morph into the bespangled ice queen of "blades of glory" to borrow one of chazzs malapropisms the whole thing is mind bottling and belly bobbling after the wedding what makes a movie big or small by any conventional measure "after the wedding" is a small import from denmark shot on a modest budget with a small cast in an intimate style yet this drama which won a richly deserved oscar nomination earlier this year spans two continents to tell a story of huge impact and all but bursts with outsize passions the story starts in bombay where jacob mads mikkelsen the danish director of an impoverished orphanage learns of a providential donation from an industrialist in denmark the only catch is that jacob must fly home to meet the benefactor jorgen face to face jorgen is played brilliantly by rolf lassgard once the two men have met the host invites his guest to his daughters wedding and jacobs past suddenly becomes his shocking present if that sounds like a dramatic cliche rest assured that nothing in this film feels familiar or predictable nor does the drama need to draw us in its the special magic of the director susanne bier who wrote the script with anders thomas jensen that were in the midst of things from the very beginning and like the films characters taking our cues from fleeting glances and odd gestures or facing great explosions of rage grief and love jorgens wife is played by sidse babett knudsen who manages to make self containment seem explosive with her two previous pictures "open hearts" and "brothers " ms bier established herself as an exceptional international filmmaker her new one is a thrilling and harrowing and beautiful celebration of the unpredictability of life and unexpectedly it gives us the chance to see mads mikkelsen who recently played le chiffre the heavy in "casino royale " turn his dark star power into a dramatic presence le chiffre merely wept blood jacob is flesh and blood in a film of rare humanity the lookout scott frank did the screen adaptation for one of my favorite movies of the past decade "out of sight " so i kept a lookout for "the lookout " his directorial debut with some apprehension as well as anticipation when someone you admire takes a shot at something new theres always a chance of failure not to worry though mr franks fine script an original this time got the strong director it deserved this first feature plays like the work of a practiced hand full of energy and memorable menace memory or the lack of it is at the storys center a head injury has left the young hero chris pratt joseph gordon levitt impaired in maddening ways like leonard in "memento " chris who works as a night janitor at a bank has such fleeting short term memory that he can manage his life only by making entries on an endless to do list but the resemblances to christopher nolans virtuoso puzzle picture are outweighed by the differences for "the lookout" is a straight ahead drama perfectly accessible though psychologically intricate coupled shrewdly to a crime thriller in a small kansas town where everyone knows him chris is seduced by gary spargo a local thug into serving as a lookout for a ruthless crew of bank robbers gary is played by matthew goode hes a marvelously scary study in sociopathy jeff daniels is less flashy but no less forceful as chriss mentor lewis a blind man who speaks wisely if too loudly and joseph gordon levitts chris isnt flashy at all to the contrary this painfully vulnerable often befuddled young man seems to be thinking his way through every moment of every hour as he struggles to sort out right and wrong and solve the mysteries of his fragile identity we saw what mr gordon levitt could do in such diverse films as "mysterious skin" and "brick " and in the tv sitcom "rd rock from the sun " but this performance is something else its unforgettable meet the robinsons "meet the robinsons" is preceded by its reputation an animated feature from disney that was reshaped and recut under the supervision of john lasseter a legendary founder of pixar animation studios after the walt disney company acquired pixar last year and whats the result a d fantasy thats lovely to look at but less than delightful to know its insistently relentlessly busy inspector gadget as an orphaned boy genius named lewis who builds a time machine and finds the family of his dreams in a necco colored future that looks suspiciously like a theme park thats harsh im sure kids will know nothing of the films reputation and their little eyes will pop behind their big polaroid glasses some of the spectacle is charming the villain an edwardian figure called the bowler guy goes through all sorts of amusing contortions and little lewis comes happily to terms with his life in a semi touching climax but oh the semi coherence at best of his family encounter and the desperate clutter of the disjointed narrative when an orchestra of frogs did a brief rendition of "give me the simple life " they were playing my song the prisoner "the prisoner or how i planned to kill tony blair" is the very long title of a very short and troubling documentary by michael tucker and petra epperlein theyre the director and producer respectively who made the "gunner palace " a free form doc with a hip hop soul about american soldiers in wartime baghdad during the course of that film mr tucker shot a scene in which our troops stormed a house that was thought to be a sanctuary for bomb makers planning to kill the british prime minister the new film is essentially an extended interview with yuris one of the men arrested in the raid whats troubling about the films technique is its lack of context we must take yuris who speaks serviceable english pretty much at his word whats troubling about his story is its ring of truth yuris seems to have been an innocent a freelance cameraman with no political agenda caught up in a blundering search based on bad intelligence and connected to tony blair only by the surreal assumptions of his captors after spending nine months in abu ghraib prison or so he claims he was sent home by an american general who simply said "were sorry " yuris makes an eloquent case for himself "i am not a terrorist " he says "i am not a monster i am civilian people and i am journalist i have a heart you see i am not dracula " dvd tip will ferrell was mugatu a sinister fashion designer in "zoolander" the fatuous fashion icon of the title was played by the films director ben stiller by no coincidence mr stiller and his producing partner stuart cornfeld were producers of "blades of glory "
