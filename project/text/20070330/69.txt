private practice is u s government outsourcing its brain boom in tech contracts sparks complex debate a mecca in virginia tysons corner va the moment visitors arrive in the lobby of the campuslike headquarters of mitre corp theyre asked do you have a national security clearance if the answer is yes mitres receptionists tap a few computer keys to verify if its no the visitor gets a special badge and a constant escort its the sort of scrutiny one might expect at the defense department or a u s intelligence agency mitre is one step from that a private company with one major client the u s government mitre does high tech engineering and other computer work for the pentagon various intelligence agencies and the department of homeland security and business is booming "there is no doubt that post there is more growth than we have experienced historically " says chief executive alfred grasso in mitre a nonprofit that runs three federally funded research and development groups says revenues topped &# billion for the first time since the terrorist attacks and wars in afghanistan and iraq the federal governments demand for complex technology has soared but washington often doesnt have the expertise to take on new high tech projects or the staff to oversee them as a result officials are increasingly turning to contractors in particular the hundreds of companies in tysons corner and the surrounding fairfax county that operate some of the governments most sensitive and important undertakings the risk of this approach in the words of warren suss a jenkintown pa consultant and expert on federal computer outsourcing is that the government could wind up "outsourcing its brain " the number of private federal contractors has soared to million four times bigger than the federal civilian work force itself according to paul light of new york university congress meanwhile is learning how hard it is to keep tabs on these activities as a mecca for this sort of work tysons corner has emerged as outsourcing central once known mostly for its shopping malls its now a land of glass towers manicured office parks and tiffany boutiques where private sector budget analysts project managers and highly paid executives do the work that clock punching civil servants in downtown d c miles to the west cant do the government still buys pencils and office furniture but now relies on others for sophisticated technology work especially whats known as "systems integration" pulling together complex information networks for the military homeland security personnel and others "our ignorance is their gain " says richard skinner inspector general at the department of homeland security projects currently under way range from the design of next generation military computer networks to the oversight of a &# billion electronic "fence" being built along the mexican border outsourcing originally sprang from concerns about overspending and mismanagement by the government itself starting in the s agencies realized it was cheaper to buy certain services directly from companies in the s teaming up with the private sector became a popular idea in part as a way to reduce the number of federal employees on the books today the potential pitfalls are legion big contracts are notorious for cost overruns and designs that dont work much of which takes place under loose or ineffective government scrutiny underlying this tension is the fundamental question of whether one system is better than the other democratic rep henry waxman of california new chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee has castigated the department of homeland security for lax oversight of the coast guards &# billion fleet modernization which is being run by two defense giants he has also faulted its management of the "fence" project formally called the secure border initiative complaining that of the people overseeing the border project are contractors outsourcing details to private contractors "can be a prescription for enormous fraud waste and abuse " rep waxman said during a february hearing on the issue mr skinner the homeland security inspector general says his investigation into the coast guard project known as integrated deepwater system found inadequate management and oversight resulting in delays cost increases and design flaws deepwater awarded in is a year program aimed at upgrading the coast guards boats aircraft and communications systems the contract was awarded to a joint venture of lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp unlike standard contractors they were given a bigger role overseeing the projects many different strands mr skinner says his office found that the top decision makers were contractors not civil servants the coast guard was relegated to the role of "adviser" on technical matters and was essentially shut out of decisions on subcontracts partly as a result he says the cost of the first two large armed boats called cutters is expected to be well beyond the &# million original estimate during congressional hearings on the matter a lockheed martin executive defended the program the performance "has been closely supervised by the coast guard" with additional oversight by homeland security congress and the government accountability office he said the coast guard recently stripped some management work from the northrop lockheed venture saying it could acquire smaller cutters faster and at lower cost mr skinner says homeland security is also trying to exert more oversight over its "fence" project one problem is that the department with procurement officers constantly battles turnover he says the department is lucky if it can keep procurement personnel for three years before they bolt to places such as tysons corner once a sleepy crossroads the area has boomed in part because of its location halfway between downtown washington and dulles international airport straddling the beltway that rings the capital the tysons area and surrounding fairfax county have enjoyed the boom in federal procurement in the post era with &# billion of work performed in the area in up from about &# billion in to economists such as stephen fuller of nearby george mason university tysons is a natural anchor for outsourcing close to the "honey " of the federal government and attractive to young engineers and entrepreneurs one flashpoint today is whether contractors hire other contractors without enough controls or competition in march rep waxman introduced a bill that would put limits on contracts awarded without competitive bidding it passed the house by a wide margin and is raising fears among contractors that it could dent their growth federal procurement is already expected to slow because of budget constraints and the slowing of the post spending boom rep waxmans staff in a feb memo said that "at least one contractor hired to engage in contract oversight on the border project booz allen hamilton may have a conflict of interest with boeing co " the prime contractor booz allen has done consulting work for boeing and has been a member of the boeing team on other contracts ralph shrader chief executive at booz allen flatly denies the charge "i take the greatest exception to the idea of conflict of interest " dr shrader says adding that booz allen is doing "support" and "coordination" work on behalf of the government and doesnt "oversee" boeing he adds that booz allen has for decades taken pains to avoid conflicts of interest and has a rigorous process to avoid such conflicts dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal has hired booz allen to help the company with its news strategy booz allen epitomizes the successful well connected tysons consultant contractor on a giant scale once mostly a management consultant to corporations based in new york city booz allens government business now accounts for more than of its &# billion in revenue in it moved its headquarters to tysons corner the firms past three ceos have come from the government side of the firm dr shrader with a ph d in engineering and ceo since had experience on the commercial side early in his career since booz allens revenue has doubled in size it plans to hire people in alone adding to an existing work force of people booz allen has extensive government contracts totaling more than &# billion a year with the pentagon intelligence services and various civilian agencies including the department of homeland security it employs numerous retired military officers and former intelligence agency chiefs retired navy admiral j michael mcconnell former head of the national security agency was a &# million a year booz allen executive until president bush named him director of national intelligence in late james woolsey former head of the central intelligence agency is another rainmaker booz allen does so much business with the department of defense that it conducts brown bag lunches for young civilian recruits dubbed "dod " where it explains among other things the difference between the insignia of a captain and a general ex military types attend a "forum" to learn the commercial ropes as well as ways of working in less hierarchical environments the company argues that it can mobilize staff more quickly and cheaply than the government as one example booz allen cites its work on the pentagons communications network which was damaged in the attack booz allen says it put together a special "surge" team to design what it calls "survivable telecom system " it turned the plans over to the pentagon in just six weeks among its more controversial projects was total information awareness a defense department plan for a grand database to thwart terrorists it was conceived shortly after the terrorist attacks and soon came under criticism from members of congress and others as a privacy invasion before being scrapped "i really have no problems with the decisions we have made " says dr shrader who adds without being specific that "there are things we have chosen not to do " booz allen has filled up its headquarters which is technically located in mclean va county zoning rules wont let the company add more people beyond its current so booz allen has set up another campus near dulles airport which housed people as of february fueling the growth at booz allen and other big firms is a move toward giant complex projects awarded by uncle sam but pulled together by whats called a "lead systems integrator " big contractors have become even more powerful in the post era some say because the government has turned conservative preferring to award contracts on critical national security projects to proven players especially as knowledgeable civil servants retire the u s government "is losing their system engineering program management acquisition expertise " said kenneth dahlberg ceo of science applications international corp of san diego at a recent wall street investor conference he vowed that his company one of the biggest federal contractors with employees would be there to fill the void saic recently formed a special team to go after big government contracts valued at &# million or larger the contracting industry has consolidated recently with big guys buying up many midsize firms thats apparent from the walls of the tony palm restaurant in tysons corner unlike its downtown washington d c counterpart which displays caricatures of people from the political world the portraits at the tysons palm run toward local technology entrepreneurs and founders of federal contracting companies many of whom have made fortunes selling to big contractors one is of ed bersoff he founded btg inc a government contracting company and sold it for &# million in to another contractor which has itself since been acquired in this small neighborhood big contractors have started bumping into each other a few years ago booz allen tangled with next door neighbor saic after the road near the two companies office towers was named "saic drive " after some back and forth that part of the road was given a new name solutions drive fairfax county is now home to foreign owned firms some of which have been lured by the countys economic development authority which has five overseas offices recently camero inc a unit of a tel aviv company set up shop in tysons corner so it can better promote a radar system that can see through brick or concrete walls robert judd the president says he considered arlington va but the atmosphere seemed very pentagon centric the office parks near dulles seemed too commercial in nature so he settled on tysons halfway between them and a blend of the two the one drawback is the traffic "we work a m until to avoid the worst of it " says mr judd
