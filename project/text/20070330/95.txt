weekend journal opening day a shift in baseball economics is making it harder for devout fans to maintain their first day attendance streaks katherine rosman on a grand obsession and why its under siege david hoffmann has made it to every cincinnati reds home opener for years with a few close calls april for example was opening day as well as the due date of his wife nancy so he dragged mrs hoffmann to the game escorted her to their upper deck seats for five innings and a minute rain delay then walked back to the car which was parked in a free lot a mile away in kentucky several hours later the streak safely defended nancy went into labor with their daughter ashlyn since then his streak has been even harder to maintain in the reds moved to a ballpark with room for fewer fans single game tickets to opening day grew scarce he says as the reds have begun reserving many of the seats for buyers of pricey multigame packages so mr hoffmann started camping out in mid winter ticket lines scouring ebay for seats and enlisting his wife to work multiple computers and phones the moment tickets came available "i can be a little obsessive " he says baseball starts this weekend and in coming days more than a million people will fill stadiums for the first home game of their local major league baseball team among them will be a particularly fierce and devoted set of boosters fans with unbroken decades long strings of attending the home opener after spending much of their adult lives ditching work or annoying loved ones in service of their streaks these fans are discovering a new adversary baseball teams are making it harder for regular fans to get in on the years first game the streaks are in danger thanks to the new economics of opening day baseballs building boom of the past decade replaced massive venues like the astrodome kingdome and tiger stadium with facilities that are not only smaller but also designed to accommodate holders of luxury box seats and other corporate sponsors admission prices of course are also rising the biggest factor more mlb teams have begun to cut back on the number of individual opening day tickets they put on sale clubs are increasingly using such plum games as bait to push "mini season ticket" packages that lock holders into multiple dates this year for example the los angeles dodgers offered about individual tickets for its first home game down from last year because it had included more of its opening day tickets in multiple ticket plans the new york mets offered about individual tickets for this years game about half of last years count the milwaukee brewers sold out of the or so individual tickets it offered for its first game this year down from the it offered last year the team had fewer individual tickets in part it says because it doubled its inventory of nine game ticket plans that include opening day this year the brewers sold out all of the packages with prices from &# to &# "fans who are accustomed to being able to buy opening day tickets are finding it more difficult " acknowledges rick schlesinger the brewers executive vice president of business operations for those who nurse a streak this is about more than a game or a symbolic start to spring its a day safeguarded from the daily grind an unapologetic exercise in nostalgia a marker for passing years mike carr of houston who quit a job rather than break his now year streak with the astros says the seasons first game is a reminder that everyone if even for just a day has an equal shot at glory to maintain her year streak reds fan kim bittner sat through a downpour so torrential that from her top row perch she could see the ohio river flood a parking lot chicagos howard jaffe recalls how baseballs strike delayed the seasons start and when the white sox home opener was suddenly announced he had already booked a fishing trip with friends he persuaded his buddies to wait in the car poles in tow while he popped in for the first innings "i bought them all hot dogs " says mr jaffe who plans to see his rd straight game this year and this year will mark the th consecutive dodgers home opener for year old nettie berkson she started watching the team with her late husband in after the franchise moved from brooklyn and now attends with children grandchildren and great grandchildren "please god another couple of weeks and ill make it " mrs berkson said in late march tom coburns streak with the detroit tigers dates back to and each spring for more than years he has organized a rolling home opener party for about two dozen friends relatives and business associates the day begins according to tradition before noon in the vatican room at roma cafe an italian restaurant that opened in after bloody marys veal parmesan and a moment of silence for departed opening day friends the group heads to the stadium after the game they decamp to an irish cultural center for beer before remaining party members return to roma for dinner mr coburn an insurance agent covers expenses and then bills all attendees equally though the tigers have made it to the playoffs just three times in the quarter century the group has remained loyal but lately the game has become a tougher get when the team moved from tiger stadium to comerica park in capacity dropped from to individual home opener tickets have become harder to find as the tigers have attached more of the seats to multigame packs this year following the teams american league championship single ticket buyers got more bad news everyday fans who wanted a guaranteed opening day seat had to buy at minimum a game plan with prices from &# to &# last year the team put nearly individual tickets on sale for opening day for this years game it held a drawing for just pairs of seats more than fans entered mr coburns year streak came to an end last year he and his friends met for lunch as usual but with only some of the attendees able to get tickets mr coburn and the rest of his party watched the game on tv from a bar he says he plans to spend this years game watching the bars flat screen as the franchise unfurls its american league pennant "back when the tigers werent playing so well it was easy " he says "now were shut out " tigers spokesman rob matwick says it has always been a challenge to find seats at the seasons first game even in lean years to spread out the celebration of last years success he says the franchise is holding its al championship ring ceremony before the seasons second game which like opening day falls on a weekday afternoon "there are plenty of tickets " he says some teams cultivate fans with longstanding opening day streaks the cincinnati reds for instance have put up the names of such fans including mr hoffmann on their opening day scoreboard in the san diego padres honored longtime ticket holders by having them throw out the honorary first pitch last year the dodgers profiled mrs berkson in the teams program other teams such as the boston red sox and the new york yankees dont appear to track fans with longtime attendance streaks in many markets those who hope to secure same day tickets are likely to be disappointed as of yesterday morning only a few clubs including the arizona diamondbacks and florida marlins said they had individual tickets left for opening day the world champion st louis cardinals sold many of their home opener tickets as part of game packages prices ranged from &# to &# and the individual tickets it offered in march sold out in a day for fans of overnight stadium campouts the team will offer tickets on game day for &# apiece the final option says cardinals president mark lamping "fans can always buy a ticket through a scalper " mr hoffmann the cincinnati reds fan whose daughter was born after opening day has given up on ticket lines and lotteries this year for the first time he went with two other families to buy a game ticket package for about &# which gave him the right to buy two opening day tickets at &# a pop mr hoffmann a project analyst for a technology company says the only way he can justify the expense is to donate his ticket pack to a church raffle as for mrs hoffmann who braved the rainy game while pregnant with their second of three kids she considered the impact of her husbands ongoing streak before marrying him "i knew this going in " she says nothing comes between mr carr of houston and his year streak the year old was in the stands for his citys first major league baseball pitch on april when the colt s beat the chicago cubs the team was rechristened the astros and mr carr has remained a fan amid changing rosters decades and stadium names the harris county dome stadium the astrodome enron park and now minute maid park "when baseball season begins each year it seems to me that the sky is bluer the sun is brighter the beer is colder and the hot dogs are juicier " mr carr says "things arent so permanent that you cant change them and make life better " mr carr is so protective of his early april commitment that he even mentions it to prospective employers still when he was working as the assistant manager of a retail store three years ago his boss called on the morning of the home opener telling him hed need to come in that day after all mr carr says he drove to the store found the manager and turned over his store keys and identification "you doggone right im going to quit over a baseball game " he remembers saying what some consider professional baseballs first opening day game took place in cincinnati on may says national baseball hall of fame researcher freddy berowski the cincinnati red stockings the first team to openly pay its players beat the great westerns since cincinnati has been home to the findlay market opening day parade and the first game remains such a cincinnati institution that in the s fans say students were excused from classes if they presented their teachers with an opening day ticket stub a cincinnati public schools spokeswoman says baseball has never been officially recognized as a legitimate excuse for absenteeism in truth the day has been associated with truancy for generations dodgers record holder mrs berkson says she fell in love with baseball in chicago watching the cubs play in the s her family couldnt afford baseball tickets she says but she used to go to wrigley field for its "ladies day" promotions which offered free admission to females on fridays "i used to quit school " she says "dont tell my teachers " mrs berkson started watching the dodgers in and bought season tickets shortly after in baseball became more than a favored pastime one of mrs berksons grandsons glen greenberg was diagnosed with leukemia he was years old he submitted to a rigorous course of chemotherapy and was in and out of the hospital for a year "i was a kid " mr greenberg says "all i wanted to do was go out and play " mrs berkson mentioned her grandsons plight to members of her card game group which included a relative of jim gott a relief pitcher for the dodgers mr gott began making regular visits to the hospital and a friendship developed between the young cancer patient and professional athlete "when i found a link to baseball it was an easy escape the perfect removal from reality " says mr greenberg now he has attended opening day games he and the gott family remain close on april mr greenberg plans to escort his grandmother to her th straight dodgers opening day also joining them will be representatives of
