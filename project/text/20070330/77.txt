the evening wrap all ears online edition crop reports generally dont get wall street to look up from its breakfast but the ethanol craze has set off a gold rush in the farm belt making the latest numbers on corn plantings much more interesting u s farmers cant seem to get seeds into the ground fast enough as they seek to cash in on the recent dizzying ascent in the price of corn futures prices have climbed steadily thanks to washingtons love affair with ethanol the corn based biofuel that is now enjoying a surge in popularity amid spurting oil prices and president bushs campaign to embrace alternative fuel sources getting the plantings right is a tricky business plant too little corn and farmers risk missing out on the fever but plant too much and theres every chance that prices will crash through the floor the department of agriculture whipped up quite a commotion when it said last month that farmers might plant million acres of corn up from million last year but that estimate turned out to be well shy of the mark farmers are forecast to plant million acres of corn this year more than they placed in the soil a year ago and also the most acreage given over to corn since the allies were battling the axis in planting vast amounts of corn means that less land for other crops soybean rice and cotton plantings were all forecast to plunge but some of these predictions may not pan out farmers might see in todays numbers the possibility of a glut and opt to plant some rice or soybeans after all whats more the cost of planting corn may turn out to be too high for some as the price of nitrogen fertilizer has recently been soaring right along with corn futures but ultimately the most important single factor in all this should be the weather if conditions dont turn out just so plantings may not meet and even fall well short of the robust numbers seen in the projections out this morning however things turn out corn futures prices sank today that may double the cheer for ethanol producers like archer daniels midland who will now pay less for ample supplies of corn its also good news for big meat producers who have watched as soaring livestock feed prices put their margins in the slicer not everyone is all atwitter about an ethanol future as a recent page one article in the wall street journal detailed residents in a number of midwestern states have fought against the opening of ethanol plants in their areas arguing that the plants deplete aquifers pollute the air and are the source of a sickly sweet barroom like odor that hangs heavy in the air others say increasing ethanol use means corn that could be used as food in the developing world will be burned up in the gasoline tanks of wealthy nations instead so argued fidel castro who roused himself from his sickbed recently to write an op ed on ethanol but mr bush is undeterred in his enthusiasm for the fuel the president recently signed a broad ethanol accord with brazil in hopes that supporting ethanol production might help offset the regional influence of hugo chavez the socialist leader of oil rich venezuela he and president luiz inacio lula da silva plan more talks on ethanol when the brazilian president stops in at camp david this weekend mr silva says the alternative fuels plan might not gain global traction unless the u s drops a big tariff on brazilian ethanol something it has refused to do spending incomes jump americans earned more and spent more much much more than economists had expected them to during february according to data released from the commerce department personal incomes and personal spending each surged doubling the average estimate of forecasters that may be a good sign for economic growth since consumption accounts for such a broad swath of gross domestic product other economic data particularly weak numbers on capital investment have left forecasters discouraged about the strength of the expansion and a number of economists lowered their growth forecasts this week on signs that businesses are pulling back but joseph brusuelas the chief u s economist at ideaglobal said todays numbers show that weakness in the housing and autos business hasnt yet inhibited consumption "with the labor market remaining tight we do not see why both income and spending should not remain solid through the first half of the year " he told clients but some of his fellow economists noted that core wage and salary gains were more limited than the headline figures suggest and that much of the money spent last month went to
