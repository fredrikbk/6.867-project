the afternoon report all ears online edition crop reports generally drop onto the wires without a sound but the ethanol craze has set off a gold rush in the farm belt making the latest numbers on corn plantings much more of a to do than usual u s farmers as it turns out cant seem to get cornseed into the ground fast enough as they seek to cash in on a dizzying ascent in the price of corn futures prices have been pushed higher and higher recently thanks to washingtons love affair with ethanol the corn based biofuel that is now enjoying a surge in popularity amid spurting oil prices and president bushs campaign to embrace alternative fuel sources getting the plantings right is a tricky business plant too little corn and farmers risk missing out on the fever but plant too much and theres every chance that prices will crash through the floor the department of agriculture whipped up quite a commotion when it said last month that farmers might plant million acres of corn up from million last year but that estimate turned out to be well shy of the mark farmers are forecast to plant million acres of corn this year more than they placed in the soil a year ago and also the most acreage given over to corn since the allies were battling the axis in planting so much corn means that less land will be given over to other crops of course and that could soon filter through as higher prices for other foods the usda said that soybean plantings are expected to drop from last year and that rice plantings are expected to be lower by another casualty of the corn boom appears to be cotton as plantings in that category are forecast to be down by some of these forecasts may not pan out of course farmers might see the numbers today start worrying about the potential for a glut and decide that it would be better to plant more rice or soybeans after all whats more the cost of planting corn could turn out to be too high for some as the price of nitrogen fertilizer has recently been soaring right along with corn futures but ultimately the most important single factor in all this should be the weather if conditions dont turn out just so plantings may not meet and even fall well short of the robust numbers seen in the projections out this morning corn futures prices sank on the news building on the declines that had been going on for the past few days ahead of the report that should double the good cheer for ethanol producers like archer daniels midland not only do the high plantings intentions indicate it will have an ample supply of corn to produce the fuel but it also would seem to ensure that ethanol will remain competitive with traditional fuel sources on a cost basis but not all are applauding the ethanol boom some critics including even fidel castro complain that increasing ethanol use means corn that could be used as food in the developing world will be burned up in the gasoline tanks of rich nations instead food companies who have seen the price of nourishing livestock surge are also less than thrilled and some say ethanol just replaces one heavily polluting fuel with another but with mr bush driving full speed ahead with his ethanol campaign the corn field may remain the place to be spending incomes jump americans earned more and spent more much much more than economists had expected them to during february according to data released this morning by the commerce department personal incomes and personal spending each surged doubling the average estimate of forecasters thats may be a good sign for economic growth since consumption accounts for such a broad swath of gross domestic product other economic data particularly weak numbers on capital investment have left forecasters discouraged about the future strength of the expansion and a number of economists lowered their growth forecasts this week on signs that businesses are pulling back but joseph brusuelas the chief u s economist at ideaglobal said todays numbers show that weakness in the housing and autos business havent yet inhibited consumption "with the labor market remaining tight we do not see why both income and spending should not remain solid through the first half of the year " he told clients but some of his fellow economists noted that core wage and salary gains were more limited than the headline figures suggest and that much of the money spent last month went to services like haircuts or having the driveway cleared of snow meanwhile prices are on the climb news that will keep the federal reserve on inflation alert the poetically

members being held captive in iran appeared on tehrans arabic language tv today and apologized for entering iranian waters "without permission " the serviceman nighton thomas summers said he was aware that the incident in which he was seized was the second time since that british military personnel had entered iranian waters the british foreign office denounced the broadcast saying displaying the

that said it "protests strongly against this illegal act in violating iranian territorial waters " the letter also calls on britain to "guarantee to avoid the recurrence of such acts " to this point

paper fight between china u s the bush administration will no longer exempt chinese companies from u s anti subsidy laws and it has agreed to consider a request for import protection by the u s paper
