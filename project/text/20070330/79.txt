teen books are hot sellers but formula isnt simple larry doyle a former emmy winning writer for "the simpsons" tv series frequently pens comic pieces for the new yorker although he is years old and has three children his sensibilities lean to the youthful so when mr doyle got an idea for a novel it wasnt a stretch for him to write about being a teenager his book "i love you beth cooper " which will be published may by news corp s ecco imprint opens with a nerdy high school senior giving a graduation speech he then veers from his prepared text and declares his love for the schools prettiest cheerleader the hours that follow are either the best or the worst of his life "most of my dreams involve high school or college along the lines of i forgot to take the midterm " mr doyle says "in this case i dreamt the opening scene " but when it came to turning this into a book mr doyle found that his teenage theme brought with it some difficult choices last april mr doyles agent sarah burnes of the gernert co began showing about pages of "beth cooper" to publishers several geared to adults but also a dozen "young adult" imprints that court readers to years old although there arent any hard numbers publishers say young adult is a hot category at a time when bookstore sales declined about last year however determining whether a book should get a young adult label is more art than science and brings with it an array of complicated issues for authors publishers and retailers "a big part of the reason publishers are so excited about this market is that its never been easier to find and stay connected with teen readers " says michael norris a senior analyst at simba information in stamford conn author web sites blogs myspace pages and mobile phone campaigns he adds can reach a big audience to mr doyles dismay potential young adult editors told him in explicit detail how they intended to "shape" his book for their readership their advice included tell it in the first person increase the female quotient and write chapters in which male and female narrators alternate this carefully manicured approach he was told by one publishing house was "what we usually do " elise howard associate publisher at harpercollins childrens books on the other hand read mr doyles "beth cooper" manuscript but passed on it because she felt mr doyles voice would be best appreciated by older readers the decision on what audience to go for is a crucial one mark haddons novel "the curious incident of the dog in the night time " written from the point of view of an autistic child became a blockbuster in after u s editors at doubleday decided it would appeal to adult readers scholastic corp which publishes the harry potter series in the u s decided to market a single edition to both adults and kids starting with the first title "harry potter and the sorcerers stone " published here in by contrast bloomsbury publishing plc which publishes harry potter in the u k issues each title in an adult edition and a childrens edition covers of the kids editions boast bright colors while the adult versions are more subdued most recently james proseks novelistic treatment of his mothers decision to abandon husband and children "the day my mother left " was published in the u s as a young adult title even though mr proseks prose reads like a book aimed at older readers what do kids want emily farrell who teaches english and creative writing at strath haven high school wallingford pa says teens like satire and humor but the reading choices cross categories older teen girls may read such "adult" authors as candace bushnell jennifer weiner and alice sebold while younger girls like "young adult" writers such as louise rennison older teen boys for instance read books by mainstream writers such as carl hiaasen tim dorsey and dave barry young adult branding can be a double edged sword many publishers think that teens like to "read up " which means that they dont want to shop in a section of the store focused on teenagers yet retailers say their young adult sections are pulling in the kids their offerings often go beyond the formulaic craig schiff an th grader in larchmont n y says he has bought and read such books as "watership down" and "lord of the flies " in young adult sections "im not reading books about teenagers " he says "i like good books " "often the young adult titles are too young we dont want to lose them if theyve outgrown the princess diaries series " says vivien jennings owner of rainy day books an independent bookstore in fairway kan publishers she notes try to bolster their young adult titles by advertising in such magazines as seventeen and teen people or by posting related videos on youtube com some authors have also launched blogs "publishers are trying to tune into whatever teens are paying attention to and go where teens hang out " she adds in the end mr doyles "i love you beth cooper" was bought by harpercollinss ecco imprint which is marketing the novel to adults "it talks to year olds and to those watching jon stewart every night " says his editor lee boudreaux previously when she worked at bertelsmann ags random house she acquired and published curtis sittenfelds "prep " a book about high school that was marketed to adults it became a best seller in mr doyle is happy with his choice he thinks theres a stigma attached to young adult books as there is with "chick lit" aimed at women readers "if to kill a mockingbird or the catcher in the rye were published today theyd almost certainly be young adult titles " he says "but then they wouldnt become classics except in the sense that judy blume books are classics " frank portman author of "king dork " a highly acclaimed novel last year that was marketed as a young adult title doesnt see the label as limiting "literary and music categories are more porous today " mr portman says "you write about an adolescent explore the mind of an adolescent comment on pop culture as seen through the adolescents eyes and you get readers who are in their s and s " but he admits to one drawback some people ask him when hes going to write a "real book "
