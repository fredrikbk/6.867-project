catfights over u s attorney dismissals are nothing new john yoo rightly supports presidential power to dismiss united states attorneys "the attorneys hubbub " op ed march the flap about the firings is nothing new in while congress was not in session president andrew johnson fired edwin stanton a holdover as lincolns secretary of war over policy differences on reconstruction the tenure of office act enacted earlier that year purported to require senate ratification of such firings the senate refused to ratify johnson stood his ground was impeached and came within a single vote of removal later stanton resigned and the tenure of office act was repealed in the supreme court upheld the presidents power to fire executive branch officials as asserted by johnson almost six decades earlier myers v united states in the supreme court upheld a statutory limitation on the presidents power to fire members of the federal trade commission humphreys exr v united states it did so on the ground that unlike the postmaster in myers the ftc "cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive" and "must be free from executive control " the ftc was an independent agency not part of the executive branch until the constitution is amended u s attorneys are part of the executive branch subject to the presidents control it is perfectly reasonable for congress to concern itself with how he exercises that control it is not reasonable to be shocked shocked that he exercises control s paul posner new york prof yoo declares that "the constitution vests the president not the attorney general or u s attorneys with the responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed " but it also imposes on "all executive and judicial officers an oath to support this constitution " the framers were fearful of a unitary executive and seriously considered a plural executive on the swiss model the executive was thus circumscribed by the requirement of senate confirmation of "officers of the united states" to insure as alexander hamilton explained in federalist no that nominees not possess "the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of the presidents pleasure " it is this safeguard that the devious amendment to the patriot act set at nought and the ensuing outcry against replacement of "officers" by apparatchiks is fully justified george w liebmann baltimore mr yoo begins with the unremarkable observation that "once again the bush administration has shot itself in the foot " at the end of the piece however mr yoo claims that "unless there are more clear facts of interference with prosecutors for partisan purposes mr gonzales should keep his job " if the administration has truly shot itself in the foot which seems incontestable should not someone be held accountable if mr gonzalezs fingerprints cannot be found on the smoking gun he was certainly in charge of the firing range and the failure to prove corruption can be no defense to the charge of incompetence are the democrats playing politics with the issue of the fired u s attorneys of course that is alas what politicians republicans and democrats alike are trained to do and since the democrats reaction was utterly predictable it is hard to imagine why no one in the administration appears to have predicted it the result is a quite needless confrontation over the difficult issue of executive privilege and a major distraction for an administration that hardly needed one it is clear that mr gonzalez should leave not because the democrats demand it but because he has demonstrated that he is not up to the job the only serious question is how many of his colleagues in the justice department and the white house should accompany him douglas m parker south orleans mass the writer held senior positions as a lawyer in the nixon and ford administrations
