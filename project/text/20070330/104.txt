weekend journal taste save our cities the fate of a two year old war on illegal immigrants declared by the mayor of tiny hazleton pa a former coal town is now in the hands of a federal judge he will rule by june on hazletons illegal immigration relief act which penalizes local businesses and landlords who employ or rent to illegal immigrants during the nine day trial that concluded last friday mayor lou barletta argued that some undocumented immigrants have ruined hazletons quality of life violent crime has doubled in the past two years unreimbursed medical expenses at local hospitals have jumped and the annual school budget for teaching english as a second language has soared to &# from &# yet business owners and landlords argued the opposite that immigrants had revitalized hazletons moribund economy filling once vacant apartments and patronizing once declining businesses as a result hazletons budget has been in the black for three years a far cry from its &# million deficit in we will wait for the judges ruling in hazletons case but in other cities the verdict is already in immigrants have significantly improved the quality of life in many of americas most successful cities take flushing queens passersby on the way from one of new yorks airports into manhattan may notice that flushing has it all high end seafood in elegant settings bubble tea cafes and fried noodles from street vendors not to mention vietnamese pho and korean barbecue a jumble of restaurants bakeries storefronts and cultural institutions flushing home to people is thriving what a difference a few decades make in the s flushing was a wasteland those same storefronts boarded up and the sidewalks empty so derelict that the area was designated in the citys federal community development block grant application as eligible for urban renewal money then came the chinese immigrants first in small numbers then in great waves through the s and s long time city planning official sandy hornick summarizes the s as "back when we were trying to figure out what to do with flushing before flushing figured it out for itself " things looked very different for all of new york city back then facing bankruptcy the city government found itself the reluctant owner of some housing units abandoned by their owners who refused to pay the steep property taxes many new yorkers in their despair at what seemed to be the citys inexorable decline missed that their saviors were at hand chinese especially from hong kong and other asians moved into lower manhattan dominicans and other caribbeans spread through the bronx and northern manhattan the russians flooded brighton beach in brooklyn the irish returned to northern manhattan bengalis turks albanians uzbeks romanians moved to queens immigrants are now even revitalizing sections of the most bucolic borough staten island the recent bitter debates about immigration have split parties and divided allies but one group has steadfastly supported immigrants the smart big city mayors michael bloomberg new york antonio villaraigosa los angeles richard daley chicago manny diaz miami thomas menino boston "no public policy is more important to cities than federal immigration policy " says mitchell moss professor of planning and public policy at new york university "the immigration act of that opened up the country again and did more for cities than all the hud bureaucrats put together or all the money spent on federal housing transportation and welfare " all booming american cities are immigrant cities its practically tautological cities that welcome immigrants both legal and illegal tend to have vital economies that expand exponentially as immigrants open new businesses fill vacant jobs and move into declining neighborhoods immigrants form "extended clans " to use a term coined by nathan glazer and pat moynihan they capture and sometimes even invent markets jewish diamond cutters korean green grocers chinese restaurateurs russian massage therapists irish bartenders and greek coffee shop owners arent stereotypes they are the reflection of a real economic phenomenon immigrants sell goods and services to their own group and once successful to everybody else armed with little capital they start labor intensive businesses that employ friends and neighbors the neighborhoods they settle in are decrepit the commercial streets tired the infrastructure overtaxed the schools deplorable but so what all that will change when immigrants reach a core number making an area their own new york with some three million immigrants about one sixth of whom are here illegally is the ultimate immigrant city and also the countrys wealthiest these two facts are not unrelated new york may be unique in many respects but there is no reason that the positive effect of immigrants cant be felt in cities much smaller mr moss argues "theres nothing wrong with upstate new york cities that a good influx of immigrants couldnt solve " he notes that immigrants are already saving second tier cities elsewhere such as minneapolis and reading pa an economically distressed former industrial city with handsome housing stock today it is not the chinese but the dominicans who are driving much of this next wave of urban revitalization in nearly three fourths of the countrys half million dominicans lived in traditional gateway metropolitan areas like new york city paterson and passaic n j and miami today that proportion is about says pennsylvania state professor of sociology leif jensen highly entrepreneurial dominicans are opening small businesses restaurants bodegas taxi companies auto repair shops in their new cities of reading and harrisburg pa grand rapids mich and daytona fla all cities that had been suffering from declining residential demand this isnt to say that there arent problems reading for example has for several years been one of the most dangerous cities in the country with a violent crime rate roughly twice the national average immigrants there and everywhere are in a sort of race will the hard working upwardly mobile ones be able to reap the rewards of american society fast enough to get their children educated and keep them out of trouble not far from reading in hazleton mayor barletta says that local immigrants are losing that race and his town will suffer long term harm as a result maybe a trip to flushing would change his mind ms vitullo martin is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute
