blood and faith in turkey a judges murder puts religion in spotlight a teachers headscarf led to protest violence muslim vs public life ankara turkey one morning last spring a young lawyer parked his opel car on a busy commercial street next to turkeys top administrative court threw a glock handgun into his bag and went inside reaching the fifth floor of the drab courthouse alparslan arslan followed a tea server toward a chamber where five judges were meeting the year old mr arslan paused to look at their faces a few months earlier these judges had ruled that a kindergarten teacher was rightfully denied a promotion because she wore a muslim headscarf near the school a covered instructor set a bad example for impressionable young students in a secular state and undermined the foundations of the turkish republic the verdict said the ruling upset many religiously conservative turks but it pushed mr arslan over the edge pulling the gun from his bag once inside the chamber he pronounced the words "allahu akbar" god is greater and fired four times the shots killed one judge and wounded three others then mr arslan blasted another round into the air and issued a warning that "verdicts should be determined more carefully from now on " according to his later testimony fleeing the courthouse the lawyer was caught and arrested the may shootings shocked turks and led to a bout of national soul searching that continues even as the trial of mr arslan wends toward a conclusion it has also highlighted a problem arising in a host of other muslim countries how to accommodate a religious populace within the strictures of a secular state since mustafa kemal ataturk founded the turkish republic in turkey has enforced one of the strictest forms of state secularism in the muslim world to this day for instance turkish laws ban students teachers judges and other state employees from wearing headscarves at work or in class a decade ago the military which views itself as the ultimate guardian of the secular order forced a staunchly islamist prime minister out of office in the past seven years the share of turks who describe themselves as "fairly religious" has doubled to nearly half of the population according to a recent survey by the turkish economic and social studies foundation and most people favor the lifting of the headscarf ban at the same time the study found that of respondents believe democracy is the best form of government for turkey the secular elite has been accusing prime minister recep tayyip erdogan of harboring an islamist agenda a charge that has grown louder as the busy electoral season approaches allies of the prime minister who holds most executive powers dismiss such worries they argue that his party is nothing more than a conservative center right force on mr erdogans watch the economy has steadily expanded and his party is projected to once again dominate the parliament after a general election late this year it is also possible that turkeys next president who oversees government nominations and laws will be mr erdogan or one of his allies tensions over islam were brought into sharp focus by the courthouse drama whose main actors embody the two competing ideologies a teacher fighting for recognition of her religious values and a secular judge trying to keep islam separate from public life aytac kilinc came from a family where women had always covered their hair before college she had to make a choice wear a banned headscarf and deny herself an education or remove it while on campus and pursue her dream of becoming a teacher for a while she wore a wig to classes circumventing the headscarf ban while keeping her hair covered all the same the wig gave her migraines she says so eventually she took that off too and went uncovered she persevered and became a teacher each day she took off her headscarf in the car on the way to work and put it back on after class "i always obeyed the rules of the state " she says in ms kilinc aced the state exam for aspiring principals with her pick of jobs she chose a nursery school near the capital city of ankara the school occupied the grounds of a military garrison and most students were children of army personnel on july ms kilinc drove up to the military checkpoint to see her new school for the first time soldiers asked for identification although shed taken off her headscarf before arriving her photo id showed her with a covered head because of that the soldiers refused to let her in according to court documents that later emerged in the case the next day ms kilinc was again denied entry on the third day she brought more papers with her and spent hours waiting in front of the checkpoint "i sat in my car walked in the courtyard but i never got in " ms kilinc recalls informed of the incident local education authorities demoted ms kilinc back to being a regular teacher and reassigned her to another school she sued the school district and initially won education authorities fought back and the case reached the council of state turkeys highest administrative court the justices ruled that her demotion was lawful and quoted a constitutional passage "as required by the principle of secularism there shall be no interference whatsoever of sacred religious feelings in state affairs and politics " the judges went on to argue that ms kilincs headscarf was particularly worrisome because her students were impressionable toddlers two witnesses including her previous boss said ms kilinc "did not have her head covered inside the school " but other unattributed statements from the courts decision said that "she covered her head from time to time in school and as she was coming in and out of school" where she could presumably be seen by her students ms kilinc denies this the teacher the judges concluded "should set an example within her environment and also within the outside environment " joining the majority in the decision was judge mustafa yucel ozbilgin he grew up in a small town in the secular family of a bank employee after a stint as a goalkeeper on his hometowns junior soccer team he went to law school in ankara deciding to become a judge because of compulsory military service after college mr ozbilgin missed the state exam for aspiring judges so he took a civil service test instead over the next three decades mr ozbilgin crisscrossed turkey serving as a senior provincial administrator in places where he often was the top official in charge of security roads electricity education and health his wife and two young sons followed him on long train journeys across the country though he had to defer his dream of becoming a judge he sometimes acted as one unofficially in the s mr ozbilgin negotiated a truce to a violent feud between two powerful families on another posting a group of farmers staged a protest complaining that the state was channeling scarce fuel supplies to wealthy well connected villagers depriving the rest of gasoline for their tractors mr ozbilgin changed the way fuel was distributed in the early s the government tapped mr ozbilgin to become governor of the large adiyaman province in the restive southeast at the time the violent separatist rebellion by ethnic kurds was in full swing and mr ozbilgin had to deal with the outlawed marxist guerrillas once the phone rang in the middle of the night his wife recalls and the governor hastily departed to inspect the latest scene of carnage another time a helicopter mistakenly dropped him and his guards near the wrong mountaintop swarming with kurdish fighters he was quickly evacuated in turkish officials gave him the honorary title of "governor of the year" and three years later turkeys president appointed him as a justice on the council of state which is responsible for guarding the very foundations of the modern turkish state nearly years had passed since he first thought of being a judge the judge believed in a strict separation of mosque and state his family whose women do not wear headscarves says he was not an antireligious zealot in his private life he observed the monthlong annual muslim fast of ramadan "he never mixed the two things together " his daughter in law says of his views on islam and official duties his ruling in the case of aytac kilinc caused a stir in conservative circles the prime minister himself criticized the verdict as a case of the courts reaching too far into private lives mr erdogans wife wears a headscarf islamist newspaper anadolu vakit went much further attacking the judges by name and printing their photos on the morning of may mr ozbilgin and his wife had breakfast together in their apartment in downtown ankara they walked to a street corner where mr ozbilgin said goodbye and told his wife to be careful crossing the street she waved at him and watched him disappear into the subway station one person who was outraged by the kilinc verdict was alparslan arslan he thought the decision "was very unfair " recalls his father idris idris arslan a devout school inspector recalls that his son always sympathized with the weak once for example he got into a fight to protect a group of children from local bullies the elder mr arslan peppers his conversation with references to the quran and the prophet muhammad and he instilled similar reverence in his son and three daughters his daughters wear tight headscarves and one studied theology on campus she had to wear a wig her brother alparslan was outraged at this perceived insult to her beliefs "he couldnt stand injustice " idris arslan says alparslan went to law school in istanbul when he landed a job at a small law firm he helped his friends financially allowing them to live in his house free says ahmet dogan a close friend who is now his lawyer soon he drifted into islamist circles where his unfocused anger gradually acquired direction investigators say "i support physical violence due to my mental nature " mr arslan told investigators after he was captured mr arslan isnt available for an interview his lawyer says in istanbul mr arslan often attended religious gatherings at the house of salih kurter a man who described himself to investigators as a retiree who teaches his visitors to read the quran mr arslan gave him a television set as a gift around this time the young lawyer became more religious and started praying five times a day according to his father and to mr kurters testimony there was also unrequited love for a woman in germany according to mr kurter after the u s invaded iraq mr arslan told his father he wanted to go fight the occupation but he soon found a target closer to home on april last year a staunchly secularist cumhuriyet daily newspaper published a cartoon showing a pig with a long snout wearing a tight wrap around headscarf used by particularly conservative turkish women it was the same type worn by mr arslans sisters and mother in response mr arslan lobbed a hand grenade at the newspapers headquarters in downtown istanbul causing minor damage but no injuries according to court testimony by that time according to the indictment prepared by ankara public prosecutor semsettin ozcan mr arslan was already hatching his next plot to kill the judges who ruled against the kindergarten teacher ms kilinc on may mr arslan and three of his friends drove to ankara and checked into a hotel the next day mr arslan came by the courthouse unarmed telling the guards he was following up on a case he didnt find his primary target the chairman of the offending chamber and returned the next day a copy of vakit newspaper with the photos of the judges lay on the gearbox of his car he had three handguns there too he picked one and went inside his shooting spree wounded the chairman and three others but the only judge who died was mr ozbilgin he was a year away from retirement at his funeral thousands of people marched through ankara shouting secularist slogans and blaming the pro islamist government the powerful chief of the turkish military called on the marchers to keep up the protests mr erdogan condemned the killing his supporters have since suggested that the murder may have been directed by shadowy groups linked to former military officers with the goal of escalating tensions and undermining the current administration if convicted of murder a charge he doesnt deny mr arslan faces life in prison several of his alleged accomplices face lesser charges at a march hearing in ankara mr arslan sat quietly in the defendants box ringed by armed police ms kilinc who is has not attended any trial hearings and has never met the families of mr ozbilgin or mr arslan she continues to teach nursery school abiding by state laws requiring her
