weekend journal review books a look back at the season ahead there comes a point each spring when even the most fervent baseball fan after the initial rush of pitchers and catchers reporting to training camps grows weary of the game he is supposed to love there are simply too many meaningless exhibition games and even when the regular season starts on sunday it will be weeks before the pulse quickens at the thought of checking out a box score springtime for baseball fans can be made entirely tolerable though by reading up on the game its past glory and its current unsettled state readers of books by cait murphy and john heidenry may come away suspecting that baseball will never again see seasons like and respectively in fact ms murphy in her entertaining and meticulously researched "crazy " collins pages &# argues for as a singular season that began the modern baseball era and secured baseballs place as the national pastime football was "for college boys" back then ms murphy notes basketball was "in its infancy " and tennis and golf were "for the rich " when tens of thousands of fans began thronging games during the bitter national league pennant race between the new york giants and chicago cubs and a three way race in the american league the sports custodians awakened "to baseballs larger possibilities " ms murphy writes and the game reached a "new maturity " ms murphy has a nice feel for baseball of that era noting how it varies from the game today spectators romping on the field during and after games pitchers performing on one days rest players frequently engaging in fistfights no home run hitting to speak of but she also sees its similarities a time traveling fan from "would find cosmetic differences outfields that stretched to the horizon whiskey in the stands fans dressed in ties and bowler hats the occasional sight of players smoking on the field a happy lack of thunder sticks and limp bizkit between the lines though the game would be entirely familiar " by many of the sports rules had been codified into a rough form of what we know today the players who figure into the seasons drama are a roll call of future hall of famers christy mathewson mordecai "three finger" brown ty cobb honus wagner and rube waddell ms murphy describes their exploits in bracing detail and her account may surprise some fans i had no idea for example that giants manager john mcgraw was such a shady character a "rotten loser " mcgraw gambled heavily consorted with gangsters and bet on his own giants to win the world series he also made it into the hall of fame today hed join pete rose in baseball purgatory john heidenrys "the gashouse gang" publicaffairs pages &# is the best account ive read of the st louis cardinals improbable championship season of it was a rag tag team led by the incomparable in both character and pitching ability dizzy dean a player who gave sports fans ravaged by the depression a welcome diversion with his bravado and country boy cornpone while the new york yankees even then were emblematic of corporate america winning with precision and high salaried players the cardinals wore ripped uniforms fought with each other drank heavily held work stoppages played pranks and generally drove their manager frankie frisch half mad still the team won the pennant on the last day of the season and then a scintillating world series in seven games against the detroit tigers given the cardinals colorful appeal and the drama of their championship drive has to go onto the short list of baseballs most exciting seasons one of the strengths of mr heidenrys book is his thorough account of st louiss general manager branch rickey who is mostly known today for integrating baseball with his signing of jackie robinson in to play for the brooklyn dodgers but rickey a church going teetotaler who didnt let his own stiff collared morality interfere with evaluating talented ballplayers who relished having a good time also developed baseballs minor leagues and he perfected the art of knowing when to trade a player before his abilities declined rickey was also tightfisted he imposed a &# ceiling on player salaries beginning in meaning that in when dizzy dean went he made the equivalent of &# in dollars hardly enough to cover the landscaping bills of todays stars how much does money matter in "the baseball economist" dutton pages &# j c bradbury an economics professor and devoted atlanta braves fan uses his professional tools to analyze the game he loves converting a players productivity into a dollar value for his team for instance mr bradbury asserts that the chicago cubs derrek lee not the cardinals albert pujols deserved last seasons national league mvp award he evaluates teams"average net value" and "total performance value" to rank the quality of organizations but the news that the pittsburgh pirates were the sixth best organization in all of baseball during that period will likely be of little solace to that citys fans mr bradbury dismantles the myth that large market teams have an inherent advantage over other franchises noting that the wealthy new york yankees led by free spending owner george steinbrenner didnt make the postseason playoffs in the years between and and chicagos cubs havent performed nearly as well in recent years as small market teams like the minnesota twins and oakland as the contrarian mr bradbury also defends major league baseballs antitrust exemption unique in sports the exemption hardly makes the mlb a threatening monopoly he says pointing out that with its game schedule the game certainly isnt restricting its product and it has a lower average ticket price than professional football or basketball "the baseball economist" may be weighed down by too much numbers crunching for all but the most hardcore fans of baseball stats but mr bradburys devotion to the game is apparent on every page "economics furthers our understanding of important topics in so many areas " he writes "but really what could be more important than baseball " the only dud in this quartet of books is george castles "baseball and the media" university of nebraska pages &# subtitled "how fans lost in todays coverage of the game " it is a cri de coeur by a veteran sportswriter who complains that "elitism and arrogance as bad as any practiced by wealthy players exist among the pen and mike crowd " he rails at columnists and sports talk show hosts who dont bother to visit locker rooms and then annoy players and managers with ill informed kibitzing fans indeed may not be particularly well served by todays sports media but this book feels like a sour grapes polemic by a beat writer who seems to resent covering the cubs and white sox for a nonelite newspaper the times of northwest indiana he pines for an era when blogs didnt exist and ambitious young writers didnt hop from job to job "disrupting the continuity of coverage demanded by fans " actually it could be argued that fans have never been better served by "the media" if that includes games from all over the country on mlb com espn and sports talk radio and gasp baseball blogs some of which are excellent sources of information and analysis sure as mr castle says much of it is "entertainment " not "journalism " but hey its just a game the best game but still a game mr smith writes weekly columns for new york press and baltimores city paper
