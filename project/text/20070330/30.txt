house narrowly backs budget plan washington the house narrowly approved a democratic budget plan challenging president bush on domestic spending but the slim victory was also a warning that the new majority faces bigger risks if it tampers with tax cuts the five year balanced budget plan approved postpones any real tax debate but its &# billion surplus in wont be achieved without meeting requirements that any extension of mr bushs tax cuts be offset by spending cuts or additional revenue republicans say these pay as you go rules lay the groundwork for a wave of tax increases after an argument that helped convince house democrats most from republican states to reject the package senate democrats in adopting their budget plan last week set aside about &# billion after to ensure greater flexibility in protecting favorite middle class breaks such as the expanded child tax credit and income tax rate when house senate negotiators meet after the spring recess next month this is sure to be a major issue for the leadership to resolve nonetheless after years out of power in the house and the collapse of the budget process in the last republican congress yesterdays victory was crucial for house democrats "its almost surreal to win one like that after so many years in the wilderness " said house budget committee chairman john spratt d s c "this was a critical issue for us it was the final complementing act to the first three months of this congress " republicans paid a price for their own divisions about what course to take wisconsin rep paul ryan the ranking republican on the house budget committee called for major savings to come from entitlement programs to make room for extending the expiring tax cuts but he lost soundly with republicans voting against given this uncertainty democrats argue their more incremental approach is the better course to restore more discipline but they have made little attempt to address the rising costs of benefit programs and much rests on congresss ability to stay focused on deficit reduction already the &# million set aside in the senate would effectively exhaust any surplus that materializes in and republicans argue that in fact senate democrats are marginally in deficit that year when the added interest costs are calculated the most important number in the budget is the cap set for annual appropriations bills that democrats hope to begin to move through the house in late may a total of &# billion would be permitted for the new fiscal year that begins oct about &# billion more than the president is asking for this increase is matched by an additional &# billion plus democrats are proposing to add to a wartime appropriations bill for the remainder of this fiscal year the &# billion measure which cleared the senate yesterday is at the center of a struggle between mr bush and the new congress over provisions calling for a withdrawal of most u s forces from iraq next year and the parallel house senate talks on the budget and wartime spending bill will take center stage when lawmakers return from their recess in making their case on iraq democrats cant afford to let the white house isolate them as irresponsible on budget matters "we expect the congress to be wise about how they spend the peoples money " mr bush said in the iraq bill it appears almost certain that some withdrawal language will be included setting up what could be a tense day period in which congress and mr bush must reconcile their differences before the military faces major financial problems which would come in mid may if the new funds arent available then
