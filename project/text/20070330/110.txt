weekend journal the weekend adviser thank you for dying in christopher buckleys vision of the near future the u s is involved in six wars the stock market is in free fall and a presidential candidate is running on an unusual platform encouraging baby boomers to kill themselves mr buckleys new satirical novel "boomsday" depicts a nation going blindly bankrupt paying social security benefits to boomer retirees in response a year old beltway blogger named cassandra decides to incite intergenerational rebellion inspiring twentysomethings to torch golf courses she also proposes tax breaks for boomer suicides mr buckley has written seven satirical novels including "thank you for smoking " which was adapted into a movie "boomsday" has generated positive early buzz from critics leading to a first printing of copies the most of his career mr buckley chatted recently between speaking engagements in florida q hows florida a here i am looking down on a golf course and i see a crowd of young people approaching with torches and pitchforks my god theyre attacking the golfers q but what makes you think young people can be made to care about social security a if i were "generation whatever " i would be pissed off we have an &# trillion national debt and that bill is going to come due one of these days but people who raise the cry of alarm can be made in our culture of gratification to sound tiresome cassandras have always been historically discredited until the monster rises out of the ocean and eats everyone on the beach q so youre going to make them rise up through satire a well you know birds gotta fly girls gotta dance this is what i do i hope younger people read it i hope they take parts of it seriously and i hope they get politically active and start forcing some of these harder issues q youre a modern day jonathan swift a im not im an acolyte of the swiftian altar and perhaps a wannabe but thats not a bad ideal to aim at thats a pretty good north star there have been humorists who think of themselves of sitting at the childrens table of literature were stuck with this conception that humor comedy satire isnt really a main event i dispute that q maybe it helps to have a female protagonist you describe as "hot" a for some reason the heroes of my books seem to be women young women the last book "florence of arabia " was about a young woman the book im writing now the hero is a woman youd have to talk to my shrink about that one its probably foolish for a year old male to try to crawl into the mind of a year old woman q well how do you do that a i know some year olds i ask them i have a very close friend whos a brilliant year old and i showed her the manuscript as a matter of fact in one of the scenes i have cass shes trying to stay up all night working on her blog and in my first draft i had her taking ritalin and my friend said "no a year old would never be taking ritalin shed be taking nodoz and red bull " q whats the next issue you want to be a cassandra about a im trying to write a satire about the supreme court its going to be a challenge the court is fascinating in that as an institution its utterly consequential and can be utterly boring
