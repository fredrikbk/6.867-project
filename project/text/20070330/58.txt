politics &amp economics jakartas newmont suit risks investment fallout conviction in pollution case would further dent image of nation to foreign investors jakarta indonesia international business groups here say indonesias efforts to attract investment could suffer another blow if a district court next week finds a local unit of newmont mining corp and its american chief guilty of pollution charges the case centers on allegations first made in that a newmont operated gold mine on the northern tip of sulawesi island dumped large amounts of mercury into a bay near the village of buyat causing residents to get sick richard ness the year old head of the newmont operation faces a three year jail sentence and &# fine if convicted by a district court in manado government prosecutors are asking that denver based newmont pay fines of &# if the company is convicted the court is expected to issue its verdict on wednesday newmont denies the charges contending that run off from mining operations was pumped more than half a mile offshore wasnt poisonous and didnt damage the local ecosystem the company stopped mining for gold at the site in but it continued to process ore until august newmont has since covered the mine site and replanted vegetation as part of a mine closure program with the indonesian government unrelated to the pollution allegations last year a civil suit brought by the government was settled after newmont without admitting wrongdoing agreed to pay &# million to an environmental foundation for north sulawesi newmont says it agreed to the payment so it could focus on the criminal case in the criminal proceedings the prosecutions case has seemingly weakened since when an indonesian national police study of the bay was alone in finding evidence of pollution a study commissioned by the world health organization also in found the bay wasnt polluted and that villagers didnt display toxic levels of mercury in their systems the indonesian environment ministry came to the same conclusion and a local doctor who first brought the charges against newmont now says she doesnt have any evidence to back them up a guilty verdict would further dent indonesias image with foreign companies and could deter investment says tom donohue president of the u s chamber of commerce "u s investors in indonesia are closely monitoring the newmont case " he says "a guilty ruling and a draconian penalty based on what by all accounts is very weak evidence would have a distinctly dampening effect on u s investor confidence in indonesia " indeed international publicity from the criminal case against mr ness which went to trial in august has already contributed to indonesias poor reputation with investors foreign companies that are pouring money into places like china and vietnam have largely steered clear of indonesia in the past few years because of its weak judicial system and the governments failure to pass business friendly labor tax and investment laws in just before the asian financial crisis approved foreign direct investment totaled &# billion last year investment approvals were about half that amount indonesias parliament yesterday passed a long awaited investment law including measures to make it easier for foreigners to invest but business groups say it remains to be seen whether the law will actually lead to better conditions for foreign investors simon felix sembiring director general of mineral coal and geothermal resources at indonesias energy ministry acknowledges the drawn out case involving newmont has had a "negative impact" on investment but the government "supports the continuation of the court process " he adds a guilty verdict could especially have an impact on investment decisions by foreign mining companies says priyo soemarno executive director of the indonesian mining association whose members include newmont as well as other foreign and local mining companies the mining group contends the case should never have gone to trial after key witnesses retracted allegations against newmont "if the court makes a wrong decision the mining industry wont have any legal certainty any more " mr soemarno says "it will have a huge impact on investment " indonesias failure to enact a new mining law to govern investments coupled with legal worries has meant the resource rich nation is missing out on a global boom in exploration spending fueled by robust prices for commodities such as copper gold nickel and coal of course mining companies are used to operating in difficult legal environments freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc of new orleans pays the indonesian army to protect its huge copper and gold mine in papua province for newmont the possibility of a foreign mining executive being sent to jail has pushed chief executive wayne murdy to threaten pulling out of indonesia "because the facts and the evidence presented in the courtroom clearly show that buyat bay is not polluted any decision to the contrary would cause any investor including ourselves to re evaluate investing in indonesia " mr murdy says mining companies havent broken ground on a major mine in indonesia since the asian financial crisis the failure of countries such as indonesia mongolia and congo to develop their huge untapped mineral resources is a major reason that global supply remains tight for a number of key commodities such as nickel and copper the newmont case is being watched by foreign mining companies that are considering whether to invest in indonesia among others rio tinto
