the morning brief the tribulations of tribune may soon try its employees online edition the wall street journal online vocal complaints from some of its midlevel and senior news personnel have characterized tribunes ownership tribulations since before the media conglomerate put itself on the block six months ago and one of the most striking aspects of two competing bids is that theyd leave much of the ownership in the hands of employees the latest bid came late last night from los angeles billionaires eli broad a real estate titan and the investment and grocery magnate ron burkle they offered to pay &# a share &# more than rival billionaire real estate mogul sam zell who had been viewed as the front runner according to the los angeles times which happens to be tribunes biggest newspaper and the source of many newsroom complaints that new offer would total &# billion bloomberg says and it comes as tribune was approaching tomorrows self imposed deadline for the process the offer is said to be similar to that of mr zell who had promised not to sell tribunes newspapers television stations and internet businesses and who intended to structure the deal based on an employee stock ownership plan messrs burkle and broad offered &# million of their own money in exchange for warrants that would bring control of of tribune compared with &# million in cash offered by mr zell the new york times says but the most attention will probably be paid to how a deal would leave of stock with employees such ownership plans are relatively unusual and while they have succeeded for many small companies theyve had mixed results for bigger ones and are virtually untested on large corporations like tribune which has about employees the n y times says the ownership ratio in mr zells plan isnt clear but would also make employees the majority of owners it would be interesting to see how that works at a company with newspapers at the core of its operations in part because journalists are often by their nature an outspoken class of workers and one where leadership often ascends from the ranks rare is the editor in chief who didnt start out as a cub reporter the n y times says the new bid "almost certainly complicates the tribunes deliberations" and "throws into doubt any previous timetable for a decision about the company " but the wall street journal says "time may be running out for the broad burkle team" and that "tribunes board is becoming increasingly agitated about the length of the sale process and will be seeking hard commitments from the duo before it extends the process any longer " gonzales is contradicted by ex chief aide attorney general alberto gonzaless hold on his job may have loosened another finger or two yesterday when his now ex chief of staff contradicted mr gonzaless efforts to distance himself from the firing of eight u s attorneys d kyle sampson who stepped down as mr gonzaless top aide this month told the senate judiciary committee they had discussed the firings a number of times in the past two years as legal times notes that contrasts with a recent assertion by the attorney general that he "was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on " asked about that statement mr sampson said "i dont think its entirely accurate " his testimony prompted the latest white house suggestion that mr gonzales still needed to make a more detailed case about the matter on capitol hill he will have a chance to do so in testimony scheduled for mid april but as the wall street journal points out that leaves the administration vulnerable to attack until then or as white house spokeswoman dana perino put it "three weeks is a long time " among other details of the matter to emerge in mr sampsons testimony was the fact that new mexico u s attorney david c iglesias "wasnt added to the dismissal list until just before the nov elections after presidential adviser karl rove complained that iglesias had not been aggressive enough in pursuing cases of voter fraud " the washington post reports that tied mr rove more directly to the dismissals than previous publicly released evidence it also came to light that mr sampson was the person who proposed replacing patrick j fitzgerald the u s attorney in chicago investigating the cia leak case during a white house meeting in "i said patrick fitzgerald could be added to this list " mr sampson testified recalling a conversation with white house lawyer harriet miers and an aide as the new york times reports but he said he regretted the suggestion immediately "they looked at me like i had said something totally inappropriate and i had " asked if mr fitzgeralds removal had ever been addressed by mr rove a one time subject of his investigation mr sampson replied "to the best of my recollection no i dont remember that " pressure rises on iran the british government said today that it was giving "serious consideration" to a letter from iran that appeared to offer hope for a breakthrough in the standoff over british navy personnel seized last week in waters disputed by iran and iraq the letter delivered to the british embassy in tehran late yesterday doesnt directly address the fate of the british sailors and marines but uses polite diplomatic language to request an explanation for why they were in iranian waters according to a copy obtained by the associated press britain had denied they were in iranian waters but its "consideration" marks the first optimistic sign in a crisis that seems to escalate daily and continues to push up prices in a jittery oil market just last night the situation took what the guardian calls "a sinister turn" when tehran withdrew an offer to release the lone female sailor among the captured crew though there were some reports today that the offer could be put back on the table last night the united nations security council agreed to a watered down statement expressing "grave concern" about irans behavior as usa today reports but britain had sought a stronger condemnation and had been battling to overcome russian and chinese objections to demands for an immediate release of the sailors and marines the financial times adds saudi arabian foreign minister saud al faisal tells newsweek that the kingdom views the situation as "a catastrophe for iran and that riyadh has made clear to tehran "this is just not the time for them to have a problem like that looming " in a wide ranging interview about the middle east and the saudis growing regional role as american influence there wanes mr faisal denies that role is part of an effort to counterbalance or contain iran but he says king abdullah has "bluntly" told iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad "youre interfering in arab affairs" in iraq and that on the nuclear issue "we warned him dont play with fire " mr faisal also denied saudi arabia may try to force oil prices lower to punish iran saying "theyre not going to be brought down " he added "people need oil " newsweek notes that when king abdullah opened the arab summit in riyadh this week by addressing iraq and saying "blood flows between brothers in the shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and hateful sectarianism " he upset many policymakers in washington the new york times reports it caught the state department off guard and that secretary of state condoleezza rice scheduled a telephone call with the saudi ambassador to the u s to discuss the matter also of note new york times lapses in using a digital medical record system for tracking wounded soldiers have led to medical mistakes and delays in care and have kept thousands of injured troops from getting benefits according to former defense and military medical officials several defense department officials said the problem may have played a role in the suicide of a soldier last year after he was taken to fort lewis in washington state
