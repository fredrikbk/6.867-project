mutual funds in a shift pose proxy questions investors are solicited on variety of changes a confounding process mutual fund companies are proposing big investment policy changes this year with many asking shareholders for permission to put more of their money into foreign stocks and real estate just as those once hot investments are slowing down mutual funds dont always have such issues but this year is producing a barrage of proxy voting ballots in shareholders mailboxes from fund companies that havent made such changes in a long time shareholders are also being bombarded with phone calls encouraging them to vote some common fund proposals requiring shareholder approval include voting on trustee changes investment advisory agreements and changing certain investment policies "this is about the rd th time i have received telephone calls about voting " wrote one frustrated investor last week on mutual fund web site fundalarm com the bumper crop of proxy ballots stems in part from a spate of recently announced mergers among fund firms that involve changes requiring shareholder approval in the first three months of this year about funds have already filed proxies roughly on pace to match the filings last year or about of all u s mutual funds according to governance tracker the corporate library the proxies are tripping up lots of investors unaccustomed to the process dodge &amp cox funds san francisco hadnt proposed significant changes in almost years but it is holding a special meeting for a vote franklin templeton investments also hasnt held such a meeting in more than a decade and is wrapping up its vote next month other fund companies holding meetings in coming weeks for various issues include oppenheimerfunds inc putnam investments and the royce funds excelsior funds is scheduled to meet today in san francisco the royce funds is seeking more flexibility in foreign investing among other things at its meeting next month in new york given recently volatile foreign markets "im not sure this is the right time to do this " says charles royce president of the royce funds but "the funds wont necessarily do more of such investing now were just making the technical change " whats an investor to do when they get a thick proxy in the mail for starters read it carefully most questions are answered in the first few pages if you dont understand it call the fund company or the proxy solicitor listed in the first few pages hired by fund companies to push investors to vote these representatives can also answer questions or even assist with the voting fund companies pressure shareholders to vote because if they dont get the necessary level of participation they must do more soliciting which costs them money changes to investment limits are among the most common and potentially most worrisome proposals popular changes include loosening limits on borrowing and lending firms typically borrow money for short term cash needs like meeting shareholder redemptions and lend securities to banks brokers and other financial institutions that use them for their own investment strategies other common changes include asking for greater flexibility in real estate and commodities investments and taking bigger positions in stocks or foreign holdings some of these are changes included in dodge &amp coxs five proposals they have triggered a handful of alarmed posts on online discussion boards at fund researcher morningstar inc s web site some postings ask if the changes are "out of character" or if they mean the company is "no longer the old d&amp c " such characterizations are "way off base " says charles pohl chief investment officer of dodge &amp cox the main change was that the firms managers wanted each of the funds to be able to buy more than of the voting shares outstanding in a single stock this is particularly crucial to the dodge &amp cox international stock fund which has gone from &# billion in assets in to more than &# billion today the big cash inflows meant managers wanted more leeway to buy larger positions in companies they consider particularly attractive like many fund firms making such changes dodge says this doesnt alter its long term investment strategy and doesnt mean the firm will necessarily utilize the changes a few years from now says mr pohl if investors look for changes "the only thing is we may own more than " of some companies in the international fund other fund companies are making similar changes including alger funds which held a special meeting in january its first since the julius baer international equity fund is voting in may on relaxing some restrictions on commodity and real estate investments franklin templeton held a meeting last week to vote on about a dozen proposals including changing borrowing lending and commodities limits in about funds franklin plans to readjourn next month to finish gathering votes one of franklins biggest changes involved converting one real estate fund into a global real estate fund with that area taking off recently the change was "prompted primarily by investors " says franklin spokeswoman lisa gallegos despite shareholders concerns about all the proxies investors rarely take the trouble to show up at the meetings dodge which manages almost &# billion in its four funds had about shareholders at one meeting a few years ago only one shareholder attended the &# billion alger funds january meeting in new york fidelity employees too see change in pension plan fidelity investments said it will end its traditional pension program that covers employees and join the growing list of employers putting greater emphasis on plans that require employees to take more responsibility for their retirement needs the issue is close to home for the mutual fund giant that manages retirement plans but the change doesnt appear as dramatic as recent shifts at other corporations that used to rely primarily on "defined benefit" pension plans wherein an employer makes monthly benefits payments to retirees for life under fidelitys revamped retirement package the company will make &# annual contributions to newly created retirement health care accounts for each employee meanwhile the companys current profit sharing plan which equals roughly of annual pay will continue and fidelity will boost matching contributions to employee k accounts to up to of annual income up from anne crowley a fidelity spokeswoman said that on average fidelity employees have historically received less than of their retirement income from the companys traditional pension plan fidelity retirees have gotten the lions share of their benefits from a profit sharing plan and a k plan both of which involve the company making annual payments to employees who then control how the money is invested retiree health care concerns not cost savings were the main reason for changing the plan ms crowley said until now fidelitys package didnt make any specific provisions for retiree health care and a recent internal survey showed that of its employees didnt know how they would pay for it benefits accrued under the traditional pension plan can either be rolled over into employees profit sharing accounts or used to purchase a retirement annuity robert tomsho
