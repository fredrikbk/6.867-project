recent cases point to the limitations of animal drug tests the promising diabetes drug galvus recently got turned back by the u s food and drug administration about patients had taken the medicine in clinical trials at that point but the problem apparently wasnt with them the agency was worried because some monkeys who were given high doses of galvus developed skin lesions humans who took normal amounts of the drug for as long as two years didnt get the sores but the fda refused to approve the drug until it saw more testing in people who might be at higher risk the decision spotlighted an important unresolved scientific question what do the results of animal studies really tell us about humans that question still puzzles researchers even though guinea pigs lab rats and their brethren have long been part of experiments the fda encourages work that could lead to a better understanding of human and animal genetics and someday reduce the need for animal studies already genetic arrays chips that can give a snapshot of the genetic effects of a drug allow researchers a broad early stage picture of what a drug does to an animal by illustrating which of its genes are "expressing " or activated as a result of the medicine such signs typically show up well before the actual physical damage these genetic road maps can give a better idea of whats causing a safety worry in animal tests and whether it is likely to affect people the same way still the question remains "does that guarantee it wont have a toxic impact in humans " asks maneesh jain an executive at affymetrix a company that makes the microarray chips "no " in the pharmaceutical world animal tests provide vital clues about experimental drugs and help prevent humans from being exposed to serious dangers the animals are given far bigger doses than a person could likely tolerate and are tested under circumstances that would be impossible with a human volunteer such as during pregnancy thats why animal trials are still done despite the concerns of animal rights activists and others about the distastefulness and expense of sacrificing so many blameless critters currently the fda is looking at results showing some anesthetic drugs led to neurological damage in young primates before regulators approve a drug it typically has been tested on hundreds of animals the fda requires initial testing in at least two species one rodent one nonrodent by the end of the process mice pigs rabbits dogs monkeys and other animals may have been used animal tests at least give a broad sense of the effects of a drug in one famous early example a pancreatic extract successfully tested in diabetic dogs in helped to illuminate how insulin would help people with the disease and many experimental medications are eliminated after very serious side effects show up many times however subtle results in animals are unclear and scientists just dont know what to make of them in the case of the new novartis drug galvus james shannon the companys global head of pharmaceutical development told investors that novartis researchers "do not understand do not know the mechanism of the skin findings" in monkeys they do know that "humans appear to react to galvus in a very different way " another example of the confusing disparities that can arise in testing is the case of the popular sleep drug lunesta it won fda approval despite the fact that tumors appeared when rats and mice took huge doses of a closely related chemical cousin of the medication some fda reviewers were concerned enough initially to recommend rejection of lunesta after further analyses however agency officials concluded the data from human testing didnt suggest a signal for cancer in people but you wont see the issue highlighted in the companys ubiquitous green moth commercials for the drug it can happen that a product doesnt hurt animals but turns out to be poisonous to patients that occurred with the catastrophic british trial of an experimental biotech drug called tgn meant to treat leukemia and other diseases it didnt cause problems when given to monkeys and other species then six people took it in a small initial study and had life threatening convulsions and organ failure british regulators blamed an "unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans" that wasnt foretold by the "apparently adequate" preclinical studies it isnt clear how to avoid such fiascos for now regulators arent likely to dial back preclinical study requirements "at the moment we dont have a better way of doing it " says david jacobson kram associate director of pharmacology and toxicology in the fdas drug center neither has the agency increased its focus on animal studies despite drug industry concerns sparked by the galvus decision scientists agree theres no way to precisely and consistently translate from animal to human results after the withdrawals of the painkiller vioxx and other medicines with side effects that didnt fully reveal themselves during years of testing the need for such a translation looms particularly large email me at anna mathews wsj com
