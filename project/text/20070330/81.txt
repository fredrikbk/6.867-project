tobacco roadkill the pseudo scandal surrounding the bush administrations sacking of eight u s attorneys has now come down mostly to an alberto gonzales resignation watch his former chief of staff kyle sampson took his turn in the senate dock yesterday and the not so big news is that mr sampson says the attorney general was more involved with the entirely legal dismissals than he has acknowledged there doesnt seem to be anything else there to uncover and maybe the boil will be lanced if mr gonzales departs but dont count on it look no further than the phony claim of "politicized" justice as opportunists now try to rewrite the history of the justice departments tobacco case last week the washington post found room on its front page to tell the two year old story of one sharon eubanks a career lawyer at the justice department who left in after years ms eubanks led the team that prosecuted the infamous civil racketeering case against big tobacco which resulted in the government ultimately reducing the penalties it sought to &# billion from &# billion ms eubanks claims that political appointees at justice including then associate attorney general robert mccallum and then assistant attorney general peter keisler pressured her to go easy on the cigarette makers "the political people were pushing the buttons and ordering us to say what we said " she told the post "and because of that we failed to zealously represent the interest of the american public " mr keisler it just so happens has been nominated by president bush for a seat on the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the seat was vacated when john roberts was appointed chief justice of the u s mr keisler who now runs the civil division at justice is a big legal talent and liberals are desperate to keep him off the d c circuit because it would make him a very prominent candidate for the high court in the future well timed smears from former underlings like ms eubanks are a means to that end ms eubanks says she chose to come forward out of concern for the "overwhelming politicization" of the justice department as demonstrated by the u s attorney dismissals over the weekend in an appearance on fox news sunday she asserted that career employees at justice "are being interfered with every day in their work " in fact the justice departments office of professional responsibility opr investigated her claims and found them without merit in a report last year the report cleared mr mccallum and the departments other political appointees of any wrongdoing in the handling of the tobacco prosecution ms eubanks rejects its findings but its worth noting that they were good enough for democratic senator dick durbin of illinois who said at the time through a spokesman that "he has been reassured by opr that mr mccallum was not engaged in improper political influence in the tobacco case " politics certainly did play a role in the tobacco litigation but not in the way that ms eubanks is suggesting the clinton administration filed the suit in and did so as an end run around congress which had blocked federal claims to the windfall resulting from the medicaid tobacco settlement with the states a year earlier after the bush administration came into office these columns urged that the case be dismissed alas to no avail by district court judge gladys kessler a clinton appointee had dismissed the governments original efforts to recoup medicare costs undeterred ms eubanks and her legal team decided to argue a theory that had no real basis in law the new claim was that under the rico federal racketeering statutes the government was entitled to ill gotten profits for past indiscretions the only problem is that in civil cases rico is forward looking nevertheless ms eubanks pressed the point and was rebuked by an appellate court which ruled that the feds if they won were entitled only to relief regarding future industry behavior it was at this point after six years and &# million spent prosecuting the case that the political appointees at justice stepped in and advised ms eubanks on how to cut her losses the case should never have been brought in the first place let alone allowed to go on that long but ms eubanks has no one but herself to blame for the outcome
