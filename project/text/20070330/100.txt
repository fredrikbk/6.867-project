weekend journal sports by the numbers biggest man on campus unlike most college freshmen ohio states greg oden knows what hes going to do after college the foot center will play in atlanta this weekend in the final four of the ncaa division i mens basketball tournament then barring a stunning change of heart hell declare himself eligible for the nba draft where hell be the consensus no pick and a potential franchise player indeed if not for the nbas recently imposed age limits players under the age of are now prohibited from entering the league mr oden would have applied for the draft out of high school and would likely have been the first pick in last years draft for college basketball fans the question is whether mr oden will leave ohio state a national championship as his parting gift the odds are that he will if you look over recent history you can see a correlation between the draft prospects of a teams best player and its final four success from to championship teams sported at least one player that was among the top three college players selected in the nba draft and since four of those champs sported players who were the first collegians taken that said mr oden isnt just a solid nba prospect he has a good shot at taking a place among the best centers to play the game looking at the list of the centers on the nbas greatest players list further highlights the connection between big time college success and an elite level nba career kareem adbul jabbar then lew alcindor won three ncaa titles bill walton and bill russell each won two titles and patrick ewing won one and while wilt chamberlain and hakeem olajuwon each missed winning a title by a few points both were named outstanding player in the tournament while there are of course a couple of modern exceptions to this rule neither david robinsons navy squad nor shaquille oneals lsu team ever got to the final four its still a strong trend one explanation in ncaa tournaments it really isnt about the team players with the physical talent to excel in the nba pose huge matchup problems at the college level even for the best opponents and unlike baseball where a journeyman player gets almost as many at bats as an mvp in basketball a team can go to its best player possession after possession look for ohio state to exploit the mismatch mr oden presents until its opponents adjust their defense in an attempt to contain him but the extra energy theyll use to keep mr oden in check will hand better scoring opportunities to his teammates notably guard mike conley jr in the first semifinal game mr oden should be too much for georgetown the second game is a replay of last years championship game in which florida defeated ucla look for florida which led the nation in margin of victory this season to beat ucla again florida vs ohio state should make for an interesting title game while the gators dont have a big man as dominant as mr oden they have two likely top nba draft picks in their lineup joakim noah and al horford sport impressive shooting percentages and respectively and are prolific rebounders and per game so while floridas strength in numbers is formidable ohio states big man gives the buckeyes a slight edge but no matter who wins nba scouts will have a big interest in what happens on the court this weekend battle of the titans the final four is likely to be a battle of the big men greg oden of ohio state has been dominant as a freshman but florida will counter with two players in joakim noah and al horford who put up numbers that were almost as good player points game reb game blocks game shooting points shot g oden osu a horford fl j noah fl
