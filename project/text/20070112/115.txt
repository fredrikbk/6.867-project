weekend journal taste scenes from the exhibitionists some of my best friends are women heck i am a woman but ive come to the conclusion that weve seen too much of the fairer sex for me the final straw came last month when britney spears jauntily revealed her waxed nether regions to waiting photographers as she exited her limo britneys stunt made her the internet smash of the season but in providing americas workers with this cubicle distraction britney was doing a lot more than making her own privates public in fact britney was following to its logical end what has become the first rule of contemporary american girlhood to show that you are liberated take it off liberty means responsibility to disrobe paris hilton britneys bff best friend forever taped her sexual escapades with an ex boyfriend though even she was tactful enough to pretend that she hadnt meant for the video to go public courtney love lindsay lohan and tara reid have also staged their own wardrobe malfunctions but flashing is hardly limited to celebrities the girls next door who migrate to florida during spring break happily lift their blouses and snap their thongs for the producers of "girls gone wild " who sell their dvds to an eager public nor is it just young female flashers who are driven to expose themselves to the masses older women whether because of lingering traces of reticence or doubts about the camera readiness of their intimate anatomy use the written word to bare all there are legions of women bloggers who write about last nights bed tricks their underwear preferences and their menstrual cycles yes virginia there is a tamponblog com more sophisticated exhibitionists turn to tasteful erotic memoirs in "a round heeled woman " jane juksa gives us a detailed description of her varied sexual adventures after at age she advertised for sex in the personals of the new york review of books in "surrender " the ex balanchine dancer toni bentley tells of the spiritual transcendence she experienced during the times she had anal sex with a former lover making this the first transcendent sex ever to involve a calculator now this is the point at which the enlightened always begin grumbling whats wrong with women showing that they are "sexual beings" in this vein the show or tell all is an act of bravery demonstrating a womans determination to throw off societys taboos against full expression of her sexuality "female exhibitionism is an act of female power " richard goldstein of the village voice has written "we should redeem the slut in ourselves and rejoice in being bad girls " naomi wolf once urged but has since modified now that she has an adolescent daughter it follows that reservations about self exposure are a sign of anti sex anti woman prudery they may just be the first step in a long planned mandated return to the missionary position female frigidity and meatloaf dinners cooked and served by apron clad wives but this puritans are coming stance validating as it does someone as cracked as paris hilton finally implodes the problem with a britney or a bentley is not that they are floozies it is rather that they are paradoxical as it might seem naive they underestimate the magnetic force field created by intimate sexual information and violate the logic of privacy that should be all the more compelling in a media driven age people in the public eye always risk becoming objectified they are watched by hordes of strangers who have only fragmentary information about them when that information includes details that only their brazilian waxers should know for sure its inevitable that humans being the perverse creatures that they are all other facts of identity will fall away instead of becoming freer the exhibitionist becomes an object defined primarily by a narrow sexual datum the writer daphne merkin offers the perfect cautionary tale about the dangers of giving the public too much information in merkin published an essay in the new yorker describing the erotic pleasure she found in spanking her sensational article hardly stalled her career if anything it increased her name recognition understandably ms merkin doesnt regret her essay which she continues to believe to be "both intellectually and emotionally daring " but she kids herself when she says "im known more for the rigor of my thinking than i am for revelations about my erotic preferences " her article is still the major fact of her public identity she will forever and always be daphne likes to be spanked merkin this is not because the shocked public wants ms merkin to cover herself up it is because ms merkin has invited us to know her by information that has far more power than her insights into virginia woolf it was doubtless for this reason that susan sontag hesitated to write about her romantic relationship with the photographer annie leibovitz after her death many accused sontag of cowardice and hypocrisy for avoiding the l word but this seems an unlikely charge a woman who braved the brutes of kosovo sontag was probably less fearful of having it known that she was in love with a woman than of having it become the defining trait of her public identity she must have dreaded being boxed in as the "lesbian writer susan sontag " note that sontag never shied from advancing a public persona on her own terms on the contrary that famous shock of white hair brashly announced that she was a woman with a talent for self dramatization but as an authority on the camera as well as on western literature she knew that the public gaze was always inclined to trivialize the complexities of identity some people believe that it is lingering misogyny rather than naive exhibitionism that leads the public to define women by their sexual anatomy and proclivities perhaps there is something to that but the exhibitionism surely doesnt help it seems that men despite their reputation as braggarts actually dont find self exposure all that appealing where are the male counterparts to britney spears and "girls gone wild" jessica cutler the d c sex blogger known as washingtienne and a one time congressional intern is now being sued for &# million by one of her gentleman callers who for some reason preferred that his bedroom antics remain well in the bedroom in the highbrow world philip roth clearly writes autobiographical novels but it took a bitter ex wife the actress claire bloom to rip off the fictional veil and give us the private roth tom stoppard interviewed recently for the new york times magazine by daphne merkin she once wrote an article about being spanked by the way hopes that his biography will be "as inaccurate as possible i flinch when i see my name in the newspapers " why men have become more discreet than women assuming they have is one of those cultural mysteries that is yet to be solved but the fairer sex might want to take a lesson from mr stoppard who notes that its not any sense of modesty that makes him reticent rather it "has to do with not making myself available " to throw your intimate self before the public is to risk having your identity mauled by a mob of hyenas and you will probably suffer for it as samuel beckett said to doris lessings lover when he heard that the novelist had used him as a model for one of her characters "identity is so fragile how did you ever survive " he peered at the man "or did you " ms hymowitz is a contributing editor of city journal her book "marriage and caste in america" was published in november
