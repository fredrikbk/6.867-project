nyses designs on tokyo purchase of a stake in indian exchange could offer road map tokyo nyse group inc s move to buy part of indias leading stock exchange could provide a template for an even bigger deal in asia in which it has expressed an interest an alliance with the tokyo stock exchange nyse which operates the new york stock exchange wednesday said it will buy of the national stock exchange of india ltd for &# million three other investors including new york brokerage firm goldman sachs group inc will buy similar stakes giving the investment syndicate a stake in the exchange the nyse and the tse the worlds two largest stock markets have been talking off and on in recent weeks about a possible alliance which might eventually include taking stakes in each other such a deal would unite two megaexchanges that house some of the worlds biggest and most powerful corporations and could give them a commanding lead as stock exchanges race to create a global platform speculation has mounted in recent weeks that an agreement of some kind will be announced soon perhaps when tse president taizo nishimuro visits new york this month a person familiar with the situation said a preliminary arrangement could be announced as early as this month to develop products together or explore technology sharing which might eventually lead to a more formal deal a tse spokesman said the purpose of mr nishimuros visit is a celebration of the th anniversary of the establishment of the exchanges representative office in new york he added that the tse has no plans to announce an agreement in the near future nyse chief executive john thain who recently crafted a deal to merge with pan european exchange operator euronext nv has repeatedly said he wants to extend his companys alliances to asia especially japan one immediate challenge to a potential capital alliance has been that the tse isnt publicly traded which means nyse cant simply buy shares of the japanese exchange on the open market nyses investment in india however could provide a road map for skirting that problem like the tse indias nse is owned mostly by the banks and brokerage firms that used to be its members and it isnt publicly traded to buy the shares nyse found financial institutions that wanted to reduce their holdings that model could work in a deal with the tse investment bankers said though they added that the japanese exchange likely wouldnt agree unless it was allowed to take a corresponding stake in the nyse the tse converted into a stock company on nov but it doesnt expect to sell shares publicly until though most of its shareholders each hold less than of the company a handful have more than with three holding more than those institutions might be persuaded to reduce their stakes even if nyse took a stake in the tse it is unlikely to get more than a minority stake that is because japanese regulations prohibit a single investor from buying more than of a stock exchange without government approval but an investment might still be worthwhile observers say giving nyse a first mover advantage and the benefits of ownership in one of the worlds most active stock markets aaron lucchetti in new york contributed to this article
