breakingviews financial insight on sports stars and ceos executives who invoke posh pay like beckhams are way out of bounds some ceos like to point to the heaps of cash carried home by sports stars to justify their own swollen paychecks british soccer star david beckhams &# million deal will provide them more grist for this spurious mill but the argument is wide of the goalposts the market for sports talent is actually more efficient than the opaque bazaar in which executive compensation is set mr beckhams new employer the los angeles galaxy could teach bob nardellis former colleagues a thing or two a few weeks ago both mr beckham and the then boss of home depot were each embroiled in their own compensation negotiations both ended up wealthier yet mr beckham came out with honor too mr nardelli just looks greedy and his former paymasters foolish on average ceos earn more than pro athletes but mr beckhams compensation is not unprecedented a handful of top players such as the yankees alex rodriguez atlanta falcons michael vick or the miami heats shaquille oneal also enjoy nine figure contracts that bests all but the highest paid bosses the economics behind the galaxys offer for the former real madrid midfielder are understandable its betting mr beckhams fame and remaining talent will help boost the licensing broadcasting and ticket revenue of the team and the popularity of soccer in america generally mr beckhams success or failure on the field and therefore the value of his contract to his employers will soon become apparent by contrast its incredibly hard to assess a ceos contribution to corporate values as a result except for leagues with salary caps pro athletes pay is set in a highly competitive and transparent market there are many knowledgeable bidders for assets with well documented track records a players value is measured in goals runs or touchdowns there are fewer tangible benchmarks for ceos their pay is set by committees of directors some of whom may be cronies as was the case at home depot with a little help from compensation consultants to be sure many ceos earn every penny of their pay most likely theyre also not the ones comparing themselves with sports heroes surprise from the bank most fed watchers expect a rate cut this year but if the bank of england is any indication they will be disappointed for the second time in a year britains central bank surprised the markets with an increase in its overnight interest rate why the british economy is healthy and inflation is too high sound familiar economists have consistently underestimated how seriously the bank of england takes the risk of inflation true markets were beginning to expect an increase in february but the market worried too much about the threat of a u s slowdown and put too much credence in the idea that the u k economy is too fragile to bear a hike easy money is the last thing britain needs the bank is supposed to follow the consumer price index which is rising at a rate but the retail price index rpi which includes mortgage interest expense is a more accurate measure of prices it is rising at an alarming rate whats more house prices were up a tenth in bank loans grew the conclusion britain suffers from a liquidity glut given the inflationary pressures hardly looks high at all measured against the rpi real interest rates are still only this latest hike is unlikely to be the last for the current cycle the bank of england isnt alone the european central bank kept rates steady on thursday but eurozone growth is strong and liquidity is abundant a rate boost is likely in march with more to come japan will also continue to creep toward financial normalcy that means higher rates and the u s unless that long expected slowdown hits soon and hard the federal reserve may have to follow the british example dwight cass and edward hadas this column is written by breakingviews com an online financial commentary site
