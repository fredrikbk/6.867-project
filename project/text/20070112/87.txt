politics &amp economics succession issue stirs dissent in egypt growing chorus of activists accuses mubarak regime of filtering out opposition cairo egypt egyptian journalist ibrahim essa believes his phone lines are tapped and says he has been advised by some friends and foes alike to tone down his writings as it stands he faces a one year prison sentence the reason mr essa says the mubarak regime wants to intimidate him for among other things harshly criticizing the current president and raising a stink about who egypts next president might be mr essa worries it could be gamal mubarak son of president hosni mubarak a prospect mr essa loathes "the issue of succession will be a watershed in egypt " says mr essa "continuing with hosni mubarak in office is a disaster but passing power on to gamal mubarak is an even bigger disaster " detractors blame the mubarak regime for the unemployment poverty and corruption afflicting egypt and claim it has no intention of loosening its grip on power the president has recently asked parliament to amend some constitutional articles in part to encourage more political participation by opposition parties but the opposition is skeptical there will be real liberalization and while president mubarak sees his regime as a stabilizing force in the middle east and egypt remains a main u s ally in the region many feel cairos clout as a peacemaker and power broker has waned amid the rising influence of hard liners such as iran mr essa is part of a growing group of egyptian activists talking publicly about a topic the regime would probably like to see left alone even as private discussion and speculation over what has become known as the "inheritance scenario" have burgeoned the year old president mubarak won a fifth six year term in office in elections as he grew older his long standing refusal to name a vice president fueled speculation that he was leaving the way clear for his year old son to succeed him it only fed the rumor mill further when the younger mr mubarak the second son of the president began taking on higher profile public roles rising rapidly through the ranks of the ruling national democratic party until he became its deputy secretary general last year he visited the white house for talks that were unannounced until an arab station broke the news meanwhile critics say the regime has been cracking down on opposition figures in part to eliminate possible challengers to the younger mubarak they say the regime wants to bill him as the only alternative to the islamist muslim brotherhood its strongest opponent secular and liberal opposition parties here pose little threat as they enjoy little popularity weakened by government restrictions and their own divisions and inability to win constituents confidence the succession issue troubling for many who hope that the end of the quarter century mubarak reign will help usher in more democracy has taken on new significance as parliament prepares to amend a constitutional article that the opposition says is tailored to filter out opponents of the ruling partys presidential candidate both mubaraks have previously denied there are plans for the son to succeed the father to his supporters gamal mubarak is a champion of political and economic overhaul and a force for change within the ruling party party members say the possibility of him becoming president isnt officially discussed but add that many of them expect it might happen gehad auda a member of the ndps policy committee says he supports having gamal mubarak at the helm he credits him with attracting fresh blood and talent to the party and with working toward establishing a popular base of support for it "hes a very good leader hes a good listener and he recognizes challenges " mr auda said critics such as mr essa say the younger mr mubarak has led a sheltered life and is too close to egypts elite business circles both problematic in a country where the gap between rich and poor is a major source of tension "he has never taken a bus never hailed a cab or haggled with a cab driver " mr essa wrote in a front page editorial that ran recently in al dustour newspaper of which he is the editor in chief "his only encounters with poor people are those with the state security informants " in another piece mr essa wrote of the political apathy gripping many here "it is difficult to persuade the people that theyre the only ones capable of changing mubarak and of stopping his son from sitting on his fathers throne for another quarter century that will see egypt waste away " mr auda sees mr essas writings on the issue as proof the regime is opening up and allowing more freedoms but the year old journalist sees the shift as a cosmetic modification of the regimes tactics rather than strategy opposition journalists say that instead of directly silencing them the regime tries to intimidate some critics and co opt others going after outspoken ones through libel suits usually filed by regime supporters others voice similar views and run into the same challenges the pro reform movement kifaya or "enough" in english helped break taboos with slogans that singled out mr mubarak and his son "oh gamal forget about inheriting office tell your father to have some shame " a group of kifaya supporters yelled in a recent protest in downtown cairo but catchy as they are kifaya protests dont usually boast a high turnout other activists have resorted to the internet dissecting mr gamals perceived ambitions on blogs or launching cyber initiatives to block the prospect other egyptians have used comedy to express their opposition all this is a far cry from the egypt in which the president and his family long were immune from public criticism in recent years the push for democracy and some regional changes as well as a clique of new satellite channels independent newspapers and internet blogs providing opponents with a podium have helped push the envelope when mr essas al dustour newspaper opened in it had to tiptoe around sensitive issues "it was known in all of egypt that the president constituted a red line " he said "so to get around this we would write a story for instance about the people surrounding the president instead " in al dustour was ordered shut out of work mr essa wrote a novel in about a ruler who was killed in his sleep and who had wanted to install his son after him "i set up this story in egypt with all its details " mr essa said "but of course i didnt say so in writing for reasons you know " still more than copies of the novel were confiscated he said but some were leaked and he managed to privately sell a few hundred more since al dustour has been closed nine papers that mr essa attempted to launch or was involved with were blocked or banned one way or another he said a television show he presented on a private egyptian channel was pulled off the air after the owner was subjected to "economic pressure" by the government mr essa added but with the country abuzz with talk of liberalization al dustour was allowed to publish again in mr essas novel "the assassination of the big man " was also reprinted and distributed then in june a court sentenced mr essa and a journalist at his newspaper to a year in prison on charges of libeling president mubarak mr essa has appealed the sentence mr essa says he has little illusion that his writings can rouse ordinary egyptians from the helplessness he feels is gripping many but adds that he wont stop exposing issues such as the succession "egypt is going through a historical situation and its my job as an intellectual to help change this situation " he said "we talk and the government talks i may go to jail because i talk "
