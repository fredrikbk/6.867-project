california emissions target hands task to industry california gov arnold schwarzeneggers plan to require a cut in the carbon content of its transportation fuels embodies a strategy to combat global warming that is likely to become more common around the world instead of mandating the rollout of specific technologies such as electric cars or ethanol pumps california has set an emissions related target and says it will leave it up to industry to figure out how to meet it in doing so it is taking a political gamble that the hands off approach will unleash fights of economic self interest among various industries fights that will in the end force industry to support a broad economywide cap on carbon emissions the broader the effort the cheaper it is likely to be for any given company to cut its carbon emissions gov schwarzenegger this week said he plans to issue an executive order calling for the state to reduce the carbon intensity of passenger vehicle fuels by the state expects that will translate into replacing of californias on road gasoline consumption with lower carbon fuels that would more than triple the amount of alternative fuels consumed on california roads today the state says today the vast majority of alternative transportation fuel in california as across the u s is corn based ethanol that is blended with conventional gasoline central to californias plan is the creation of a market in which fuel producers can reduce their cost of compliance by buying and selling carbon "credits " under the plan transportation fuel sold in california will be subject to a ceiling on the amount of carbon it can emit per unit of energy it contains the limit will take into account the carbon produced throughout the fuels entire "life cycle" from the making of the fuel to its consumption in a car or truck that means california is pushing not just for any alternative fuels but for those that are the most energy efficient that makes certain types of ethanol for instance more attractive than others though the details have yet to be worked out producers whose fuel has a lower carbon content than the standard will have excess emission credits they can sell on a market those whose fuel is too high in carbon will have to buy extra credits oil producers chevron corp and conocophillips expressed support for the broad intent of the new california rule the industry increasingly has concluded it will get slapped with some sort of carbon cap and based on the broad outlines it has seen so far it thinks californias approach is as flexible an offer as the industrys likely to get "the good news is its not picking winners and losers " says joe sparano president of the western states petroleum association the oil industrys sacramento based trade group the group itself hasnt taken a position because it faces its own carbon rule the oil industry in california is likelier to support such policies throughout the country while stressing his organization doesnt endorse a national global warming emission cap mr sparano said a national emissions trading market would be beneficial "so that california companies are not unfairly disadvantaged " for its own competitive reasons the auto industry is talking even more bullishly about californias push for lower carbon fuels auto makers already face a california mandate to reduce global warming emissions from the cars and trucks they sell in the state by roughly by a law the industry has sued to block arguing it amounts to a state effort to regulate automotive fuel economy which is barred by federal law yet the auto industry is under mounting pressure to reduce the oil consumption of its fleet so over the past year it has promised to ramp up its production of versions of its conventional vehicles that have been tweaked so they can run mostly on ethanol for auto makers the california low carbon fuels rule is a welcome way to ensure an increased supply of ethanol for those vehicles general motors corp hasnt taken an official position on the california low carbon fuel rule said david barthmuss a gm spokesman but he noted when gov schwarzeneggers office asked gm what the auto maker thought about the fuels rule "we told them we think fuels like this are very important to the vehicles and technologies were putting on the road right now " the fact that the oil and auto industries each for their own reasons are endorsing the notion of applying emissions regulations broadly across the economy highlights the divide and conquer strategy at the heart of californias approach said hal harvey director of the environment program at the william and flora hewlett foundation and a close adviser to california officials in coming up with the fuels plan "when you have two giant politically powerful industries aiming their arrows at each other its possible to get things done "
