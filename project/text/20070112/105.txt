weekend journal hollywood report spinning lance armstrong biopics makers wrestle with tabloid details its not a puff piece the internationally renowned cyclist lance armstrong won a record seven tours de france beat testicular cancer and has sold tens of millions of yellow wristbands to raise money for cancer related causes it sounds like the makings of a heroic hollywood movie which is why sony corp s columbia pictures has spent several years developing a film based on mr armstrongs autobiography "its not about the bike " but while mr armstrong remains a revered athletic champion his once pristine public image now includes a lot of items that are indeed not about the bike since his retirement from professional cycling in he has gone through a high profile divorce a relationship with rocker sheryl crow that ended just before she was diagnosed with breast cancer and allegations that he engaged in doping to help his career lately there have been tabloid tales about his life on the hollywood party circuit with wingmen like actor matthew mcconaughey whats clear is that the planned film will cover his early career his battle with cancer his marriage and first tour victory how to address the latter years is a work in progress which leaves the question what kind of movie will the lance armstrong story be a "chariots of fire" style tale of inspiration through athletics or something as one person connected to the project suggested to mr armstrong himself along the lines of "raging bull " the gritty and often unflattering film about boxer jake la motta though theyre loath to discuss the specifics of an unfinished script the filmmakers promise an unvarnished approach "its not a puff piece " says frank marshall the longtime producer who plans to direct the biopic "this is not going to be lance the beauty queen " its not easy to make a movie about a living subject figures depicted by hollywood rarely have contractual approvals over the finished product say studio executives and mr armstrong is no exception but a portrayal whose subject found it denigrating could distance himself or herself from the film causing embarrassment and possibly a marketing setback for the studio involved "youre not going to make a project that looks down on who they are " says columbia production president matt tolmach who was part of the team that worked on the muhammad ali movie "ali" and now is overseeing the armstrong film another concern price no budget has been set for the planned film but any number is likely to reflect the spotty track record of biopics at the box office with &# million in domestic ticket sales the johnny cash story "walk the line" is among the best performing films of the genre others like the ray charles story "ray " "gandhi" and the recent "marie antoinette " garnered good reviews but didnt do quite as well financially the armstrong movie has been a long time coming after the publication of "its not about the bike " which quickly became a best seller producers writers and studios made about offers to turn mr armstrongs life into a movie recalls bill stapleton his longtime business manager but mr armstrong who didnt see any upside to the project kept saying no mr stapleton says the cyclist wasnt available to comment for this article but mr stapleton argued that the right biopic could be inspirational for people and help raise awareness about cancer that hit home for mr armstrong who had established a foundation for cancer education and research in shortly after his own illness had ended the organization called the lance armstrong foundation is now a thriving operation that advocates for cancer patients and has sold more than million yellow bracelets inscribed with the athletes motto "livestrong" inadvertently creating an international fashion statement and helping raise &# million along the way so in mr stapleton called mr marshall a friend and business associate who had produced movies like "raiders of the lost ark" and "the bourne identity " to ask for guidance "we dont ever have to do a movie " mr stapleton recalls saying "if we do it " he added "i dont want it to be a movie of the week " mr marshall began circulating the book in hollywood gauging studio interest not long after he met with mr stapleton and columbias mr tolmach a cyclist himself to discuss the idea the three joked about the production executives permanently shaved legs the calling card of a serious rider privately though mr tolmachs love of the sport made him a little leery he didnt want to embrace the wrong movie just because it was about riding "as much as i love cycling i also really love my job " he says but sonys chairman amy pascal agreed that "its not about the bike" had the potential to cut through the world of cycling and create a compelling human drama another tempting factor the actor matt damon who had met with messrs marshall and armstrong on the berlin set of "the bourne supremacy" to discuss playing the role in columbia bought the option giving mr stapleton a producer credit and agreeing to share profits with him and mr armstrong after the movie was released then scott silver whose work mr tolmach had admired on the eminem biopic " mile " was hired right off the bat the writer brought up the martin scorsese directed boxing epic "raging bull " recalls mr tolmach making clear his intention to do a nuanced take on the cyclists life mr armstrong was enthused about the "raging bull" idea even if it revealed his dark side say associates he told mr marshall that anything covered in his autobiography was fair game at points in his early career says mr marshall "he was a jerk " his business manager was on board too "its going to address the complicated person that lance is " says mr stapleton still a number of high profile developments came after "its not about the bike" that could prove tricky in the filmmaking process in following the birth of three children mr armstrong divorced his wife kristin a key player in the autobiography he was later engaged to ms crow only to break up with her weeks before her unexpected diagnosis with breast cancer allegations that mr armstrong had used a banned substance during the tour a notion he adamantly denies also were dogging him and his shirtless runs with mr mcconaughey plus numerous spottings at exclusive hollywood parties have turned the retired cyclist into a tabloid staple in the current draft of the script which mr silver delivered late last year both the doping issue and the latter tour victories play a role says mr stapleton but the divorce does not "the movie will probably end in " he says and may make brief note of the victories that followed still the film is a work in progress mr silver is reworking some aspects of the script and the studio hopes to deliver a more finished version to mr damon some time this year mr damon who worked closely with mr marshall on the "bourne" movies expressed an interest in playing mr armstrong early on the filmmakers say although nothing has been put in writing its understood that the actor will have a right of first refusal on the role they add "we would love nothing more than for matt damon to play this part " says mr tolmach associates of mr damon say hes definitely interested but not formally committed ultimately the studio is optimistic about mr armstrongs reaction to the project "theres an understanding" between the studio and a subject like mr armstrong when it comes to a biopic says mr tolmach "why would you want to make a movie he wasnt happy with " corrections &amp amplifications cyclist lance armstrong and his wife kristin armstrong divorced in the hollywood report in fridays weekend journal erroneously stated that the divorce had occurred after mr armstrongs retirement from professional cycling wsj january
