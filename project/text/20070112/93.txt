options scandal the company hoped to put behind it last month apple admitted last month that records relating to a board meeting authorizing a lucrative stock options grant to chief executive steve jobs had been "improperly" created and that a meeting hadnt taken place on the day the records said it had people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal that the false documentation was created by apple attorney wendy howell who in turn contends that former apple general counsel nancy heinen instructed her to make the false documentation ms howell was quietly dismissed last month and ms heinen left apple last may for unrelated reasons a source tells the journal the securities and exchange commission and federal prosecutors have opened both criminal and civil probes into apples options practices which included improper backdating that apple acknowledged last year and now investigators are focusing on the grant to mr jobs that was the subject of the false records they want to question ms howell and ms heinen but the journal reports neither has thus far agreed to be interviewed by the authorities authorities also want to talk with former apple finance chief fred anderson and the journal says it isnt clear whether he too will agree to talk mr andersons attorney tells the journal his client played no day to day role in "the granting reporting and accounting of stock options and he was not involved in any knowing manipulation of the process " ms howells attorney said she "acted as instructed by apple management and with the companys best interest being paramount " and ms heinens attorney said she didnt knowingly engage in any wrongdoing and denies instructing ms howell to falsify documents moreover the lawyer said "each of the option grants involving ms heinen

secretary and that was cambodia and when our government lied to the american people and said we didnt cross the border going into cambodia in fact we did i happen to know something about that as do some on this committee so madame secretary when you set in motion the kind of policy that the president is talking about here its very very dangerous matter of fact i have to say madame secretary that i think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam if its carried out i will resist it " republican sen chuck hagel a veteran of the war in vietnam said yesterday to secretary of state condoleezza rice during a foreign relations committee hearing on the administrations plans for iraq "were going to be to a certain extent the prisoners of anyone who wants to strap on a bomb and blow themselves up " defense secretary robert gates said yesterday when asked by a reporter how and when americans will know whether president bushs new plans for iraq are working "but if but if the environment in baghdad improves to the point where the political process can go forward where the reconciliation process can go forward where an oil law can be passed for the distribution of the revenues from the oil sales where provincial elections can go forward and where the government is actually beginning to make its writ felt outside baghdad and we see the government of iraq beginning to operate more effectively i think all of these things as the president said last night and as i suggested this morning it isnt going to be like anything weve experienced before in terms of when well know whether or not were being successful its going to take a little time and we will probably have a better view a couple of months from now in terms of whether we are making headway in terms of getting better control of baghdad with the iraqis in the lead and with the iraqis beginning to make better progress on the reconciliation process " write to david hall at david hall wsj com
