the daily fix can beckham score in mls and sell soccer to americans on the pitch apart from his famous wife fashionable wardrobe and unaccountable celebrity david beckham is a formerly top flight soccer player who appears to have begun his decline in his nd year he made his first appearance for manchester united in during the next fifteen years he won six premiership titles in england before joining real madrid along with other international stars galacticos they were called in meanwhile he scored goals in appearances with the national team leading england three times to the world cups final and twice to the quarterfinals but no further compared to other players in the worlds best leagues his performance in the free flow of play has never been much better than ordinary but meticulous practice combined with natural ability to make beckham free kicks corners and penalties among the best struck balls in the world hence the name of the film "bend it like beckham" and not "dribble like beckham" or "defend like beckham" after playing a role in four of englands world cup goals this past summer beckham was dropped from the national team and from real madrids starting lineup with his contract expiring he spurned offers from real and other top european clubs according to the independents sam wallace to move to u s major league soccers los angeles galaxy in july how much of beckhams total value to the galaxy to mls and to u s soccer is derived from his soccer skills once sublime but now on the wane the question isnt rhetorical the answer is more or less one fifth beckham will make &# million over five years with &# million of that covering his on field salary and the rest expected from endorsements and a share of club ticket revenue and merchandise sales the print journals aaron o patrick jonathan weinbach and keith johnson have more on the financial side of the deal yet the guardians simon talbot insists money isnt the primary motivator for the former manchester united star instead it is his football legacy "beckham had watched film of the world cup final and thought to himself that could be me " mr talbot writes "his tears this summer were born not just of englands failure but also of the realisation that it was his last chance and he had failed to leave a mark on another tournament it was that desire to stand out that took him to real madrid in the first place and it is that desire to leave his mark that takes him to the u s now if the glamour is seductive far more so is the opportunity to achieve something historic and make football a major sport in the united states to achieve something that johan cruyff franz beckenbauer and george best could not achieve something even pele was unable to do " mr talbot isnt the only columnist to recall other big names who have tried and failed to sell new team sports to an american public seemingly content to stick with baseball basketball and football "soccer has been here before a sport perpetually on the cusp of exploding in america " tim lemke writes in the washington times "pele and franz beckenbauer in the s brandi chastain and world cup champion women bruce arena and the cinderella mens team of freddy adu all were supposed to push soccer over the top to success and all failed now its beckhams turn " "this has been tried here before remember " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "a big star showed up to sell a secondary sport and it worked for a while but once that star disappeared so did the sport guy by the name of gretzky beckhams job is to be greater than the great one " san francisco chronicle columnist bruce jenkins says thats mission impossible "the mls could bring in ronaldinho didier drogba cristiano ronaldo thierry henry and the entire roster of italys world cup winning team without changing the american perspective were too set in our ways we prefer our own football and we like sports that employ the use of hands " times of london columnist simon barnes who witnessed a failed cricket tour of north america says that the love of a sport must be embedded within a culture "beckham can kiss all he likes and football will not awake in america " mr barnes writes "that is because football is not actually present in american culture and is therefore unavailable for the kissing sah kurr is a game for children women and hispanics and beckham will not change that perception " but si coms grant wahl is more hopeful pointing out that beckhams arrival and the so called "beckham rule" allowing for one big salary per team could pave the way for other stars not perhaps italys entire roster but more likely ronaldo "landing beckham gives mls a credibility that it has never had with the american sports fan who demands to see the worlds biggest stars in the sports it cares about " mr wahl writes and how will the u s greet beckham on and off the pitch with uncertainty and curiosity at least by residents of carson calif where the galaxy who missed the playoffs last year play their home games los angeles daily news reporter gene maddaus gathers reaction from carson residents such as "who is the guy i heard something on the news he must be the babe ruth of soccer " and "did he do a movie i didnt see the movie i just remember the name " beckham will also have to get used to "a different footballing universe " phil shaw writes in the independent "the galaxy share their state of the art seat stadium which is situated on a university campus with club deportivo chivas usa chivas who have targeted las mexican community have the slogan adios soccer el futbol esta aqui goodbye soccer footballs here beckham steeped in the rivalries of manchester and madrid should relish the only mls derby even though it carries the cringe worthy sponsored title of the honda superclassico " for the newest and highest paid mls player to make an impact in these strange new environs hell have to succeed on the pitch predictions on that score are split "in major league soccer he might get away with his relative lack of movement he remains an earnest industrious performer and he still has an ability to guide a ball long distances with laser like precision " rob hughes writes in the international herald tribune "but on the ball he is far from hypnotic he lacks speed and grace he does not command comparison in any way to ronaldinho to the younger men real is now signing in his place to countless truly world class pros in the world game " the guardians david hannigan predicts some great moments and some jostling from resentful lower paid opponents "his dead ball skills will be easy fodder for the producers of the highlight reels on espn and at least once over the next while somebody somewhere will prompt a rash of headlines speculating about an nfl team wanting him to try out as a place kicker " mr hannigan writes but he adds "he may also discover that in a league where the average salary is less than &# and rookie players sometimes draw as little as &# envious peers best articulate their feelings through robust treatment freddy adu found that out to his cost and the ghana born teenage prodigy now with real salt lake earns a mere &# a year beckham will be trousering that much each week " he willingly signed that contract but he cant be blamed for the celebrity that makes up four fifths of his present value "this charming man who does so much unheralded charity work and remains remarkably sane despite the circus around him will continue to fascinate people but not as a footballing institution " henry winter writes in the daily telegraph "the legs have gone but not the legend " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com
