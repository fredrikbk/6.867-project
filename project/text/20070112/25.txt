earmark entertainment speaking of earmarks democrats are having their own problems cleaning up bad spending habits and thats after only a few days in power yesterday on the senate floor majority leader harry reid was caught pulling out every stop to kill his own partys plan for earmark reform to speaker nancy pelosis credit house democrats recently passed ethics legislation that included provisions making earmarks more transparent the house bill included a broad definition of earmarks thereby making it harder to hide them in say last minute conference reports it also requires members to file a public disclosure form when they request an earmark and to state that neither they nor their spouses will financially benefit its hard to argue that this is anything but elementary good government unless you are harry reid the ethics reform offered by senate democrats contained none of these tougher earmark provisions so senate republicans led by south carolinas jim demint cheekily took the identical language of the house earmark bill and offered it as an amendment to the senate version numerous democrats instantly denounced it apparently unaware or unconcerned that the language had been sponsored by ms pelosi democrat dick durbin then moved to table the amendment though he lost by to of the senators who voted to banish ms pelosis reform of them were her fellow democrats the seven republicans who went along with mr reid included some of the gops biggest spenders trent lott and members of the appropriations committee aka earmark central station when senator demint then moved to have his amendment accepted by voice vote which is customary mr durbin objected the effect of these procedural run arounds was to give mr reid more time to twist a few more democratic arms into killing earmark reform by our deadline last night he still hadnt succeeded though senate sources told us that mr reid was considering filing for cloture on the entire ethics bill thereby foreclosing a vote on the current demint amendment if he prevails voters will know just much "fiscal discipline" to expect from the new majority
