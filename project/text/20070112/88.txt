rapid plunge in price of oil may fuel growth though still expensive crude has fallen from julys record high oil prices fell sharply yesterday and are now hovering at their lowest levels since mid raising the prospect of significant changes in the outlook for corporate profits consumer spending and the global economy crude oil fell another &# or to &# a barrel yesterday on the new york mercantile exchange the price has plunged since the year began and hasnt closed as low since may oil is now down from its record finish of &# on july the slide which market participants said was fueled in part by speculative hedge fund trading and a retreat by other investors helped send stocks higher as investors bet lower energy prices would fatten corporate profits and strengthen economic growth particularly in the u s the worlds leading oil consumer the dow jones industrial average jumped points or to a record close of the price of oil tends to be volatile and it could bounce back quickly but if sustained the decline in prices would have a big impact on everything from the american consumer to the profits of giant energy companies it also could dent the revenues and the political clout of major oil producing nations like russia iran and venezuela a senior official of the organization of petroleum exporting countries said yesterday that opec will consider the need for an emergency meeting to weigh what it should do to halt the price slide opec already was cutting back its production sharply the official said he didnt specify whether the cartel would consider cuts beyond the million barrels a day it has already pledged to remove from the market if lower oil prices lead to a reduction in what american consumers spend on gasoline it would leave them with more money for all kinds of discretionary purchases such as restaurant meals movies and vacations that spending could provide a welcome cushion for the u s economy which is grappling with a sharp downturn in the housing sector it could also give a boost to airlines and auto makers which have been hurt by high fuel prices as yet the drop in oil prices hasnt produced much relief at the gas pump regular gasoline is selling at a nationwide average of &# a gallon down from more than &# this summer in many parts of the country but just a penny less than in december according to auto club aaa nonetheless oils pullback "is coming at a great moment for the u s economy " says ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers in new york who estimates that each &# reduction in oil prices adds about a half percentage point to annualized growth in inflation adjusted gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity "youre worried about this one two punch from housing first construction collapses and then the consumer collapses lower energy prices are acting as a sort of smelling salt " mr harris said indeed many economists credit the retreat of energy prices from their summer peaks for a recent bout of stronger than expected economic performance nonfarm payrolls in the u s grew by a seasonally adjusted jobs in december and economists expect inflation adjusted consumer spending to have grown more than in the fourth quarter of that has led some to raise their estimates of inflation adjusted gdp growth in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of more than compared with forecasts of about just a month ago the added impetus for the u s economy could change the picture for the federal reserve which is trying to keep short term interest rates high enough to keep inflation under control but not so high as to cripple the economy in recent months prices in bond and futures markets have suggested that investors expect a slowing economy and receding inflation pressures to allow the fed to lower interest rates in as oil prices have fallen though those expectations have changed "if this acts like a tax cut and consumers spend a lot of it then it just makes the fed more and more likely to stay on hold and to watch carefully what happens to inflation " said richard berner chief u s economist at morgan stanley in new york in futures markets yesterday investors placed a probability on the fed lowering short term interest rates to by july from the current that was down from wednesday the strength of the u s and global economies is one reason many doubt oil prices will remain weak for long "i would expect to see the market bounce back " said nariman behravesh chief economist at consulting firm global insight "the fundamental in terms of the oil market is demand growth which comes from economic growth from that perspective we dont see any further weakening " analysts attribute lower oil prices in part to the fact that with the start of the new year many large institutional investors such as pension funds have been pulling back from energy investments also unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the u s spilled into january temporarily reducing oil demand if it continues however the current drop in oil prices would create a number of winners and losers companies whose fortunes depend on heavy oil consumption from auto makers to airlines could see their profits grow on the other hand oil companies would see their earnings fall and investors that bet big on rising oil prices could find themselves in trouble lower oil prices are "a plus for us " said paul ballew top sales analyst at general motors corp noting that higher oil prices significantly crimped auto demand last year gm is a top producer of gas guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and is counting on big sales of its new chevrolet silverado the auto maker has blitzed the airwaves with ads for the pickup during football games auto makers suffered as sales of profitable trucks and suvs plummeted during the second half of gasoline prices that hovered around &# a gallon pushed consumers away from those vehicles especially suvs light truck sales dropped nearly in according to autodata corp even lower prices at the pump however wouldnt be a panacea for gm ford motor co or daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group gm and ford which have reported billion dollar losses are in the midst of restructuring plans that include worker buyouts and chrysler which reported a &# billion loss in last years third quarter is set to announce a restructuring plan next month rising oil prices over the past several years have transformed the cost structure of the u s airline industry causing jet fuel to displace labor costs as the industrys no expense for every penny decrease in the price of a gallon of jet fuel the u s airline industry saves as much as &# million in costs annually at amr corp s american airlines the worlds largest carrier by passenger traffic that amounts to a saving of &# million a year or &# million each time crude oil prices drop by &# per barrel "a drop of any amount is clearly good for the industry but its still really high " said john heimlich chief economist of the air transport association a trade group for u s airlines cheaper oil would sharply lower earnings of major oil producing nations including those in opec leo drollas deputy director of londons international centre for global energy studies estimates that opecs members earned &# billion in up from &# billion in assuming a fall of about &# a barrel in oil prices on average this year and lower output to shore up prices mr drollas estimates that opec export revenues would fall to &# billion this year but if prices average about what they are now for all of the export earnings of opec countries leaving out angola which just joined jan would fall to levels or less if the exporters group slashed output further to support prices major oil companies are also likely to see shrinking earnings from their oil production operations the largest source of income for integrated oil companies like exxon mobil corp bp plc royal dutch shell chevron corp and others yesterday the new york stock exchange index of energy shares was down from a recent peak on dec over that period exxon mobil shares have fallen bp shares have shed and chevron is down mike spector and melanie trottman contributed to this article
