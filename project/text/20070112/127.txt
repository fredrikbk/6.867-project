withdrawal treatment a novel plan helps hospital wean itself off pricey tests it cajoles big insurer to pay a little more for cheaper therapies seattle virginia mason medical center has made unusually aggressive moves in the past two years to cut health care costs consulting with the big insurer aetna inc along with starbucks corp and several other big local employers the hospital revamped how it treated some expensive ailments cutting down high tech tests and high end specialists but a troublesome pattern emerged the more cost effective it became the bigger financial hit the medical center took "everyone gained but virginia mason " says its chief of medicine robert mecklenburg a novel solution crafted with the help of the big employers ultimately let virginia mason share in some of the savings it created by paying the medical center more for some cheaper treatments it offers a lesson in dealing with one of the most confounding elements in americas health care crisis a perverse system of payments that rewards doctors and hospitals not for how well they treat patients but for how much they treat them insurers often reimburse high tech procedures richly while simpler remedies and visits to doctors therapists or nurses earn far less and sometimes incur losses with each mri that aetna and the employers avoided at around &# virginia mason lost about &# in profit the payment system of government sponsored medicare which private health plans also use as a template tends to reward the big capital expenses of buying high tech machines such as mris the more the machines are used the bigger profit margin they pack meanwhile reimbursement fees for doctors visits have stagnated "the payment system is so toxic " says francois de brantes a former health care program director at general electric co "unless you tackle it any health care reform doesnt have much chance " mr de brantes coordinates a program funded by employers that pays doctors bonuses based on patients outcomes even medicare has experimented recently with performance bonuses to correct a system that it acknowledges "rewards volume over quality " says herb kuhn acting deputy administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services a gamble virginia masons move is a gamble only aetna which accounts for of the medical centers business has adjusted fees to reward its more efficient care seattles two biggest health insurers regence blue shield and premera blue cross havent matched the move so far medicare despite its own experiments doesnt have the flexibility to change its payments for one hospital and it accounts for a third of virginia masons business virginia mason a not for profit that is satisfied with an annual to operating margin still hasnt replaced all its lost revenue many medical professionals also distrust letting insurers and employers have so much influence in deciding what medical guidelines to use norman latov professor of neurology at cornell universitys medical school in new york objects to presenting such innovations as being done for the good for the patient "whats driving the process is really cost " he says named for the daughters of two of its founding physicians in virginia mason routinely receives top marks for quality and patient safety in local and national report cards rating hospitals the medical center has pursued efficiency by adopting some assembly line methods of toyota motor corp and hitachi ltd which hospital officials and doctors observed on a visit to japan in for instance virginia mason rerouted patient traffic in its cancer center cutting the time patients had to wait for chemotherapy from four hours to minutes but those types of changes didnt address the cost of its care in the summer of aetna gave virginia mason a surprising warning the insurer measured the costs of medical providers in seattle and found some of virginia masons specialty practices cost up to twice as much as other top local practices for the same care aetna planned to exclude four virginia mason departments from a new network of top providers in clinical performance and efficiency to measure quality aetna crunched its claims data to see for instance how often their patients had unexpected complications it then calculated how much the doctors spent in the entire course of say treating a heart attack from the initial tests to the post treatment medications virginia mason the seattle areas third largest health care provider rated well for quality but not cost in four of the six specialties aetna measured treating a patient for a narrowing aortic valve at virginia mason cost &# on average aetna found while area cardiologists who scored in the top quarter of aetnas rankings averaged only &# aetna members with migraines received four times the number of imaging tests at virginia mason as at other top specialists patients treated for severe acid reflux at the medical center spent four times as much on medications don storey a senior medical director at aetna called on virginia masons dr mecklenburg to show him the findings taken aback dr mecklenburg proposed to go directly to aetnas big seattle employer customers to ask for a chance to improve in addition to starbucks aetnas seattle clients included locally based retail giants costco wholesale corp and nordstrom inc as well as the county government in a teleconference with them and other employers virginia mason ceo gary kaplan mentioned that patients were virginia masons most important customers a chorus of frustration erupted from the employers on the phone including starbucks benefits director annette king "yes the patients are their customer but im the customer that writes the check or most of it " she said later "to exclude me from the equation isnt right either " dr mecklenburg also had dr storey present aetnas results directly to the medical centers department heads like many doctors virginia masons physicians "didnt pay attention to the cost of care" until then says dr mecklenburg most were trained to see cost concerns as antithetical to focusing on patients needs "guys i know virginia mason and i respect you but heres how you look to the market " aetnas dr storey remembers telling the silent roomful of doctors medical maze in early the doctors met with aetna and the big employers again this time they invited the employers and the insurer to work in teams with them mapping out the medical maze patients went through and trying to eliminate wasteful steps dr mecklenburg also paid a house call to ms king at the seattle based coffee companys headquarters to ask specifically what shed like to see "i couldnt believe a doctor was making an appointment with me and asking what i wanted " she says she pushed the hospital to tackle the cost of treating back pain a big health care expense for the coffee chain as doctors studied the course of treatment of dozens of patients at virginia masons spine clinic it was clear no standard procedures were being followed though virginia mason physicians are salaried and have no direct financial incentive to run excess tests many had gotten into the habit of ordering an mri though uncomplicated back pain rarely warrants one many patients had to wait a month for appointments and often were bounced from specialist to specialist eventually some patients were directed to physical therapy and often only then began to feel relief once the inefficiencies were mapped out on paper the solution was clear to everyone ms king says put the physical therapy in front thats also what a lot of medical literature suggests the hospital made the change and also worked with its team of employers to eliminate extra steps in the medical maze for patients standardized path now patients follow a more standardized path they have an initial consultation with a physical therapist and then a doctor unless red flags suggest another course the physician often prescribes some physical therapy first the streamlining means wait times for appointments have fallen to a day within a year the percentage of people receiving mris dropped by a third to from only of patients lost time from work under the old system when thomas kundigs back pains from an old rock climbing accident would flare up hed often have to wait at least a week to get an appointment with a specialist often hed get x rays and a prescription for a temporary fix of painkillers on one occasion he had to return for an mri "its not just the money " says the seattle architect and aetna health plan member "youre thinking my god im spending all my time in the doctors office " this summer when mr kundigs pain returned the clinic had appointments available the next day after a physical therapist checked his symptoms a doctor waived the need for an mri or any prescription drugs instead he prescribed several physical therapy sessions and if necessary an occasional over the counter anti inflammatory pill after four sessions mr kundig felt better and his therapist showed him how to continue the exercises on his own "i appreciated that i didnt have to keep going back " he says "i felt they were setting me up for more of a permanent solution " the total cost &# he says his back is now better than it has been in a long time but for virginia mason losses started piling up with the new approach the spine clinics income fell from a profit of about &# per case to a loss of about &# the medical center said in virginia masons collaboration with employers they agreed to look together at how changes were affecting everyones bottom line the medical centers finance director brad senstra showed starbucks ms king the spine clinic numbers "it was pretty clear right away we couldnt let that happen " she says ms king pushed aetna to come up with a solution and the insurer agreed to increase virginia masons physical therapy reimbursements by about from about &# to &# for each minutes of therapy virginia mason says it also is able to see five times the patients it used to with fewer staff under the new system the hospital says it now breaks even and hopes the rising volume will push it more and more into the black the moves have created some tension building up the spine clinic shifted resources away from the hospitals state of the art chronic pain center that treated fewer but more complex cases and of the medical staff left aetna has begun promoting virginia masons teamwork approach to get other hospitals and specialists to be more cost effective the insurer says its in discussions with several other large medical groups across the country about forming similar working groups with employers within virginia mason medical department heads have taken some doctors to task for ordering redundant tests even though they drive up revenue in the short term in treating severe acid reflux virginia masons gastroenterologists traced their high costs back to a different source a pharmaceutical contract while doctors prescribed cheap generic drugs to patients with milder heartburn many patients who were hospitalized were on a more expensive medication the reason its hospital pharmacy had a contract for a steep discount on wyeths acid reflux medication protonix patients would continue to refill their prescriptions with protonix rather than a cheaper generic driving up costs for their employers "it was a classic case of the right arm not knowing what the left arm was doing " says jay tihinen assistant vice president of benefits at costco who worked with virginia mason on its heartburn care "they saw how low their own drug costs were but they werent looking at the end users " to stop the pattern virginia mason ended its contract and started prescribing generic pills even though it also meant the hospital lost its steep protonix discount ultimately virginia mason negotiated a lower generic price to help make up the difference also on virginia masons list was migraine treatment the migraine clinic began to give out "rescue" medications more frequently for patients to have on hand to avoid costly emergency room visits when the next migraine set in in addition doctors were coached on when and when not to order an mri reducing tests ordered for migraines from to of cases the big employers saved &# in the first year but virginia mason fell into the red on the average migraine case instead of breaking even as before now the medical center is putting together a proposal to divert some of the employers savings to pay more for the nurse practitioner at the heart of the migraine clinic "if we can come up with a proposal especially if its self financing theyll look at it " dr mecklenburg says meanwhile the medical center is watching to see whether rising patient volume will help make up the difference with that and virginia masons other changes he added "at the moment were right between the trapezes "
