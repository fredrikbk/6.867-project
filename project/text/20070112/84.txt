super bowl advertisers hand amateurs the ball inspired by youtube buzz companies stage contests for fans to make spots super bowl advertisers who pay as much as &# million to air a second spot usually have good reason to leave the creation of their ads to the professionals but with all the current buzz about "user generated content" on web sites like youtube and myspace next months game will feature three ads designed either completely or in part by ordinary people pepsico inc s doritos general motors corp s chevrolet and the national football league have run contests inviting average people to submit ideas or in the case of doritos the actual ads for the game that doesnt mean super bowl viewers will see the raw jerky footage common to amateur videos on the web and cable channels that use consumer contributions some of the advertisers have dropped hints about the ads they plan to air they are expected to look much the same as the rest of the multi million dollar spots running on the broadcast the super bowl contests show the challenge facing advertisers in using consumer generated content marketers like the idea of letting the public help make ads in hopes of creating spots that resonate more with their audience particularly young people who tend to be turned off by slickly produced spots but marketers are also reluctant to give up control concerned about the image their ads project "consumers are much wilder than the agency or the client would ever want them to be " says alex bogusky chief creative officer of mdc partners inc s crispin porter + bogusky "the stuff they create is potentially terrifying to a client " each advertiser imposed guidelines on the submissions to ensure the ads werent vulgar or obscene and were in keeping with the image they want to convey chevrolet for instance told contestants that proposed ads must end with the tagline "chevy an american revolution " the tone had to be "approachable not arrogant or offensive " in all of the contests the main prize is getting an ad on tv but there are other perks as well doritos finalists for example also get &# most of the top entries didnt come from complete amateurs the nfl contest which drew entries was won by a portsmouth n h man who was working for a sales and marketing firm doritos top five entries which can be viewed on a doritos web site came mainly from aspiring or experienced filmmakers who were mostly older than the brands to year old target audience chevrolet opened its contest only to college students while some marketers that have tried the consumer generated technique in the past couple of years have been pleased with the results others have seen it backfire chevrolet last year ran a web promotion for its tahoe vehicle that allowed consumers to add their own text to video clips of the automobile some people chose to make critical gibes about the car a chevrolet spokesman acknowledged that the company received some things that "were a little untoward " but he noted "if you never push the envelope you never learn you never progress " the super bowl which airs feb on cbs is a particularly tough venue for experimentation the game is regularly the most watched tv program of the year usually drawing roughly million people in the u s and the ads that air during the broadcast have traditionally been as much of a draw for viewers as the sport as a result marketers usually take more care with super bowl ads than any other tv spot while doritos invited people to submit completed ads chevrolet and nfl were looking only for ideas with the winning entries to be produced by professionals students entering chevys contest for instance had to submit their ad ideas in a professional layout to be judged by a group of executives from chevrolet and its ad agency campbell ewald a unit of interpublic group the nfl which has run a super bowl spot since the mid s to promote nfl football invited fans to submit ideas to be judged by nfl marketing staff with some input from members of the public voting online of the three doritos took the most hands off approach perhaps in keeping with its younger image doritos was prepared to consider anything says ann mukherjee a vice president of marketing at pepsis frito lay snack division even a spot showing somebody trashing doritos for instance part of the success of the idea she says is "the genuineness of letting people express themselves " finalists were picked based on originality creativity and the "passion" they showed for doritos she says still despite getting more than entries all of the spots in doritos final five could easily be mistaken for a typical professionally produced super bowl spot one devised by a year old wedding photographer jared cicon shows a man falling off a cliff while clutching a bag of doritos and trying to eat all the chips before he hits the ground in the end it turns out hes dreaming mr cicon says two of his sons held up air compression hoses to his face to simulate how it would look while falling through the air the winning entry wont be revealed until super bowl night when doritos broadcasts the ad in the average national second spot cost &# to produce buying ad time is a separate cost according to the american association of advertising agencies an industry trade group but super bowl ads often making use of celebrities and high end special effects would cost much more than the average mr cicon estimates the shoot for the doritos ad that made it to the finals he submitted nine in total cost around &# to produce mr cicon says he has an edge over big ad agencies he can film edit and even act "i dont have the overhead " he says "i dont have all the logistics that some companies tend to create for themselves over time and the red tape " ad notes j&amp j to move planning duties for tylenol johnson &amp johnson is expected to shift its media planning duties for its tylenol business to deutsch the
