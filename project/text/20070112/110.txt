weekend journal review theater historical hijinks new york the success of tom stoppards "the coast of utopia" continues to bemuse me how could a trilogy of plays about a group of th century russian intellectuals have become the talk of the town if such miracles are possible then perhaps "the germans in paris " jonathan leafs thought provoking comedy about the private lives of heinrich heine karl marx and richard wagner will become the sleeper hit of the off off broadway season i wouldnt bet on it but stranger things have happened mr leaf first came to my notice with "the caterers " a flawed but promising play about islamic terrorism "the germans in paris " which is being revived by verse theater manhattan after a brief run two years ago at e theatres is a very different piece of work a historical extravaganza spun out of a real life coincidence heine marx and wagner all spent time in paris where they became swept up in the same revolutionary crosscurrents described in "the coast of utopia " so far as i know marx and wagner never met but they could have and heine knew both men well upon this "travesties" like foundation of fact mr leaf has erected an elaborate superstructure of speculation whose premise suggests a joke told by an egghead did you hear the one about the poet the philosopher and the composer in america heine is mainly known as the man who wrote the words to "dichterliebe " robert schumanns famous song cycle in fact he was a great lyric poet and mr leafs portrayal of his ironic temperament deftly realized in the fine performance of jon krupp is squarely on the mark "the germans in paris" places him at the center of a farce like plot that revolves around his impending marriage to an illiterate shopgirl kathryn elisabeth lawson and his simultaneous dalliance with an upper class married woman angelica torn marx ross beschler and wagner brian wallace are turned into comic foils albeit of a sinister sort both men were monsters of vanity and wagners pathological anti semitism though played for laughs gives the punch lines an acrid aftertaste the laughter gives way to disillusion and despair as heine eventually realizes that marx is better at preaching revolution than living it and at plays end he predicts a coming apocalypse of idealism run amok "they shall take the logical statement all men shall eat and from this like devils they shall change the shape of the world that all upon the earth shall be rendered to supply every man an equal portion of black soup the future smells of blood godlessness and very many beatings i would advise our grandchildren to come into the world with a thick hide on their backs " mr leaf has woven his web of fact and fiction with enviable skill and the result is a sharp witted comedy of manners that modulates neatly into high seriousness the cast is good especially the women i cant imagine a more apt companion piece to "the coast of utopia" than "the germans in paris " and at &# a ticket its far more affordable dont dally the run is short and the theater small according to theatrical legend anybody can write a good first act i wouldnt know i definitely cant but ive definitely seen a lot of plays that were good until intermission and bad afterward "the waters edge " theresa rebecks last play was like that and so is "the scene " her black comedy about an out of work actor of a certain age tony shalhoub who trashes his marriage to an ultra competent tv producer patricia heaton by sleeping with an amoral young bimbo anna camp the first act is fast funny and more than clever enough and when the lights came back up i was sure id be filing a rave but no sooner did the cast return to the stage than the plot ran out of steam part of the problem if not most of it is that ms rebeck is a comedian who longs to be serious but doesnt seem to have anything particularly original to say midlife crises to be sure are deadly serious to those who are having them but it isnt easy to make them interesting to anyone else nor was i much moved by her preachy predictable rants about the "mindless soulless uninspired unoriginal bereft soul sucking crap" that is american pop culture i agree but who doesnt mr shalhoub and ms heaton respectively familiar to viewers of "monk" and "everybody loves raymond " prove to be first rate stage actors and ms camp whose name is new to me turns in a wickedly exact caricature of an im like you know airhead good staging by rebecca taichman nifty sets by derek mclane if only id gone home at halftime mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com the germans in paris arclight theatre e st st &# closes jan the scene second stage theatre w rd st &# closes feb
