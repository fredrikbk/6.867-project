politics &amp economics bush bets congress will have to back plan fort benning ga as president bush presses his latest iraq strategy he is gambling that the new democratic congress will give him the same broad discretion to prosecute the war that he has had for the past four years yesterday a wide number of democrats and republicans blasted the approach white house officials calculate that democrats will be stymied by practical problems legislative maneuvering and internal divisions in their attempt to prevent the administration from sending more soldiers and more money to iraq "there are a lot of divisions among the democrats and you see them tiptoeing around it because they understand the consequences of such a vote " white house counselor dan bartlett said during a trip with mr bush who was pushing his case for sending new forces to iraq in a speech to hundreds of soldiers on this military base mr bushs call to send more troops to baghdad and restive anbar province moved the white house closer to open confrontation with congress where lawmakers have been denouncing the proposal while considering whether to impose conditions on the white houses plans speaking to a roomful of troops mr bush said he planned to work with "the congress to provide all the resources you need in this war on terror " he gave no indication of willingness to accommodate congressional criticism democratic leaders hope to pass a nonbinding measure opposing the troop escalation in the senate as early as this week and are openly discussing ways to block funding for it or otherwise tying the presidents hands white house officials downplayed the possibility of congress blocking troop escalation noting that the administration has enough money to send most of the additional "surge" forces to iraq that means any democratic move to limit funding would effectively impact money used for sustaining troops already in the field the nonbinding measures criticizing the war may also face a rockier than expected path the senates top republican sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky has threatened to filibuster the surge resolution which could force democrats to soften their language or delay bringing it to a vote with polls showing the u s public highly skeptical of the new iraq approach and even many congressional republicans raising criticism democratic leaders in congress are trying to calibrate their own strategy figuring out whether to condemn the new approach or try to take firmer steps such as limiting funding or other restrictions during previous similarly unpopular conflicts lawmakers regularly passed measures dictating the way administrations should conduct military operations during the vietnam era for instance lawmakers passed measures requiring president nixon to set a timetable for withdrawing american forces from the country and barring them from being deployed into cambodia lawmakers later passed measures barring the cia from operating in angola and nicaragua in the early s congress approved legislation setting a firm timetable for the withdrawal of military personnel from somalia congress gave mr bush broad authority to wage the iraq war in and when the capitol was under republican leadership lawmakers did little to challenge the president on his handling of the conflict the new congress has said it would push to rein in the white house sen edward kennedy d mass has written an amendment that would require congressional approval for any iraq troop increase and the number of democrats supporting the measure has increased for the moment though democrats seem to be focusing on laying down a public marker opposing the troop escalation rather than trying to direct the conduct of military operations in iraq senate majority leader harry reid of nevada says he hopes to introduce a nonbinding resolution against the troop increase by the end of next week and democrats claim that as many as republican senators could support it the house plans to consider an identical measure as early as next week the administrations talk of escalating confrontation with iran and syria within iraq stirred similiarly sharp concerns leading senior democrats like senate foreign relations committee chairman joseph biden of delaware to say he was prepared to limit mr bushs authority to carry any fight outside iraqs borders "we can do just about anything given our constitutional powers of the purse " said one senate democratic leaders chief of staff "but right now politically we dont want to do anything that could be seen as shortchanging the troops in the field " indeed several newly elected democrats who had made the war a central part of their campaigns stopped short of restrictions on troop levels rep john murtha d pa chairman of the house appropriations defense subcommittee said such language could be part of future spending legislation but some democrats said they were not yet prepared to back such a measure "were not at that point yet " said rep patrick murphy a pennsylvania democrat and iraq veteran jackie calmes contributed to this article
