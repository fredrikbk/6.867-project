weekend journal tastings inexpensive chardonnay no thanks for old u s favorite the slump isnt over six good bottles in the new year is a time for new hope for second chances in that spirit we decided to conduct a new tasting of inexpensive american chardonnay chardonnay continues to be americas sweetheart far and away the most popular varietal wine in the u s it was one of our first loves too back in the s but bad things have happened since then in broad blind tastings of chardonnay for this column we have found far more bad wines than good in our most recent tasting of chardonnays under &# two years ago we found only four good ones out of more than our advice then skip the chardonnay aisle considering our own warm feelings toward chardonnay from our youth this was painful for us vintages have come and gone since then however and we decided actually it was dotties idea because she tends to be more generous and forgiving wed give inexpensive chardonnay another chance we picked up almost that cost less than &# we bought wines from the and vintages because those are the ones you are most likely to see on shelves we focused on the best known most widely available names but we also snagged a few that are a bit more obscure as always we were not looking for "americas best chardonnay " but were trying to get an overall sense of the state of inexpensive chardonnay at the moment we certainly understand why people love chardonnay when its right it has a very special easy quality with a balance of ripe fruit oak lemon and other citrus fruits good american chardonnay can fill your mouth with a kind of warm glow that lasts a very long time leaving your throat coated with a rich sometimes buttery intensity to be sure there is also something special about other chardonnay based wines from around the world the steely intensity of chablis the elemental earthiness of other white burgundies but a good american chardonnay is unique and memorable one of our best wines of was a chardonnay chasseur from hunter wine cellars &# about which we wrote "it even looks gutsy green tinged and rich refined with toast and great citrusy acidity ripe yet restrained " yummy unfortunately at some point vintners decided that they could make chardonnay on the cheap with flavorings and laboratory tricks replacing real fruit expensive oak barrels and intense care chardonnay became a caricature of itself with obvious tastes of oak vanilla alcohol and sugar replacing anything true in fact in our notes during this tasting we referred to one of our favorites clos du bois "reserve " as "pre caricature chardonnay " because it tasted of real fruit it had those comforting and comfortable tastes of nutmeg vanilla and rich fruit but they tasted real and balanced consider these notes "pleasing and plump with smooth not in your face oakiness and a bit of vanilla but relaxed without too much of anything really friendly round pleasing wine not harsh or alcoholic happy wine with a clean finish and good acidity good for a party or as a glass of wine at the bar " now really is that too much to ask for an inexpensive chardonnay apparently so because our more common comments in this tasting included "sugar water " "funky with some potty stuff " "harsh " "sweet " "no hint of real fruit " "fizzy water" and "cotton candy " if we had to sum up the taste overall of inexpensive american chardonnay today wed say the single most notable smell and flavor is pineapple with syrupy sweetness some acetate or nail polish remover far too much alcohol and a bizarre overlay of unintegrated acidity as though a big sack of industrial strength acid mixture had been dumped into the tank at the last minute to compensate for the lack of natural acidity which gives wines life and makes them food friendly if none of that sounds very attractive well yep thats right in fact of almost wines in our tasting just six rated good or better a terrible outcome what those six had in common especially our best of tasting from calera should be the simplest thing in the world tastes of honest chardonnay fruit calera made more than cases of that chardonnay by the way and it was distributed in states for now sadly we would still urge you to avoid the chardonnay aisle when you are looking for a wine under &# there are far better wines for the price all over the wine store including just about anything these days made from the sauvignon blanc grape unusual stuff sometimes in the midst of disappointing tastings its easy to forget what we love about wine fortunately something always happens to remind us december was tough for us noisy neighbors were driving us crazy media was in the last frenzied throes of her college applications and to top it all off we lost the heat in our country cabin the heating people came out a dozen times and couldnt figure it out by the time school ended and we arrived at our cabin for two weeks we felt we were falling over the finish line that night media and zoe disappeared into a small room with a space heater and we started a fire john rushed to the wine closet and picked up something that happened to be sitting on the top of a shelf an odd half bottle of sweet late harvest cabernet sauvignon from van der heyden vineyards in napa valley wed visited van der heyden some years before many napa vineyards have become big and fancy so we were delighted to find a small quirky winery like the ones we loved so much in the s van der heydens specialty they told us was late harvest cabernet we tasted it there and well truth be told we werent crazy about it and it was expensive &# for a half bottle nevertheless we bought two more as souvenirs it was a truly memorable visit than as great wines we wanted to keep we opened one soon after we returned and well we still werent crazy about it if john had given it any thought he probably would not have brought this bottle to our perch by the fire because we really needed a good wine but it was handy so he opened it and and it was wonderful the extra years of age had worked a miracle the wine had become smooth almost velvety it tasted of rich chocolate ripe fruit and dark earth there was even cabernet like structure which was a huge surprise in a wine of residual sugar it reminded us somewhat of port the acidity was so abundant that the wine wasnt the least bit heavy and the alcohol was perfectly integrated soon we decided to open an assortment of cheeses wed received for hanukkah then warmed by the wine and the fire we walked outside where the night was so perfectly clear that from our deck the sky looked like a planetarium we made out both dippers when we walked back into the house the heat suddenly went back on and it has stayed on look for our wine
