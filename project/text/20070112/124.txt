white house in rare move yields to scientific panel on policy plan washington in what could be a first for the bush administration a panel of outside scientists has prompted the white house to overturn a policy initiative as officials withdrew proposed changes in the way federal agencies conduct risk assessments the office of management and budget said it will back off from a proposal to overhaul how the government weighs the wisdom of adopting new health environmental and safety rules the national research council in an unusual critique had derided the administration plan as "too simplistic" and "fundamentally flawed " the controversy involves an analytical tool called "risk assessment " essentially a written synthesis of scientific evidence and statistical analysis to project whether a rule may be justified by the potential of a hazard or danger to human health safety or the environment consumer groups had complained that the change would set an imprudently high bar to new regulations the nrc a branch of the nonprofit federally chartered national academy of sciences reviewed the proposal at ombs request and said the white house should defer more to the rule making agencys experts rather than setting guidelines that the councils experts found "too simplistic" and that might "create confusion" in individual agencies following the councils criticism omb regulatory chief steven aitken said that the white house will modify its plan before making it final he didnt say how it would be modified however rep john dingell of michigan chairman of the house energy and commerce committee applauded the move and urged the omb to abandon the effort altogether saying it "ignores the specific statutory directives" congress gives federal agencies the american chemistry council called for the omb to try another version of the proposal "omb has a necessary and important role in advancing the technical quality and objectivity of risk assessments by providing appropriate guidance across the federal government " said the group which represents the chemical industry john ahearne who headed the national research council panel said the groups initial intention was to recommend a few changes "but the more we dug into the proposal the more we realized that from a scientific and technical standpoint it should be withdrawn altogether " he said the panel found that the omb had erred in calling for evidence of adverse health effects when public health needs might be better served by regulations that reduce risks before they cause human impairment mr ahearne heads the ethics program at sigma xi a scientific research society based in research triangle park n c neither mr ahearne nor mr aitken could recall an earlier instance where a panel of outside scientists had prompted the withdrawal of a white house policy initiative
