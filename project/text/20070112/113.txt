weekend journal taste de gustibus saying goodbye to grandmothers house it would be easier if she were crazy thats what i thought as my brother and i launched the latest offensive in my familys continuing campaign "get goldie out of her house " the tactics cajole deceive and bribe my year old grandmother better known as goldie to abandon her two story row house in west philadelphia her home for more than years to live in virginia with my mother goldie has seemed impervious to reason for years my family has tried to persuade her that shes too old to live alone in a big house in a bad neighborhood she wouldnt budge admittedly before i became a foot soldier in operation get goldie i was amused by my grandmothers nearly decade long winning streak against my mother and aunt the frontline fighters why i admired her love of freedom even though she cant leave the house alone and depends on grandchildren nieces and nephews to buy groceries and take her to the doctor she was born in philadelphia and is determined to die in philadelphia yet while i respect her resilience it grows tiresome ive been blessed with elders who have lived long lives with sound minds good health and iron wills my paternal grandfather lived alone until he was when he finally agreed to go into a nursing home he died a few months later ornery and alert to the end all of this leaves me with a nagging question if my cunningly demure grandmother can be this troublesome what hope will i have finding an appropriate living situation for my own parents or years from now as goldies generation passes on theres a new senior set on the horizon baby boomers in the first wave of that cohort turned and try as they might they still havent figured out how to stop time boomers are relentless their obstinacy spawned the civil rights movement and the womens movement and hastened the end of the vietnam war but they are also the generation of viagra and year old pregnant women in a aarp survey of year olds respondents said that the best possible gifts they could receive would be the loss of pounds "that people forget im " new arteries and love this is a generation that shows no signs of decelerating and while they may live longer than their parents the boomers arent saving as much the average american baby boomer boasts about &# for retirement while many expect to work beyond they also expect to enjoy a higher quality of life according to the survey money ranked as the biggest personal obstacle to achieving what the boomers want in life attitude was last only cited age as a barrier to fulfilling their ambitions while thats good news for boomers its bad news for those us who will have to pry the car keys out of the hands of our elderly parents exacerbating the problem is the fact that adult children are moving away from their parents my mom left philadelphia for college got married moved to virginia and never looked back no longer do children choose to follow their father into the family business or resign themselves to marrying their high school sweethearts boomers challenged convention and overturned tradition for future generations too when my mom went to college her mother expected her to return to philadelphia eventually when i went to college my mom made my room a den without a sofa bed former house majority leader dick armey used to say "the american dream is not owning a home and having some kids its getting all the kids out of it " only time will tell if boomers will regret their profound glee in sending their children off to fabulous out of state schools to be seen only for week long intervals and major holidays boomers relish their independence now but what will they think when their children ask them to move to another state in order to care for them not long ago goldie finally relented she packed her bags and left her beloved row house in the city for the green grass of virginia i wish i could say that she finally listened to reason and maybe my own parents will too but i hear from my cousin in philadelphia that my grandmother is plotting her own clandestine campaign "get goldie out of her daughters house " see related letter "letters to the editor pre boomers led civil rights surge" wsj jan
