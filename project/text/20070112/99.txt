chief executive that carried a false october date people familiar with the matter say apple recently disclosed that records were "improperly" created to claim that the grant was approved at a special board meeting that month but no board meeting took place then investigators are now focusing on the grant to mr jobs for million options that were finalized in december when apples share price was higher the false dating increased the value of the grant to mr jobs and resulted in a retroactive &# million charge to apples earnings when it was discovered by a special internal investigation people
