google this u k papers vie to buy search terms london britains famously competitive newspapers have a new battleground google newspapers are buying search words on google inc so that links to their web sites pop up first when people type in a search the daily telegraph for example bought the phrase "north korea nuclear test" after the country detonated a nuclear device last october people in the united kingdom and the u s using english language google who typed the phrase into the search engine saw an ad for the telegraph web site on the top right of their screen the ad which linked readers to a telegraph article about the test was labeled a "sponsored link" in small type and shaded blue on some computer screens to distinguish it from googles own search responses many papers are also tailoring their web sites to attract googles news site which has links to thousands of news articles the times of london owned by new york based news corp is training journalists to write in a way that makes their articles more likely to appear among googles unpaid search results "you make sure key phrases and topic words are embedded in the top paragraph and headlines " says zach leonard the papers digital media publisher recent words purchased by british papers related to articles about house speaker nancy pelosi and the poisoning of russian spy alexander litvinenko the sun a news corp owned tabloid known for its daily "page girl " a photo of a scantily clad woman recently bought an ad linked to the search term "george bush " when people searched for the name responses included links to the official white house web site and an ad linked to a sun web page with articles about the u s president some u s newspapers such as the new york times the washington post and gannett co s usa today say they sometimes buy search terms on google at the wall street journal published by dow jones &amp co gail griffin general manager of the wall street journal online says "its something that we have tried in the past but its not a big focus for us " but the british press is more frequent the times of london often buys words a week the telegraph a property of telegraph group ltd hired consultants to boost its google news appearances their recommendations included keeping headlines on the main telegraph web page and other pages identical so as not to confuse googles computers which rather than human editors select stories to highlight its an effort to fight for online readers at home and attract readers in the u s who are frequent visitors to newspaper sites in the u k the guardian owned by guardian media group plc says five million of its million online readers live in the u s the times says it has about three million readers in the u s and about one third or two million of the telegraphs online readers are in the u s the papers say u s readers help them attract advertisers including international luxury brands and british travel companies "the most important driver of all readers to our site is google except for people who know us and come directly " says edward roussel the telegraphs digital editor "it plays a critical part of exporting our brand particularly to the u s " trying to figure out how to gain more prominence is "something of a dark art " he adds online is the latest front in the decades war among british papers and is in many ways an extension of how old media are looking to adapt to the internet the british press has battled to win readers with screaming headlines lower prices coupons game promotions and recently by giving away free cds and dvds with their papers paying to put their stories in front of readers by buying google ads a practice the papers say has intensified in recent months is different from past marketing efforts they say some readers may not realize that links to articles that appear higher up on google are paid for while others appear lower down because they didnt pay even though the higher ones are marked "sponsored links " a spokesman for google which is based in mountain view calif says he doesnt think the use of ads to direct people to articles is confusing "our sponsored links are very clearly marked and our feedback from users is that they find the ads useful because they relate directly to what they are searching for " says spokesman d j collins to buy search terms papers pay google at least cents each time the term is clicked on prices can go up to &# or even higher depending on demand from other advertisers google sells the terms through an auction the papers can stop using a word or phrase any time some change the words daily the british papers have been buying terms on both googles u s and u k sites the papers have also bought ads on other search web pages but say they mostly buy on google because it is the most popular search site in the u s and britain at times the papers try to outbid each other for terms over the summer both the times and telegraph bid on google many times for rights to the word "ashes" the shorthand name of an annual cricket tournament between england and australia other bidders included advertisers for the sporting event on some days the times paid more making its ad appear above the telegraphs the telegraph also bought misspellings of the word including "ahses " "its a lot of effort to go through" to get new readers says steve leach chief executive of big mouth media ltd a scottish consulting firm that helps companies improve search engine results "you need a lot of research to determine which headlines to use then you have to upload them to search engines and decide how much you are going to spend its labor intensive "
