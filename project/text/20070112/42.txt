fresh off streak bill miller thinks u s stocks are cheap the usual "we beat the markets again" party was missing this year from bill millers calendar but the mutual fund manager whose &# billion in assets legg mason value trust fund finally failed to beat the standard &amp poors stock index last year ending a year streak says he is more optimistic now about u s shares than he has been in the past two years "the stock market is still cheap " mr miller says that may sound unusual given that some market indexes are at or near records just yesterday the dow jones industrial average set a new high closing at points mr miller argues that the stock market especially large companies is worth about more than its current trading levels the market and the economy appear to be firing on all cylinders he says corporate earnings are strong interest rates are steady merger and acquisition activity is booming and commodities prices are falling from overheated levels "unless you believe somethings different from whats out there today its hard not to be bullish " the year old manager says adding to the mix mr miller says that in recent years investors have been taking more risks buying bonds but havent shown the same fervor for stocks making them a relative bargain today one sign of that traditionally investors demand much higher returns for riskier debt but today returns for even some of the riskiest debt so called junk bonds arent much higher than the returns on very safe bonds such u s treasurys this partly explains the current boom in private equity deals he says private equity investors who typically purchase listed companies taking them private and financing the deal through debt are "buying the cheap asset which is stock and selling the expensive asset which is debt " mr miller says he attributes investors reluctance toward u s stocks right now partly to the market psychology of the past half decade or so research suggests that investors feel the pain of a loss twice as much as they feel the pleasure of a gain says mr miller who is a student of this kind of research as it pertains to market behavior in the past five or six years bonds have provided safety and decent returns whereas stocks had three years of negative returns following the technology stock crash of "everybody loves bonds because of what bonds did recently " he says one of his concerns in the coming year is whether in some cases private equity groups are buying public companies at prices that are too low shortchanging existing investors mr miller says he is paying close attention to management practices and corporate governance issues in fact a team in his office is preparing a best practices list covering an array of governance issues that they will use to help evaluate investments the list which is still being drafted may include guidelines such as a minimum time during which a companys top executives wouldnt be allowed to exercise stock options for instance the most recent issue at a company he owns the exit last week of home depot inc s chief executive bob nardelli under pressure for his large and controversial pay package mr miller says he was surprised that mr nardelli left considering that he had done a good job of improving the company "i was sorry to see him go " he says meanwhile mr miller and co manager mary chris gay continue to dig around for companies that fit their definition of stocks that are trading at a price they consider below their estimated value the fund ran into trouble during the past year partly because of holdings in internet companies like amazon com inc and ebay inc stocks of home builders like pulte homes inc and centex corp and health care companies aetna inc and unitedhealth group inc also hurt as did the lack of energy stocks which have done well in recent years the fund returned for trailing the total return of the s&amp p including reinvested dividends by percentage points according to morningstar inc the failure to maintain his year streak of beating the s&amp p was a disappointment says mr miller "it would be far better if we had outperformed the market " he said but at the same time he joked that it is "a relief" that it might finally put an end to questions about the streak observers had keenly been watching whether the fund would turn around in the last few weeks of the trading year as it sometimes has done in the past in fact there is an internal joke at legg mason capital management where mr miller sometimes is compared to silky sullivan a race horse in the s that was famous for shocking come from behind victories while mr millers fund stumbled last year it has done well in the long run over the past five year and year periods ending jan the fund has been a top performer among its peers returning an annualized and respectively mr miller whose office has a framed image of a sports illustrated cover from featuring silky sullivan says "we keep him around for good luck "
