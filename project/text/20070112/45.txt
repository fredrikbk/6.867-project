gop flake out one big test of a new minority is to draw the right lesson from its drubbing at the polls house republicans have a long way to go judging by house minority leader john boehners decision this week to punish arizonas jeff flake by tossing him off the judiciary committee the offense porkbusting mr flake should be getting a promotion to the leadership given how prescient he was in warning his colleagues about the perils of their run amok "earmarking " he and a few comrades sponsored more than house floor amendments last year to strip pork projects from spending bills the national taxpayers union ranked him the most fiscally conservative member of the house none of that sits very well with his house colleagues who blame mr flake for shining public attention on their spendthrift ways theyre especially angry that he talked about this with cbss " minutes " which chose to run the program on election eve weekend a spokesman for mr boehner says mr flakes judiciary ejection isnt punitive and is merely the bad luck of the draw now that the gop has fewer seats in the minority however that is hard to credit given that mr flake had more seniority on judiciary than six other republicans who didnt lose their seats mr flake retains seats on two lesser committees meanwhile mr boehner has asked californias jerry lewis to remain the ranking republican on the appropriations committee as chairman mr lewis allowed earmarks in the budget he is also under investigation for relationships with lobbyists amid allegations of "pay to play" earmarking the duke cunningham payments for pork crimes happened on his watch if republicans truly believed in limited government mr flake would be running appropriations and mr lewis would be a back bencher only last year while making his move to replace tom delay as republican majority leader mr boehner ran as a budget reformer he declared that "my republican colleague jeff flake of arizona has bold ideas to solve this problem i support his efforts " well never mind if republicans think that punishing their most principled members is smart politics their time in exile could be very long indeed
