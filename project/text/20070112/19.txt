chinas merger boom continues soaring stocks cash flush firms feed activity beijing china had more than a stock market boom last year it also had a surge in mergers and acquisitions as domestic and foreign companies moved to add chinese assets the rising stock market robust corporate earnings and government encouragement all converged to favor consolidation among state owned giants and private sector businesses and m&amp a activity is likely to be robust again this year according to data provider dealogic a total of whole or partial acquisitions of china based companies were announced last year up from in the total value of deals cracked the &# billion mark for the first time with &# billion that is up from the &# billion announced in the m&amp a trend might not add much to the gains of chinese shares a relatively small part of chinas companies are listed and many of the biggest deals werent done on the countrys newly vibrant exchanges still the surge in acquisitions as chinas small and scattered companies start to bulk up is helping to lay the groundwork for improved corporate performance in the longer term "it should make things more efficient " says stephen green an economist with standard chartered "youre looking for economies of scale horizontal and vertical integration improving quality of management and also the ability to wipe out your competitors and gain pricing power " retailing with its notoriously thin margins has seen a lot of activity gome electric appliances holding chinas largest consumer electronics retailer by revenue last year acquired one of its smaller rivals china paradise electronics retail foreign companies are also getting into the game wal mart stores has agreed to acquire trust mart a closely held taiwan retailer with operations in china and home depot is buying chinese home improvement chain home way the trend isnt limited to one or two sectors the producers of everything from building materials to big ticket technology goods are feeling the urge to merge chinas cement industry for example has seen a whirlwind of activity as companies try to stitch together regional powerhouses from a patchwork of kilns two steelmakers in the province of shandong laiwu steel and jinan iron &amp steel are planning a merger that would create the nations second largest producer and in december unprofitable boe technology group and other chinese makers of tft lcd panels used in flat screen tv sets and notebook computers agreed to explore ways to combine their businesses it is hard to point to any one factor driving the m&amp a surge but the boom in chinese stocks major market indexes doubled last year is certainly changing the way that executives think about prospective deals "todays market valuations are very good so people that didnt used to be sellers are becoming sellers " says leon meng co head of china investment banking for j p morgan chase "if im running a company that has peaked a bit or is feeling uneasy about growth then i take advantage of the valuation to exit and try something new " also corporate balance sheets across china are flush with cash after economic growth accelerated to more than in and even companies with thin margins can pull in plenty of cash from fast rising sales "companies have a huge amount of money to start doing m&amp a profits have come up a lot allowing them to repay loans from banks " says paul cavey an economist with macquarie bank "they have a huge incentive to go and spend this money " the national bureau of statistics survey of large industrial companies showed their profits for january november rose from the year earlier period mr cavey says the biggest profits are being earned by oil gas and mining companies because of high commodity prices yet the statistics bureaus survey also shows that the profits of state companies arent rising as fast as those of companies run by private or foreign investors china wants its companies to go head to head with u s or european multinationals which is increasing official pressure for state companies to shape up in the past three years the number of companies owned by the central government fell to from mostly through mergers provincial and local government bodies own many more companies for instance china communications construction which raised &# billion in a hong kong initial public offering of shares in december was formed from the combination of two state construction companies and the central government wants to cut the number of state owned companies to between and by a plan that will likely require even more mergers "state enterprises are stretched too thin and their number must be reduced " li rongrong the top official overseeing state companies said at a december news conference one way that state companies are restructuring is to put more of their businesses into publicly traded ones once small companies such as shanghai automotive and inner mongolian baotou steel union are getting injections of assets valued at billions of dollars from their better known parents such deals are broadening the role of markets in corporate financing and giving more companies the ability to use their shares to buy other businesses that is a trend that could encourage even more mergers stocks rise in europe india but fall in japan many european stock markets surged boosted by mining and
