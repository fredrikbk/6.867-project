politics &amp economics as libby goes to trial case appears weakened prosecutors success hinges on focusing on perjury charge washington special prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds case against lewis "scooter" libby goes to trial next week seemingly weakened by revelations that mr fitzgerald knew early in his cia leak probe that the ex white house official wasnt the original source of news media disclosures those disclosures and the search for their source were the reason mr fitzgerald was ordered to launch an investigation in the first place as a result mr fitzgeralds success will depend largely on how well he can keep the jury focused on his charge that mr libby "knowingly lied" to federal agents during his probe into the leak of former central intelligence agency operative valerie plames identity other recent perjury cases including the successful prosecution of martha stewart on charges of lying to investigators about a stock sale offer a road map narrowly directing a case amid heavy media attention and myriad distractions mr libbys high profile attorneys theodore v wells jr of paul weiss rifkind wharton &amp garrison llp and william h jeffress jr of baker botts llp will have vigorous and savvy public relations backing a private legal trust has raised more than &# million for his defense thanks to fund raising and donations from prominent conservatives such as mary matalin and bill bennett who regularly appear as media commentators meanwhile the defense plans to call vice president dick cheney as a witness while prosecutors plan to call several reporters to the stand perjury prosecutions are notably difficult with a high rate of failure in this case prosecutors have the added challenge of navigating a minefield of extraneous issues while asking jurors to interpret mr libbys state of mind when he talked to investigators "at the end of the day you try to get your jury to focus on elements of the offense " says karen patton seymour the lead prosecutor in the martha stewart case who now heads the criminal defense and investigations practice at sullivan &amp cromwell llp a new york law firm "you have to send the message that lying under oath matters or our criminal justice system suffers " a spokesman for mr fitzgerald said he declined to comment messrs wells and jeffress cited an order by the judge barring comments to the media prosecutors suggest mr libby then mr cheneys chief of staff lied to investigators to conceal a white house campaign to leak ms plames identity in retaliation for her husbands criticism of the administrations war plans prosecutors say mr cheney urged mr libby to "get out all the facts " about a cia fact finding trip to niger made by ms plames husband former diplomat joseph wilson to investigate alleged ties to an iraqi weapon program this included according to prosecutors spreading a story that the trip was a junket arranged by his wife but allegations of a cover up motivation appear to be undercut by recent news that former deputy secretary of state richard armitage not mr libby was the source of the leak of ms plames name to reporters mr libbys attorneys havent said what importance they plan to place on the armitage disclosures but they have sought to subpoena a tape made by washington post reporter bob woodward of an interview with mr armitage the challenge for prosecutors will be to train jurors attention on whether mr libby committed perjury when he made statements to the federal bureau of investigation "certainly the defense would like to point out the armitage revelations but thats not the point " says dan richman fordham university law professor and former federal prosecutor in new yorks southern district "the point here is whether he lied in this setting and its a setting that an average jury especially in d c would expect a high government official to be truthful in " another problem for mr fitzgerald at the end of his two year investigation during which he fought high profile battles to get reporters to reveal their secret sources he didnt bring charges on the leak itself and instead brought the libby perjury case the defense has its own issues court filings suggest mr libbys attorneys will argue he was so consumed with national security and political matters that he simply misspoke when he talked to fbi agents and that any misstatements were due to faulty memory or confusion amid weightier matters to support their defense attorneys requested dozens of pages of classified documents dealing with issues as varied as unrest in liberia the israeli palestinian conflict and threatened attacks by al qaeda says mr richman "the im too busy im too important defense has the potential to rankle a lot of jurors "
