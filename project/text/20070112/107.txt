weekend journal review film stomp the yard offers cool steps arthritic plotting power of god grew tired sudanese true life tale is marred by vagueness its hardly a harbinger of coherence when the opening credits announce as they do in "stomp the yard " that the screenplay is based on another screenplay the final writer of record is robert adetuyi preceded by gregory ramon anderson yet theres no sign of any screenplay whatsoever for the first few manic deafening minutes of the film images and music are all inner city los angeles a street dancing contest young dancers gyrating wildly you might also say wonderfully except for the madly speeded up camera work yelling cheering twirling one dancer rotates upside down skull on sidewalk glad faces mad faces motorcycle noise baleful orange light rival dancers fight gunshots a boy is dead only then does a conventional plot about step dancing kick in conventional enough in its dogged way to make you yearn for a little chaos step dancing or stepping is a form of street dancing that has evolved into a cross between ladysmith black mambazo and marine corps basic training the moves can be remarkable though ritually repetitive male chorus lines of adrenalized automata acting out anger menace pride audacity or joy and "stomp the yard " which was directed by sylvain white is absolutely fixated by step dancing the troubled young hero a street wise dancer named dj an appealing performance by columbus short has lost his kid brother in that prefatory fight to avoid being sent to juvenile hall for his role in the melee he enrolls reluctantly in truth university an ostensibly prestigious african american school in atlanta that seems to be an institution of higher stepping since no learning is in evidence the school is fictional but untruth university wouldnt have sounded right truth u s life is organized around greek fraternities which are organized around stepping contests "being in a fraternity is about a lot more than just stepping " dj is told by april meagan good the temporarily unattainable girl of his dreams but she is wrong stepping is everything in "stomp the yard " and dare i say it a stepping stone to djs redemption the movie itself is redeemed slightly by its almost touching devotion to the hoary hollywood traditions of college movies with battling frats as well as its earnest endorsement of education truth u s heritage hall built in displays photos of martin luther king coretta scott king and rosa parks with a prominence that suggests they were alumni no info is offered on whether they stepped god grew tired of us two unimaginable journeys become more than imaginable in "god grew tired of us " a documentary by christopher quinn and tommy walker the movie makes them vivid and memorable this is a film that adds to our understanding of human nature yet its impact is lessened by a lack of factual context and by an inspirational climax that may leave one feeling good and uneasy in equal measure the first of those journeys recapitulated with archival footage and narrated by nicole kidman is that of the so called lost boys of sudan they were innocents orphaned by sudans savage civil war who fled their villages in the s and wandered sub saharan africa on foot for five years before reaching a united nations refugee camp in kenya more than half of them died along the way victims of sickness and starvation on the other journey the camera follows three of those camp dwellers no longer boys but grown men and english speaking christians as they are relocated to the united states two in pittsburgh one in syracuse part of the fascination is inevitably watching fish out of water the world travelers all three of them dazzlingly affable penetrate mystery after mystery airplanes light switches running water toilets potato chips ice skating santa claus supermarkets that seem as vast if not as warm as african savannahs more fascinating still is why they do what they do and how they feel about their new lives after many months in new apartments the refugees still eat with their fingers because they cant adapt no because finger food is part of the culture they cling to quite consciously for spiritual nourishment "a person without culture " one of them explains "is like a farmer without land " their irretrievable losses the makeshift families of the long march leave them feeling haunted sometimes hopeless and terribly vulnerable to loneliness you can take the boy out of the country but you cant take the sorrow out of the boy where the film grows vexing is in its vagueness about the size and nature of the resettlement effort how many young men were brought here what were the selection criteria how big a dent does it make in the refugee problem no answers are provided and the film comes uncomfortably close to tv cliche the make a wish syndrome strikes again when one of the men is reunited with his mother the moment is shattering heaven knows deplaning in syracuse the woman collapses at her sons feet then ululates piercingly and prances joyfully down the airport corridor but the scene bespeaks a media conundrum how to focus public attention on vast social upheavals without turning them into grist for the entertainment mill dvd tip an earlier documentary "lost boys of sudan" follows two other sudanese refugees to new homes in suburban america the photography is less resplendent or seductive in this film and theres no narration but powerful feelings are evoked all the same megan mylan directed with jon shenk who also did the cinematography
