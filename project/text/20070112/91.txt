the gitmo high life for sheer irony its hard to beat this weeks spectacle of cindy sheehan protesting the u s detention facilities at guantanamo bay from inside the prison that is cuba itself its not uncommon for asylum seeking cubans to brave minefields and shark infested waters to enter the u s naval base which five years ago this week also became home to many top figures from al qaeda and the taliban that anniversary has brought forth predictable demands that guantanamo be closed from the self styled human rights activists at amnesty international and other groups but the world needs a place to hold al qaeda terrorists who continue to strike in europe iraq and afghanistan even if they have failed to hit the united states since and after visiting guantanamo just before christmas it was easy to understand why belgian police official alain grignard who came last year with a delegation from the organization for security and cooperation in europe was moved to declare it "a model prison where people are better treated than in belgian prisons " this is no less true of camp five gitmos maximum security facility that houses its most dangerous detainees modern and clean it looks just like a u s jail meals i ate the same lunch the detainees did that day are high in caloric content if not exactly gourmet the average detainee has gained pounds and in the interrogation room its the americans who may have to suffer long hours in straight back chairs while the detainees i kid you not get a la z boy i was shown a syrian under interrogation via closed circuit television his questioners were two pleasant looking young women he was smiling im not under the impression that these sessions are always fun and games but detainees in defense department custody are treated according to the restrictive rules of the army field manual which bans all forms of coercive interrogation i double checked with the camps lead interrogator other government agencies read cia and fbi have to follow those rules too not only does that mean no "torture" is going on your average good cop bad cop routine isnt allowed cooperative detainees get rewards like movies "harry potter" is one of their favorites when it comes to medical care almost no expense is spared as i discovered after spotting an overweight man lounging in the rec yard of camp five "khalid sheikh mohammed " i inquired he was some distance away "no thats paracha " came the somewhat exasperated reply saifullah paracha is a pakistani businessman and media owner who claims two meetings with osama bin laden were purely for journalistic interest he is believed to be an important figure in the case against majid khan one of the "high value" detainees recently transferred to gitmo from cia custody last year mr parachas son uzair was sentenced to years in a u s prison for aiding an al qaeda operative in a plot to bomb u s targets maybe terrorism is stressful work but whatever the reason the elder paracha also suffers from heart disease so late last year at an expense of some &# the u s government flew down doctors and equipment to perform cardiac catheterization mr parachas response was to refuse treatment and file a petition in u s federal court for transfer to a hospital in the u s or pakistan at least his lawyers were frank about their cynical motives "his death in u s captivity would be a blow to american prestige " the medical care at guantanamo seems state of the art all detainees over are offered colonoscopies at least have been performed gitmos psychiatrist told me that fewer that of detainees suffer from mood disorders a rate lower than that of the general population that would appear to undercut claims that indefinite detention is itself a form of "mental torture " guantanamo detainees dont lack for legal representation a list of lead counsel released this week in response to a freedom of information act request reads like a whos who of americas most prestigious law firms shearman and sterling wilmer cutler pickering hale &amp dorr covington &amp burling hunton &amp williams sullivan &amp cromwell debevoise &amp plimpton cleary gottlieb and blank rome are among the marquee names a senior u s official i spoke to speculates that this information might cause something of scandal since so much of the pro bono work being done to tilt the playing field in favor of al qaeda appears to be subsidized by legal fees from the fortune "corporate ceos seeing this should ask firms to choose between lucrative retainers and representing terrorists" who deliberately target the u s economy he opined none of the above is meant to suggest guantanamo is a fun place what terrorist detention facility would be base commander adm harry harris rejects the term "prison " by the way "we are not about punishment we are about keeping enemy combatants off the battlefield " but the picture of guantanamo usually painted by the press and human rights activists is a terribly distorted one americans should rest assured that the men held there are probably getting better treatment than they deserve mr pollock is a member of the wall street journals editorial board
