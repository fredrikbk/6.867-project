weekend journal the weekend adviser clap your hands and say buy their new album has set off some of the highest expectations of the new year their moaning lead singer is frequently likened to david byrne but theres one thing clap your hands say yeah doesnt have a record label on tuesday the east coast quintet will release its second album "some loud thunder " for download on its own web site the cd version arrives in stores jan like the bands self titled debut which garnered nearly universal praise in the music press the new compilation is a layered blend of rhythm guitar and danceable rock in "satan said dance " one song getting some strong early reviews lead singer alec ounsworth lays out a vision of hell over bleeps guitars and a disco beat "no whips no chains just dancing dancing dancing dancing " etc but the group is getting even more attention in the music press for its unusual do it yourself business model in after the first wave of buzz the band turned down deals from several labels including columbia records the debut disc nevertheless went on to sell more than copies in the u s according to nielsen soundscan a relatively large number for a new indie rock band they never considered joining a label for their new album according to their manager opting instead to contract out label functions such as publicity and lining up cd production and distribution themselves mr ounsworth says his goal is to avoid becoming beholden to a labels finances or marketing plan "by remaining independent " he says "i can theoretically focus on making music " it remains to be seen whether clap your hands say yeah can build lasting success but mr ounsworths unusual path to the music store may represent an ominous sign for the industry as cd sales continue to fall and the power of labels continues to dwindle in the traditional music industry model bands earn advances from a label that they repay over time with their share of sales which can be lower than of revenues but clap your hands say yeah is instead spending its own money more than &# to finance the production of some cds for example to cut the music company out of the loop the band then pays a much smaller percentage of its revenue to a distribution company that handles both digital and retail outlets sales from the bands own web site are exempt the approach has its dangers when columbia dropped singer nellie mckay about a year ago she put out an album herself it has sold only copies since its late october release according to soundscan but clap your hands say yeah could be part of a broader shift in the balance of power in the music industry as new gatekeepers such as apples itunes gain clout musicians market themselves on myspace and some artists begin to regard record labels as optional bigger groups such as the white stripes for example now have more negotiating power the rock duo is working on an album due out this summer but its contract with v records has expired ian montone the bands manager says the white stripes are looking to sign a deal that covers only production and distribution rather than a traditional label relationship "the tide has turned for some artists " says mr montone who manages musicians with label deals as well as others with more unconventional arrangements "i wouldnt rule out a traditional label completely but im trying to flip the label relationship to make it what does the label do to earn the money that we pay them " also out prolific folk rock musician erin mckeown is taking liberties with the american songbook and so far critics are pleased ms mckeowns fifth album "sing you sinners " twists and reanimates jazz and pop standards like "paper moon" and slips in one like minded original song written by the year old who
