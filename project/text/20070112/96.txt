trading shots rare bears very few strategists see stocks down in here are their stories bears seem to be an endangered species on wall street sure most strategists expect earnings growth and the economy to slow in and they dont expect stocks to set the world on fire the consensus view is that the dow jones industrial average and the standard &amp poors stock index will each gain this year according to a late businessweek survey of strategists but many of those forecasters have been dialing up their optimism in the weeks since that survey citigroups tobias levkovich for example boosted his year end target for the s&amp p from to and the sheer number of strategists expecting stocks to rise swamps the number of those expecting a decline in a year ending survey of money managers by russell investment group just said they expected the market to fall in only expected a decline just nine of the strategists surveyed by businessweek expected the s&amp p to end the year lower and one of those was mr levkovich who has since defected from the bear camp so who are these lonely bears and why are they bucking the consensus we talked to a few of them about their views in a nutshell they see stagflation or something much like it on the horizon stagflation is a cocktail of inflation and economic stagnation a perfect storm of nastiness that is poison to stock prices as it was in the s so far this year there have been few signs that this will come to pass the economy looks stronger than expected commodity prices are tumbling and the dollar is strengthening interest rates are creeping higher however and expectations of a federal reserve rate cut are evaporating meanwhile earnings forecasts are drifting lower according to thomson financial all are potential red flags for stocks and the bears are sticking to their forecasts market profile theorems michael painchaud founder and research director seattle dow jones industrial average s&amp p nasdaq mr painchaud has the distinction of being one of the few strategists who accurately predicted the bull market that began in oct he also has the possibly dubious distinction of being one of the most bearish strategists on the street this year his partial basis for both outlooks his research of investor behavior specifically the stock trades of insiders at about u s companies before the bull run began in these insiders were buying shares of their own companies signaling early confidence in the market at a time when stocks were unloved late in according to mr painchauds research those same insiders were selling a warning sign for "theres an information flow in the marketplace that comes from the company level bubbles up through the analyst community and is reflected coincidentally or thereafter in the relative strength of the markets " he says "invariably what one sees is that at the very time insiders become more negative the analyst community is either still increasing its bullishness or maintaining a high level of it but they tend to follow " and despite what he calls "excessive bullishness" on wall street he now sees signs that analysts are starting to come around to the caution already displayed by insiders "youre not seeing the increases in earnings estimates you saw at the beginning of " he says mr painchaud doesnt look at insider behavior alone he makes sure it matches up with the prevailing economic conditions including inflation and interest rates unfortunately he says all seem to point in the same direction a significant slowdown in the economy and earnings in maybe "significant" is the wrong word "ugly" might be more apt mr painchaud thinks inflation will stay surprisingly strong keeping interest rates high and leading to a recession and a to correction in stocks by year end "some people would call it stagflation " he says it is worth noting that mr painchaud has made bad calls before and very recently he predicted the s&amp p would fall roughly in and in instead it gained about and respectively blue marble research vinny catalano chief investment strategist cross river n y dow s&amp p nasdaq mr catalano is new to the bear cave he was bullish last spring when stocks were down in the dumps and his stance was vindicated by a virtually uninterrupted climb through the end of the year but mr catalano sees little reason to be bullish now he too expects earnings to be weaker and interest rates higher than the consensus expects he is also anxious about what he calls "the high high degree of bullishness" on wall street "when there are too many bulls and not enough bears who is left to convert " he asks most bulls say the liquidity sloshing around the globe will provide the fuel for another stock rally this year but all that cash worries mr catalano who says it is being wielded mainly by fast moving highly leveraged hedge funds who will be more likely to flee the market at the first sign of trouble he also thinks all this liquidity will worry the fed and other central banks by putting upward pressure on inflation as hot money flows around the globe pushing wages and asset prices higher forcing central bankers to keep interest rates higher than the market expects add it all up and theres a "good chance" of stagflation setting in he thinks some bulls note that is the third year of president bushs second term and that stocks typically rise in the third year of presidential terms as the party in power showers taxpayers with economic incentives mr catalano is skeptical noting mr bush is not running for reelection and that the current congress has vowed to be more fiscally responsible if anything he says "we already had our rally in " he does think there could be a "melt up" in stocks early in the year as hot money managers chase returns but at some point the barrier of high interest rates will spook the market and then those same money managers will flee en masse for greener pastures he believes "with hedge funds and the pressure theyre under to perform were getting this texas holdem poker style of investing all in or all out " he says that said hes not a perma bear and not wedded to his forecast he still has of his portfolio in stocks and is waiting for a better signal that his ugly scenario will unfold "im agnostic " he says "i want to make money " riversource investments david joy chief market strategist minneapolis dow s&amp p nasdaq mr joy is less gloomy about than other bears in fact he agrees with the more bullish forecasters that the economy is headed for a soft landing and will dodge a recession in but he sees corporate profits suffering from an economic slowdown in the first half at the same time he thinks inflation will stay stubbornly high and that the fed will stay on hold longer than the market expects supporting the dollar and pinching the profit margins of u s exporters early this year the market seems to be coming around to his view about interest rates at least as a stronger than expected employment report and other economic data have sent market odds of a first half fed rate cut tumbling "that puts more pressure on earnings growth to come in pretty solidly in order to get this equity reflation scenario underway " he says "my forecast is that earnings are going to be a disappointment to wall street " he also notes the current bull market is in its fifth year and has yet to suffer a major correction "we are overdue to some extent if we get disappointment on the earnings or interest rate front we could get it " he says still he doesnt expect the decline to be apocalyptic and thinks stocks will be on an upward trajectory again by the end of the year "if what i forecast occurs i still think it would leave u s and foreign markets in pretty good shape economically and might actually shake out a little bit of the consensus optimism and leave equity markets in pretty good shape too " he says he also points out that the investment committee at riversource investments a unit of ameriprise financial is more bullish about than he is and has divided its investment pie accordingly again for the record it must be noted that mr joy was overly cautious in and calling for only small gains in the s&amp p each year write to mark gongloff at mark gongloff wsj com
