weekend journal review books beyond the shores of tripoli power faith and fantasy by michael oren norton pages &# the war for independence aside no long term military experience so agitated the american colonies and the nascent republic than the relentless aggressions against the nations shipping in the waters off north africa but the battles were not limited to the sea the honor and prestige of the u s were also tested in the desert and around ancient walled cities american sailors were actually enslaved and for a while the u s government capitulated to the necessity of tribute to free them the barbary wars lasted roughly two decades almost two centuries after these conflicts between arabs and americans a conflict between persians and americans sounded an ominous echo the revolutionary shiite government of iran acting through student militants put the u s through perhaps the most humiliating diplomatic incident in its history by seizing occupants from the american embassy and holding them hostage it was not short taking days and the personnel in captivity were not few at the end prisoners oddly jimmy carter whose presidency foundered on his weak response at the time seems warmly inclined to irans equally belligerent leadership today he seems indifferent to the lesson of his own political ruin that one cannot tame the enraged with displays of anguished timidity these instances of uncivilized aggression serve as near bookends to americas long experience in the middle east surprise neither had anything to do with the jews in "power faith and fantasy " michael oren offers a sweeping chronicle of americas middle eastern policies and perceptions arguing that the lands of the ottoman empire before its dissolution and after have long loomed large to washington and to the wider american populace helping to define americas sense of itself and its role in the world one result of the early battles with the barbary states mr oren argues was the realization that the articles of confederation were crippling americas capacity to raise a national military force "the united states had no navy nor even a constitutional instrument for constructing one " mr oren writes anxiety about this weakness informed the constitutional convention in and helped persuade delegates overcoming their aversion to foreign affairs and wariness of central government to endorse a document that provided for a national defense the new nation had moved from infancy and its concerns were made concrete and world wide the countrys focus on the mediterranean had multiple sources of course the vivid presence of the hebrew bible in old american protestantism the christian proselytizing instinct which made americans both hostile to islam and sympathetic to a possibly more secular and less anti christian arab nationalism and the imperial designs of other nations which the u s resented even as it moved to protect its interests by ensuring american access to the suez canal and desert oil fields mr oren handles these complexities with admirable clarity he is equally adept at describing the characters who drive the story not a few are nutcases latching on to identities and causes sometimes spurious sometimes real in "clarel a poem and pilgrimage in the holy land " herman melville brought to life the americans he met on his own visit to palestine among them was a missionary named walter dickson who told melville that he had "permanently settled on the soil of zion sir " many of dicksons family members and traveling companions though not dickson himself were later slaughtered by arab intruders and then there was the encounter of a revivalist preacher from new hampshire harriet livermore and lady hester stanhope the self styled queen of the desert and niece of william pitt both women were lured to palestine in the s by reports of a jewish settlement there a sign they hoped of jewish restoration and the fulfillment of prophecy as mr oren recounts the two "should have bonded" but instead "quarreled over which of them was the truly elect and which would accompany the lord on his triumphal reentry to jerusalem " it would be another century before the jewish restoration in the middle east would truly take hold decisive american support for zionism mr oren notes can be traced to the induction of louis dembitz brandeis in the cause a prominent lawyer and progressive activist he supported the idea of a jewish state in the middle east full throatedly even after he was appointed to the supreme court by woodrow wilson in it was brandeis who persuaded american jewry to dream of a jewish state it was he too who enrolled wilson in the practicality and justice of the idea it didnt hurt that wilsons commitment to the sovereignty of nations had as one of its beneficiaries the group that had first given substance to the very meaning of peoplehood one can say that brandeis was a spiritual co author of the balfour declaration the british writ to palestine in declaring "sympathy with jewish zionist aspirations " where there are wise men alas there are also fools one of wilsons advisers was charles crane a major contributor to the campaign "if brandeis saw zionists as avatars of the hardworking pilgrim colonists " mr oren writes "then crane subscribed to the popular american image of the arabs as lovers of liberty and revilers of radicalism the unitarians of the desert " crane the heir to a chicago toilet manufacturing fortune was also interested in the infamy of jews so he defended the czarist pogroms and henry fords campaigns against "the international jew " later he would pronounce adolf hitler "the real bulwark of christian culture " in president wilson appointed crane and henry c king the pious president of oberlin college to co chair the inter allied commission on mandates convened to ponder the destiny of ottoman lands england and france refused to participate so the u s was the only "ally " the commissions staunchly pro arab report which happily came to nothing might have been expected given cranes background wilson defended his appointment of crane as well as king by saying that the two men "knew nothing" about the middle east and thus presumably brought along no biases yet crane was a self described anti semite what they thought they knew turned out to be nonsense reading about the king crane commission its difficult not to think of a more recent gathering of ineffective sages the iraq study group though "power faith and fantasy" went to press too early to address the findings of the commission headed by james baker and lee hamilton mr oren does a sterling job of putting in context mr bakers role in the middle east over the years the former secretary of state of course is a longtime underminer of israel and mr oren shows among other things the paltriness of what mr baker considers one of his brightest achievements the madrid peace conference of ostensibly called to encourage negotiations between israel and its arab neighbors the summit was essentially a reward to syria and egypt for doing nothing during the first gulf war as the catalyst for the peace process mr oren writes madrid was "a nonstarter " mr orens skillful narrative shows that americas bond with israel is as intrinsic as axiomatic as its bond with england it is inconceivable that these two nations these three nations really would be other than together in the current struggle against dogma zealotry and the darkest habits of violent life such a bond has consequences for americas role in the world confirming yet again mr orens theme and for the orbit of militant islam in the middle east mr oren reminds us that the stakes are very high mr peretz is editor in chief of the new republic
