getting iraq to work the american mission in iraq must succeed our goal promoting a stable accountable democracy in the heart of the middle east cannot be achieved by purely military means iraqis need to establish a civil society without the support of mediating civic and social associations the informal ties that bind us together no government can long remain stable and no cohesive nation can be maintained to establish a civil society iraqis must rebuild their basic infrastructure iraqis must take control of their destiny by rebuilding houses stores schools roads highways mosques and churches but the constant threat of violence combined with a high unemployment rate estimated between and fundamentally undermines that effort this not only sustains the fertile breeding ground for terrorist recruiters but has the same corrosive effect as it would in any city raising the likelihood of further violence civic decay and a crippling sense of powerlessness a massive effort must be made to engage in a well organized plan to rebuild iraq the goal an infrastructure to support and encourage a strong stable civil society the week before christmas the pentagon asked congress to approve a supplemental &# billion for military operations in iraq and afghanistan on top of the estimated &# billion spent to date the administration should direct a small percent of that amount to create an iraqi citizen job corps along the lines of fdrs civilian conservation corps during the great depression the job corps can operate under the supervision of our military and with its protection the army corps of engineers might be particularly helpful in directing this effort it will place our military in a constructive relationship with the iraqis both literally and figuratively today iraq has almost state owned factories that have been abandoned by the governing authorities since the outbreak of war in deputy undersecretary of defense paul a brinkley has led a team to of those facilities traveling far beyond the green zone to idled plants from fallujah to ramadi mr brinkley believes that under department of defense leadership at least of these facilities could be re opened almost immediately putting more than iraqis to work within weeks this should be done without delay and it is only the beginning the wages that these thousands of gainfully employed workers receive will be used to purchase goods and services that will employ other iraqis those goods and services must be produced by still other iraqis these are the first steps in creating the requisite conditions of a stable functioning economy and the best hope of displacing retribution and violence with hope and opportunity we must try to achieve constructive and compassionate goals through conservative means jump starting civic improvement and the individual work ethic in iraq without creating permanent subsidies the goal is to get more iraqis working especially young males who are most susceptible to the terrorist and warlord recruiters there are many lessons from the successful welfare reforms in new york city that can be readily applied in iraq in the early s new york city suffered an average of murders a year while more than million people one out of every seven new yorkers were unemployed and on welfare too many neighborhoods were pervaded by a sense of hopelessness that came from a combination of high crime high unemployment and despair "workfare" proved an excellent method to change this destructive decades long paradigm it required able bodied welfare recipients to work hours a week in exchange for their benefits in the process we reasserted the value of the social contract which says that for every right there is a responsibility for every benefit an obligation as many as people participated at a single time working in the neighborhoods that most needed their help cleaning up streets with the sanitation department removing graffiti from schools and government buildings or helping to beautify public spaces in the parks department more than individuals went through our workfare program between and and their effort helped to visibly improve the quality of life in new york city many of them moved on to permanent employment this change from welfare to work did as much as the new york police department compstat program to keep reducing crime a similar model can work in iraq there is an opportunity not only to increase employment by rebuilding roads houses schools and government buildings but also to engage the iraqi people to participate in laying the foundation for a civil and prosperous society the population of iraq is roughly million with a pre war median annual income equivalent to &# subsidizing unemployed iraqis with a meaningful wage in exchange for meaningful work rebuilding their society is well within the means of the u s and its allies the entire effort will help stabilize and grow the iraqi economy it should be open to all willing iraqis sunnis shiites and kurds as a means of helping to create a common culture through shared participation in work projects to rebuild and take ownership of their nation one word of caution the program should be overseen by the u s military not private contractors to avoid unnecessary delays in deployment or accusations of cronyism in the bidding process our military will still be devoted to its primary role of hunting down terrorists and patrolling the streets but administering a jobs program would be a direct extension of their effort to secure law and order after the program has been started and becomes successful it can be transferred to a civilian authority within the iraqi government the creation of an iraqi citizen job corps will help expedite the establishment of a more stable civil society and improve the growing iraqi economy through the transforming power of an honest days work mr giuliani is the former mayor of new york city mr gingrich is a former speaker of the u s house of representatives
