at heart of ciscos iphone trademark lawsuit a desire for open standards cisco systems inc s suit against apple inc turns on a trademark but the fight also reflects two fundamentally different approaches to technology one based on open standards and the other on proprietary design cisco contends that it holds rights to the name iphone the silicon valley networking giant filed trademark infringement charges wednesday to stop apples use of the name on its new cellphone after the companies failed to reach a licensing agreement before the product was announced tuesday cisco also disclosed that it had been asking apple in exchange for using the name to help ciscos product work together with apples mark chandler ciscos general counsel summed up its account of what happened in a blog posting wednesday night "what were the issues at the table that kept us from an agreement was it money no was it a royalty on every apple phone no was it an exchange for cisco products or services no "fundamentally we wanted an open approach we hoped our products could interoperate in the future " the request fits ciscos style the san jose calif company makes networking devices that rely on published specifications to exchange data apple by contrast has kept tight control over internally developed technology to be able to offer exclusive features many competitors for instance have asked apple to make it possible for songs purchased from the companys itunes music store to be loaded on their portable music players but only apples hit ipod can do that the new iphone offers sophisticated cellphone features and many functions of the ipod opening up that product or other apple devices in new ways could help ciscos hardware sales given the publicity apple tends to generate one person familiar with the situation said the negotiations focused on broad technical cooperation rather than specific devices douglas masters an intellectual property lawyer at the firm loeb &amp loeb llp in new york said ciscos negotiating strategy was far more sophisticated than seeking royalty payments from apple "there is no amount of money that is going to be worth more than to have the interoperability " argued mr masters who is not involved in the case other lawyers observing the battle predict apple will try to show cisco didnt adequately use or protect the iphone trademark cisco said it has owned the trademark since when it bought a company called infogear technology corp that first sought a trademark on the iphone name in infogear used it on a telephone that offered web access which mr chambers wrote that cisco has "shipped and or supported" for years ciscos linksys unit added iphone branded products last spring and formally announced them in late he said if cisco didnt offer iphone branded products for a lengthy period or didnt try to block other companies from using the name apple could argue that cisco didnt live up to a legal obligation to defend the trademark said robert andris an intellectual property lawyer at the firm ropers majeski kohn &amp bentley llp apple could also argue that the letter "i" has evolved into a generic term indicating the internet not a brand deserving trademark protection an apple spokesman said several companies besides cisco also use the name iphone for internet based phones characterizing ciscos u s trademark protection as "tenuous " he said apple is the first to use the name on cellphones but nate garhart another intellectual property lawyer at coblentz patch duffy &amp bass llp questioned whether apple can show its phones wouldnt be confused with ciscos a key issue in trademark law cisco is likely to try to persuade a judge to issue a preliminary injunction blocking apples use of the trademark while the merits of the case are decided which could be difficult mr andris said yet pressure on apple to resolve the matter could increase by spring when it needs to build phones in advance of kicking off sales in june mr masters added
