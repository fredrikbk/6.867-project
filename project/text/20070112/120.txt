weekend journal the snoop next door bad parking loud talking no transgression is too trivial to document online jennifer saranow on new web sites for outing fellow citizens last month eva burgess was eating breakfast at the rose cafe in venice calif when she remembered she needed to make an appointment with her eye doctor so the new york theater director got on her cellphone and booked a date almost immediately she started receiving "weird and creepy" calls directing her to a blog there under the posting "eva burgess is getting glasses " her name cellphone number and other details mentioned in her call to the doctors office were posted along with the admonition "next time you might take your business outside " the offended blogger had been sitting next to ms burgess in the cafe it used to be the worst you could get for a petty wrong in public was a rude look now its not just brutal police officers panty free celebrities and wayward politicians who are being outed online the most trivial missteps by ordinary folks are increasingly ripe for exposure as well there is a proliferation of new sites dedicated to condemning offenses ranging from bad parking caughtya org and leering hollabacknyc com to littering litterbutt com and general bad behavior rudepeople com one site documents locations where people have failed to pick up after their dogs capturing newspaper stealing neighbors on video is also an emerging genre helping drive the exposes are a crop of entrepreneurs who hope to sell advertising and subscriptions one site that lets people identify bad drivers is about to offer a &# monthly service for people to register several of their own plate numbers and receive notices if they are cited by other drivers but the traffic and commercial prospects for many of the sites are so limited that clearly there is something else at work the embrace of the web to expose trivial transgressions in part represents a return to shame as a check on social behavior says henry jenkins director of the comparative media studies program at the massachusetts institute of technology some academics believe shame became less powerful as a control over everyday interactions with strangers in all but very small neighborhoods or social groups as people moved to big cities or impersonal suburbs where they existed more anonymously the sites documenting minor wrongs are the flip side of an online vigilantism movement that tackles meatier social issues community organization cop watch los angeles encourages users to send in stories and pictures of people being brutalized or harassed by police for posting on the web the governor of texas plans to launch a site this year that will air live video of the border in hopes that people will watch and report illegal crossings in a trial run in november the site received more than emails tips included spottings of individuals swimming in the rio grande a person wearing a large white hat and a "wild" boy at the border in china web postings have become a powerful social weapon used to rally thousands of people to hound a man who allegedly had an affair with a married woman for people singled out the sites can represent an unsettling form of street justice with no due process chris roths driving skills have been roundly criticized online by self anointed traffic monitors "this man needs his license revoked " wrote one poster who accused mr roth of cutting in and out another charged him with driving on a shoulder and having the audacity to "flip off" an old lady who wouldnt let him cut in mr roth found the critiques when an anonymous writer added a comment to his myspace profile in late november directing him to platewire one of the handful of new sites devoted to bad driving there a user had posted mr roths license plate information his vanity plate reads "idrvfast" and complained about his reckless driving style subsequent posters found and listed his full name cellphone number and link to his myspace page as well as comments like "big jerk" and "meathead " he has no idea how they found his information "there is no accountability you can just go online and say whatever you want whether its factual or not " says the year old mr roth of raleigh n c who works in technology sales he admits he is an impatient driver and speeds but he has no plans to change his driving style based on posts by anonymous commentators "who are they to decide what is safe or not " he says if you type "ycantpark" into photo sharing site flickr there are about photos of bad parking jobs at yahoo inc s sunnyvale calif headquarters the company says the posts were started anonymously around by employees disgruntled with the parking situation during that year yahoo hired more than new employees and finding a parking space become difficult "i dont want to have my car posted up there so i definitely think twice about how i park " says yahoo spokeswoman heidi burgett the digital age allows critics to quickly find a fair amount of information about their targets one day last november at about a m a blog focused on making new york streets more bike friendly posted the license plate number of an suv driver who allegedly accelerated from a dead stop to hit a bicycle blocking his way at p m someone posted the registration information for the license plate including the suv owners name and address the editor of the blog thinks the poster got the information from someone who had access to a license plate look up service available to lawyers private investigators and police at p m another person added the owners occupation his businesss name and his title ten minutes later a user posted a link to an aerial photo of the owners house within another hour the posting also included the accuseds picture and email address the suvs owner ian goldman the chief executive of celerant technology corp in the new york city borough of staten island declined to comment for this article according to an email exchange posted on the blog mr goldman said that he had lent the vehicle in question to a relative with "an urgent medical situation" and that he was not aware of any incident the alleged victim has decided to drop the matter since the damage to the bicycle which he was standing next to at the time was under &# last month aaron naparstek editor of the blog says he removed mr goldmans home and email addresses from the site after receiving a "lawyerly cease and desist" email asking that the whole posting be deleted other sites have also received complaints asking that posts be removed most say they will remove identifying information like phone numbers or full names when it comes to their attention or if asked yet lawyers say alleged wrongdoers shamed online typically have little legal recourse under libel and privacy laws if the accusations in postings are true if they are posters opinions about behavior witnessed in a public place and if the personal information listed is available to the public "it becomes very difficult when it comes to the shaming sites in terms of what you can do in creating a case " says daniel solove an associate professor of law at george washington university law school who is working on a book about gossiping shaming and privacy on the internet caughtya org hosts pictures of cars illegally parked in handicapped spaces other objects qualify too one photo from plano texas is called "big rubber chicken parked in accessible parking spaces " playground snoops can log onto the five month old isaw yournanny

infractions rudepeople com has about six stories of rudeness and irate driver com has none many ask for donations to cover costs but some owners are hoping to make money mark buckman launched platewire in may after almost getting run off the road a few months earlier by several drivers including one who was looking in his backseat and steering with his leg the site now lists nearly license plate numbers chastised for moves like tailgating with brights on and driving too slowly in the left lane to drum up revenue mr buckman recently added advertising and an online store with branded merchandise users in about states can also pay &# to have a postcard sent to an offending driver directing the accused to the site he plans to launch another site this year that will allow people to rate and complain about local businesses and individuals "if i can create jobs and create an empire that would be awesome but my main goal is to make a web site that can actually make real world changes " mr buckman says yahoo photo site flickr has an "i hate stupid people" group that focuses on shots of regular people parking or dressing badly among other misdeeds it has nearly members as does the similar "jerks" group for pictures of "neighbor cats pooping on your lawn" or suvs parked in compact spots on google inc s youtube users have contributed videos of minor wrongs like people cutting in line on the blogs one poster refers to this new form of revenge as "blogslapping " a word that previously just referred to when one blogger criticizes anothers blog after tim halbergs santa barbara calif news press didnt show up on his doorstep for six days straight last march he grabbed his camera and launched a stakeout he stayed up all night waiting for the newspaper to arrive when it

the bicycle of a woman blocking his way the driver was quickly identified by internet vigilantes and soon apologized on television for his behavior and on a popular web site last year after one husband accused a student of having an affair with his wife other users posted the students phone number and other personal details after that groups of people showed up at his university and parents home according to some reports the student denied the affair some suggest that public shaming could be used here as a tool for social betterment in a paper in the november issue of the new york university law review lior strahilevitz a law professor at the university of chicago suggested that roads would be safer if every car had a "hows my driving " placard on the bumper asking other drivers to report bad behavior the neighbor as big brother approach is already being deployed offline since august spectators at cincinnati bengals home games have been able to call jerk to complain

morning commute the caption "cant you use your inside voice " for others posting can be revenge enough in april grace davis a stay at home mom in santa cruz calif captured a "pushy customer" wearing a
