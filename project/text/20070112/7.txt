ahead of the tape retail report could prove misleading todays retail sales report could paint a dismal picture of sales over the holiday period investors should take it with at least half a grain of salt economists surveyed by estimate that december retail sales were above novembers level which compares with a november gain of as always the focus will be on sales excluding automobiles on that count the economists are looking for a december gain of versus novembers rise if anything it could be even weaker novembers sales jump had wall streets chin scratchers scratching their heads instead both individual stores sales figures and sales data culled from mastercard transactions suggested it had been a weak month one reason the november retail sales report was so strong may have been that thanksgiving came earlier than usual that meant that more holiday sales were pushed into november but if they were pushed into november they were probably pulled from december at the same time gift card use means that a portion of holiday sales that used to be booked in december are getting booked in january instead says j p morgan chase economist haseeb ahmed as the cards get more popular by the year the government statisticians who try to adjust the sales figures for seasonal swings cant keep up even if december sales come in on the weak side overall sales for the fourth quarter will probably be on the strong side the caveat the november sales figures could get revised sharply lower after two quarters where consumer spending growth was on the weak side thats good news at least part of that pickup in spending is because of the drop in gasoline prices ubs economist jim osullivan says the housing downturn could still bite but its possible that rising incomes will help fill in the gap chinese inflation outlook is unlikely to menace u s a popular theme of the global growth story is that cheap baubles flowing out of china sold to u s consumers by discounters such as wal mart stores have helped keep inflation tame in the states now inflation may be ticking higher in china could that spell trouble down the road in the u s probably not chinas consumer price inflation may rise to this year up from an estimated annual pace of in according to china daily the state owned news service high commodity prices are behind the increase wages may be creeping up too today the labor department is expected to report that import prices rose in december from the previous month after gaining in november excluding petroleum prices were up from a year ago in november and they may have risen even more last month if inflation is on the march in china that doesnt mean the federal reserve should be on high alert china simply doesnt have much impact on overall inflation rates in the u s imports from china account for just about of the u s economy not enough to have a broad impact on inflation scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
