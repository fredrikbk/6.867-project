in nigeria a bill to punish gays divides a family theologian is pushing it his minister sons church would run afoul of law lagos nigeria augustus olakunle macaulay founded the bible university that trained his son in theology he founded the evangelical ministry that ordained his son as a minister and he is president of nigerias association of christian theologians which counts his son as a member but now prof macaulay supports a proposed law that could criminalize his sons new christian church and put him behind bars thats because his son the rev rowland jide macaulay has founded house of rainbow a church that caters to nigerias gay men and lesbians a first for africas most populous country the relationship between prof macaulay and his son mirrors some of the conflicting forces buffeting homosexuals in nigeria gay men and lesbians are becoming more visible even as their society which is hostile to homosexuality threatens to become still less tolerant of them in his new years eve sermon rev jide as he is called by his small but growing flock declared himself a "happy holy homosexual " he said "we are all gods children no matter what some people tell us " the more than attendees all male clapped and sang out their approval after the service the church sponsored a party in keeping with a church function no alcohol was served but the event featured exuberant drag queens lip synching disco hits the partys highlight a "mr bloke" beauty contest with contenders strutting their stuff in traditional african garb corporate wear and swimwear house of rainbow a member of a gay affirming u s umbrella church organization would almost certainly run afoul of nigerias proposed law homosexual sex is already punishable by up to years in prison or death by stoning in the muslim north though that shariah sentence is rarely meted out the sweeping new bill would punish by up to five years in prison anyone who enters into a gay marriage "performs witnesses aids or abets the ceremony of same sex marriage" or is "involved in the registration of gay clubs societies and organizations sustenance procession or meetings " the u s state department has denounced the bill proposed in january last year as a violation of basic freedoms but the bill is widely expected to pass it is supported by most mainstream christian and muslim clergy in nigeria including peter akinola the anglican archbishop who is leading an international revolt of conservative episcopalians angry about the ordination of gay priests and the consecration of gay unions archbishop akinola who also opposes the ordination of women priests has become the spiritual leader of more than american conservative churches that have broken away from the world wide anglican communion anglican christianity was brought to nigeria in by a particularly conservative group of british missionaries and "there has been a hardening of attitudes as the west has liberalized " says philip jenkins professor of history and religious studies at pennsylvania state university and author of "the new faces of christianity believing the bible in the global south " prof jenkins notes that many african societies still derive their norms from agrarian life and that animal sacrifice and polygamy are common in many parts of africa "the bible carries a lot more weight among ordinary africans partly because people can identify with the society it describes " he says "they recognize it as their world " this leads africans to a more literal interpretation of scripture he believes the rise of fundamentalist islam also puts pressure on african christians to draw a hard line against homosexuals he says but urban nigerians are increasingly aware of the advance of gay rights not only in the u s but also in south africa which enshrines equal rights for homosexuals in its constitution and recently legalized marriage for same sex couples the fact that nigerias legislature is considering the new bill testifies to the growing visibility of gay men and lesbians in nigeria as for the macaulays the father and son are both polite well educated and well traveled the elder macaulay is but looks so young that he and his year old son are sometimes mistaken for brothers and they were close even as the younger macaulay was struggling in secret born in london rev jide says he had his first homosexual experience in nigeria where he spent his teenage years ashamed of his attraction to men he married a nigerian woman in london in and had a son with her about three years later increasingly depressed he told his wife the truth they divorced and he was expelled from their church he says he and his wife now speak only to discuss their son with whom rev jide remains close rev jide says that for many years he wanted to tell his father but he says "i couldnt find the courage " then during a visit prof macaulay made to his sons london home in he noticed some books on homosexuality he confronted his son admonishing him that homosexuality was against gods will and urging him to change rev jide remained silent both men recall "in truth i felt for him because i am a father too " the younger man says "i have two generations on either side of me bearing the brunt of my being gay " indeed last september after rev jide discussed his sexuality on a bbc television show his year old son sent him a cellphone text message that read in part "i hate u" and "ur not my dad nemore " the two reconciled a few days later but rev jide believes his sons emotional turmoil is stoked in part by relatives telling him the bible condemns homosexuality many nigerians say they would disown a gay child but prof macaulay who comes from a family so prominent that a street in lagos is named after one of his uncles tries to take a love the sinner hate the sin approach in a letter to his son shortly after discovering his sons homosexuality he wrote "people in nigeria here love you and rate you high in their lives " but in that same letter he warned that his sons homosexuality "is not only abominable but a great disgrace to our family " to the extent that his sons church affirms homosexuality it is "of satan " the father says so despite protests from his wife prof macaulay supports the anti gay legislation he says he "wont feel very bad" if his son winds up in prison which he even sees as a possible means of turning his son straight at house of rainbow rev jide repeatedly encounters his own family struggle in members of his flock "the biggest issue " he says "is people have been wounded in their family by being rejected by being totally unloved " another key issue he says is nurturing healthy relationships in "a society that is very very brutal" toward gay people gay men tend to meet in the relative safety of the internet but relationships often founder because the men cant build a life together says adebisi alimi a member of house of rainbow and one of nigerias very few openly gay activists fearing gay bashers always a threat in nigeria where homosexuals cant count on police to protect them rev jide arranged for the new years eve service and party to be held on the far outskirts of lagos the event was held under the moon in an open air courtyard with a dirt floor electricity always sporadic in lagos kept cutting out as the backup generator sputtered but as midnight approached the congregation counted down the seconds with gusto then hugged and danced before resuming the service to take communion when rev jide announced he would offer a blessing for gay singles dozens rushed to him some kneeling "may you find a fine boyfriend " rev jide prayed
