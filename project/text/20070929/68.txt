president ron gettelfinger a southern indiana native and former ford chassis repairman instead of trying to block gm from sending jobs overseas or eliminating them mr gettelfingers contract uses inducements such as a significantly lower starting wage for new hires and certain support and subassembly workers to persuade gm to retain and perhaps even create more uaw positions it falls now on mr gettelfinger to persuade uaw gm members over the next week that this fundamental shift is what the union must do and get them to vote yes on the deal that process started well for mr gettelfinger on friday the first day he began disclosing details of the contract to the rest of his union uaw membership now numbered at about once topped million local uaw gm plant presidents and chairpersons gave the tentative agreement unanimous support on friday several of them interviewed after the vote noted the commitments in the uaw gm contract for specific products in specific years for specific plants

thought there might be changes we just couldnt live with " mr gettelfinger said during a news conference after the vote that a show of support from local leaders "gives us a pretty good indication" that the tentative agreement will be accepted nationwide he said he hopes to conclude rank and file voting by oct the union run trust known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or a veba has been the focus of these talks and likely will be the issue mr gettelfinger and the uaw plant leaders will have to work on the most as they sell the agreement to members uaw opponents of the veba already have begun a campaign online and in person urging members to vote against the contract because of the veba "im not concerned about that at all " said mr gettelfinger according to uaw highlights of the deal gm will put in added payments of as much as &# million over the next years with the entire safety net not exceeding &# billion if health care costs rise faster than expected active workers will play a role in funding the veba as they will forgo certain cost of living adjustment promises they might otherwise have received according to the document distributed friday the veba will include a &# billion convertible note the note is a mechanism thats designed to be a windfall for the veba in the event of a gm stock price increase if the conversion is not triggered it essentially works like a standard bond gm shares moved higher friday afternoon as the terms of the deal were announced the stock was quoted at &# up cents in p m composite trading on the new york
