the buzz marketwatch weekend investor shutterflys shipping revenue may airbrush profit picture when silicon valley venture capitalist and entrepreneur jim clark resigned as chairman and quit the board of shutterfly inc earlier this year one of the reasons he gave was that as a "technologist " he believed there was "little that i can offer to guide what has become a manufacturing company " mr clark the companys largest holder hasnt yet sold any shares but his departure and the "manufacturing" comment may have been more significant than the picture perfect performance of shutterflys stock would suggest since going public a year ago shutterflys shares have more than doubled as a pure play on the boom in digital cameras the company calls itself "an internet based social expression and personal publishing service that enables consumers to share print and preserve their memories by leveraging our technology manufacturing web design and merchandising capabilities " that is a touchy feely way of saying it processes digital photos for consumers with the hopes of also selling them such things as photo books personalized photo greeting cards and scrapbooks it has been a growing business and an idea whose time has clearly come it also is one with plenty of competition from the likes of the kodak gallery from eastman kodak co snapfish a unit of hewlett packard co and flickr which is owned by yahoo inc as you might guess that means there also is plenty of price competition in the space which gets us back to mr clarks departure and his "manufacturing" comments and why they may be relevant a hefty and increasing chunk of shutterflys revenue doesnt come from products but instead from the amount shutterfly charges for shipping if you are like me you probably assumed that when you buy something online the cost of shipping is merely a pass through but at shutterfly those shipping fees also are a profit center the company is currently only profitable in its fourth quarter "we do make money on it " says judith mcgarry director of investor relations while not disclosing just how profitable it is shutterfly does acknowledge that shipping is a "significant" revenue generator that for the first nine months of generated of sales before ending the year at up from the year before that compares with at amazon com inc which unlike shutterfly discloses shipping costs amazons disclosures show that shipping is a money loser thanks largely to free shipping shutterfly as of its first quarter stopped disclosing shipping revenue quarterly instead preferring to do so at years end the reason ms mcgarry says is that there is too much fluctuation in part because of rising postal costs and the way shipping is allocated to products not surprisingly shutterfly fans dont mention shipping as an issue instead analysts such as youssef squali of jefferies &amp co and brad manuilow of american technology research highlight in their reports how the company plans to expand with new products and line extensions sounds great on paper but at times this years expected per share earnings and times s shutterfly trades more like the kind of technology company that mr clark prefers than like a manufacturing company and not just any manufacturing company but one that gets nearly a quarter of its sales and an unknown portion of profit from something as nebulous and potentially unpredictable as shipping which isnt even a product and as of the last year appears to be a growing influence on the companys financial performance ms mcgarry counters that "its not clear that shipping is going to rise as a percent of revenue " and besides she says "we dont think thats a meaningful way to view the business " which might mean it really is herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
