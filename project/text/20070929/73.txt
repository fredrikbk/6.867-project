weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations hear hear you dont want to judge christ by christians someone once said he is perfect they are not in a similar way you dont want to judge capitalism by capitalists or the legitimacy of democracy by the democrats or the vitality of our republic by the republicans you have to take the thing pure and in itself while allowing for the flaws and waywardness of its practitioners i say this because here in america we have reached a funny pass people are doing and saying odd things as if they dont know the meaning of the thing they say they stand for in particular i mean we used to be proud of whom we allowed to speak and now are leaning toward defining ourselves by whom we dont speak to and will not allow to speak this is not progress conservatives on campus are shouted down a crusader against illegal immigration is rushed off the stage at columbia university great newspapers give ad breaks to groups with which they feel an ideological affinity but turn away ads from those they do not such as antiabortion groups and they call this a business so much silencing it seems so weak so out of keeping with who we are we love the tradition of free speech in america but you dont want to judge its health by what weve done with it lately or to it in the premier of the soviet union came and spoke in the united states nikita khrushchev was our sworn enemy and a vulgarian sweaty faced ill educated dressed in a suit just off the racks from the gulag kresges i was a child but i remember the impression he made he took off his shoe and banged it literally on the soft beige wood of a desk at the u n as he fulminated his nation had nuclear weapons they were aimed at us the new cuban dictator fidel castro was there too he was young and bearded and dressed in camouflage he too soon would have missiles pointed at us he not only went to the u n and spoke to the world he refused to stay at the waldorf and sweetly chose instead a hotel in harlem to show his solidarity with americas oppressed the americans there seemed to get the joke and welcomed him with laughter they knew he was playing them but then theyd been played before khrushchevs trip and castros were all about propaganda all about sticking it to uncle sam and heres what happened nothing their presence hurt our country exactly zero percent in fact it raised us high reminding the world we are the confident nation that lets its foes speak uncensored as an adult nation would you know where im going is it necessary to say when one speaks of mahmoud ahmadinejad that you disapprove of him disagree with him believe him a wicked fellow and are not amused that he means to have missiles aimed at us and our friends if it is i am happy to say it who really isnt but this has been our history to let all speak and to fear no one thats a good history to continue the council on foreign relations was right to invite him to speak last year that is the councils job to hear listen and parse and columbia university was well within its rights to let him speak this year though in what is now apparently columbia tradition the stage was once again stormed but this time verbally and by a university president whose aggression seemed sharpened by fear there were two revealing moments in ahmadinejads appearance the first is that in his litany of complaint against the united states he seemed not to remember the taking and abuse of american diplomatic hostages in an odd thing to forget since he is said to have been part of that operation the second was the moment when he seemed to assert that his nation does not have homosexuals this won derisive laughter and might have been a learning moment for him dictators dont face derisive from crowds back home it was like the moment in when khrushchevs motorcade stalled on third avenue and a commuter walked by and gave him the finger actually i dont know there was such a moment but knowing americans im sure there was talking and listening to the wicked is the way we always operated in the long freak show that was th century world leadership and im sure before if jefferson had dined only with those whod been a force for good in the world jefferson would often have dined alone if we insist only good and moral leaders talk to us well wind up surrounded by silence in fact if we insist we talk only to those whose good deeds have matched their high aspirations we wont always be on speaking terms with ourselves domestically the democratic presidential candidates appear only before supportive groups they dont speak to antitax groups and talk about their own assumptions regarding tax policy they dont go to traditional values groups its all very controlled and its unworthy of a great nation when people say the campaign feels artificial thats what they mean its not john edwardss hairspray or hillary clintons makeup its that they give every sign of being afraid to speak and listen to those who havent been patted down by thought cops for unacceptable views the republicans are the same an invitation to debate on univision the spanish language network they have scheduling conflicts what about the log cabin republicans no time right now how unserious if you candidate a have clear and serious reasons for desiring the wave of millions a year illegally over the border to stop you should be able to talk to hispanic groups and audiences about it you go straight to them and appeal to their patriotism fairness and common sense why because theyre patriotic and fair and have common sense it is a compliment to show you know this will some of them boo yes of course so what too bad thats the price you pay for being truthful at a tough time and in america its always a tough time the staffs gurus and handlers of all the candidates are always afraid their guy will get booed but do they realize how tired we are of hearing the tepid applause that follows the predictable pander i know theyre all always eager to laud ronald reagan but reagan began his fall campaign in the south bronx and argued his case with people on the street after he was elected he pleaded for peace in letters to leonid brezhnev too bad he wasnt tough enough oh wait i think the problem is not coming from normal americans but from our leadership class our academics and political leaders the new fearfulness has resulted in new foreign policy "lets not speak to buffy " great hows that working for ya
