to spend an extra &# brian day executive director of the north american association for environmental education a professional nonprofit group based in washington says it helps to tell children that theres more than one way to cut down on carbon emissions he recommends driving less and reminding kids about carpools your son comes home from school and hassles his little sister to save energy by not using her nightlight watching an episode of "spongebob squarepants" on tv uses more energy than one nightlight does in an entire night mr day says still he recommends that the sister unplug her

plastic pudding cups in the trash where possible mr doherty recommends presenting a unified front telling the children to talk directly to that parent and reminding them that its not nice to tattle
