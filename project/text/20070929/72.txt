weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes choosing crowd pleasers our neighborhood is having a progressive dinner weve asked people to bring a favorite bottle of wine and an appetizer to share at the first house they then will walk down the street to our home to have the main course of beef and whatever side dishes others will bring knowing what past experiences have been i doubt any wine will be left over from the cocktail party to have with our part of the dinner can you suggest a good but hopefully inexpensive wine to share with of our closest neighbors marguerite ragone reston va when we were asked recently to provide the wine for a school event we brought beaujolais and chilean sauvignon blanc and thats what wed recommend get both as young as possible you might see sauvignon blanc and beaujolais but stay clear of any nouveau these are reasonably priced especially by the case and crowd pleasers between the two they pair well with just about any food special sauternes i have been keeping a bottle of wine that my mother bought when she lived in miami beach and held for years b&amp g sauternes i wonder whether it is likely to be very special because of its age or really bad if special i will open it on a special occasion with friends it is a dark caramel color i think darker than i remember it long ago but im not sure ken beckerman pittsburgh this is why we invented open that bottle night it seems that everyone has one special wine that they cant stand to open so on the last saturday of every february we open them together otbn will be saturday feb if you are not familiar with otbn drop us a note at wine wsj com and well send you this years follow up article in terms of this bottle sauternes ages beautifully for years and does get darker as time goes by if this were a top notch sauternes that had been kept in excellent conditions were pretty sure it would be delicious with this bottle wed be cautious but if you open it and celebrate the memories of your mother that come pouring out the taste of the wine isnt really the point thats what otbn is all about picking when theyre paying in a recent wine notes we were asked what to do when friends insist you order the wine at a restaurant and theyre paying for it heres one interesting response i just read your response to the question of how to handle the situation of someone asking you to pick out the wine at a restaurant when this happens our solution is this we reply that we would be happy to choose a wine but our rule is if we choose the wine we pay for it we then have the waitstaff put the wine on a separate bill for us this approach seems to keep everyone happy lynn perenic franklin mich you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to include your name city and state
