weekend journal sports golf journal golfs turf wackos a look at the obsession with creating lush grass for craig schreiner a golf course designer from myrtle beach s c the highlight of any project is the final step "draping" the course in a variety of attractive grasses "if the golf course site is the canvas and the routing plans and the bunkers are the pencil outlines the grass is the paint " he says he uses the contrasting tints and textures of different grass strains to define the fairways greens and roughs and often frames his compositions with colorful areas of high fescue the grass he said is like "a silk dress on a woman with a good figure it may not cling exactly but it reveals the shape beneath " mr schreiner is a "turf wacko" the fond term that greg lyman director of environmental programs for the golf course superintendents association of america uses to describe many golf architects and almost all of the countrys grass besotted course superintendents in simpler times known as greenkeepers or greenskeepers and they are joined in their condition by a large number of home lawn owners albeit in many cases frustrated ones "a lot of people who care for their own yard see the golf course as the pinnacle of what they could achieve " mr lyman says "but unfortunately they tend to gloss over the science and the technical sophistication necessary to grow performance level grass " many course superintendents including mr lyman have luscious home lawns but they are often able to maintain them with half the effort that their neighbors expend and even more importantly a fraction of the environmental degradation simply because they know how the aesthetic passion for grass is one that eludes many including in my world my wife my daughter and all of my close personal friends the only lawn related compliment i can recall ever receiving specifically about a new patch of grass i painstakingly brought to life on a difficult slope came from an avid gardener friend "and grass is so hard to grow " she ooohed midway through my modest words of acceptance i realized her voice had been dripping with sarcasm my wife explains my ardor for our lawn as an outgrowth of my love for golf and im sure thats part of it as it turns out the history of the suburban lawn in deeply intertwined with that of golf one of the most popular volumes on the topic "the lawn a history of an american obsession" by virginia scott jenkins features a photo from a magazine ad of the legendary golf pro sam snead pushing a mower the initial models for lawns in this country were the landscapes of the great english country houses in the victorian era well kept lawns emerged as an important expression of bourgeoisie order but by the early years of the last century as ms jenkins writes country clubs became the aspirational anchors of the new suburbs and velvety golf courses increasingly became the inspiration for home lawns the state of turfgrass science in that era was still pretty primitive but in the mid s the u s golf association and the u s department of agriculture began to fund a joint research project the turfgrass equivalent of the s man on the moon program to develop new strains of grass and better methods for growing it according to ms jenkins the usda had initially been reluctant but surrendered to the persuasions of several high ranking employees who were also influential members of the usga "if these men had not worked for the usda or if they had not been golfers the domestic landscape of the united states might look very different today " she wrote most golf playing lawn owners i know have at least briefly toyed with the notion of building a backyard putting green when mr lyman of the gcsaa taught at michigan state university he fielded many inquiries on the matter "my advice was always to lie down until the thought went away " he says apart from typical installation costs of at least &# putting surfaces to roll smoothly need to be mowed daily with a specialized mower that costs &# to &# what about establishing backyard turf short enough for practice chipping also tough the performance level turf on golf course fairways is typically maintained at between one quarter and three quarters of an inch and mowed with mowers that "float" along bumps and hillsides three or more times a week rough grass designed to be difficult to hit balls from is typically cut at inches or higher whereas the grass on typical home lawns is to inches long plus the blue grass and rye strains commonly used on home lawns would never survive a summer cut below inch conversely the bent grass and bermuda strains used in golf fairways would be prostrate at typical lawn lengths and look terrible like a bad comb over but thats not to say homeowners dont have a lot to learn from golf course practices for the past three years david phipps a course superintendent in portland ore has been teaching a three hour class called "golf course quality lawns " he is currently in talks about syndicating the curriculum nationwide "people think they can go out and buy a bunch of fertilizers and get a beautiful green lawn but thats a good way to waste a lot of money you have to think in terms of treating the whole plant starting with the soil and good drainage " he says "in fact honestly one of the main points of my class is to make people aware of the adverse impact on the environment when they take care of their lawns incorrectly " yearly practices such as aeration extracting inch plugs from the soil to allow more oxygen into the roots dethatching and top dressing with lime or gypsum to adjust the soils ph level can drastically reduce the costly and potentially toxic chemicals needed to create a thick green lawn so can frequent mowing with a sharp blade never cut away more than the top third of the grass blade and smart watering how much and how often depends on the drainage properties of the soil the problem of course is that all this is hard to figure out for time pressed homeowners few of us have college degrees in botany or turf science as most top course superintendents do these days its just one more
