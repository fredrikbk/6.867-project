fannie to the rescue fannie and freddie went up the hill to fetch a pail of money last week we cant say they broke their crown but it also seems no one is about to write them a blank check to profit from the current turmoil in the housing and mortgage markets at least not until after the election fannie mae and its sibling freddie mac have been in moderate purgatory since their dual accounting scandals earlier this decade but now they are using the subprime mortgage mess as a political lever to return to business as usual or better in particular they would love official sanction to purchase jumbo mortgages those above the &# limit on loans they are permitted by current law to securitize they would especially like to see the regulatory caps lifted on the size of their portfolios of mortgage backed securities mbss held on their balance sheets these are two very different issues but the motive for both is the same profit we like profits but fannies and freddies are of a very particular kind involving private profit but socialized risk their quasi governmental nature and the implicit promise of a taxpayer bailout allows the companies to borrow at rates unavailable to even their best private competitors and the current market gyrations present a unique opportunity to leverage that borrowing advantage right now jumbo mortgages carry interest rates of some basis points above so called conforming mortgages the sort fannie and freddie are permitted to securitize and re sell that would make it a cinch for the duo to buy up those mortgages with taxpayer subsidized cash and either package and re sell them or hold them to capture the interest rate spread it might also as treasury secretary hank paulson has noted bring down the cost of getting a large mortgage in the short term but jumbo mortgage rates have already come down some and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke says that by early next year he expects them to have fallen even more as "government sponsored enterprises " or gses fannie and freddie are supposed to assist low income housing but they want to move up the income chain because thats where the money is its less clear why democrats in congress should help them do so this would do little or nothing to help the subprime market or the most distressed borrowers but then again doing favors for fannie and freddie is a favorite pastime on capitol hill in return for campaign cash as for their mbs portfolios mr paulson laid it out plainly "when mortgage spreads widen growth in the gses retained mortgage portfolio provides enhanced profit opportunities given the gses debt funding advantage " but as the treasury secretary added delicately "whether this request will have a positive impact on the mortgage market is much less clear " thats for sure lifting the cap on portfolio size would be a windfall for fan and fred but since the mortgage giants are unlikely to buy troubled loans for their portfolios its not likely to help the subprime borrowers whom congress claims to want to help remarkably mr paulson mr bernanke and house financial services chairman barney frank spoke with one voice last week any legislation that loosens restrictions on fannie and freddie should also strengthen regulators ability to control the companies our guess is that fan and fred wont take that deal holding out for hillary clintons election and a return to party time in
