columbia furor its useless to debate the insanity of hate in his sept global view column "columbias conceit " bret stephens wrote "on saturday john coatsworth acting dean of columbia universitys school of international and public affairs made the remark that if hitler were in the united states and if he were willing to engage in a debate and a discussion to be challenged by columbia students and faculty we would certainly invite him this was by way of defending the universitys decision to host a speech yesterday by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad " dean coatsworths imagined invitation to adolph hitler in fails to understand that just debating the subject "should we or should we not kill all the jews" would have automatically bestowed a positive to the question at the start it is irrational to debate the insanity of hate contrary to columbias description of the invitation to ahmadinejad as a "debate " it was nothing more than a one sided rant if a debate had been desired columbia president lee bollinger should have invited a representative of israel to defend that nation on the same platform if mahmoud ahmadinejad then failed to appear or walked off the students and faculty at columbia would have received a much needed lesson as to which side supported free speech and open debate seymour yusem new york mr stephens notes that columbia university in invited nazi germanys ambassador to the united states hans luther to speak on campus luthers remarks focused on what he characterized as hitlers peaceful intentions columbias flirting with the nazis did not end there while williams college canceled its student exchanges with germany columbia and others refused to do likewise and in columbia sent prof arthur remy as its representative to anniversary celebrations at the university of heidelberg where the nazis had expelled all jewish instructors implemented a curriculum based on nazi ideology and organized book burnings remy said he found a reception with josef goebbels incidentally the man in charge of the book burnings to be "very enjoyable " columbia students protested the universitys participation at heidelberg by picketing the home of president nicholas murray butler dr butler responded by permanently expelling the leader of the protest robert burke from columbia for allegedly using "disrespectful language " the current president of columbia lee bollinger evidently feels his invitation to a would be hitler mahmoud ahmadinejad constituted a tribute to the principle of free speech a more impressive gesture would be a public apology to the family of robert burke rafael medoff director the david s wyman institute for holocaust studies washington mr stephenss reaction to dean coatsworths hitler comment is compelling and one that i largely agree with but since the context of the comment has much to due with present day iran and the decision to host irans president ahmadinejad i thought the discussion needed to be broadened the fact that this great country lived up to its ideals and permitted the man to speak is a victory for us because it became an undeniable fact to those in iran who were able to see the speech on iranian tv albeit only in english and who might not be so fanatical in their fundamentalist beliefs and so might be open to concepts not emanating from the iranian leadership in the war of ideas we need to take advantage of every opportunity to send our message of the strength of our beliefs to those who are lied to by our enemies if the u s refuses to stand for itself how can we expect to win the hearts and minds of the future leaders and potential combatants of iran or for that matter any nation george linzer arlington va its not appropriate to question john coatsworths example of "inviting hitler to a debate" in defending why the school hosted a speech by mahmoud ahmadinejad the simple point he was trying to make is that the purpose of education is to help students develop judgment and judgment is only developed when one is confronted with contrasting positions that create conflict and debate hosting a speech by mr ahmadinejad does not mean the school agrees with his politics but it does provide students and faculty with the opportunity to raise their concerns directly to him these types of forums are the best way to get firsthand information and i dont agree that they resemble "confronting a wild animal by staring at it through its cage at a zoo " julian aldeco johnson graduate school of management cornell university ithaca n y mr stephens reminds us again that unrealistic philosophy can lead us to foolishness that may hasten our own demise columbia university decided to exercise its right to offer a forum to mr ahmadinejad in like manner many politicians and other prominent people have been exercising their right of free speech in which they give aid and comfort to the enemy those who insist on such rights are like the driver who insisted on his "rights of the road" in "transfusion " a popular song a few decades ago the chorus "he was right dead right but just as dead as if hed been wrong " eugene henn rochester n y
