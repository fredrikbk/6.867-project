how economy could survive oil at &# a barrel compared to u s is more able to handle once unthinkable rise the world economy has managed with some indigestion to swallow the rise of oil prices past &# a barrel how well could it survive &# a barrel the answer is quite well so long as several conditions still hold true the price rise would probably have to be gradual inflation couldnt get so bad as to force big interest rate hikes oil rich nations would need to pump their profits back into u s and european economies all of this has happened so far the happy confluence may continue though fears remain strong that high energy prices will tip the u s into recession a host of factors including tight oil supplies and a weak u s dollar suggest that oil prices have further to rise some analysts continue to believe that oil is destined to reach an all time high as measured in todays dollars of more than &# a barrel the record was set in on friday in new york the benchmark crude oil futures price closed down &# or to finish at &# a little more than &# off the all time high not adjusting for inflation high oil prices could lead to ugly consequences if they hit consumers pocketbooks especially in the u s where the housing slump is already hurting the economy consumer spending has been the primary engine of growth in the u s in recent years target corp was among the major retailers in the last week cutting sales forecasts target expects september sales at stores open at least a year to rise just to down from an earlier expectation of to growth for all the concern the world today is better equipped to swallow expensive oil than it was when jimmy carter was installing solar panels and a wood burning stove in the white house the main reason has to do with what some call the wal mart effect for every extra dollar taken from drivers pockets at the pump in the form of higher prices in recent years low cost exporters from china and elsewhere have put roughly &# back in the form of cheaper retail goods even at todays near record prices u s households today spend less than of their disposable income at the pump vs over in current prices are also a reflection of a strong economy not an oil embargo or war in the middle east since a market share war between saudi arabia and venezuela flooded the market with oil and drove prices to below &# a barrel in oil prices have risen nearly eight fold during that run the global economy grew roughly each year strong growth in places like china helps take some of the edge off the oil price blow for u s and european companies such as detroits big three auto makers many emerging markets are hitting a "takeoff" stage where per capita income reaches a level that sparks serious auto demand says ellen hughes cromwick ford motor co s chief economist growth in emerging markets is a "structural development" that is "less sensitive to oil price changes " she says "theres a more relaxed attitude now " said daniel yergin a noted oil historian and chairman of cambridge energy research associates at a recent event promoting alan greenspans new memoir mr yergin asked the former fed chief on stage if &# oil was a concern "he basically shrugged and said not so far " mr yergin recalls economists see global growth slowing but still chugging along at a relatively healthy this year and next high oil prices also mean more money for oil producing nations such as russia and saudi arabia to invest globally "if resource owners are now getting a bigger piece of the pie to spend and invest then &# oil shouldnt be a problem" in the absence of a u s recession says independent energy economist philip verleger jr "and that investment is happening " such sanguine views while they are far from universal reflect a fundamental shift in economists understanding of how energy prices affect the economy historically oil prices have doubled or trebled in a matter of weeks because of sudden and sharp supply disruptions such as those in following the iranian revolution and the outbreak of the iran iraq war that prompted the fed to raise interest rates sharply in an effort to head off a spiral of inflation current fed chairman ben bernanke has spent a lot of time trying to understand such shocks in he analyzed the effects of sharp rise in prices during the oil shocks of and in the brookings papers on economic activity his surprising conclusion the feds cure for high oil prices was worse than the disease "the majority of the impact of an oil price shock on the real economy is attributable to the central banks response to the inflationary pressures engendered by the shock " he wrote today that view is fairly mainstream among central bankers mr bernankes fed recently responded to the subprime mortgage crisis by cutting benchmark interest rates for the first time in four years by implication the fed was saying it was more worried about the fallout from credit market gloom than about the risk of inflation at a time of record energy prices thats a risky but educated bet growing fuel efficiency could also blunt the blow of higher prices james barnes a union pacific corp spokesman says the railroad has bought more fuel efficient locomotives and trained engineers to operate trains in ways that conserve fuel "from a macro level we would anticipate that rising oil costs will make us more competitive with trucks and potentially drive more business our way " mr barnes says in china the engine of growth on which many are counting other energy sources can make up for oil china uses oil for only of its energy needs with most of the rest coming from coal unlike in the u s where imported oil goes to fill peoples gasoline tanks china mainly uses oil in industrial settings where coal may be an alternative greater coal use however would also exacerbate chinas already serious pollution problem and speed up emissions of gases that contribute to global warming still some fear the impact of &# a barrel oil would be too powerful for the u s to overcome "if we arent already headed for a recession it could push us in that direction " says bill zollars chairman and chief executive officer of yrc worldwide inc a large trucking company based in overland park kan "with a very fragile economy like we have now this could be another burden for the consumer and the business community " mr zollars says shipment volumes at yrc which serves many retailers and manufacturers have dropped to levels "we are not seeing the kind of volume we would normally expect" ahead of the christmas retail season he adds higher oil prices could hit the beleaguered auto and airline industries detroit is still digging out from the fall in demand for sport utility vehicles caused by the climb in gasoline prices paul ballew general motors corp s top sales analyst explained sluggish industry sales earlier this month by citing in part high fuel prices which he called "effectively a tax on u s households " for now most economists expect oil prices will stay high through next year an unexpected hurricane in the gulf or a sudden disruption to oil flows from a big producer like iran or mexico could push oil to &# they say demand is chugging along the paris based international energy agency sees world oil demand in the fourth quarter rising by or million barrels a day from a year ago to nearly million barrels a day of course those forecasts could go awry if the u s economy tanks and brings europe and japan along with it then demand would likely ease and oil prices could fall perhaps significantly and then the world would have something else to worry about daniel machalaba shai oster susan carey and mike spector contributed to this article
