weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece his interpretation of dreams freud brought the unconscious to the publics consciousness anatomy of a classic the interpretation of dreams" is sigmund freuds most important work "it contains " he said "the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make insight such as this falls to ones lot but once in a lifetime " at the time of the books publication in in vienna most doctors regarded dreams as a mysterious biological phenomenon freud argued that dreams had a psychological meaning but more importantly he introduced a revolutionary model of the mind he called his creation "psychoanalysis " which only later became accepted as a branch of psychiatry initially the dream book was ignored six years after publication the first edition had sold only copies but about that time psychiatrists who were captivated by freuds psychoanalysis such as carl jung joined the new movement thereafter freuds influence spread everywhere to just about every humanistic discipline today as harold bloom has written freud has become unrivaled as the "central imagination of our age " freud makes two fundamental points first every person harbors unconscious thoughts that are not only wholly unknown to him but govern every aspect of his conscious thoughts and actions second unconscious ideas include bizarre sexual fantasies derived from early childhood the dream theory developed out of freuds psychoanalytic treatment of neuroses such as hysteria hysterical symptoms might include a paralysis of an arm but the paralysis had no known biological cause a hysterical patient under hypnosis could be induced to move the same arm that remained paralyzed when she was awake freud believed that the paralysis was not a biological symptom it was a psychological symptom the paralysis prevented the woman from acting out her unconscious wish to strike her mother at the same time the thought was so forbidden that the patient had no clue to the meaning of the paralysis a dream he was surprised to find was constructed like a hysterical symptom the dream was the result of the dreamers repression of an unacceptable wish this wish was impossible to discover by simply examining the surface of the dream because the dreamer had unconsciously disguised the offending wish psychoanalytic interpretation was required to discover the meaning of a dream just as it was required to understand the meaning of the paralyzed arm for example freud describes a young woman patient who dreams that her sisters young son was lying in a coffin could the patient really be wishing for the death of her nephew as freud and the young woman analyzed the dream she spoke about a time when there was an actual death the death of her sisters first born at that time a condolence call was made by a professor the woman loved but whom she rarely saw during his visit she had a chance to be near him as he looked at the dead child lying in the coffin freud could then make his interpretation "if now the other boy were to die the same thing would happen and the professor would be certain to come to offer his condolences so that you would see him again under the same conditions as the other time the dream means no more than your wish to see him once more a wish which you are inwardly struggling against " for freud every dream is a struggle between conscious and unconscious thoughts the unconscious wish in the young womans dream was the desire to see the professor the dream was about him not the nephew her dream thoughts included the idea that the death of her nephew would unite her with the professor all that mattered was that her wish be fulfilled in the dream and she would employ any sort of thinking in order to accomplish that it did not matter how bizarre irrational or cruel the thought was just so long as the dreamers desires were fulfilled "the interpretation of dreams " freud said "is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind " and these unconscious activities are every bit the same in waking life as they are in dreams "the interpretation of dreams" does not stop with the description of unconscious processes it also describes the contents of the unconscious the most important of which are childhood sexual desires it is here that freud introduces the oedipus complex oedipuss murdering his father and copulating with his mother cannot be simply dismissed as some freakish abomination he says sophocles play is powerful because it resonates with the unconscious wishes of the audience oedipus has fulfilled what we all desire freud believes that all of our dreams include "infantile sexuality " his term for sexual desires of childhood sexuality does not start at puberty we are passionate sexual beings from the beginning another of freuds revolutionary ideas since everyone dreams freudian psychoanalysis became not just a theory of mental illness but also a general psychology our everyday actions are profoundly influenced by forces of which we are entirely unaware what a blow to our self importance as freud points out we are not even masters in our own house add infantile sexuality to the power of the unconscious and you can see why freud will always be controversial and why he will continue to be attacked as obscene it is hard to imagine that there will ever be a time when readers will accept calmly that year old boys wish to copulate with their mothers and will unconsciously retain that desire for the rest of their lives but isnt it true that freud was wrong yes often for him the dream of one white viennese male was enough to form a universal theory he either ignored or dismissed statistical data so important to the work of a present day psychiatrist and when he wished to support his findings he was more likely to cite a poet like sophocles than a scientist right or wrong freud has something intelligent to say about almost everything he has made the continuing analysis of our irrationality a staple of our discourse whether or not we read him when talking about human motivation it is hard to avoid using concepts like denial projection narcissism erotogenic zones repression defense mechanisms or even freudian slips freudian ideas are embedded everywhere in our everyday thinking as w h auden wrote at the time of freuds death in "if often he was wrong and at times absurd to us he is no more a person now but a whole climate of opinion " dr miller is a clinical professor of psychiatry at george washington university and a teaching analyst at the washington psychoanalytic institute see related letter "letters to the editor perchance to dream with freudian nuance" wsj oct
