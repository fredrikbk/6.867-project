american century in flux at the top why the faces change from fund ceo down the most valuable asset of an investment firm walks out the door every night or so the saying goes at american century investments the mutual fund company that boasts lance armstrong as a celebrity endorser that asset hasnt always been coming back the next morning in recent months the &# billion mutual fund company has changed its chief executive chief investment officer and chief financial officer in addition the chief technology officer general counsel and director of global trading were among more than executives or fund managers who have left the firm or changed duties just last monday the firm announced a bond fund manager had left some of the executives retired and many of the departures were planned long in advance some of the changes were part of efforts to improve performance of some lagging funds or beef up certain lines of business a new chief investment officer for u s growth stocks and another for international stocks were brought in from outside in the past year and several other new executives also have been taken on to help install more sophisticated investing strategies that could appeal to institutional clients such rapid change has investors and fund industry watchers scratching their heads and wondering just what is going on the firms founding family has moved on to other ventures too most notably to the stowers institute for medical research a acre complex near american century headquarters in kansas city mo american century founder jim stowers jr and his wife started the facility several years ago after they were diagnosed with cancer its &# billion endowment is made up mostly of american century stock their son jim stowers iii left the american century board this year to focus on his own separate business venture the board is now co run by the elder mr stowers and by richard brown a former hospital executive who also is co chairman of the stowers institute board interviews with six former employees and several current senior officials shed additional light on the sweeping overhaul some top staff left because they wanted better long term incentive pay others tiring of the midwest wanted to move to the east or west coasts they say weak fund performance such as the results posted by the firms flagship &# billion american century ultra fund which was one of the worst performing distinct large growth funds over a recent three year period is another factor american century executives say much of the overhaul has been part of an organized management transition that began more than a year ago as certain top executives planned to retire their idea was to announce the firms plans in march about a year after executives such as the new ceo and cfo were installed "as a management team we said lets wait one year to go out and tell our story but in the last few months weve been chomping at the bit" to do so says new ceo jonathan thomas he adds that while the stowers family has pursued other interests like the institute over the years current american century staff is fully focused on the investment firm american century started nearly years ago is one of the nations biggest fund companies with more than &# billion in fund and other assets financial luminaries such as myron scholes who helped create the black scholes model for pricing options now sit on a fund board j p morgan chase &amp co acquired a stake in the firm some years ago for about &# million at the time one third of the shares sold were controlled by the stowers institute in recent years american century has tried to expand its offerings like many fund firms this includes trying to attract more business from institutional investors such as pension plans and applying certain investment strategies popular among such investors such as better quantitative risk controls other recent goals have included improving investment processes expanding distribution and pursuing acquisitions it has brought on a string of new outside executives to help with such mandates including from morgan stanley investment management and munder capital management the elder mr stowers who is now years old is the son of a doctor and considered the medical field before starting american century after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and his wife with breast cancer several years ago the family began the institute to conduct scientific research the square foot facility has a staff of more than with more expansions planned in coming years last year in a move that linked the stowerss interests in investing and health care american century rebranded a group of its retirement funds as the "livestrong" portfolios the slogan of the lance armstrong foundation the nonprofit founded by the tour de france champion who also is a cancer survivor mr armstrong endorses the funds and has appeared in american century advertisements "when i do a deal with someone it really has to be based on my ideals " the cyclist said the money invested in the funds helps determine the amount that the firms management company will pay to the lance armstrong foundation a cancer nonprofit above a guaranteed amount the institutes endowment is about &# billion and made up mostly of certain american century stock according to recent tax and other filings the structure means the institute can benefit financially if american century does well this novel approach has drawn enthusiasts like mr armstrong who said that he thinks people would "want to be involved with a company thats put themselves out there on such a human level " however in interviews with departed staff some said they felt the institutes financial stake in the company was detracting from their own long term incentive pay an increasingly important carrot in the mutual fund business as lucrative positions at hedge funds continue to lure staff others cited geography as an issue one departing senior employee told an executive for instance that kansas city is "halfway to where you want to be " american century executives say that their pay is in line with peers and most employees "see the relationship with the institute as an incredible source of pride " says spokesman chris doyle "there is literally no connection whatsoever between" the financial holdings of the institute and the levels of compensation at the firm says mr thomas the ceo more private stock can also always be issued when needed to reward employees the firm is currently reviewing its compensation structure to potentially make more room for such long term profit sharing its portfolio manager retention rate was through the end of august these days improving fund performance is a top priority especially at offerings like the ultra fund which is up about so far this year well ahead of the benchmark russell growth index according to morningstar it has turned around recently as the big fast growing companies in which it invests return to favor and a tweaked investment approach helped to minimize the impact of recent market turmoil "we know one or two quarters dont make a success story but i think were headed in the right direction " says enrique chang the firms recently named chief investment officer many of the firms funds were recently top rated by morningstar and in the top quartile for performance on a year to date basis
