the weekend interviews with nouri al maliki and recep tayyip erdogan prime ministers questions last week the united nations general assembly brought many of the worlds leaders to new york this correspondent was granted exclusive interviews with two of the most interesting heads of government in the muslim world herewith are brief accounts of my visits the man who killed saddam nouri al maliki has a very nice smile not an expansive one certainly not toothy rather the kind that gently lifts his whole face especially his eyes when he decides to show it he should do so more often but then thats one of the refreshing things about mr maliki unlike so many arab leaders especially the thugs often favored by the cia and state department there is none of the false hospitality of the souk about him instead there is the quiet dignity of a man who remarked after his unlikely elevation to the post of iraqi prime minister that he had been given a heavy burden i allude to those words when we meet suggesting that god has entrusted him with a great and difficult task "hes put the responsibility on me not the trust " he laughs quietly "it is a heavy responsibility but it is an honorable one as well the most honorable thing a person can do is serve his country and his principles " it is tuesday shortly after p m and we are sitting in a suite at the ritz carlton at the southern tip of manhattan the statue of liberty looming large outside the window over the iraqi prime ministers left shoulder he has just come from meetings at the general assembly and with president bush he is punctual unusual for an iraqi and attentive as i start scribbling he quickly rips a few pages from one of my notebooks and begins jotting down thoughts of his own im told his arabic he studied literature and poetry is beautiful his penmanship certainly is and as i watch him write it occurs to me he has killed with it it was all but foreordained after the u s decided on "regime change" that saddam hussein would die whether by airstrike or by judicial process but one of the most underappreciated facts about this quiet man so often derided as "weak" by those who wish him ill for various reasons is that it was he in the end who took direct responsibility for the task it was late december and saddam who had been sentenced to hang by an iraqi tribunal the previous month had exhausted his avenues of legal appeal mr malikis dilemma was thus he could appease nervous american diplomats and assorted others pleading for a stay thereby leading iraqis of all sects to believe that the wheels of justice would not turn full circle for the former tyrant or he could sign the execution order and face the fury of so many who predicted that saddams death would only inflame the antigovernment insurgency i have yet to hear a single one of the people who criticized mr malikis decision that day admit they were wrong that saddams death lifted a great psychological weight from iraq especially its sunni population or that the momentous and positive turn of events this year in anbar province led by tribal sheikhs calling themselves the anbar salvation council would almost certainly never have taken place so long as there was breath in saddam husseins body "the situation for al qaeda today has shifted " the prime minister tells me with characteristic understatement "it has lost a lot of the bases where it was operating freely " in part this is because of the "surge" of american and iraqi forces whom mr maliki thanks repeatedly for their sacrifices but "these recent successes were also achieved because of the ordinary citizen the residents in these areas discovered the reality of al qaeda " i ask if this change of heart on the part of the sunnis dubbed the "anbar awakening" can survive the killing of charismatic leaders like sattar abu risha who was murdered by an al qaeda bomb on sept yes he assures me the movement is strong abu rishas killing only "brought all the tribes together in condemnation " the "national reconciliation" continues what about the risks i ask is he worried about the rapid growth in the number of sunni men under arms given that some of them were almost surely fighting the government not too long ago yes he confesses "we had a concern about a possible danger because of arming the tribes we worried about creating new militias while we were confronting existing ones " but he tells me there is a solution to the problem "when members of the tribes carry arms they will be part of the structure of the state " that is they do so as members of the iraqi security forces not as representatives of this or that sheikh granted the anbar awakening is still in its early days but it is more than noteworthy that it is under mr malikis allegedly "divisive" shiite led coalition that iraqs sunnis appear to have finally thrown in their lot with the central government mr maliki also deserves more credit than he gets for moving against the shiite militias associated with moqtada al sadr "we deal with all iraqis on the basis of whether they are abiding by the law or not abiding by the law " i ask him if he followed the recent testimony before congress of u s commander david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker yes he says closely "i thought he tried to be realistic " he says of gen petraeus "he talked about the difficulties and the challenges but also about the successes " what about iraqs neighbors are they helpful "no actually " he admits "at the beginning it wasnt an issue of getting more support but suffering from their negative interventions and their breaking of the principles of good neighbors " but he says things have started to change for the better because the surrounding countries now worry that troubles in iraq could spread they have "started a dialogue" with us he says adding "it is the duty of the entire world to work with iraq " throughout the course of our discussion i emphasize that he should regard this as an opportunity to speak his mind not a "gotcha" game he tells me that the overriding message he aims to deliver in new york this week is that the world must form a "united front that supports democracy and confronts terror there is no country that can say that terrorism has nothing to do with me " and he thanks the wall street journal for what he calls balanced coverage of iraq "we dont want news organizations to do propaganda for us " flattery aside i come away with the reinforced impression that prime minister maliki has been highly underrated sure it might be nice to have an iraqi prime minister with a ready smile flawless english and the unquestioned loyalty of all the countrys people but given the fractured nature of the country we found and our many missteps particularly the "proportional representation" electoral system which encouraged sectarian politics we should be thanking our lucky stars we ended up with mr maliki he is decent thoughtful and courageous he deserves our support and patience "in the s your country fought a great struggle of its own" mr maliki reminded the world in an article for this page in june yes he really did draft it himself "a civil war that took hundreds of thousands of lives but ended in the triumph of freedom and the birth of a great power " after ataturk recep tayyip erdogan is buoyant in fact he looks much younger than the last time i interviewed him a year ago in washington d c maybe a resounding electoral victory will do that for a politician but then mr erdogan had unique reasons to be concerned his islamic rooted justice and development ak party won an overwhelming parliamentary majority in but with only slightly more than a third of the national vote proportional representation again so while he presided over an unprecedented explosion of economic growth in turkey istanbul is becoming harder and harder to distinguish from any other european capital he was dogged by questions about the legitimacy and permanency of his government contemporary turkey after all is the unique creation of an ardent modernizer named mustafa kemal ataturk who did his best to suppress the expression of islam in public life and even banned traditional dress and mandated that a whole nation begin writing in latin script the countrys secularist military establishment turkey has long been a key member of nato and its intellectual classes didnt even try to disguise their contempt for the ak party government and when the post of the turkish presidency weak but a key check in the countrys constitutional scheme became vacant earlier this year a genuine government crisis appeared possible after mr erdogan nominated his foreign minister abdullah gul for the position there were mass demonstrations and threatening communiques from the military mr erdogans clever daring and simple response was to call for a new election "in the last years " mr erdogan tells me proudly "no other governing party in turkey has increased its share of the vote the second time around in versus this year " which is to say nobody can deny he has a mandate but for what will he chip away at turkeys constitutional secularism as many turkish elites fear or will he simply pursue his avowed goals of economic growth and bringing turkey closer to membership in the european union its late morning on wednesday and were sitting in the turkish cultural center on th street near the east river surrounded by the full retinue of mr erdogans most trusted advisers he has been very good about keeping up a dialogue with me since i wrote an article in early critical of anti american intellectual trends in turkey none other than the legendary turkish impresario ahmet ertegun founder of atlantic records producer of ray charles aretha franklin and led zeppelin to name just a few was one of mr erdogans unlikely supporters not long before he died last year after falling backstage at a rolling stones concert ertegun told me that while they might never have fun together over a bottle of raki mr erdogan was an honest and competent pair of hands to guide turkey forward and this is the theme the prime minister emphasizes again as we speak its all economics "reducing barriers to competition" "reducing tax rates" "freeing the entrepreneur " this is not idle talk mr erdogan has certainly been a better steward of turkeys economy than any of his imf dependent secularist predecessors but i decide to hone in on the controversial issues what about constitutional reform with the ability to wear islamic dress in government offices and schools chief among the "freedoms" mr erdogan says he wants to restore he says that no serious person can dispute that turkeys current constitution which last underwent a major revision during military rule in is in need of updating and he tells me how a committee has been set up to study other constitutions around the world which ones "the successful ones " he replies citing the united states and a number of countries in europe his sophistication is such that he is even able to talk about the virtues of britains "unwritten" constitution as for the process and timeline he tells me that while a simple majority in parliament would suffice he aims to present the new document for a popular referendum some time next year that could be another explosive moment in turkish politics but mr erdogan assures me his aims are not radical "i gave a speech on election night saying we are not the government of only the who voted for the ak party one must understand the amount of the mandate that the people choose to give " on the other hand secular turks will find his answer to my final question somewhat less reassuring is there anything he admires about ataturk and what would he criticize his neutral reply in essence that ataturk "happened " he was "a product of his times" he says "the turkey that we have today was built on the pillars that were established " mr pollock is the wall street journals editorial features editor
