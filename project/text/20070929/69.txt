veni vidi wiki latin isnt dead on vicipaedia online reference features britannia spears disneyi disputing computatrum its not that ancient romans didnt know a thing or two about wild sex they had their bacchanalia after all but lacking video technology they had no expression for "sex tape " and that is why writing about paris hilton in latin can sometimes be so difficillimum the editors of vicipaedia latina the latin version of the popular wikipedia internet reference site were thus forced to wing it in their article about the hotel heiress they described ms hiltons famous x rated web video as pellicula in interrete vulgate de coitu paridis which means more or less "the widely disseminated internet movie of pariss sex " improvising like that is necessary when using the language of chariots and togas to account for the world of suvs and navel piercings vicipaedia is a labor of love for a small group of latin buffs and weekend philologists whose motto might well be "what would julius do " their goal is a latin reference work that is hip and alive or at least as much as can be expected from a tongue long since given up for dead they write in authentic classical latin too not in the kitschy feastus maximus stuff you might see at caesars palace bartholomaeus simpson is a skateboarder experto as a pre teen britannia spears apparuit in canali disneyi cum christina aguilera et iustino timberlake in sodalitate mici muris for those who think latin means ciceros orations caveat emptor "were using an ancient language but were writing on a computer not papyrus " says josh rocchio a graduate student and one of the most active editors "there isnt anything that doesnt belong in vicipaedia you can write about julius caesar or you can write about blue cheese " that up to the minute outlook says rafael garcia another editor is a boon to beginning latin students since "its a little more down to earth reading about britney spears than it is reading about caesar conquering gaul " wikipedia is a reference work to which anyone can contribute it comes in more than languages the english version with more than two million articles is by far the biggest vicipaedia has articles catullus horace and the roman senate all are there so are musica rockica georgius bush and cadavera animata a k a zombies you can read in latin about hangman homo suspensus paper airplanes aeroplanum chartaceum and magic balls pila magica as well as about famous italians like leonardo da vinci and the super mario brothers "its a slightly odd thing to do in this century " admits andrew dalby another contributor "when i first saw vicipaedia i thought whats the point but then i started working on it and i found it addictive " professional latinists say theyre generally impressed with vicipaedia while articles written by beginning latin students often contain errata "the articles that are good are in fact very good " said robert gurval chairman of the ucla classics department latin is undergoing a resurgence high school latin enrollments are up in part because students hope college admissions offices will be impressed to see such a hard subject on their transcripts there are latin translations of dr seuss elvis presley and harry potter in finland a latinist hotbed apparently there are weekly radio news broadcasts mr rocchio years old might well be a poster boy for this new hip latin mention "classics scholar " and most people conjure up a tweedy fellow sipping port next to a bust of ovid mr rocchio wears regulation battered t shirts and jeans in his spare time he is the drummer in a rock band he went to college intending to major in physics and math but on a whim took a latin class and fell in love "i liked its structure and its simplicity the way it can take very complex ideas and express them in a couple of words " he is now a graduate student in latin and greek at the university of maryland he chanced upon vicipaedia last year at the time it was full of musty articles about roman military campaigns et cetera other latin buffs were happening onto the site at the same time and as a group they decided to liven things up mr rocchios contributions go back and forth between the traditional and the contemporary he has written on math and chess but is especially proud of his essay on the american drinking game ludus potatorius americanus known as beer pong pong cervisiale he says scholarship is important even though most readers dont use vicipaedia as a reference per se but instead as language practice most of the work among the editors is collegial though now and then debates break out one involved the proper neologism for "computer " vicipaedia calls it a computatrum despite the vehement opposition of editor justin mansfield who says the word is just bad latin "you cant use trum at will to make new words " insists mr mansfield also a classics grad student "trum actually fell out of use around the time of the punic wars its like th in english you can say warmth but you cant say coolth " mr mansfield lobbied for computatorium but was outvoted he prevailed though with "particle accelerators " the atom smashers used by physicists which per his suggestion are known on vicipaedia as particularum acceleratorium observes mr rocchio "we tend to argue about words ad infinitum " most vicipaedia articles duplicate topics also covered on english wikipedia though occasionally when an editor is interested in a particular subject it will get exclusive latin treatment j w love an editor who is also an anthropology professor has published latin translations of samoan poems so why bother vicipaedias volunteers usually say they simply enjoy keeping up with the latin they had in school mr garcia for instance teaches physics in massachusetts at worcester polytechnic institute and says he likes keeping in practice well enough to be able to read classics like isaac newtons "principia" in the original mr rocchios coda "latin has a tradition of years and we dont want that to end latin isnt dead it just smells funny "
