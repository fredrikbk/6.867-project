not the place i originally moved to youve got overcrowded roads the utilities are higher now taxes are unreasonable everything in florida is more expensive " john cypherd retiree who left florida last month for north carolina tampa fla for almost a century florida has been a magnet for mobile americans the states plentiful sunshine and open space has attracted "snowbirds" fleeing winter retirees living out the last chapter of their lives and down on their luck workers in search of jobs a steady flow of newcomers has kept the states population growing faster than the nations often much faster since the s but for americans on the move florida has become a less appealing destination moving company atlas van lines brought families into florida last year and took out the first time it has moved more out than in the number of people from other states who switch to a florida drivers license is down more than from last year and the states crowded schools actually lost students last year prompting many counties to cut back on their construction schedule and in some cases look to close schools while foreigners continue to arrive at a rate of about year migration from inside the country is slowing floridas pull has been weakened mostly by rising costs though real estate prices are now falling the median price for an existing single family home at &# remains more than five years ago that kind of price appreciation has increased property taxes especially for newcomers and for snowbirds whose primary residence is out of state florida is also recovering from a spate of hurricanes that have pushed up already high property insurance rates a two tier tax system hits newcomers and part time residents harder than long time homeowners florida is also dealing with new competition looking to tap the economic boost seniors can give many of the souths less expensive relatively warm states have been reaching out to seniors and fiddling with their tax laws in the hope of grabbing more retirees georgia gov sonny perdue is pushing to exempt all retirement income from taxation as a way to attract and retain retirees "instead of everyone making the assumption that theyre going to move to florida now its more of an open playing field " says dave schreiner national vice president at pulte homes del webb communities florida has been soaking up migrating americans since the s and has had one of the fastest growing populations ever since the most prominent group retirees started pouring in after world war ii just as americans started living longer lives with shorter work weeks and fat union pensions developers responded with trailer lots and tract houses sold with slogans like "we give years to your life and life to your years " some americans came to stay year round but about one million live in florida just part of the year and return north to avoid the steamy summer long before disney world opened in tourists drove down to see aquatic theme parks with dolphin shows and roadside alligator pits last year about million people visited the state many of those tourists have later made florida their permanent home "growth is what florida is known for " says carl hiaasen the novelist and miami herald columnist "florida is in the business of cramming people into real estate for absurd prices " floridas reality has always been seamier than its sun kissed image in the s flim flam men peddled mail order real estate schemes in s the drug trade was celebrated in "miami vice " the states lenient bankruptcy laws have long made the state a destination for debtors on the run floridas unrestrained growth has destroyed mangrove swamps and drained large swaths of the everglades but growth has transformed florida from an agricultural backwater to a key player on the national stage florida had just electoral votes when john f kennedy was elected in he didnt carry the state but won anyway in florida delivered the presidency to george w bush with electoral votes a few months ago randy quinones a retired plumber in new hampshire was gearing up to leave the chilly northeast and live out his days in florida just like millions of retirees before him he got ready to put his home on the market and told his buddies that hed be in florida soon but florida housing prices caused him to look elsewhere "it didnt fit our budget so we didnt do it " he says instead of gainesville or ocala where prices were &# to &# mr quinones moved in may into a home outside knoxville tenn that cost &# then there are the so called "half backs " northeasterners who move to florida and then move halfway back home faith cohan moved to florida from rhode island in with dreams of living on the beach and opening her own business with the proceeds of their house sale ms cohan and her then husband moved to florida and opened a store near naples two years ago ms cohan and her husband divorced ms cohan had planned on staying in their condominium but after hurricane wilma condo fees jumped to &# from &# reflecting higher insurance costs for the building the couple sold their condo for &# and split the proceeds but instead of looking in florida ms cohan paid &# for a townhouse in simpsonville ky "i just couldnt stay another year and pay those kinds of fees by myself " she says after years of nonstop growth many florida cities have been caught off guard by slowing growth between and the tampa bay region with its million residents on floridas west coast grew adding about residents the number of single family home permits doubled as new residents flooded in buoyed by subprime and no down payment mortgages tract homes on the outskirts of the county in a town called ruskin have blossomed on land that was once set aside for oranges and tomatoes the supply of new housing had everyone from the school district to local churches gearing up for years of booming growth but all this has slowed two years ago father tracy wilder rector at ruskins st john the divine episcopal church envisioned his parish growing a year for the foreseeable future he asked a church volunteer to do a feasibility study for an elementary school thats now been shelved father wilder says the number of new members has declined precipitously when he first arrived in the church was signing up new members a year this past year there were "we had to scale back some of our plans " he says few organizations have been as rattled as the local public school system in recent years the schools have added an average of about new students a year and have put overflow classes in portable trailers this year through the th day of school hillsborough county schools have between and fewer students than last year last year the school district opened a new high school in the ruskin area one of five new schools built to relieve the crammed classrooms and address projected growth but on the first day of school lennard high school had about students half of capacity every teacher in the school has a dedicated classroom plus an unused classroom where theyve put copy machines and are storing computers and extra chairs "were not seeing the growth we anticipated " says principal denny oest the school district now projects flat attendance for at least three years and has shelved plans for yet another high school as well as two elementary schools a decline in migration trends could spell broader trouble for floridas economy in addition to tourism the influx of retirement savings and social security checks are a big driver of the states economy this in turn creates a huge stock of service oriented jobs one reason why some of floridas best known businesses include homebuilding companies and restaurants like outback steakhouse and the olive garden florida is always in need of doctors and nurses as well as civic employees like teachers over the past five years florida has created jobs more than any u s state and about as many as california and arizona combined the growth has helped out communities even beyond florida the states demand for new workers has acted as a sort of a pressure release valve for many rust belt states that have seen unemployed workers leave for better opportunities in the south michigan ohio and illinois have long been among the biggest contributors to floridas population growth yvette thomas moved to tampa from dayton ohio in in ohio ms thomas had been working as a full time substitute teacher in an elementary school but had to move to a charter school after the teacher she was subbing for came back from maternity leave then came a spring break vacation to tampa it was cold in ohio balmy in tampa ms thomas and her future husband hung out on the beach saw dolphins from a boat and ate fresh grouper on a whim they stopped by the school districts recruiting office a recruiter called them the next day and a few months later they were looking for a new apartment "it was very easy for us to come in the system " she says five years later ms thomas has her mind set on going back north with the aid of a no money down mortgage ms thomas and her husband bought a &# house the mortgage with property taxes and homeowners fees comes to about &# a month more than half a months pay to supplement her income as a middle school teacher ms thomas teaches night school two days a week "there is no way i could raise a family here " she says next year she plans to sell her home and move north perhaps back to ohio "i thought it would be like a vacation " she says "it turned out to be a hurricane " florida has been through this before in the early s economic weakness and failures in the savings and loan industry pushed the states unemployment rate to among the highest in the nation immigration slowed and some metropolitan areas had a net outflow of residents the state recovered and the next boom came along many economists believe that this lull too will be temporary despite a drop in home sales in the past year floridas economy has so far skirted recession and unemployment remains a low though joblessness has been rising while domestic migration from other states to florida has slowed it hasnt turned negative last year domestic immigration contributed people to floridas population down from the five year average of according to the census bureau those figures dont reflect the most recent trends but there are some signs of trouble in the economy in july retail sales declined statewide from the same period a year earlier compared with a gain nationally car retailer autonation inc reported a dip in second quarter revenue because of "a decline in new vehicle retail sales especially in california and florida " over the past few months retailers including wal mart stores inc target corp and lowes companies inc have all reported sluggish sales in florida a florida rebound would likely require housing prices to fall further than they already have with the help of subprime and no money down mortgages the state became a place for rampant speculation that more than doubled prices in a four year period the price appreciation fueled a refinancing boom that gave consumers access to billions in home equity and they spent it research firm moodys economy com estimates the real estate sector has been responsible for one in three new jobs over the past few years everything from mortgage brokers to home depot inc stockboys but the rise in prices also locked out a lot of prospective migrants from other states while home prices were doubling the states personal income rose just that made it tough for anyone living on florida wages to crack the real estate market and recent declines havent offset that whats more as floridas population has swelled the state has created a two tiered tax system that hit newcomers and part time residents harder than longer term residents for tax purposes permanent residents receive a &# "homestead" reduction in the assessed value of their home which reduces their property taxes a amendment to the states constitution caps the annual increase in residents assessed home value at a year or the rate of inflation whichever is lower the effect is that over the past few years as home values have soared newcomers have paid higher tax bills for instance the owner of one north tampa house assessed at &# paid &# in taxes last year according to the hillsborough county property appraisers office a new owner who made it his primary residence would pay about &# in taxes next year assuming the house doesnt decline in value rising insurance rates prompted by hurricanes are also eroding floridas appeal the average premium for homeowners insurance in florida was &# in the fourth highest of any state in the country in hillsborough county rates on a five year old &# house range from &# to &# a year florida is now scrambling to reduce property taxes and the cost of homeowners insurance over the summer gov charlie crist signed a bill to roll back property taxes to last years level next year floridians could vote on a constitutional amendment that would lower property taxes by increasing the tax exemption given to permanent residents new legislation also requires the state run citizens property insurance corp to freeze rates in the idea is to keep other insurers from raising their prices but none of that makes a difference to mel graves he sold his new hampshire software and advertising systems support company and moved to florida in he spent &# on a house near sarasota on the gulf coast in when hurricane charley bore down on their home mr graves and his wife left for their sons place in tennessee when the hurricane was past mr graves returned to florida and sold the house for almost double what he paid for it "my wife said no way am i staying here " he says the graves have decided to settle in tennessee
