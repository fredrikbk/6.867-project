remembrances robert h bates he mentored generations of students and scaled heights beyond academia if many students considered robert bates a modern version of the beloved teacher in "goodbye mr chips " a big part of his life deserved the title of another movie "cliffhanger " when he wasnt teaching english literature to generations on the well manicured grounds of phillips exeter academy mr bates was assaulting some of the tallest mountains on earth training the armys th mountain division in high altitude survival and directing the peace corps in nepal during the decades of what he called "the golden age" of mountaineering mr bates logged numerous first ascents and helped lead two famous and harrowing attempts on pakistans k at feet the second highest mountain in the world and by many accounts a greater challenge than mount everest at one point he and others were pulled off a ridge he and colleagues once described it as "falling off the empire state building" and rescued by a single blow of an ice ax outside the climbing world a large group remembers mr bates who died sept at age in a very different way gunnar knapp now a professor of economics at the university of alaska read "the grapes of wrath" with mr bates in his sophomore year at exeter in and recalls "thoughtful probing discussions" and good humor but he had never heard of mr batess mountain adventures until reading about them in a book george f russell jr chairman emeritus of russell investment group says mr bates "became a mentor to me and hundreds of others perhaps thousands " diagnosed with a heart murmur mr russell got a second opinion with mr batess help and then a new set of activities cross country wrestling and of course mountaineering mr russell was a founding member of exeters club he credits mr bates with "saving my life " mr bates had a brief third career in sargent shriver recruited him to become the first peace corps director for nepal where the mountaineer had trekked on his honeymoon in the mid s after a two year peace corps stint mr bates helped host birendra bir bikram shah dev during the nepalese crown princes year at harvard in birendra became king in and was killed in by his son with a father who served as chairman of the university of pennsylvanias classics department mr bates grew up in philadelphia family history has it that ancestors on both sides were minutemen who died on the first day of the revolution in his autobiography "the love of mountains is best" mr bates writes that he discovered his love of climbing at age when he conquered foot flying mountain on the coast of maine a graduate of exeter mr bates left its new hampshire campus for harvard university and caught the mountaineering bug seriously from fellow students he suspended graduate education at the university of pennsylvania in to join harvard alumnus bradford washburn in mapping canadas yukon territory for the national geographic society two years later the pair tackled the yukon territorys foot mount lucania it was then the highest unscaled peak of north america airlifted in the pair traveled with no oxygen supply and shared a single sleeping bag unseasonably warm weather turned the mountain to slush and kept a plane from picking them up they had to hike miles out through uncharted territory and nearly starved but came back with a photo they had taken of themselves beaming at the summit it ran in papers across the country the next year mr bates and harvard classmate charlie houston set their sights on k whose summit remained unscaled but bad weather and short supplies hampered them finally they ran out of matches a necessity for melting drinking water and had to turn back although one climber had reached a level of about feet mr houston now living in vermont says he invited mr bates because he judged he would be "compatible under stress " adding that "he had a huge repertoire of song he was just a cheerful happy person even in desperate times " by the time the pair next tried to reach the summit of k in it was still unscaled exeter had given mr bates a job teaching english in mr bates also finally finished his dissertation at penn about the literature of the mountains the k team established an advance camp at feet and unusual in mountaineering elected a team of two for the final assault on the peak by secret ballot though they had planned the expedition mr bates and mr houston didnt make the cut "the goal was to get somebody to the top " says mr houston "the game is more than the players of the game " but a blizzard delayed them and one of the mountaineers art gilkey developed dangerous blood clots the mountaineers decided to forgo the summit and evacuate him via stretcher descending a climber roped to mr bates mr houston and three other men slipped and they began to fall off the ridge like dominoes to save them all from a drop of several thousand feet the top man in the chain pete schoening dug his ax into the ice the move is perhaps the most famous belay in the annals of mountaineering in "k the savage mountain " messrs bates and houston described the accident and its fatal aftermath in the confusion mr gilkey and his stretcher though belayed by two ice axes disappeared apparently swept away by an avalanche reinhold messner the german mountaineer famous for being the first to climb everest without oxygen once told discover magazine about the expedition and the secret ballot on the summit trek "they failed the most beautiful way imaginable there was no ego in it " the expedition marked mr batess apogee as a climber by as an italian team won the race to ks summit mr bates was getting ready to be married to gail oberlin the secretary at the american alpine club they never had children though an adoptive family of students and friends were always gathering around them at exeter sometimes they listened to mr batess mountaineering stories "the lucania trip is a great story for young people " says mrs bates herself an accomplished climber recognizing it had a special case on its hands exeter granted mr bates leaves of absence for mountaineering and the peace corps and other projects in mr russell endowed a chair at exeter in mr batess honor that comes with built in leaves for outside projects exeters chief financial officer joseph e fellows credits mr bates with inspiring him to follow
