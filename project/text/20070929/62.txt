weekend journal books childrens books ivan the terrier by peter catalanotto simon &amp schuster pages &# theres a deplorable trend in illustrated childrens literature toward books with too much grown up humor too many sight gags and not enough plot "ivan the terrier" is guilty on all counts which goes to show how even the most regrettable trends can have marvelous exceptions "ivan" isnt so much a story as it is an entertainment designed to make children laugh and it works beautifully the book opens with a pastoral scene of the three billy goats gruff quietly cropping grass under a glorious late afternoon sky on first reading children probably wont notice the tiny figure streaking across a distant field toward the peaceful animals but turn the page and the goats are suddenly rearing and bolting and "hey " the narrator cries "where did that dog come from is that ivan it is ivan you naughty dog youre ruining the story " as the narrator sputters and protests ivan disappears into the distance hard on the heels of the escaping goats "oh well " were told "i guess well have to read a different story " and so we visit the three bears who are enjoying a tranquil fireside breakfast until the arrival of "arf arf arf " ivan chases off the three bears then routs the three little pigs before exploding on a tender scene the gingerbread man just as he is being taken out of the oven by the little old lady and the little old man while the panicked couple flees down the garden path ivans liquid eyes gaze guiltily at us over a mouthful of "ivan drop it shame on you dont eat that " peter catalanottos delightful romp makes up with amusement what it lacks in plot and is the sort of book that children will ask to have read aloud again and again
