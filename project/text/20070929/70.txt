led a comfortable life as a chef in new york he worked at well known restaurants such as mesa grill and lutece and later ran a corporate dining room at an investment firm now mr orkin cooks in a very different place the year old american recently opened a seat restaurant in suburban tokyo that specializes in ramen a hot noodle soup that is japans ultimate comfort food the restaurant ivan ramen is in an old fashioned shopping arcade near a cigarette shop and a tofu maker the main items on its simple menu are homemade egg and wheat noodles served in salt or soy sauce flavored soup beneath beautifully arranged toppings a mound of sliced leek slender strips of pickled bamboo shoots and slabs of succulent braised pork the piping hot soup hot enough to fog up eyeglasses combines long simmered chicken broth with seafood broth for an added layer of complexity in opening ivan ramen mr orkin has thrust himself into one of the most competitive corners of japanese cuisine there are an estimated ramen restaurants across the country ramen is a national obsession in japan akin to burgers or barbecue in the u s almost all japanese have strong feelings about every detail like whether the broth should be made of bonito sardine or pork bones and how many slices of pork should be in the soup television quiz shows dare self professed experts to "name that ramen" just by looking at a fraction of a picture of a bowl of noodles there are guidebooks focused entirely on the best ramen restaurants and bloggers who hunt down and critique new ramen joints the minute they open the biggest challenge facing mr orkin is that unlike most of his competitors hes not japanese "i know that i am a big attraction im a gaijin foreigner and im from new york " mr orkin says "but what i really want is for people to sit down and taste my ramen and say man this is some of the best ramen ive ever tasted " early press reviews are encouraging hiroshi osaki claims to have eaten more bowls of ramen than anyone else in japan an average of bowls a year he says mr orkins ramen is tasty if a bit ordinary but he credits mr orkin for paying attention to details such as warming each slice of pork before gently placing it on top of the noodles mr orkins decision to take on japans iconic dish in tokyo can be traced back to his first wife and to a series of personal changes triggered by her death in he met tamie nagano while teaching english in japan in the late s they lived in new york and had a son together after she died mr orkin returned to japan yearly with their son to teach him about the culture and to eat plenty of ramen his second marriage to another japanese woman mari sawamura brought him back to live in japan permanently in and thats when mr orkins real ramen obsession began mr orkin says he could have opened a western style restaurant in tokyo with a much bigger splash but that it wouldnt have been challenging enough "in the states its popular among french and italian chefs to start hamburger joints " he says "its sort of like that ive been eating ramen for over years and ive always wanted to make a perfect bowl of noodles " ramen was first introduced to japan in the late th century by chinese merchants who served chinese style noodles at restaurants in the port city of yokohama over the years the dish was adapted to meet japanese taste buds and spread to every corner of the nation with regional variations in recent years a new generation of chefs have put their own unique twists on the dish like a version called tsuke men where noodles and soup for dipping are served separately some chefs combine ramen and italian food serving noodles in tomato based soup or in cream sauce mr orkin is testing out a summer tsuke men with spicy cold soup inspired by gazpacho famous chefs and critics appear often on television shows and magazines one chef minoru sano is known as the ramen fiend because of a permanent frown and signs in his restaurants that declare an absolute ban on smoking cellphones and talking hideyuki ishigami a popular critic is said to have a "gods palate" for his unrivaled ability to discover great ramen shops mr orkin who grew up in syosset on new yorks long island as a son of a copyright lawyer studied japanese in college after graduating he taught english in japan for a few years inspired in part by the movie "tampopo " a story of a mans effort to make a perfect bowl of ramen and in part by the dishs affordability he ate a lot of ramen in he and tamie moved to the u s where he enrolled at the culinary institute he apprenticed at mesa grill and was hired as a junior chef at lutece the famed manhattan french eatery that closed in in mr orkin took a job running the dining room of furman selz an investment firm later bought by ing groep a year later tamie died suddenly from toxic shock while pregnant with their second child who died with her "for the next several years the idea of taking on more responsibility was out of the question " mr orkin says "i had to raise my son and thats all i could think of " during a trip to japan with his son isaac mr orkin met ms sawamura an interior decorator they were married in three months she and her son joined mr orkin in new york but she didnt like the cold weather and couldnt find enough work when ms orkin contemplated returning to tokyo mr orkin decided to follow her but the first three years were tough he tried out different jobs including giving cooking lessons to housewives but nothing felt right on a visit to new york in june of last year mr orkin checked out momofuku noodle bar a popular east village restaurant where chef david chang serves ramen inspired noodles the restaurants success inspired him returning to tokyo later that summer mr orkin plunged into the world of ramen he attended the ramen expo where tens of thousands of ramen shop owners and vendors discuss the latest trends in ramen he signed up for a weeklong course at the ramen school in a remote town on the island of shikoku in western japan then he found an elderly woman who wanted to pass on the lease of her ramen shop so she could retire mr orkin spent months fixing up the shop painting the walls yellow and hanging lamps bought at ikea above the l shaped counter he locked himself up in his study with cookbooks conceptualizing the perfect ramen noodles that remained firm until the last drop and a soup thats rich but clean tasting and "wont make you want to go home and curl up for a nap afterwards " ivan ramen opened in early june on a recent morning he stirred two gallon pots filled with water and whole chickens listening to a podcast of wfuv a new york public radio station "i get to keep track of yankees scores " he said at p m when mr orkin opened the restaurant two young men were already waiting outside an hour later the place was packed mostly with men eating alone hiroyuki boda a year old commercial film director who lives nearby said he decided to come in after reading a sign outside saying the chef is from new york "i came in expecting to eat americanized ramen " mr boda said slurping noodles in a soy sauce soup "what a nice surprise this tastes so authentically japanese " a better way to make instant noodles making ramen noodles and soup from scratch is so time consuming that even in japan only fanatics try it
