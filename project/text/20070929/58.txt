the week ahead our take on coming events jobs september unemployment data will likely shape next fed move by sudeep reddy with the economy under recession watch fridays coming report on september employment may give the strongest signal yet about whether the u s is headed for a painful contraction or a soft landing the august report which showed that monthly payrolls fell for the first time in four years fueled recession fears and paved the way for an aggressive action by the federal reserve which cut its target for the benchmark federal funds rate by a half percentage point but some economists argue that technical problems bedeviled the august data and that septembers tally will show a healthy jobs gain others arent so sanguine either way the september employment data should help clear up the confusion and provide a clue about the feds likely next move if septembers job performance was dismal more rate cuts could be on the way perhaps as early as the end of october when the fed meets next but if job creation was strong or even modest suggesting moderate economic growth "the fed will feel more comfortable seriously considering staying put " says bank of america economist

unemployment benefits many analysts expected claims to rise after layoffs in the mortgage finance sector but claims for the week that ended sept fell to the lowest level since may jobless claims reflect layoffs which havent been widespread rather than laying people off companies have slowed hiring while hoping the economy will perk up analysts say the unemployment rate remains at a historically low though it may tick up to in fridays report still the august payroll report also included worrisome downward revisions of june and july job gains "there was clearly a big deterioration over the summer and that was before we had the credit crunch " says paul ashworth an economist at capital economics a london based research firm that expects the friday report to show modest job gains of about reflecting a slower economy he and other economists will be watching closely friday "one bad number you can just chalk up to the volatility of the series " he says "but two bad numbers you
