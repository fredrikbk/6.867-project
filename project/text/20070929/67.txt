weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink not grandpapas grappa grappa an italian brandy made from the detritus of winemaking grape skins seeds and once upon a time stems too long had a reputation as awful liquid offal a peasant staple cobbled together from leftover bits that nobody wanted but no more grappa makers began reinventing the whole concept of the spirit in the early s turning it into a rare artisanal luxury the trend was neither phony nor fleeting and the boutique grappas available in the u s merit their premium prices typical of the comments grappa provoked in the mid th century are jane nickersons in the new york times in a roundup of brandies available in the city in she declared that grappa "is thriftily distilled" from "the residue in wine vats " the stuff sold at gimbels she wrote "is coarse earthy a mans drink if ever there was one " not only a mans drink but if ernest hemingway is to be believed a seedy mans drink papa suggests that at its best grappa is a rustic martial spirit stuff to drink just before battle but in the short story "out of season " grappa makes a telling appearance as a cheap buzz a young couple visiting italy go fishing only to find that the guide provided by their hotel a man called peduzzi is the town drunk before showing up for an afternoon with rod and reel peduzzi had already managed to drink all the grappa that could be bought with the four lire he had earned that morning tilling the frosty soil of the hotels garden with the prospect of getting paid for an afternoons trout fishing peduzzi manages to get the local cantina to advance him three grappas more but hes still thirsty leading the couple through town on the way to a brackish stream "peduzzi stopped in front of a store with the window full of bottles and brought his empty grappa bottle from an inside pocket of his old military coat a little to drink some marsala for the signora something something to drink " the young lady is sullen appalled by the spectacle the young gentleman is distracted wondering "what in hell makes him say marsala thats what max beerbohm drinks " and indeed when hemingway had visited beerbohm the year he wrote the story thats what the caricaturist had served but hemingways point about marsala is that even peduzzi wouldnt think of pushing grappa on his society clients what a remarkable transformation grappa has undergone not only is the good stuff extremely good but at least in the u s it has managed to crowd out the bad most good liquor stores make room for some pretty sketchy spirits even those with excellent selections of single malt scotches provide plastic liters of generic whisky the parade of pricey vodkas marches alongside popov not so grappa if the stores i visited are any indication it is now almost exclusively a luxury good none of the grappas i bought were coarse and several were truly fine one of the first i tasted was from the nardini distillery one of italys oldest youre more likely to find its almond flavored brandy called mandorla on shelves but its plain aquavite is a good baseline for well made and straightforward grappa in the traditional style it wasnt harsh but it was hot on the palate with the alcohol burn eclipsing the taste of the grapes if you were looking for grappa to add to your espresso a drink that italians call caffe corretto the nardini would be an excellent choice if for no other reason than that it is so darn expensive dont waste nonino grappa on coffee in fourth generation distiller benito nonino and his wife giannola created what has since become the standard in luxury grappas a spirit made not from any and all the grapes at hand but from an individual variety the noninos first effort was with an obscure regional grape called picolit it was such a sensation when it first appeared that now most first rate grappa distillers focus on single variety expressions and produce a staggering variety of those the picolit remains one of the noninos signature grappas and it comes in their impossibly delicate bottle a small sphere with a slender cylindrical neck i was sure it was going to shatter in my hands as i worked to coax out the obdurate cork the grappa inside is every bit as refined as the bottle though perhaps too refined the nonino is elegant to the point of austerity ascetic in the extreme similarly subtle were grappas made by inga from barolo grapes and the sarpa di poli from merlot vodka drinkers looking to branch out should give them a try the poli was particularly ingratiating light and limpid with an elusive sweetness it was also the best value of the tasting but far and away my favorites among the grappas i tried were those from the marolo distillery from the first moment of opening the bottles a fresh bold scent signaled that these grappas were in a style entirely different from that of their reserved cousins i couldnt decide which i liked more the marolo made from moscato grapes with its soft caramel rich feel in the mouth combined with the bright clean taste of the fruit or the brunello variety round and grapey with a hint of port these are exuberant grappas flavorful complex and delightful these are not the sort of grappa with which poor old peduzzi would have refilled his empty bottle in "out of season " its worth noting by the way that hemingway wrote to f scott fitzgerald in that the fiasco of a fishing trip had actually happened to his wife hadley and himself hemingway wrote the story "right off on the typewriter without punctuation" and meant for it to be "tragic " hed reported his drunken guide to the hotel owner hemingway confessed to fitzgerald fired the man "hanged himself in the stable " that last bit the author left out of his short story email me at eric
