weekend journal books the blackboard bungle glimpses into the unhappy state of american education principal tina mcknight and third grade teacher alia johnson at tyler elementary in annapolis md made a strenuous effort to bring their public school students up to state and national standards in reading and math according to linda perlstein in "tested" holt pages &# the former washington post reporter who spent a year as an observer at the school reports that ms mcknight and ms johnson succeeded in the sense that their kids passed the tests designed to measure grade level proficiency but "tested" suggests that the sound and fury of the testing process may signify if not nothing a lot less than one might hope she offers affecting portraits of ms mcknight and ms johnson showing them to be devoted to their students and anything but soft educationists who care about "self esteem" more than real learning but they are not happy with the test driven world they work in "tested" raises a now familiar question does the testing mania that is the direct result of the no child left behind act nclb passed in and expected to be renewed this year have a positive effect on the public schools the bipartisan nclb legislation was an attempt to reverse decades of declining proficiency in literacy and math while injecting some basic measure of accountability into the schools it was the heir to the great societys elementary and secondary education act of whose famous title one requires "equity for poor schoolchildren by infusing significant funds into the schools that they attend " under nclb the funds for title one &# billion in and other aid can be withheld from schools that do not reach defined levels of proficiency schools responded by urging instructors to "teach to the test " at tyler elementary panicked administrators turned their school into reading and mathematics cram boxes one might think at least the kids are learning something under such conditions but ms perlstein suggests that cram learning is frenetically acquired and soon forgotten it destroys whatever enchantment a classroom might possess for a richer sort of instruction as i know from my own teaching experience it is still possible to make "othello" and "macbeth" come alive in the broken down classrooms of our inner city schools quick fixes will not make that happen only teachers who are left alone can do it and the quick fix aims of the testing craze tend to push away many good teachers an ironic effect given that the school reform movement which advocates testing also champions the hiring and retaining of talented teachers then again the quest to find and keep exceptional educators is often a struggle for reasons that go well beyond testing for a troubling sense of what it is like to face a contemporary classroom for the first time we can turn to two memoirs dan browns "the great expectations school" arcade pages &# and christina asquiths "the emergency teacher" skyhorse pages &# both teacher authors seem ready to try classroom work for the first time in the sense that they are eager to teach and seem open to learning new skills at the beginning of their stories ms asquith is a young philadelphia inquirer reporter and mr brown a budding filmmaker and rock musician because school districts are legally required to put "qualified" teachers into every classroom they often skirt the rule by coming up with lamentably makeshift programs to put people who dont have education degrees in front of blackboards in philadelphia there is something called "emergency certification" ms asquiths route and in new york a "teaching fellows" program mr browns in each case the training is mind numbing vacuous centering on make work assignments for children rather than the transmission of real knowledge maybe we would have better teachers if they themselves were taught better by both authors own admission teaching played a minor role in their year on the job neither ms asquiths sixth graders nor mr browns fourth graders learned much the students did not read and write and calculate much better in june than they did in september some of them benefited emotionally from their young teachers care and this is surely an important part of schooling but when we remember teachers who changed our lives we usually recall individuals who worked on our gray matter as well as our heartstrings alia johnson did just that with her kids at tyler elementary despite the dispiriting regimen imposed on her by business model administrators by contrast the kids at ms asquiths julia de burgos school in north philadelphia and mr browns ps in the bronx n y watch their young teachers try and fail to manage the classroom while struggling with corrupt administrators uncaring school districts and this being america their own personal "issues " mr brown seems the more befuddled of the two repeatedly letting himself be fooled by childish manipulation when not obsessing over his own experience playing "mr brown " he is after all a filmmaker ms asquith more keenly observant discovers a few excellent teachers in her school but next to these are uncaring and sometimes alarmingly unbalanced individuals who seem taken from a charles dickens novel then there is ms asquiths principal who faked test results to improve the schools standing although the principals case was egregious she was eventually fired from another school the dispiriting truth is that gimmicks to "improve" student performance are not uncommon lamentably the message is passed along to students that whatever works including cheating works by the end of mr browns story it has achieved a hollywood worthy arc he marries his gal escapes the public school ordeal by moving to a rich kids private school in manhattan and enrolls in columbia universitys teachers college plus he keeps up with his film and rock n roll careers ms asquith breaks up with her boyfriend does some graduate work and returns to journalism eventually covering education in iraq individuals like ms asquith and mr brown are unlikely to succeed as teachers if they are put directly into classrooms where they inherit all the social problems of the inner cities and at the same time must confront petrified bureaucracies that view them as baby sitters such teachers are driven from the field before they can acquire the informed experience that educrats and politicians claim they want for their education money part of the problem is the "educationist" mindset in "edspeak" ascd pages &# diane ravitch offers a lexicon that captures alongside many worthy ideas and theories the pseudo scientific jargon and "progressive" ideology that does so much to form the education establishment and harm the schools service learning "community service by students in a nonschool setting which aims to deepen students learning and promote problem solving by having them engage in socially useful activities " constructivism "a philosophy of teaching based on the belief that students learn by constructing their own knowledge its methods center on exploration hands on experience inquiry self paced learning peer teaching and discussion " ms ravitchs book is an admirable attempt to bring clarity to pedagogese but even if "edspeak" were abolished tomorrow the problems besetting modern education would persist no child left behind will not make public education thrive again either even if the policy is a well intentioned improvement on decades of failure in federalized education but finding solutions is crucial if we are going to meet as the greeks did long ago the core challenge of maintaining a vibrant society forming the young mr kaplan taught english in high schools in the bronx n y for several years
