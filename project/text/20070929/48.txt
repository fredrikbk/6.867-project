politics &amp economics iran action stalls at u n push for penalties on nuclear efforts waits to november a decision by the major powers to delay discussion on whether to impose new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program raises a key question who will blink first tehran or the countries trying to coax it away from the nuclear path the u s and its main european partners friday gave in to sharp opposition from china and russia and agreed to hold off trying to impose tougher penalties on iran until late november moscow and beijing are increasingly leery of pressuring iran and insisted that separate discussions with tehran be given more time the stakes have increased in recent weeks as prominent players such as french president nicolas sarkozy have begun to warn that failure on the diplomatic front could lead to military conflict the u s is now suggesting that moscow and beijings unwillingness to ramp up economic pressure on tehran could sap the diplomatic effort to get iran to stop its uranium enrichment work the west believes that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon under the guise of a civilian nuclear program while iran says it just wants to develop atomic power fridays agreement made on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly appears to be an attempt to paper over the growing divisions within the u n security council at a time when iran insists it will not back down on its nuclear work under the agreement germany and the five permanent members of the security council britain china france russia and the u s said that they will vote on a third sanctions package only if two u n emissaries to iran fail "to show a positive outcome to their efforts " russia and china have been particularly focused on the work of mohamed elbaradei head of the international atomic energy agency who is now engaged in discussions with iran to clear up a number of unanswered questions on the intricate history of irans nuclear program mr elbaradei plans to wrap up those discussions by november the group also agreed to send javier solana the european unions top diplomat to try again to persuade tehran to agree to a offer under which iran would suspend its enrichment program in exchange for a range of economic incentives iran has rejected numerous similar offers by mr solana in the past two years in his speech to the u n tuesday iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that the nuclear issue was "closed " and that iran would reject any further sanctions the schism within the security council makes it all the more likely that the u s and europe will try to move ahead on their own restrictions outside the u n france britain and the u s want the eu to take steps to sever irans major banks businesses and military enterprises from the main banking nodes of europe and the u s the bush administration is likely soon to impose new restrictions on portions of irans military germany opposes such a move saying its critical to keep china and russia on board "i believe what impresses iran the most is the unity of the six irans strategy is to split the six but it hasnt succeeded so far " said german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier
