hot topic the uaws awakening this weeks deal between general motors and the united auto workers is being hailed as a new era for detroit and for once that advertising may be justified the uaw in particular made historic concessions that show a new awareness of global competition whats less encouraging is how much this reality based compromise still contrasts with the policies that unions and their political friends are promoting in the unreal world of washington d c our friends in the afl cio often think were too critical but were not responsible for taking union membership down to of the non government american labor force last year the reality of a dynamic world economy did that assisted by the failure to adapt by union leaders and corporate managers these columns support collective bargaining and our belief has long been that if a companys workers vote to join a union they and the company deserve what they get the problem with unions is not all that dissimilar to that posed by entrenched management once they win comfortable contracts they often become impediments to the kind of innovation and flexibility essential to success in todays economy so in the name of "job security " they undermine a companys or a nations competitiveness the result over time is less job security for everyone especially the union workforce theres no better example of this than gm where the uaw now represents about hourly workers compared to in some security the new gm uaw contract is a belated recognition that the choice has now become change or chapter under the deal wages are frozen save for bonuses and some lump sum payments gm in turn promises to invest in american plants with uaw workers though of course it will also keep investing abroad in what seems to be the most creative stroke gm will pay some &# billion toward a new health care trust fund to be administered by the union thats a big initial cash flow but it means the company can divest itself of some &# billion in long term liabilities which would only have grown as health care costs rose and retirees lived longer investors loved it driving up gm stock by around for the week the uaw now gains ownership of its members health care resources in effect becoming a financial manager of a giant health savings account for auto workers if the union is creative it will rethink its coverage plans using the new generation of consumer driven health care options such as personal health savings accounts to encourage and reward more careful spending by beneficiaries uaw president ron gettelfinger has told his members the trust fund will last years and the unions job now is to make sure it does a similar arrangement at caterpillar inc didnt work because the money ran out in six years this new treaty of detroit in the marketplace is all the more notable when you consider how little the union political agenda has changed the afl cio famously split in over the priority of organizing over politics but organized labors share of the private workforce has kept falling we had a friendly visit not too long ago with andy stern the service employees international union president and perhaps the most successful modern labor leader he is a shrewd man but his main message seemed to be that union salvation lies in america adopting the work rules and income redistribution of europe he says companies need to pass their health care costs onto government meaning taxpayers and while he recognizes that unions cant secede from the global economy the trade rules need to be changed that is restricted or managed so that the pace of change is less disruptive and wealth more equally shared with democrats now running congress and ahead in the presidential polls mr stern and his union mates are closer than theyve been in decades to seeing that agenda implemented but they also reveal their own lack of faith in the appeal of unions when they support a ban on secret ballot elections at work sites and of course they still benefit unlike anyone else in american politics from being able to coerce the payment of dues the larger irony is that europe is now learning the hard way that mr sterns "social contract" is itself deeply flawed french president nicolas sarkozy was elected this year in part because he acknowledged that even france cant sustain the french model any longer health care expenses represent a huge chunk of the tax burden in france where restrictive work rules and such union demands as the hour week have led to far higher joblessness and far less prosperity than in the u s mr sarkozy is now pushing american style reforms precisely when mr stern and democrats are promoting french policies our guess is that economic reality will in the end limit mr sterns political ambitions in the same way that global competition has finally awakened the uaw
