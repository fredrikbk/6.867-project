the secrets of intangible wealth a mexican migrant to the u s is five times more productive than one who stays home why is that the answer is not the obvious one this country has more machinery or tools or natural resources instead according to some remarkable but largely ignored research by the world bank of all places it is because the average american has access to over &# in intangible wealth while the stay at home mexicans intangible wealth is just &# but what is intangible wealth and how on earth is it measured and what does it mean for the worlds people poor and rich thats where the story gets even more interesting two years ago the world banks environmental economics department set out to assess the relative contributions of various kinds of capital to economic development its study "where is the wealth of nations measuring capital for the st century " began by defining natural capital as the sum of nonrenewable resources including oil natural gas coal and mineral resources cropland pasture land forested areas and protected areas produced or built capital is what many of us think of when we think of capital the sum of machinery equipment and structures including infrastructure and urban land but once the value of all these are added up the economists found something big was still missing the vast majority of worlds wealth if one simply adds up the current value of a countrys natural resources and produced or built capital theres no way that can account for that countrys level of income the rest is the result of "intangible" factors such as the trust among people in a society an efficient judicial system clear property rights and effective government all this intangible capital also boosts the productivity of labor and results in higher total wealth in fact the world bank finds "human capital and the value of institutions as measured by rule of law constitute the largest share of wealth in virtually all countries " once one takes into account all of the worlds natural resources and produced capital of the wealth of rich countries and of the wealth of poor countries is of this intangible type the bottom line "rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity " what the world bank economists have brilliantly done is quantify the intangible value of education and social institutions according to their regression analyses for example the rule of law explains of countries intangible capital education accounts for the rule of law index was devised using several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance drawn from separate data sources constructed by different organizations the latter include civil society groups freedom house political and business risk rating agencies economist intelligence unit and think tanks international budget project open budget index switzerland scores out of on the rule of law index and the u s hits by contrast nigerias score is a pitiful burundis and ethiopias the members of the organization for economic cooperation and development wealthy developed countries have an average score of while sub saharan africas is a dismal the natural wealth in rich countries like the u s is a tiny proportion of their overall wealth typically to yet they derive more value from what they have cropland pastures and forests are more valuable in rich countries because they can be combined with other capital like machinery and strong property rights to produce more value machinery buildings roads and so forth account for of the rich countries total wealth overall the average per capita wealth in the rich organization for economic cooperation development oecd countries is &# consisting of &# in natural capital &# in produced capital and a whopping &# in intangible capital switzerland has the highest per capita wealth at &# the u s is fourth at &# by comparison the world bank study finds that total wealth for the low income countries averages &# per person that consists of &# in natural capital &# in produced capital and &# in intangible capital the countries with the lowest per capita wealth are ethiopia &# nigeria &# and burundi &# in fact some countries are so badly run that they actually have negative intangible capital through rampant corruption and failing school systems nigeria and the democratic republic of the congo are destroying their intangible capital and ensuring that their people will be poorer in the future in the u s according to the world bank study natural capital is &# per person produced capital is &# and intangible capital is &# and thus considering common measure used to compare countries its annual purchasing power parity gdp per capita is &# by contrast oil rich mexicos total natural capital per person is &# &# due to oil produced capital is &# and intangible capita is &# a total of &# per person yet its gdp per capita is &# when a mexican or for that matter a south asian or african walks across our border they gain immediate access to intangible capital worth &# per person who wouldnt walk across the border in such circumstances the world bank study bolsters the deep insights of the late development economist peter bauer in his brilliant book "dissent on development " bauer wrote "if all conditions for development other than capital are present capital will soon be generated locally or will be available from abroad if however the conditions for development are not present then aid will be necessarily unproductive and therefore ineffective thus if the mainsprings of development are present material progress will occur even without foreign aid if they are absent it will not occur even with aid " the world banks pathbreaking "where is the wealth of nations " convincingly demonstrates that the "mainsprings of development" are the rule of law and a good school system the big question that its researchers dont answer is how can the people of the developing world rid themselves of the kleptocrats who loot their countries and keep them poor mr bailey is reason magazines science
