weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings the theory of critical relativity why some bad shows arent quite so bad critics have long memories for pain like most of my colleagues i find it all too easy to remember the worst shows ive ever seen and from time to time i find occasion to update my mental list when something especially horrible comes along one word "xanadu " but badness is a relative concept if like me you live in a major city and review only professional performances while ive seen some awful plays on broadway and some productions that were to put it mildly misconceived its unusual for me to write about anything that can truly be called "amateurish " it wasnt always so thirty years ago i was a second string critic in a medium size midwestern city and more than a few of the performances to which i was sent by the paper for which i wrote were well not entirely professional so when a colleague sent me a link to an essay by john barry called "confessions of a community theater critic " i made haste to read it wondering what the author would have to say about one of the trickiest problems that a working critic has to face how do you decide what critical standards should be applied to the performances you see mr barrys piece appears in the smart set a new online publication named after the long dead but well remembered magazine edited by h l mencken and george jean nathan in it he describes his adventures as a part time drama critic for the baltimore city paper i too cover theater in charm city on occasion on friday i was raving in the journal about a revival of "arsenic and old lace" by centerstage baltimores oldest and best known professional company whose work i greatly admire but mr barry unlike me doesnt get to pick and choose and his beat also includes what he calls "theater in the rough " meaning the amateur and semipro productions that are known in the trade as "community theater " just because i now live and work in new york doesnt mean that i dont know what such shows are like not only have i reviewed them but i even acted in some of them long long ago hence i read mr barrys confessions with empathy smiling when he remarked that the casts of these homemade productions consist of "policemen computer programmers starry eyed sophomores retired schoolteachers i was no longer writing for potential theatergoers people looking for my advice on whether to shell out for tickets i wasnt even being read by the actors in the plays i was being read by their best friends and close relatives and they knew who i was they knew where i lived " ah yes i remember it well what struck me most forcibly about mr barrys essay though was a paragraph in which he explains why he tries to be as gentle as possible when reviewing amateur theater in baltimore "in a world where its constantly pounded in our heads that theres someone more interesting going on somewhere else " he writes "people need to be told why theyre doing it and what theyre going to get out of it in baltimores community theatre thats not always clear there arent any big names and no ones breaking new ground theyve created a small comfort zone in a city where theatre is underfunded overlooked and loved by a shrinking crowd of advocates whenever i try to play frank rich with them theres one question i cant get out of my head does the world need one more unread reviewer telling unseen actors to stick to their day jobs " i occasionally teach courses in criticism and the next time i do so i plan to make that passage required reading ive never seen a better explanation of why newspaper reviewers have an obligation to apply what i call "appropriate standards" to the shows they review i know what youre thinking good is good bad is bad tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may blah blah blah but life isnt that simple and neither is art unlike most new york based critics i regularly review regional theater throughout america and i know that much of it is every bit as good as the best shows that i see on and off broadway i also know that a responsible critic doesnt review a no budget show in a black box theater the same way he reviews a big ticket broadway opening if he does hes doing a disservice to the performers and to his readers sometimes i write my reviews in the heat of the moment and get carried away and when that happens i can become intemperate and even downright nasty but as one of the characters in "pride and prejudice" says "i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good " by the same token i hope i never forget that to be a passionate amateur is one of the wisest and best things that a human being can be even if it leads him to make a fool of himself on stage we should all be such fools for love mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
