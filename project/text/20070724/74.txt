politics &amp economics japanese election could stall abes plans deregulation effort trade pacts at risk if ldp is defeated tokyo japanese elections to be held sunday appear likely to weaken prime minister shinzo abe and may slow his efforts to overhaul inefficient industries mr abes liberal democratic party heads into the vote for the upper house of parliament at a time when about of voters say they support his cabinet analysts predict mr abes party and its coalition partner will lose their combined majority in the chamber if that happens "it could be a long time before theres a strong government again " says ubs economist takashi omori "theres a high chance that the government wont be able to make important decisions for a while " without a coalition majority mr abes administration would find it hard to pass laws because the upper house can block most legislation that would hold up deregulation free trade agreements and other policies economists say japan needs to prosper as its population shrinks mr abes fortunes have declined in spite of a healthy economy and no major disasters during his months in office output is expected to expand about this year and mr abe was praised for fixing japans rocky relations with china after he traveled to beijing shortly after becoming prime minister in september he has also obtained some well received legislation toughening the certification of schoolteachers for example but the japanese public gained a taste for strong leadership under dynamic former prime minister junichiro koizumi and now they want more action in particular measures to deal with big changes in the population structure while the number of japanese pensioners increases the total population began to decline in that means working age japanese need to produce more in order to maintain the nations living standards something economists say can best be done by overhauling important industries plenty of ideas are floating around more transparent regulation might raise tokyos status as an international financial center agriculture might become more competitive if rules restricting the use and purchase of farmland were loosened that might enable japan to ease food import restrictions and forge more free trade agreements which could increase overall economic output while mr abe has pledged support for these efforts he has put little emphasis on them his economic policy chiefs have pledged only to look into these areas and in a noncommittal way mr abe has seemed more interested in projects to increase japans assertiveness he elevated the defense agency to a full ministry and is pushing for changes to the constitution that will enable more participation in u s military operations he has appeared disengaged from issues that average japanese care deeply about in may opposition members of parliament attacked the government over some million national pension records that had gone missing causing people to fret they wouldnt have anything to live on in old age mr abe scion of a wealthy political family at first appeared to be dealing with the problem with little urgency meanwhile some of mr abes appointees have embarrassed him the agriculture minister was investigated over expenses and political donations and committed suicide in may welfare minister hakuo yanagisawa showed little understanding of the causes of japans declining population he tried to spur greater fertility by telling the nations women often forced to choose between careers and children they are "baby making machines " mr abe is "not in charge " says gerald curtis a political science professor at new yorks columbia university who specializes in japanese politics "the public wants a sense of reassurance a sense of confidence " a heavy defeat might force mr abe to resign to take responsibility but the upper house has only limited powers so a modest loss of seats and the majority wouldnt automatically mean his ouster most analysts think he would likely be able to carry on of the chambers seats are up for election and the ldp probably needs to win to maintain a majority if it misses by just a few it could try to recruit lawmakers from other parties to achieve a majority if the results are very bad say fewer than seats mr abe would likely resign the leading candidate to succeed him is foreign minister taro aso like mr abe he favors deregulation and holding down tax rates but he is a more experienced politician who might get business done more effectively
