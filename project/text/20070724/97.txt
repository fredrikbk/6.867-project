the middle seat bumped fliers may get a better deal as overbooking worsens transportation department weighs raising the compensation for first time in years for the first time in years the department of transportation is considering raising the compensation that airlines have to pay customers bumped from overbooked flights the federal agency is asking travelers to weigh in on the issue and will take comments from the public until sept after that it will propose a new rule which would likely be effective next year airline bumping when passengers with confirmed reservations get left behind because of overbooking is on the rise in the first quarter this year of every passengers were involuntarily bumped from flights on u s airlines up from thats a higher rate than even the late s when airline service deteriorated under crowded flights and long delays and the increase caught the dots attention "this year things have really gone in a different direction and this is one of several consumer issues were dealing with " said andrew steinberg the dots assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs among the issues under study congestion delays and passengers kept on grounded planes for extended periods with all the delays cancellations and disruption of this summer overbooking becomes a bigger problem for travelers flights are full and passengers with tickets but not seats on a flight may end up competing for seats with people from canceled or delayed flights the competition for boarding passes grows more intense one factor in overbooking is that the penalty for airlines is small yet the inconvenience to travelers can be huge in fact overbooking can often be a bit of a windfall for an airline sell an expensive last minute ticket on a full flight to a business traveler and then bump a cheap fare vacationer and the airline increases revenue because the compensation paid to the vacationer is so small under current rules which were set in consumers can get a maximum compensation of just &# if the passenger gets re accommodated on a flight that is scheduled to arrive within two hours of the original arrival time for domestic trips or four hours for international flights if the passenger gets rebooked on flights that cant meet the two hour domestic or four hour international window the compensation jumps to a maximum of &# the airline has to compensate an involuntarily bumped passenger with of the value of his or her ticket for that flight the one way portion not round trip but only as much as the maximum cap if you agree to voluntarily give up your seat you will likely get the compensation in the form of a voucher for future travel but if youre bumped involuntarily you can demand cash the dot has been under pressure to raise the caps as overbooking worsened in the past year earlier this month the dot proposed several options including raising the caps to fully account for inflation or just eliminating them forcing airlines to pay the price of the ticket no matter how expensive already some travelers who have heard about the proposal have fired off comments to the dot all expressing anger and outrage at overbooking "where else do you get to do this a theater cant sell more seats than it really has " said louise helland of san martin calif still angry about being bumped from a flight from boston with an infant in her arms years ago "the cost to them doesnt equal the inconvenience to passengers " she said in an interview dan hepler a retiree in pittsburgh urged the dot to eliminate overbooking period "its like a giant sword hanging over the heads of travelers " he said in an interview john negron a frequent business traveler from new york also hates overbooking because flights are often delayed while gate agents try to enlist volunteers to give up seats "youve got a confirmed ticket and they try to take it away the practice should be limited at best and they should be made to pay " he said there is some benefit to consumers in airline overbooking by selling more seats than are actually on a particular plane airlines can accommodate customers otherwise left behind a last minute traveler who might be told the flight is sold out if airlines didnt overbook can in fact get onboard thats because people still dont show up for flights even though most airline tickets these days are nonrefundable or jump on different flights by selling more tickets than there are actual seats on the plane the dot says overbooking probably helps hold down ticket prices take away overbooking and fares would likely rise whats more some people like to volunteer to give up seats on overbooked flights to snag vouchers for future trips airlines are required to ask for volunteers before involuntarily bumping customers and if you arent in a hurry it can pay to perhaps pocket a &# voucher toward your next ticket those vouchers however come with strings attached such as restrictions blocking their use on ultra cheap fares or popular travel dates couple that with longer waits to get on another flight because planes are booked so full these days and volunteering isnt as enticing as it used to be in the first quarter this year the rate of voluntary bumps dropped by while the rate of involuntary bumping was on the rise either fewer people wanted to volunteer for vouchers or airlines were getting chintzier with their offers to volunteers the dot offered up several options in an "advance notice of proposed rulemaking " one option is to fully account for inflation since that would more than triple the penalties to a maximum cap of &# from &# and &# from &# another option is to tie the increase to the rise in airfares which have increased at a much much slower rate than inflation because of increased airline competition and low cost competitors using the average price travelers pay to fly one mile as the measure the caps would bump up to &# from &# and &# from &# thats the option likely to be preferred by airlines but not travelers also under consideration doubling the caps eliminating the caps or leaving them as is airlines say they are still studying the proposal and their main lobbying organization the air transport association says it "welcomes the review " carriers are unlikely to raise a spirited fight against some change since they are already under pressure in washington where congress is considering possibly slapping a "passengers bill of rights" on the industry most likely airlines will offer to accept the small increase from the ticket price inflation and hope that the dot doesnt hit them with the huge inflation adjustment or elimination of caps altogether another change under consideration is including more regional jets and turbo props planes under the denied boarding compensation rules currently airplanes with seats or fewer are exempt the dot has proposed dropping that to seats the dot excluded small plane carriers in because it thought the rules placed a heftier financial burden on them and small planes often have to bump passengers for safety reasons on hot days when takeoff performance is diminished in practice most small plane airlines voluntarily abide by the rules because they are partners of bigger carriers in fact its usually the big airline that is selling tickets setting prices and deciding how much to overbook the regional airline flights the regional airline association says its board hasnt met yet to decide a position but it likely will support dropping the exclusion to seats and tying compensation to ticket prices "the measurement ought to be the value of airfares not the cost of living " said roger cohen president of the group the dot is taking comments from the public at a web site http dms dot gov by fax at or mail to new jersey ave se room w washington d c you need to include docket number ost after comments are weighed the dot will offer a proposed rule change open again to comment and a lengthy regulatory evaluation an actual change in the rule isnt expected to be enacted until next year bump money regulators may change how much airlines must compensate fliers when theyre bumped from flights
