politics &amp economics passport problems hobble iraqi expatriates iraqi expatriates facing uncertain futures have a new problem most of their passports are no longer valid and replacing them can be practically impossible with the u s and its allies increasingly worried that terrorists disguised as iraqi emigres will slip across their borders baghdad has started issuing new electronically enhanced passports with digital numbering and watermarks that meet all international security standards but that has rendered pre existing passports useless stranding millions of iraqi citizens who hold either saddam hussein era passports or the handwritten easily counterfeited ones the government started issuing after the u s invasion the u s earlier this year said it would no longer recognize any but the newest iraqi documents because it felt the older ones are too easy to forge canada the united kingdom and other countries dont accept them either the only iraqi passports these countries now recognize are the new ones the iraqi government began issuing more than a year ago which are much more difficult to duplicate but obtaining one of the new passports which are only produced in baghdad is extremely difficult for iraqis living abroad the only places they can be obtained outside of baghdad are from iraqi embassies in london and amman jordan even then the process can stretch for months the iraqi government hasnt yet set up procedures for iraqis living in other countries to apply for one of the new passports from abroad says hikmet bamarni the iraqi consul in the iraqi embassy in washington when iraqi expatriates living in the u s apply for a new passport the embassy here issues them one of the passports the u s and others no longer consider valid says mr bamarni "we have a dilemma " he says "nobody wants the old passport because if they leave they cant come back to the u s " he said these iraqis continue to obtain the documents because they at least allow entry back into iraq if necessary and serve as identification for various day to day transactions the iraqi passport restrictions are among numerous steps the u s and other countries are taking out of a heightened concern about terrorism the u s prohibition against the use of the old iraqi passports is more severe than any steps it has taken with documents issued by other nations the passport restrictions are further complicated by the million iraqi refugees who have fled their country to escape the war hundreds of thousands of other iraqis also are studying working or living in other countries most iraqis living abroad dont want to risk their lives by traveling to baghdad to update their documentation they are also reluctant to leave their host countries without the right passport for fear that they wouldnt be able to return the result is that hundreds of thousands of iraqis living abroad including some diplomats are facing severe travel restrictions for example ghassan razak a year old masters degree student at leeds university says he didnt attend his mothers funeral in iraq and wont travel to jordan to see his wife and four children because he is afraid he wont be able to return to the u k with his current passport "i felt all the people i know were dying and i couldnt see them " mr razak says a few iraqis still carry passports issued during the saddam hussein era but those are only recognized by syria passports issued in the years after the u s invasion are extremely vulnerable to forgery partly because much of the information in them such as the owners names is filled out by hand "sub standard security features and a lack of control over production and issuance make the passport extremely vulnerable to alteration counterfeiting and imposters " according to a circular issued by the u s embassy in amman iraqs new passports have security features commonly used by other countries that make them very hard to forge all the information except the signature is printed electronically officials in embassies in washington london and ottawa say they dont know when they will receive the machines and training necessary to produce them iraqi nationals who hold old so called s series passports will be allowed to enter jordan until the end of december according to the jordanian ministry of interior the extension was granted after iraqi government requests to allow more time for its citizens to obtain new passports passport problems shouldnt affect iraqis applying for refugee status in the u s according to peter eisenhauer spokesman for the state departments bureau of population refugees and migrations "individuals who are approved by the u s as refugees dont need a passport " he says the bush administration announced in february that it planned to allow about iraqi refugees into the u s this year up from in the department of homeland security in may said that it had developed new security procedures for screening applicants the department also said it had approved only cases involving individuals so far and that the administration planned to accept "up to" refugees "americas tradition of welcoming international refugees is unrivaled " said michael chertoff homeland security secretary in a statement issued last month when the new security procedures were announced "yet we also must be mindful of the security risks associated with admitting refugees from war torn countries "
