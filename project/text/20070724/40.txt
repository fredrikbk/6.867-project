germans hack at forest of signs distracting drivers in schilderwald its hard to say auf wiedersehen to comfortable old order troisdorf germany a lawyer three civil servants and a policeman stopped their van to ponder the "no passing" sign on a narrow residential street the sign should be taken down because theres no room to pass anyway said the lawyer it could use a cleaning said a civil servant "its a nice day " said the policeman keeping the peace as he moved the van a few yards down the road to inspect the next sign for nearly a decade germanys million member adac automobile association has been curb crawling the nations streets with municipal officials in an effort to persuade them to get rid of as much as half the countrys estimated million traffic signs many germans believe the countrys signage has become so dense that its a safety hazard a recent study concluded that the distracting signs keep drivers from watching the road germans have coined a term for the phenomenon schilderwald or sign forest but as the van load of officials touring troisdorf for surplus signs discovered on a recent morning parting with them isnt proving easy "germans like clear rules " said joachim adam one of the three civil servants in the van theres a sign for toad crossings kroeten wanderung theres one that tells drivers when theyre on a "dirty road" verschmutzte fahrbahn another warns them not to drive into lakes or rivers there are different signs regulating how to park at a curb theres even a special parking sign for hikers where they leave their cars a recent adac funded survey in nine european countries found that of respondents thought their roads had too many signs compared with of german drivers "we know of groups that are concerned about billboards but not traffic signs " says andrew delmege a spokesman for the american automobile association in washington he doesnt see traffic signs as an issue in the u s it isnt clear that the sign forest has made germans safer germany had the eighth highest rate of injuries from road accidents among countries in a recent survey by the organization for economic cooperation and development most german road fatalities meanwhile occur off the speed limit free motor ways in the neighboring netherlands a village called makkinga pop axed all its traffic signs and signals in other dutch towns also have taken radical steps to reduce road markings theyve been inspired by a local traffic engineers "shared space" philosophy the idea is that roads are safer with fewer rules that way drivers and pedestrians pay more attention to one another one german town has decided to follow the dutch example in a project funded in part by the european union but mr adam a traffic planner for troisdorf is certain the idea wont spread far across his country because following rules is so deeply ingrained here "its a habit " says clemens albrecht a sociologist at koblenz university what mr albrecht calls germanys "rule mania" dates back centuries to prussian times when leaders of the kingdom in whats now northern germany and poland developed a highly sophisticated state bureaucracy and military machine about german municipalities have teamed up with adac to trim the schilderwald since the automobile club the largest in europe launched a pilot project in thats less than of the countrys municipalities however "there are people sitting in government offices who simply like to put up signs " complains thomas hessling an adac traffic engineer heavily involved in the associations siege on signage in troisdorf a bucolic city of near cologne in western germany mr adam and other local officials spent the past year driving up and down streets with an adac representative inspecting traffic signs in an early drive through last year the group stopped at an intersection it featured signs including three "no stopping" signs two "yield" signs and two "no entry" signs there wasnt a car in sight after some debate they agreed that the intersection would be just as safe or safer with only half a dozen signs "i like the look of it " said hartmut minjoth the adac lawyer as he stood in the quiet intersection and imagined it clutter free condemned signs are covered with plastic yellow hoods the streets look as if christo the artist famous for wrapping the reichstag and other public buildings had paid a visit if nobody complains within a few weeks officials take the signs down the group also agreed to hood other signs on neighboring streets including a "pedestrians only" directive at the entrance to a narrow path after everyone agreed that even a bicycle couldnt squeeze through spirits were high as the van pulled up to a local bakery for coffee and cake "maybe well open a museum" for discarded signs joked mr adam back on the road mr adam resisted appeals from mr minjoth to tear down a sign prohibiting cars and motorcycles from entering a yard long street which already had a big asphalt hump and a paved white stripe to deter traffic he worried hed have to deal with angry calls from one elderly resident "when he dies well do it " said mr adam by the final curb crawl last month mr minjoth was feeling less buoyant as he sat in the back of the police van in a rumpled suit "were not getting rid of a lot ive got to say " grumbled mr minjoth wiping sweat from his brow on this hot day "can we get some air in here " the windows in the back were sealed shut because the van is normally used to transport criminals the policeman explained apologetically mr minjoth did persuade everyone in the van to ditch the "no passing" sign at the entrance to the narrow residential street they agreed to hood a "residential area" sign that stood in the middle of several square miles of homes a sign prohibiting cars from entering an overgrown field got the heave ho so did a sign with nothing written on it for which nobody in the van could discern a purpose the troisdorf officials also ordered several old fashioned train crossing signs depicting a steam locomotive to be replaced with new signs featuring electric trains they earmarked scratched or dirty signs for cleaning they noticed some signs were lower than the and foot mandated heights along sidewalks and bicycle paths respectively "you could hit your head " said one official issuing instructions to elevate them other signs were partially hidden by trees and bushes the officials made plans to alert the local ordnungsamt or department of order to instruct residents to trim their foliage after driving around for hours everyone clambered out of the van for the last time they estimated that more than signs in troisdorf had been designated for removal over the past months roughly a fifth of those standing when the project began next month city officials plan to gather the discarded signs pile them on top of each other and take pictures afterward some signs will be sold for scrap many others will be put in storage according to mr adam in case troisdorf needs them again down the road
