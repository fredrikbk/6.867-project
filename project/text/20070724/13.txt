business technology hire eds get microsoft oracle sun alliance that helped boost texas companys profit still key for incoming ceo plano texas in september a team of about people from electronic data systems corp sat down in a conference room in suburban chicago with around officials from kraft foods inc the kraft delegation wanted to know one main thing why should it choose eds over international business machines corp or hewlett packard co for a &# billion contract to oversee the food giants computer servers and desktops and laptops kraft got an answer but not just from eds staffers rick cmiel a manager from personal computer maker dell inc rose to reply using powerpoint slides he told kraft executives they should go with eds in part because dell had a larger share of the computer business in the worlds largest corporations than ibm or h p mr cmiel was speaking as part of an alliance that eds has formed with some of the worlds biggest technology companies under the partnership called the eds agility alliance sun microsystems inc microsoft corp oracle corp and others embed teams of to people each with eds for months at a time the teams work side by side with eds technicians doing everything from bidding on contracts together to customizing tech services for clients the alliance begun in has been a key part of edss turnaround engineered by outgoing chief executive michael h jordan who announced last week that he will step down as part of a planned succession on sept the year old will be replaced by edss chief operating officer ronald rittenmeyer who says he plans to continue the alliance overall edss profit has more than doubled in the past three years revenue is also rising up to &# billion last year founded in by texas businessman h ross perot eds helped invent the technology outsourcing industry handling computer needs for businesses and other institutions acting as a general contractor eds would land an outsourcing contract and then parcel out pieces of it to other computer companies who acted as subcontractors but as companies tech needs have grown ranging from pcs to servers to security software to storage many enterprises turned to larger tech vendors that could provide a one stop shop in particular ibm and h p boast larger business portfolios that include servers and software as well as outsourcing services the two companies which each produce around &# billion in revenue annually and about employees between the two of them can provide soup to nuts solutions for businesses looking for more simplicity other corporate customers began using cheaper offshore providers in india and elsewhere some eds customers were spooked by edss missteps contracts that the company had trouble servicing because of delays and other problems contributed to a loss of &# billion in for instance when mr jordan took over that same year he and other executives realized eds was being outflanked but with employees and &# billion in annual revenue eds didnt have the resources to make computer products like h p and ibm and wasnt nimble enough to fend off the smaller ones so he tried a new tack create a consortium of tech companies to go after the competition "what we believed we needed was an ecosystem that would create a virtual hardware and software company " says charles feld an eds executive vice president who helped create the alliance formed in companies in the alliance sign agreements that say they are strategic partners with eds and also sign contracts agreeing to do their part on specific deals partners get compensated for the goods and services they provide but nothing beyond that the benefit eds says is the opportunity to win business through the alliance and the alliance doesnt preclude companies from working on projects of their own for other clients partnerships arent uncommon in the computer industry companies hook up with partners all the time to help develop new microchips or other technologies but what makes this alliance unusual is that the partners actually work together under one roof and operate as one team in pitching a client on a contract and carrying out the work joseph tucci ceo of data storage maker emc corp says he jumped at the chance to join forces with eds against a common foe ibm when eds unveiled the consortium in october it had six partners sun microsoft dell emc xerox corp and cisco systems inc oracle and sap ag joined later today about engineers from partner companies are dedicated to eds which houses them in offices at its main plano campus and at a facility in auburn hills mich eds has around employees devoted to the effort the alliance is helping eds to outmaneuver rivals in deals involving the alliance accounted for of edss &# billion in contract signings so far this year alliance involved deals have accounted for almost half of the signings say eds officials one of the advantages the eds alliance pitches to customers is that rather than dealing with multiple vendors to get a technical problem resolved they can go to eds as a main point of contact then eds can get the team members who sit together at eds offices to come up with a solution "the client wants things to be easy to work " says ben trowbridge ceo of alsbridge a dallas based technology adviser one of the deals eds won through the consortium was kraft while much of the tech gear kraft was using earlier this decade was from ibm the company decided to put up its tech outsourcing for bid to see what else was out there talking to eds in the process "it was nice to see their partners with them at the table where you could look each of them in the eye " says lee coulter an information technology vice president at the northfield ill food company kraft awarded its deal to eds in april mr coulter declines to say whether kraft is paying less than if it had gone with ibm blue cross blue shield of massachusetts a longtime eds customer says it often gets outsourcing offers from other firms but it says the alliance has been "a key factor" in the health insurers decision to continue with eds carl ascenzo chief information officer at the blue cross blue shield affiliate says the alliance has made it easier for him to address the increasingly complex needs of his company which has desktop computers and multiple backroom systems and databases that all have to be stitched together in particular blue cross blue shield now finds it easier to work with microsoft oracle and other partners that are now part of edss team before says mr ascenzo the vendors often worked disparately sometimes slowing down efforts such as making all the desktops servers and mainframes communicate well with one another edss alliance has encountered some bumps eds asked dell to leave the alliance in june after eds officials said customers appeared more focused on software and networks than on pcs eds says that dell will continue work on contracts it has already won as part of alliance teams keeping engineers housed at eds and remains a "preferred" partner but dell wont be part of the alliance team that customizes products for clients dell of round rock texas says eds officials have given assurances the company will maintain close relations with dell for hardware and computer services "my guess is our relationship will continue to grow " says bill rodrigues a dell vice president balancing the competing interests of remaining partners is also a challenge eds officials say they must assuage wounded feelings when one or more partners products arent chosen by the customer as part of a contract still edss partners say they have benefited from piggybacking on contracts they might not otherwise have been in on emc officials say theyve been able to push into new markets in europe and the middle east with the alliance cisco ceo john chambers credits eds for adding "hundreds of millions of revenues a year" to his san jose calif based company competitors say the alliance hasnt hurt them h p declined comment on eds but says its own outsourcing business continues to grow ibm officials say their companys &# billion in contract signings last year exceeded edss &# billion in the same year "its great to talk about an alliance but each one of those companies has its own objectives " says john bukovinsky an ibm spokesman eds officials say they are now looking at fine tuning the alliance to include more attributes such as partners making sure customers experience few computer outages eds also plans to assess whether additional partners need to be brought in to increase global reach
