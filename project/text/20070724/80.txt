school choice and racial balance schools that admit students on the basis of race run afoul of the constitution wrote chief justice john roberts in the recent supreme court case parents v seattle over subscribed schools may not use race as a tie breaker when deciding which students to admit but according to justice anthony kennedy in his decisive concurring opinion racial segregation remains such a serious public issue that explicit race criteria might be used if all other means for achieving racial balance have been explored seattles error was not to have first tried other less draconian options for achieving diversity both views are correct and the solution is simple to achieve racial balance let parents choose their school and let oversubscribed schools admit students by lot if parents of all races and ethnicities seek admission to a particular school at the same rate then a lottery will ensure that the schools social mix reflects that of the school district the very goal seattle said it tried to achieve it will be objected wont white parents apply to good schools at a higher rate than minority parents will wont some schools have larger concentrations of white students leaving minorities packed into schools elsewhere such questions imply that minority parents are not equally capable of figuring out whats best for their child yet when parents can choose and schools use a lottery minority parents are quite willing to look for options in many urban areas parents are now being given the choice of attending one of the countrys nearly charter schools publicly funded schools operated by nonprofit or for profit organizations most are so popular they are over subscribed and must turn some students away theyre especially attractive in big cities because they typically provide smaller safer and friendlier educational environments to comply with state laws and regulations as well as to live up to their own egalitarian ideals charters usually rely upon a lottery to pick which students to admit unless they are siblings of a student already at the school charter schools serve a higher percentage of minorities and disadvantaged students than traditional public schools according to a department of education survey of charter school students are african american as compared to in traditional public schools for hispanics the proportions in the two sectors are and respectively nor are the well to do crowding out the economically disadvantaged of charter school students are income eligible for the subsidized lunch program as compared to of those in public school but what if parents prefer to send their child to a school that is racially unbalanced is the evidence clear that desegregated schools are so educationally desirable they should be forced on families even if they choose otherwise it isnt scholarly studies both good and bad have produced so many conflicting findings that nothing is known with any certainty about the impact of attending a desegregated school overall the evidence points in two directions on the one side abolition of de jure segregation not only changed the countrys racial climate but african american student performance in the south rose markedly especially during the reagan years when schools were desegregating amid a public rhetoric that stressed personal self reliance but on the other side significant school desegregation within big cities since along the lines that seattle carried out has not prevented the recent slide in minority adolescents test scores perhaps this was because affirmative action policies created a sense of entitlement and a powerful entertainment industry reinforced an anti education peer group culture justice kennedy is correct in saying that school desegregation is a goal still worth pursuing chief justice roberts is correct in saying that true equality demands race blind policies but the route to racial balance is better pursued by parental choice and fair school policies than by granting entitlements to one group over another mr peterson professor of government at harvard university and a senior fellow at the hoover institution is a member of the koret task force on k education
