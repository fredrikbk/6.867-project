businesss technology iphone calls to some business users web based applications work nicely with browser but security is a concern with the iphones hefty price tag it is likely that big spending business users were well represented among the hordes who turned out to buy apple inc s cellular phone during its first weeks on sale even if the bona fides of the iphone as a business tool arent established with skeptics questioning whether its security performance and compatibility with existing business software are up to snuff some early adopters arent holding back some corporate customers are using the apple phone in place of "smartphones" such as research in motion ltd s blackberry and other devices that have long track records among business users some are even tapping into business centric applications for tracking inventory and accounting business software makers such as netsuite inc and salesforce com inc are marketing their applications to iphone users and in some cases modifying software so it works more smoothly on apples device brian keare chief operating officer of circle of friends llc a maker of hair care and bath products for children in santa monica calif is one customer using the iphone for business though he bought it primarily to make phone calls write emails and use the ipod entertainment functions he decided to test the limits of the iphones web browser by logging onto netsuite where his small companys sales accounting and other records are kept to mr keares surprise it worked flawlessly allowing him access to all of his company information on the go he had previously had no luck accessing netsuite with its complicated design from the browser on a blackberry or palm inc s treo "they choked on the web pages " he said mr keares wife eleanor chief executive of circle of friends was so intrigued by the iphone that she snatched it from him for a business trip to chicago where it helped her make a spontaneous visit to a clients store before going in she was able to quickly access the clients sales records and the store managers name without having to haul out her laptop ms keare is planning to buy her own iphone "its proving to be useful enough were really going to take advantage of it and use it as a business tool " said mr keare who has stopped using his treo there is a particularly good fit between the iphone and web based business applications such as netsuite that is partly out of necessity to protect the security of iphones apple cupertino calif is allowing independent software makers to offer iphone applications that work only through its web browser not the more traditional programs that are stored and run locally on a device users said the iphones web browser known as safari is one of the most usable on a mobile phone with better compatibility with many web sites they said the large touch sensing screen on the iphone which lets users pan around a web page and zoom in with various finger gestures also makes it more practical to use the web the iphone is priced at &# to &# with a two year commitment to wireless service through at&amp t inc salesforce com said its web site currently works on the iphone and that it is modifying its software to more effectively display the site through the iphone browser zimbra inc which makes a web based competitor to microsoft corp s outlook email calendar and contacts program expects to offer a version of its software tailored to the iphone next month still it is difficult to deny that apple designed much of the iphone for consumers from the ability to watch youtube videos to the music playing functions the fact that users must have apples itunes software with its heavy focus on entertainment on their computers to synchronize data with an iphone may be tough for many businesses to stomach adam gross vice president of developer relations at salesforce com believes the iphone will follow the path of other technologies with consumer roots like the web browser and adobe systems inc s flash animation software that were ultimately embraced by businesses "i think the iphone absolutely is going to have a big impact on mobile business applications " he said in the near term the iphone probably has a better shot with small businesses where decisions about technology are more frequently based on an employees preferences for now large businesses are looking more skeptically though some are considering it the information technology department at quintiles transnational corp a pharmaceutical services company in research triangle park n c is testing the iphone including a web conferencing application made by genesys conferencing inc but jonathan shough executive director of global network service and information technology at quintiles said the person company needs better tools for managing the iphone if the company is to deploy it broadly with blackberries for instance quintiles can remotely erase emails and other sensitive data if the devices are lost or stolen no such capability now exists for the iphone mr shough said apple declined to say whether it might offer such a feature in the future "iphone is a great product for all customers businesses included " said natalie kerris an apple spokeswoman in a report this month research firm gartner inc discouraged large businesses from letting employees put sensitive company data such as emails on iphones because of security concerns while the iphone does have some security features built into it ken dulaney a gartner analyst said they arent up to most corporate standards visto corp a provider of mobile email services said it is working on a product that will beef up email security on the iphone for business users
