contractors in lead go on defensive costs problems spur concerns about companies power over military work five years after major defense contractors began receiving unprecedented control of important military programs skeptical lawmakers are taking steps that could reel in the practice for the past few years military officials have tapped companies like boeing co lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp to oversee big projects a role that gives the companies both broad responsibilities and healthy profit margins the lead integrator role gives them oversight once handled by the pentagon essentially giving one company wide latitude to oversee everything from choosing technologies to divvying up work among subcontractors the lead integrator model has been used in some giant programs including the armys future combat systems a modernization program overseen by boeing that program meant to bring sophisticated communications technology and equipment to rank and file soldiers on the battlefield could cost more &# billion by the time it enters service a decade from now according to some estimates but those growing cost numbers and troubles with some programs have brought the lead integrator approach under fire lawmakers who criticize the practice are asking whether defense companies should have so much influence over everything from new ships for the coast guard to tiny unmanned aerial vehicles used by army infantry the house version of the defense budget for the next fiscal year which begins oct includes language that could put an end to any new "lead systems integrator" contracts after oct it also calls for the government to identify work that should be reserved for the government but by putting the target date off into the future the legislation acknowledges that the lead systems integrator approach could be the only way to get this work done now indeed supporters of the model cite personnel cuts in the pentagon as well as the ability of private sector companies to get increasingly complex systems engineering work done faster than under traditional contracts "theres been a growing complexity to the systems that are being acquired " says lockheed spokesman tom jurkowsky "we believe integrating large complex systems is a core attribute of this company " the lead integrator model grew partly out of defense department personnel cuts and partly out of the governments desire to encourage more efficient commercial practices the poster child for this contracting concept is boeing and its role overseeing the fcs program the broadest example yet of a private company overseeing a large defense contract the lead integrator label is also applied to some smaller and less complex contracts in which contractors hold a less extensive role the government accountability office the investigative arm of congress wrote in a june report that it fears that the inherently cozier relationship between a contractor like boeing and the army weakens oversight one concern is that the two parties interests are so closely aligned that any problems or failures may get smoothed over to keep the work on track or that costs may be higher than the army says they are "i think quite the opposite is the case" said dennis muilenburg boeings fcs program manager he said the program gives the army more oversight because the agreement is structured to give the service more involvement in the supplier base in a traditional more narrowly scoped prime contract boeing would have more freedom to choose its subcontractors he said the industrys largest players bolstered by the past decades consolidation gravitated toward this kind of overarching contract because it let them use their size to take over work the downsized defense department no longer wished to do problems with the coast guards &# billion deepwater contract a plan to modernize the services ships and aircraft drew attention to the practice from lawmakers the work overseen by northrop grumman and lockheed resulted in unseaworthy ships and management headaches lockheed and the navy also encountered rough waters over the costly development of a ship designed for coastal missions northrop and lockheed have defended their work and cited progress in the project which was handed back to the coast guard to manage reining in the biggest contractors roles means government will have to step in with its own people if it can the house bills section on lead systems integrators calls for a study of what positions and skills the pentagon should supply to supplement contractor personnel by oct going from study to change however wont be easy scott davis the deputy program manager for operations with the armys fcs group says that if each of the partners involved in the work had their own contract then the armys staff would have to triple or quadruple any move to overturn the lead integrator model also poses a headache for defense contractors who to some degree have remade their businesses around the idea the biggest test of the concept is boeings oversight of the fcs program boeing along with partner saic inc sits atop a latticework of contractors developing new networking communications and military technology for a st century upgrade of the army boeing oversees an army of more than defense contract workers including boeing employees which dwarfs the fewer than pentagon officials involved much of the focus is on tens of millions of lines of software code at the foundation of the effort which will allow soldiers to operate new unmanned vehicles weapons and communications technologies in missions ranging form urban combat to peacekeeping "its really like microsoft building windows " the armys mr davis said some of the biggest concerns about the program are tied to oversight and making sure all the new technology works together as it should boeing isnt slated to make any military hardware for the fcs program but there were concerns that it would be tempted to award itself work the contract was revised to specifically prohibit it from doing so total cost is also being closely scrutinized the gao has highlighted the wide distance between total cost estimates for the fcs program the army estimates the cost of the program at roughly &# billion over its lifetime the office of the secretary of defense puts the work at &# billion to &# billion boeing and the army are paving the way for early production of the fcs weapons systems in the program is expected to use fixed price contracts after the research and development phase winds down the army wants &# billion in fiscal to fund the work the program is on time and slightly under budget according to boeing
