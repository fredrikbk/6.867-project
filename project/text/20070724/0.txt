a tax cure for health care there arent many issues in washington that everyone can agree on these days but heres one our health care system needs serious reform deciphering the forms you get when you take your child to the doctor is very difficult small business owners who provide health insurance for their employees struggle to afford skyrocketing costs many communities dont have a single practicing ob gyn because the risk of lawsuits has run them out of town the problems are clear yet there is great disagreement about what to do about them what we need is an honest look at whats right with our health care system whats wrong with it and what we can do to improve it lets start with whats right americas private system of medicine is the worlds finest it taps into the efficiency and flexibility of competition and markets it puts doctors and patients in charge not government it gives us the worlds most talented doctors and nurses the most advanced hospitals and the most promising medical research americans with access to this system receive outstanding care and people from around the world come here to benefit from it of course theres also a big problem access to high quality private health care is getting so expensive that many cant afford it growing numbers of americans depend on the government for coverage that creates a bureaucratic maze for them and weakens the system of private medicine for all as president bush summed it up recently "americas health care is too costly its too confusing it leaves too many people uninsured " so how do we fix the system the president agrees with the many members of congress democratic and republican who believe we have an obligation to ensure that poor kids have health insurance the state childrens health insurance program schip has been covering poor kids for years and now is up for reauthorization the president supports reauthorization his budget boosts funding for poor children in schip and he is prepared to sign a bill with appropriate funding increases the president differs from some in congress on how to cover children in middle class families and other americans for example one bill sponsored by sens max baucus d mont and charles grassley r iowa would expand schip dramatically beyond what it is intended to do and it would be a dangerous step down the path of government run health care ultimately resulting in fewer options and lower quality care for american families the baucus grassley proposal would expand schip to cover many children who are not actually poor a family of four making &# would be eligible for taxpayer funded health insurance it would also cause many people to drop their good private coverage and move to taxpayer funded government run health care in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that for every two people who would join schip under this bill one would drop his her private health insurance a striking example of "crowd out" that is contrary to the purpose of the program finally this bill would run up a huge tab &# billion over years and would impose new tobacco taxes to pay for it but even a large tax hike wont pay for this bills vast expansion of the schip program instead the bill resorts to a massive budget gimmick to hide its true costs this trick makes it appear that schips costs under this legislation will steadily increase from &# billion this year to &# billion in and will then suddenly drop to &# billion a year a steep fall that wont happen of course because millions of kids would lose coverage in short the baucus grassley bill would weaken the part of american health care that is working well our private system of medicine while doing little to address the real problem for most americans which is the cost of care if congress really wants to talk about reforming american health care and getting more people covered there is a smarter way a way to build on the strengths of our private system while addressing its shortcomings and it starts with addressing one of the root causes of the problems in health care the federal tax code the problem is straightforward under todays tax code people who are fortunate enough to get health insurance through their jobs get a big tax break but those who have to buy coverage on their own get no tax break at all that is not fair and it is not wise it makes it impossible for millions of americans who work for small businesses or who are self employed to afford health insurance and it drives up the cost of coverage for us all so president bush has proposed to level the playing field for health insurance under his plan every family with private health coverage would receive a standard tax deduction of &# no matter where they get their health insurance this deduction would encourage more people to buy their own health insurance just like the mortgage interest deduction encourages more people to buy their own homes some have suggested that a flat tax credit could also achieve the presidents goal of leveling the playing field and he has signaled that he would be open to that option these tax reforms are simple but their effect would be revolutionary more than million people who are now covered by employer provided insurance would see lower tax bills right away those who now purchase health insurance on their own would get a tax benefit for the first time and millions of others who have no health insurance would be able to purchase private coverage to reduce the ranks of the uninsured even more president bush has also proposed to make federal help available to states that ensure all their citizens have access to basic private health insurance there are sharp contrasts between the presidents plan to reform the tax code and the baucus grassley proposal reforming the tax code would bring more affordable health insurance to million americans while baucus grassley will not change the cost of coverage for most people reforming the tax code would reduce the ranks of the uninsured by as many as million while baucus grassley would cut the uninsured by fewer than four million and reforming the tax code would achieve these goals without increasing taxes while baucus grassley would mean more taxes more spending and more control for federal bureaucrats in washington for taxpayers families patients and businesses the choice is clear therefore president bush will continue to work with members of both parties for reforms that make health care more affordable and more available for all americans while continuing to support schip for poor kids mr hubbard is assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the national economic council see related letters "letters to the editor flat
