battle drawing in financial institutions from the u s asia and europe barclays plc its plans to acquire abn amro holding nv of the netherlands in a friendly transaction spoiled by a richer bid from a rival consortium reached halfway across the world to government entities in china and singapore to boost its offer to &# billion and offer more cash in so doing it quickly illustrated how new sources of capital may play an increasingly influential role in deal making barclays said yesterday that china development bank a chinese government controlled lender plans to invest at least billion euros &# billion and as much as billion euros for a stake in barclays of at least and as much as if barclayss bid for abn succeeds and if regulators approve it could become the largest overseas investment by a chinese company to date and at china development bank would be by far the biggest shareholder in the british bank singapores temasek holdings pte ltd will invest as much as billion euros in barclays increasingly banks outside the european sphere are playing a role in the abn fight in a side deal to abns sale to barclays abn agreed to sell its u s unit lasalle to bank of america corp but that move sent the abn sale into courts in the netherlands and u s until recently when the dutch supreme court allowed the &# billion lasalle sale to go through it remains unclear whether bringing in the asian entities as investors will be enough to put barclays over the top in its battle for abn the cash infusion increases the barclays bid to billion euros from billion euros and changes its all stock offer to one that is cash an effort to make it more appealing to abn investors still it remains well shy of a billion euros bid from a consortium of royal bank of scotland group plc spains banco santander

products and services that china development doesnt provide such as asset management services china developments main business is lending to chinese government owned companies a number of which are doing big business overseas and as chinese companies expand into places like south africa barclays hopes to capture the banking business behind those deals given china development banks role in infrastructure and chinas booming demand for commodities such as metals barclays plans to provide expertise in hedging commodities the british bank for example will put employees on the ground to provide training and assist in infrastructure buildout "if you look at even the amount of infrastructure investment that african countries are projected to make over the next five to years its clearly an area that the chinese have deemed to be of strategic importance to them " said jerry del missier co president of barclays capital the capital markets business of barclays mr del missier helped in structuring the stake sales barclays began courting china development bank and temasek in may and june as the rbs led consortium became aggressive in its pursuit of abn barclayss mr diamond directed
