wisdom of the turks democracy has a bad rap in the middle east these days but it earned some rehabilitation in turkey on the weekend in parliamentary elections voters sent a message of moderation both to the islamist influenced majority party and the military prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his ruling justice and development party akp won of the vote up percentage points from the poll in its wisdom however the electorate also put a check on the majority by denying the akp a two thirds majority to change the constitution two other parties and a bloc of kurdish parliamentarians squeaked in this means the akp will hold fewer seats overall and face a more robust opposition as the most talented turkish vote getter of his generation mr erdogan can now burnish or tarnish his statesman credentials within the month parliament must again elect a new president in may mr erdogan chose abdullah gul the foreign minister and party no whose wife wears a headscarf but street protests a not so subtle warning from the military and a politicized decision from turkeys highest court forced mr erdogan to withdraw the nomination to avoid another ruckus mr erdogan will need broader support for his next choice so far mr erdogan has hit the right notes "we are prepared for a compromise " he said yesterday "god willing we will end the presidential election process without giving rise to any tensions " the deep suspicion in many quarters is that mr erdogan and the akp have a secret agenda to ransack the turkish constitution but his rhetoric was anything but triumphalist "our joy should never be the sorrow of those who do not think like us " this is good politics for mr erdogan who will do his party no favors by courting a military showdown turkeys secular traditions are strong and kemal ataturk remains a revered founding father to be able to tinker with that legacy say by lifting the ban on the wearing of headscarves in public buildings the akp needs to move gingerly and first build legitimacy and support after last springs public backlash the party purged more hardline islamists the reward for its restraint came sunday when voters endorsed its pro business and europe friendly agenda the akp victory is also a rebuke to talk of a military coup the kemalist republican peoples party the main opposition party that tried to exploit the may conflict over the presidency stayed at of the vote if the military can read election results it wont stage a coup that would be unpopular and only strengthen akp hardliners the recent political turmoil has distracted turks from their main task which should be to build on the akps five year record of liberalizing the countrys economy and politics growth averages a year and inflation has fallen to single digits little wonder that yesterday the turkish lira hit a two year high against the dollar and the istanbul stock exchange jumped investors like political stability much work remains to be done to make turkeys markets and society less vulnerable to statist meddling the eu wants stronger free speech and anti torture codes to boost turkeys membership prospects ankara also faces a serious threat from pkk kurdish terrorists based in northern iraq that washington can do more to address the akps expansion of educational and cultural rights for the kurdish minority is part of the solution to the troubles in its own southeast turkey is undergoing a political transition that has produced strains with its traditional friends in europe and the u s but thanks to the wisdom of turkish voters ankaras politicians have a mandate for compromise and moderate reform
