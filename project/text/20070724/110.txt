wagoner takes a victory lap nashville tenn porter wagoner has been very arguably the most significant surprising emotionally penetrating country music performer of the past years whos nevertheless remained a cipher or even a rhinestone festooned comic caricature to audiences outside of the stone country core the country hall of famer looks at that career path so different from the crossover pop moves of his late friend johnny cash and protegee dolly parton with the same observant frankness that marked his hit renditions of such lasting unblinking ballads as "satisfied mind " "green green grass of home" and the tellingly titled "the cold hard facts of life " "i just never had the desire to go beyond that " mr wagoner said in a recent conversation here "just to be a good country singer and a good country songwriter you know marty told me porter the other artists on the grand ole opry came here to learn how to play the music on there youre a farm boy from missouri that knew how to sing when you came here brought your style with you and youve never varied youve kept that same feeling in your voice that sincerity and drive and i said marty id never thought of it that way but really that is what i did " marty is marty stuart at age a veteran country star in his own right and the producer of "wagonmaster " the just released new cd on the indie rock oriented anti label the new recording captures the year old mr wagoners decisive return to twangy sometimes even spookily twangy sounds in the style of his s and s band for which the album is named and to biting hard country songs many of them self penned in recent decades mr wagoner had largely stuck to gospel music and his regular opry hosting duties as his mix of traditional country backup impeccably phrased singing and recitations and far from sunny themes seemed so far removed from the stuff of contemporary country hit making "porters the last man standing of the old cloth from the old hank williams era " mr stuart says "my job was to put him back in touch with his classic sound to get his pompadour up in there again and to get a guitar back around his neck those three things are accomplished now i also get to see him take a victory lap " that "lap " which comes on the heels of a slow but real recovery from an aneurysm that nearly killed mr wagoner a little over a year ago has already included the celebration of his th anniversary as a member of the grand ole opry the nationally broadcast show featured a rare reunion with dolly parton with whom porter had a half dozen top duets in the mid to late s dolly sang her smash hit "i will always love you" originally written as a farewell to mr wagoner as she left his innovative hundred market syndicated tv show directly to him face to face for the first time with damp eyes all around people are getting to see mr wagoner well beyond the opry now he recently opened in los angeles for indie rock favorite neko case and porter will open tonight for rockers the white stripes at a show at madison square garden no less hell be backed by marty and his gifted remarkably flexible band the fabulous superlatives the very sorts of songs that urban hipsters were inclined to deride as gothic melodrama or maudlin in the s seem daring and edgy and right for the same sort of audience today the harrowing single and video from "wagonmaster" is "committed to parkview " written by johnny cash and first recommended by him for porter in by which time both sometimes troubled men had in fact been committed at different points to the nashville psychiatric hospital portrayed mr wagoner has been writing more than a few new songs in that vein himself lately "it gets some of the things out of my system that i have in there " he says with a laugh dark tinge be damned messrs wagoner and stuart share a bright flamboyance in performance style and a love of the flashy stage suits designed by nudie cohen and his successor manuel as the "wagonmaster" cd was released mr stuarts deep private collection of country memorabilia including some of the historic stage gear worn by porter rose maddox the staple singers and carl perkins was being put on display in "sparkle and twang marty stuarts american musical odyssey " an extraordinary exhibition at nashvilles tennessee state museum it runs free of charge through nov stunning previously unseen artifacts jimmie rodgerss satchel comic notes from johnny cash elviss sweater patsy clines traveling case a carter family report card mingle with handwritten song lyrics and letters from everyone from hank williams to bob dylan historic musical instruments and an array of martys celebrated portrait photography the exhibition like his new career spanning duets cd "compadres" is essentially organized around mr stuarts own musical life a childhood in philadelphia miss where he was exposed to hillbilly african american and choctaw culture a stint playing bluegrass mandolin with lester flatt at age time in cashs band and his chart topping years as a hillbilly rocker mr stuarts mission to gather and preserve these now priceless artifacts began when they were often greatly undervalued and found abandoned in second hand stores and pawn shops "i started to see that as a cultural sin " mr stuart noted as we watched some of the last items being put into place before the exhibits opening "i thought maybe the world doesnt know about country music as a living breathing art form and culture right now but porter wagoners boots are just as important as the whos costumes people have preserved johnny cashs set list is just as important as john lennons lyrics " marty stuart like his musical partner porter wagoner is interested these days not just in preservation of the old sounds the old visuals from places hes been but in bringing them back in shape good to go for another round his effort appears to be working mr mazor writes about country and pop music for the
