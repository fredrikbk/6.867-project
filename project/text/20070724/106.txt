transocean merger deal may spur more tie ups shortage of rigs lifts drillers profit to record levels the planned &# billion combination of transocean inc and globalsantafe corp the worlds two biggest offshore drilling contractors by market value could herald more consolidation in a sector where a shortage of deepwater oil rigs has boosted drillers profits to record levels the deal comes as soaring crude oil prices have triggered a stampede for the last reserves many of which are buried far from the shoreline and deep below the ocean floor that has caused unprecedented demand for deepwater rigs and a bonanza for companies like transocean which operates the worlds largest deepwater drilling fleet some contractors have been able to lease out units for more than &# a day and that in turn has sent the companies stock prices soaring in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday transoceans shares were up &# at &# while globalsantafes price rose &# to &# transoceans shares currently trade at times historical per share earnings richer than globalsantafes price earnings ratio of the sector has long been rife with speculation about imminent deals but as earnings grew so did share prices making most potential acquisitions too expensive last year seadrill ltd a bermuda based drilling contractor held tie up talks with three u s drillers noble corp ensco international inc and globalsantafe but walked away when valuations grew too high it was also reported that transocean had looked to acquire seadrill earlier this year the transocean globalsantafe deal comes at a time when parts of the oil services sector seem to be breaking out of the boom bust cycle that has dogged it for decades investors had previously disdained such a volatile industry in earlier oil booms drillers would tend to order too many rigs and then get killed by excess capacity if prices fell and demand leveled off but that might be changing drillers are typically leasing out rigs on much longer term contracts than before sometimes for as long as five years compared with two to three years before the current boom "i have oil companies that are coming to us and saying please help us with a rig in were going to lose the license because we cant drill " says tor olav troim vice chairman of seadrill some of seadrills rigs still under construction are booked through particularly in

to ods petrodata an energy analysis provider whats more the trend toward offshore activity shows no sign of abating and that could push drillers share prices higher deepwater exploration in the gulf of mexico and off the coasts of west africa australia and brazil has yielded large finds in recent years that has made the drillers a hot ticket for investors transoceans shares have risen since early january as a group the offshore drilling contractors are in an extraordinary financial position their debt is minuscule and they have record work backlogs generating dependable cash flow for the next couple of years the major hurdle currently facing these offshore drillers how to expand their fleet speculators are building more than a dozen new deepwater rigs acquiring these rigs means paying steep prices but building their own means companies risk oversupplying the market the potential merger could deflate the price tags for these rigs transocean and globalsantafe sent a clear signal yesterday that cash flow would be used to pay down debt rather than buy equipment this could help push down asking prices and spur further consolidation says matthew conlan an oil field services analyst with weeden &amp co mr conlan has "buy" recommendations on transocean and globalsantafe he doesnt own shares in either company and weeden hasnt provided investment banking services to the

driller analysts said the structure of the combination could lead to more merger and acquisition activity in the sector pointing the way for small drilling companies to get a slice of the lucrative ultradeep water market without having to resort to expensive acquisitions noble pride international rowan diamond offshore drilling inc and ensco all are likely candidates in any wave of consolidation
