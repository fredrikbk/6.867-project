hopper in a new light well up to a point edward hopper museum of fine arts through aug the show then travels to washington d c sept jan and chicago feb may boston edward hoppers repertory of images has taken such firm hold in the realm of cliche that a fresh response feels nearly impossible the deserted cityscapes the new england lighthouses under the eternal cirrus clouds the usherettes at the movies the nudes on their beds the chalk faced career girls awaiting chop suey those "nighthawks" at the all night diner when the curators carol troyen of the museum of fine arts franklin kelly of the national gallery of art washington and judith a barter of the art institute of chicago floated their proposal for the first major hopper blockbuster in more than a quarter century the initial response was in effect why bother between calendars greeting cards spoofs and tips of the hat notably in the movies hopper has hardly suffered from underexposure nevertheless hoppers three champions got their wish their retrospective is now on view in boston through aug with stops in prospect in washington and chicago the challenge for the organizers of course was to make him new does it happen yes to a point hopper was born in nyack on the hudson river in he died at his studio in washington square new york in in his time commentators placed him in the by then far from progressive tradition of american realism following in the footsteps of winslow homer and thomas eakins a fellow in his way of such contemporaries as rockwell kent george bellows and indeed norman rockwell yet a wall text in the opening gallery sets the tone for the show with a quasi transcendentalist confession "all i really want to do is paint light on the side of a house " the perhaps equally germane first half of the statement "i guess im not very human" does not appear as a pictorial curtain raiser there is "hodgkins house" which captures with loving devotion the steep sunshine of a massachusetts summer as it washes the white clapboard other than that hoppers performance here is on a par with that of hundreds of sunday painters the only other canvas in the orientation gallery is a noncommittal self portrait of the artist in a brown fedora it took him an unaccountable five years to complete from to hoppers training began in his late teens when he enrolled in the correspondence school of illustrating between and he visited europe three times and fell in love with paris he never crossed the atlantic again in he moved to washington square his last home by age he had sold a single painting until then commercial illustrating which he hated was his bread and butter though printmaking had won him a measure of critical respect the turning point in his career came in with the brooklyn museums purchase of the watercolor "mansard roof" price &# he married in henceforth his wife josephine nivison a painter known to all as jo would be his principal if not his only model he worked slowly and when inspiration flagged he would go to the movies for days a quiet encapsulated rather boring life one might say and the lives hopper gazes upon through the open windows in his paintings seem as devoid of excitement as his own in the rare instances when the faces or body language of hoppers figures betray an inner life at all what registers is a numb aimlessness in a video that runs nonstop in the gallery the pop artist red grooms speaks of hopper in the same breath as both "sparse" and "thrilling " an anonymous narrator is closer to the mark when he says that hopper "lacked the dynamism" of eakins and homer a strange sort of endorsement ms troyen suggests that hopper "evokes" rather than "narrates " which may invest him with greater mystery than he possesses yet there are surprises most strikingly in the prints which simmer with anecdote or crackle with drama "night on the el train" records a furtive love affair on the rails it both narrates and evokes no problem "american landscape" makes a sort of comedy of cows laboriously crossing railroad track shades of mark tansey "night shadow" an overhead shot of a lone man striding past a grim office tower is pure film noir the summery watercolors of towns and landscapes in coastal new england often painted over graphite can be remarkably ambitious in the handling of light shadow tone and surface and who would have expected hoppers sensitivity to the grain of the paper in the oils one may be caught off guard by glancing references to masters old and new sometimes in the same painting a woman at the window of her top story apartment in "house at dusk" tucked into the composition like a figure in an advent calendar might be a postage stamp homage to vermeer the streetlamp burning in the afterglow of day is pure magritte out of nowhere "ground swell" channels the boys of abercrombie &amp fitch even as it freezes summer seas and sky to marble here and there hopper betrays an affinity for the pinup the secretary at her filing cabinet ogling her oblivious straight arrow of a boss at his desk in "office at night" is a vintage esquire cartoon awaiting its caption then there are the jokes that require no captions "drug store" prominently advertising prescription drugs and ex lax or "night windows" with its peek a boo glimpse of a pink slipped derriere all the same hoppers limitations are hard to overlook perspective remains an on and off affair eyes of a matron on cape cod of her collie of a swell at the theater defeat him he was forever painting windows yet seldom deigned to paint the window pane as for that pet theme of his sunlight on the side of a house there he was in his element and at the tail end of his life rather miraculously he brought the light indoors "sun in an empty room" is exactly that and something more american realism dissolving into space and light edging its way toward abstraction but that will never be what hopper is remembered for it has been said that he made poetry of the commonplace which makes him sound sentimental which is false on the emotional scale his needle hovers invariably at the midpoint between the poles of sentimentality as in rockwell and sensationalism as in bellows which is to say it registers nothing at all his genius most accurately may have been to lend evanescence a kind of gravity emptiness a certain weight concurrent with "edward hopper" in boston the newark museum has mounted the focus show "at the movies edward hoppers the sheridan theatre " supplying rich visual and documentary context for the small but formally audacious masterpiece from the collection through aug for new yorkers its an afternoons excursion well worth the trip mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
