new opposition arises to dow jones deal key bancroft trustee who was on the fence is against murdoch boston members of the bancroft family gathered at a hotel here yesterday to consider whether to end their more than century long stewardship of wall street journal publisher dow jones &amp co and sell the company to rupert murdochs news corp the outcome of the familys deliberations remains difficult to predict but yesterday one key family member who had been ambivalent about the sale to mr murdoch told her relatives she was staunchly opposed people familiar with the matter said jane macelree a family trustee who votes shares totaling about of dow joness total shareholder power made it clear to the family she was in the anti murdoch camp people familiar said ms macelree a member of the cox branch is one of the most senior bancrofts and has been viewed as a swing vote her decision could put her at odds with some of her seven children who support the deal the meeting which started after lunch lasted several hours and included a series of presentations by family bankers trustees and dow jones board members bankers and lawyers reviewed the pros and cons of mr murdochs offer according to participants their conclusion was clear while they viewed the offer as a substantial one that would give dow jones much needed resources to expand they acknowledged that it would be difficult to guarantee that the wall street journals editorial independence would survive a sale even under the guidelines agreed to by dow joness board and news corp "it might be better financially but i wouldnt say its everybodys favorite option " one participant said "its the same old story " the family which has about three dozen adult members broke away after the presentation to deliberate in private family members some of whom called in by telephone will be given several days to cast their votes on the deal and it could be next week before the results of the poll are known christopher bancroft who serves both as a family trustee and dow jones board member emerged from the meeting shortly before p m wearing a baseball cap embroidered with a picture of fishing lure and the line "bite me " he said it was still undecided whether the family would support the bid "some people are for and some people are against " he said "everyone has to decide for himself i want the best possible outcome for dow jones " the bancrofts control about of dow joness voting power but mr murdoch would likely only need about half their shares to acquire the company most of the remaining shareholders are eager to accept the &# billion offer which represents a premium over where the shares were trading before the bid a throng of reporters photographers and camera crews awaited family members as they arrived at a hilton hotel in bostons financial district family members greeted each other and gathered with their advisers in a conference room that was cordoned off from the media attendees were told to ask for "a family meeting" and were directed to the conference room in an apparent effort by the family to throw reporters off the scent people asking for the bancrofts or dow jones were told the meeting was in a different hotel yesterdays gathering capped three tumultuous months since mr murdoch made his &# a share offer in a letter to dow joness board family members have agonized over whether to sell to the controversial media tycoon at first refusing to entertain the offer and then reversing course divisions within the far flung family have served to further muddy the process only one of the familys three main branches the cooks appeared to be solidly behind the offer that could prove crucial because the cooks have the largest share of any branch of the companys total voting power if as expected some smaller trusts also vote in favor mr murdoch may have enough support to acquire the company in recent weeks opposition to the deal has crystallized in some quarters two of the three family directors of dow jones have been actively working against a deal with mr murdoch one independent director dieter von holtzbrinck resigned in protest dow joness shares have drifted and were down cents to &# yesterday in p m new york stock exchange composite trading during a board discussion last week even most of the directors who voted to endorse a deal with news corp voiced sympathy for the familys difficult position according to people familiar with the matter in a round of calls dow jones chief executive richard f zannino made to other directors before the meeting to gauge the vote several directors said they were emotionally opposed to a deal but agreed that as independent directors they couldnt ignore its compelling financial advantage to shareholders these people said michael elefante the familys lead trustee and a member of dow joness board led the meeting yesterday representatives from merrill lynch &amp co the familys investment bank and wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz its legal adviser gave a rundown of the companys efforts to find alternatives to mr murdoch and argued that those alternatives are inferior to news corp s offer m peter mcpherson dow joness board chairman and lewis b campbell ceo of textron inc and the chair of the companys governance committee also made presentations the three family directors ms steele leslie hill and mr bancroft gave their own presentations merrill lynch bankers said at the meeting that they could not come up with any scenario other than the news corp offer for getting the companys stock price to &# per share in the short to midterm people familiar with the matter said but the bankers didnt give advice on whether to sell the company growing family discomfort has nonetheless thrown increasing doubt over the final outcome of the situation one person at the meeting said that more doubts about a news corp deal were apparent at the end of the session than at the beginning such discomfort however might be helpful to the negotiating stance of a pair of denver based trustees these trustees who control of the voting stakes argued forcefully in the meeting for seeking a higher price for the family specially traded b shares so far it is unclear how they will vote but they are asking for a to increase in the bid should the denver trusts come out in favor of the transaction that may be enough to carry the day for mr murdoch but as of now the family appears in relatively the same state of paralysis that has gripped them throughout the ordeal that may force mr murdoch to put down "an exploding offer" that would expire on a set date to force the family to make a decision according to people familiar with the matter mr bancroft has spent the past several weeks trying to raise money to buy out other family members and block a deal according to people familiar with the matter ms hill has also been urging the familys advisers to aggressively explore alternatives to mr murdoch she helped gain an audience for internet entrepreneur brad greenspan who has written an open letter to shareholders proposing to borrow money to buy up half of dow joness shares outstanding and offering a &# million to &# million cash injection to bancroft family members such as mr bancroft who want to buy out other family members both ms hill and mr bancroft have hired their own lawyers each has been in contact with mr greenspan who has said "there is definitely strong interest" in his plan among several family members he has declined to be more specific in addition to the wall street journal and its international and online editions dow jones publishes barrons and smartmoney magazines marketwatch dowjones newswires dow jones indexes and the ottaway group of community newspapers
