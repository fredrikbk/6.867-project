politics &amp economics pelosi cultivates her own style in building support for farm bill speaker pursues rural urban alliance washington more armani than carhartt speaker nancy pelosi brings her style of coalition politics to the house farm bill debate this week as she tries to balance the need for change in federal agricultural programs with the democrats dream of reviving the partys historic urban rural alliances its a goal the san francisco liberal has pursued since the early s when as chair of the state party she traveled californias back roads with her children in tow working to bridge the political gap between rural inland and more urban coastal interests in as house democratic leader she created a working group to address rural concerns and last winter ms pelosi became the first house speaker in decades to address the national farmers union convention where she promised the disaster aid delivered this spring the five year farm bill now before the house is a greater challenge since the choices can be painful and make it harder to hold different factions in her caucus the same sort of change versus status quo trade offs are repeated in continuing negotiations over energy legislation and auto fuel standards and as ms pelosi weighs her options she reveals more of her leadership style in the case of the farm bill freshmen democrats elected from rural districts last year need some assurance that loan and subsidy programs important to their farmers will survive but to move a bill forward with urban support also demands cuts from some programs and new payment limits which can upset powerful commodity groups to placate those demanding more reform a democratic political memo last month predicted that rural america will be a major battleground next year as the iraq war continues to pull down president bushs poll numbers but the landscape has also changed dramatically since the s and s when the legendary rep phillip burton a california democrat who held ms pelosis seat at the time walked the house floor trading with cotton and peanut interests in order to get the votes for food stamp and health benefits important to the partys urban labor agenda in the house today there are fewer of the rural southern democrats who helped mr burton in the midwest farmers have left the land giving way to development new budget rules restrict federal spending the biofuels explosion is driving up land prices and altering rural economies and a once fledgling "agriculture reform" movement powered by public interest activists such as the environmental working group has gained strength demanding crop subsidy cuts to navigate these hurdles ms pelosi has allied with house agriculture committee chairman collin peterson pressing him to be more open in his bill to changes in federal farm programs but also promising to support him against amendments on the house floor mr peterson from a huge minnesota district of wheat sugar beet and poultry farms is very much part of the agriculture subsidy establishment nevertheless the package his committee approved last week would tighten subsidy limits and require more transparency making it harder to hide payments to multiple entities fruit and vegetable growers often ignored in past farm bills get more aid cotton and crop insurance interests face cuts small ranchers won rules requiring country of origin meat labeling and all farmers would be able to try out new "revenue protection" programs to safeguard against low crop yields as well as poor markets "peterson made some surprising moves" in the bill an administration official said the chairman credits ms pelosi for giving him the support needed to make change "she has been our greatest ally trusting us backing us " mr peterson said "she was sending us a message that we needed reform we know that " many activists argue the bill still falls short despite high corn prices those growers would get billions in annual subsidies at a time ms pelosi has asked tax writers to come up with &# billion in new revenue to meet house budget targets "i am personally a longtime fan of nancy pelosi " says environmental working group president ken cook "but at every turn all the decisions were given to the subsidy lobby this is an unwelcome surprise that she has put her fingers on the scale so heavily " philosophically ms pelosi is much closer to those who want more change but on the farm and energy bills she has proven to be more pragmatic than many expected there is a fierce often religious based idealism about her "seventeen centuries ago st augustine said any government that is not formed to promote justice is a bunch of thieves " she says "in order to do the job you have to have a belief its what drives your engine what you keep coming back to " but she also sees herself as an executive who must make decisions or watch her options disappear impatient with the drift of a party meeting on the iraq war she began going around the room asking members to say where they stood "when you become an executive you must be intuitive you must act " she says "if you wait your options diminish " decisions also mean this first ever woman speaker must rein in the houses old bulls who were her superiors when she was a junior member "its a new order " she says "i dont think how can i ask david house appropriations committee chairman obey to do this when he was my chairman i dont think that at all im the speaker " nonetheless it isnt easy as seen in the protracted public sparring between her office and house energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell d mich an outspoken auto industry ally in the fight over fuel efficiency standards "were doing fine " ms pelosi insists moments later she lets out a laugh that is part yelp "its a rough place ill tell you that " she says "washington is a challenging place to move because there are vested interests that will fight the fight but at the end well make the change " coalitions arent just building blocks toward power she insists but a way to teach different elements of her caucus to listen to one another her model isnt the famously bullish mr burton "a big humma humma" she says but rather her father a quieter figure who served in the house before becoming mayor of baltimore when she came to congress he gave her some things that had been in his house office including a stone figure of a coal miner early in her career the figure caught the eye of rep john murtha from pennsylvania coal country the strong friendship that grew from that chance meeting helped make her speaker "jack murtha saw this coal miner carved out of stone and said what is that i said it was about understanding we have national responsibilities and the coalition building you have to do " new crops rep nancy pelosi is trying to balance various demands in a house farm bill major provisions include extending target price and loan subsidy programs helping farmers protect themselves against low yields and poor markets barring crop subsidies or conservation payments to individuals with adjusted gross income of more than &# million a year providing more money to strengthen specialty crops requiring country of origin labeling of meat products increasing funding for nutrition programs and renewable energy research
