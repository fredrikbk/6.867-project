the stepford staff or how it happens that a boss is cloned there are two ways clones are propagated in a company managers hire versions of themselves signaling to everyone the value of aping the boss and staffers take it upon themselves to ape the boss peter ireland has seen both he thinks he lost out on a job he sought because he failed a sports quiz the boss was a jock and liked to discuss sports with clients and thus the quiz asking mr ireland for example what team won the super bowl last year but he has also felt the tug of conformity twenty years ago when he worked at a consulting firm headed by a brit who commuted in a rolls royce he acquired a taste for tweed jackets he even tried unsuccessfully to import an old english taxi cab "to have something uniquely british to show off " he says at least he didnt join the local yacht club or take up tennis the way some of his colleagues did "you wanted to be like the boss " he says "by the end of the first year everybody had the same look " any number of reasons can account for an outbreak of two legged facsimiles in the office employees may remake themselves out of ambition survival or a tribal will to belong managers may hire in their own likeness out of comfort fear of differences or maybe because brimming with narcissism theyd like to spend twice the time with themselves but often whats alike in both manager and staffers is a cluelessness about the ingredients for success in other words if youre not sure what propelled someone to the executive suite you might as well also dump carbs lease a lexus and pretend to listen too just in case any of those things had something to do with it "because bosses are very bad at articulating exactly what it takes to be successful people below them are left guessing " says jennifer chatman professor of management at uc berkeleys haas school of business who has conducted research on recruiting and ingratiation bosses and staffers "assume theres a cause and effect relationship between completely irrelevant behavior " yet managers or anyone recruiting are often the last to recognize the irrelevant behavior prof chatmans research shows theres no limit to the "suck up till you die" approach to authority that means flattery including its sincerest form is lapped up by bosses who view it as a sign theyve successfully influenced their people that may explain why "people who have no interest at all in golf or in walking around a pollen field of a golf course in the springtime take up golf " says executive search consultant patricia cook who estimates that as many as of executives look for a version of themselves when hiring she recalls one executive who hired a dead ringer who even had the same first name "he was looking for his son and he found him " she says when she ultimately remarked on the likeness the executive responded "it never occurred to me " richard noxon a retired accountant joined a pandemic obsession for golf spread by a former boss he ended up winning a trophy at a company tournament for the worst score "it probably did worse for my career than if i didnt play at all " he says stuart creque worked for one high tech firm in which a managers right hand man started smoking a pipe four wheeling in jeeps and sporting a beard one could hold it against the copycat except his success depended on the approval of his manager "the more the subordinate bought into the bosss way of doing things the more he was praised and rewarded " says mr creque "everybody else wasnt happy about the fact that this clone got promoted over other guys who were capable and had more experience " robert cialdini professor of psychology at arizona state university believes its legitimate to let skills take a back seat when hiring he says values trump skills because peoples values dont change after their late s the problem is when managers mistake simple taste for real values "if theyre recruiting on the basis of similarities of baseball teams hairstyles or latte taste " he says "thats going to be a mistake " dentist marc lowenberg learned that you have to be careful what you ask for he worked hard to find junior dentists he saw as having the same warm chairside manner he possesses at first they all started enjoying playing tennis together but then he noticed that they started sounding alike which dr lowenberg admits now creeps him out "its mortifying when we show up at work and two of us are wearing the same color sweater " says the dentist the good news adds their office manager yvonne miranda "its easy to buy them gifts " sometimes thankfully a boss will nip personality plagiarism in the bud teresa habitan a government fiscal policy maker has an employee with the annoying tendency of talking like her to the point where her own family members often cant tell them apart when they call ms habitan had to warn her employee when she started to address a close colleague in the same friendly manner she did she told her to keep it professional which was another way of saying "one of me is enough thank you " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns
