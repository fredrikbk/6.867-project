cheese headcases when louis brandeis praised the states as "laboratories of democracy " he didnt claim that every policy experiment would work so we hope the eyes of america will turn to wisconsin and the effort by madison democrats to make that "progressive" state a petri dish for government run health care this exercise is especially instructive because it reveals where the "single payer " universal coverage folks end up democrats who run the wisconsin senate have dropped the washington pretense of incremental health care reform and moved directly to passing a plan to insure every resident under the age of in the state and wow is "free" health care expensive the plan would cost an estimated &# billion or &# billion more than the state currently collects in all income sales and corporate income taxes it represents an average of &# a month in higher taxes for every wisconsin worker employees and businesses would pay for the plan by sharing the cost of a new employment tax on wages wisconsin businesses would have to compete with out of state businesses and foreign rivals while shouldering a combined federal state payroll tax nearly double the payroll tax paid by non wisconsin firms for social security and medicare combined this employment tax is on top of the &# billion grab bag of other levies that democratic governor jim doyle proposed and the tax happy senate has also approved including a &# a pack increase in the cigarette tax a hike in the corporate tax and new fees on cars trucks hospitals real estate transactions oil companies and dry cleaners in all the tax burden in the badger state could rise to of family income which is slightly more than the average federal tax burden "at least federal taxes pay for an army and navy " quips r j pirlot of the wisconsin manufacturers and commerce business lobby as if thats not enough the health plan includes a tax escalator clause allowing an additional percentage point payroll tax to finance higher outlays in the future this could bring the payroll tax to one reason to expect costs to soar is that the state may become a mecca for the unemployed uninsured and sick from all over north america the legislation doesnt require that you have a job in wisconsin to qualify merely that you live in the state for at least months cheesehead nation could expect to attract health care free riders while losing productive workers who leave for less taxing climes proponents use the familiar argument for national health care that this will save money about &# billion a year through efficiency gains by eliminating the administrative costs of private insurance and unions and some big businesses with rich union health plans are only too happy to dump these liabilities onto the government but those costs wont vanish theyll merely shift to all taxpayers and businesses small employers that cant afford to provide insurance would see their employment costs rise by thousands of dollars per worker while those that now provide a basic health insurance plan would have to pay &# to &# a year more per employee the plan is also openly hostile to market incentives that contain costs private companies are making modest progress in sweating out health care inflation by making patients more cost conscious through increased copayments health savings accounts and incentives for wellness the wisconsin program moves in the opposite direction it reduces out of pocket copayments bars money saving hsa plans and increases the number of mandated medical services covered under the plan so where will savings come from where they always do in any government plan rationing via price controls and as costs rise waiting periods and coverage restrictions this is michael moores medical dream state the last line of defense against this plan are the republicans who run the wisconsin house so far theyve been unified and they recently voted the senate plan down democrats are now planning to take their ideas to the voters in legislative races next year and thats a debate wisconsinites should look forward to at least wisconsin democrats are admitting how much it will cost americans to pay for government run health care would that washington democrats were as forthright see related letter "letters to the editor healthy wisconsin cheesed over editorial remarks" wsj aug
