the finale is magical even for muggles harry potter and the deathly hallows by j k rowling scholastic pages &# given the fever of anticipation and the drama of a sales embargo broken at last at on saturday morning the wait for "harry potter and the deathly hallows" felt endless even if the waiting ordeal really lasted only a matter of months but the big questions about this culminating piece of j k rowlings imaginary world have been bubbling for years among the most pressing would harry finally conquer evil lord voldemort or would it be the other way around what would befall harrys closest friends red headed ron and smarty pants hermione would they die or kiss or both and was severus snape really a death eating baddie all along or did he and the apparently saintly albus dumbledore whom he murdered at the end of book six have a secret understanding more important than such undoubtedly absorbing narrative points was this would j k rowling be able to pull it off the previous six books have been building in sophistication toward a full explication of the authors magical world a final veil ripping that would not merely tell us what ultimately happens to the characters but who those characters really were and in what ethical framework they were operating all along the answer with a friendly well talk about it later nod to the critics who doubt the literary merits of the series is that ms rowling does indeed pull it off and beautifully hints and clues and partly developed plot lines from the preceding books come together in "deathly hallows" so successfully that it is clear as fans hoped that ms rowling always knew where harrys story would end she has said that the idea of the harry potter epic simply fell into her head one day "harry potter and the deathly hallows" confirms how amazingly complete her vision was in "deathly hallows " ms rowling finally liberates her characters from the strict school year calendar that constrained the action in the earlier books the tale begins as usual with harry at home with the lumpen dursleys who grudgingly took him in after voldemort killed his parents but this time the action does not immediately shift to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry nor is there any waiting until the end of the academic year for things to get hot here the story opens on the cusp of harrys birthday as members of the order of the phoenix attempt to convey him to safety before he turns and loses certain magical protections lord voldemort and his death eaters meanwhile are in terrible ascendancy theyre controlling the ministry of magic hunting down members of the order and slaughtering muggles non magical people at will and for fun it is a dreadful new wizard order and soon harry ron and hermione are on the run as they desperately seek to evade voldemorts forces while finding and destroying the tiny pieces of the dark lords soul that he has secreted in objects called horcruxes every reader and harry too knows that events must end with the death of either the boy wizard or his snaky red eyed nemesis there can be no survival for the both of them this ominous understanding has been building in faithful readers for a decade and makes the final quarter of the book a heart stopper it has been widely observed that j k rowling owes a creative debt to christian fantasists j r r tolkien and c s lewis apart from their fondness for initials its odd now to remember that at the same time some parents have objected to the magic depicted in the harry potter books as a glorification of satanic practices for "harry potter and the deathly hallows" confirms something else apart from the well thought out ness of ms rowlings moral universe it is subtly but unmistakably christian the principal hogwarts holidays have always been christmas and easter but it took five books before ms rowling really began tipping her hand in book six "harry potter and the half blood prince " she addressed concepts of free will the power of love and the sanctity of the soul but in the final volume she gently lays it all out the preciousness of each human life bodily resurrection after death mercy forgiveness and redemption sacrificial love overcoming the powers of evil strip away the elves goblins broomsticks and magic wands and these are the concepts that underpin the marvelously intricate world of harry potter there are clues throughout at one point harry is led to a weapon that will enable him to destroy the horcruxes when he finds them "the ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misty gray carapace something else glinted a great silver cross " two unattributed new testament quotations recur in the story after harry sees each on a tombstone in the village where he was born and his mother and father died he discovers on the dumbledore family tomb "where your treasure is there will your heart be also " from i corinthians and on the grave of his own parents he finds this from matthew "the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death " on seeing it harry feels momentary horror does it imply a link between his parents and voldemorts followers hermione gently sets him straight "it doesnt mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry it means you know living beyond death living after death " and it goes on near the end harry visits the hereafter where he sees joy coming to those who in life were merciful and agony meted out to those who were cruel and remorseless "tell me one last thing " harry says to dumbledore whom he has met in the white mistiness "is this real or has this been happening inside my head " dumbledore beams at him "of course its happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean that its not real " many readers may not even notice these intimations of christian spirituality theres nothing finger pointingly didactic here the story is too well made to insist on anything so obvious as a proselytizing message the same is famously true of lewis and tolkien we have in "harry potter and the deathly hallows" skillfully plotted drama entertaining characters in a fantastically imagined world and a moral contest that would not be out of place in aeschylus or for that matter philip pullman what about the literary achievement snobs complain that the rowling books do not approach the lasting greatness of true childrens classics and with reason the exposition can be clunky the plot pace clogged with complicated revelations and yes harry can be a rather wooden and unappealing boy its also true that from now on no reader will experience the suspense of an ending unknown to all but not everything has to be a classic to be celebrated in some alchemical way we have all participated in an amazing cultural moment a character and a drama playing out in a series of books and not on a movie or tv screen have come to matter intensely to millions of people most of them young but not all some things are brilliant just as they are even if its just for now mrs gurdon reviews childrens books for the journal correction the source texts of two biblical passages alluded to in "harry potter and the deathly hallows" were reversed in a review "the finale is magical even for muggles " july "where your treasure is there will your heart be also" is from matthew "the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" is from corinthians wsj july
