eyes on the road honda cr v redefines suv landscape deb nison is a data warehouse developer in portland ore who likes to go snowboarding on nearby mount hood once upon a time she drove a chevy trailblazer and later a subaru forester today she owns a honda cr v "i like the way it handles " she says she appreciates feeling "ridiculously safe" in a vehicle with standard head protecting airbags and for an suv she says it gets "decent mileage" about miles per gallon around town so far ms nison is just one reason why the honda cr v is as of june americas best selling sport utility vehicle the cr vs rise and the parallel collapse in demand for "real" suvs like the trailblazer and the one time king of suvs the ford explorer reveal a lot about why the american auto industry is in the shape its in right now ten years ago a mere two product generations in auto industry terms america was suv nation suv meant a tough looking box perched on a heavy steel ladder frame borrowed from a pickup truck no vehicle did a better job capturing the appeal of this formula than the ford explorer in ford motor co sold more than explorers three years later ford sold more than explorers its not a coincidence that ford earned record profits during this period the explorer was a perfect automotive money making machine a high volume model that sold at premium prices if henry ford or alfred p sloan the architect of general motors corp s rise to power had been alive in they would have understood the explorers business model immediately and approved of course it helped a lot that the late s were an era of ultra cheap gas todays v powered explorer is rated miles per gallon city mpg highway not bad for a truck that weighs more than pounds perhaps but not good in any absolute way but at &# or so a gallon during the heady days of the dot com boom a lot of american families could afford to take a "what me worry " attitude toward gasoline prices the explorers combination of a tall in the saddle ride "go anywhere" four wheel drive capability and rugged looks became a suburban status symbol but even as the explorer was enjoying its peak years honda motor co began offering something new the honda cr v launched in looked like an suv that had taken a wrong turn on to the set of "honey i shrunk the kids " it had the boxy profile of an suv rear cargo space and all wheel drive but it was more than pounds lighter and smaller in every dimension than explorer underneath the cr v was built like a compact front wheel drive honda civic there was no heavy duty ladder frame which meant it couldnt tow very much in the late s the cr v sold modestly compared with the explorer in honda sold just shy of by sales had risen to just over in other words barely half of one explorer assembly plants annual production from the peak of more than explorers sold in explorer sales have fallen by nearly through the end of by the end of ford may be lucky to sell much more than explorers the capacity of just one shift of production at one assembly plant gms rival mid size traditional suvs are in the same downward spiral within a few years its probable that neither ford nor gm will even sell a body on frame mid sized suv theres more to this than just &# a gallon gasoline consider how the cr v has redefined success its the best selling suv in america but through the first half of this year honda has sold only about by the end of the year cr v sales might top but probably not by much in other words no in the suv segment today means selling fewer than half as many vehicles as ford did when the explorer was no a decade ago whats the lesson the detroit auto makers already know the demise of the explorer doesnt mean americans dont want to drive vehicles with all wheel drive lots of cargo space and a tall drivers seating position a large segment of the public wants all that just with better handling more safety technology and better fuel economy thats why even as the explorer fades away ford and gm and chrysler are rushing out more vehicles to compete with the cr v and its larger brother the honda pilot and enjoying success fords total "crossover" sales are up in june even as overall ford sales fell an internal ford tally finds that ford including its european luxury brands is the leading seller of crossover vehicles in the u s with gm close behind ford in fact has a shot at wrestling back the no suv in america title from the cr v if it can continue to boost demand for its recently redesigned escape send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
