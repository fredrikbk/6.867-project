at root of economic inequality theres more than just income gap brink lindsey attributes economic inequality to a "lack of elementary self discipline" in americas underclass "the culture gap " editorial page july and argues that our nations schools are contributing to the problem his shocking lack of empathy for the poor is not really shocking at all very few middle or upper income americans know what it is like to live in true poverty with all its encumbrances i would like to put a face on the people he is talking about imagine you or one of your own children are born into a "family" where the adults who are supposed to protect you belittle you and beat you on a regular basis you experience hunger even as a toddler you babysit yourself beginning as early as four years of age for up to hours per day you are surrounded by filth ignorance drug abuse alcoholism disease and violence you watch your siblings suffer the same torture and by your early teens you are filled with shame and rage emotionally crippled children cannot be fixed in the public schools they enter there are many studies that firmly link early childhood neglect and abuse to antisocial behavior behavior for which society as a whole pays a steep price a little investment now could pay huge dividends later in terms of reduced subsidies to the poor fewer demands on the judicial system and reduced costs to medicare and medicaid providing girls with meaningful incentives to delay childbearing until age or would likely reduce poverty in the long run and perhaps even in the next generation or two given all the facts i believe a majority of americans would support policies that would make this happen mr lindsey would do well to open his heart his impressive intellect and some of his institutions considerable resources to that end jessica cannon m d wilmington n c i would like to point out to mr lindsey that the median annual income in was &# which would be &# in dollars this means that the annual income of &# that he celebrates reveals not a huge leap forward for most american families but rather a period of prolonged wage stagnation or to put it more neutrally middle class families have roughly the same purchasing power then as now once the figures are adjusted for inflation rebecca rourke rochester n y i spent the last years of my working life as a high school history government teacher in the southern suburbs of sacramento working with a racially and culturally diverse low income student body during my time in the high school classroom i observed that virtually all my students saw college as the way to realize their life dreams and that most of my students did not have the study skills to successfully graduate from high school let alone earn a college degree and that most of their parents did not know what study skills were essential for academic success i noted that as a result of the lack of study skills approximately half of the incoming freshman at my high school did not graduate although most of my colleagues seemed to assume their students knew how to acquire knowledge some lead an underground movement to teach study skills success in school begins at home when support is not available at home the role of education should be to pick up the slack this begins by helping the student acquire study skills since the acquisition of knowledge begins with knowing how to acquire it mr lindsey is correct about the cultural gap and educations neglect of that fact glenn pope ocean shores wash mr lindsey is correct that schools are the critical "public institutions" and correct in his call for more competition among schools makes perfect sense but much more important is another private institution the two parent family too often this lack of stable two parent families is the unacknowledged elephant in the room when social policy is discussed today in particular the fact that most african americans are born out of wedlock accounts for a large part of the racial disparities we see in income education and crime many civil rights activists and politicians prefer to blame just about anything else rather than admit this fact roger clegg president center for equal opportunity falls church va it is unfortunate that mr lindsey concludes his otherwise excellent piece with an attack on educators as a new york city public school teacher who has read and like mr lindsey endorses annette lareaus studies of child rearing differences between social classes i was very surprised to see mr lindsey change course from admonishing the parents and children who exemplify and encourage the "lack of elementary self discipline" he describes to place the blame squarely on teachers it is absurd to believe that teachers who spend approximately minutes with their high school students each day can have as much personal impact on troubled childrens lives as the peers parents and pop culture figures influencing these children nearly every other hour throughout the day james longwell stevens teacher new york city department of education brooklyn n y while i applaud mr lindsey for taking issue with those who are trying to make the income gap into as much a bugaboo as global warming i disagree with his idea that we face a problem because the percentage of college graduates has hardly increased at all over the last decade the truth is that the united states has been saturated with college graduates for more than a decade lots of college graduates now end up taking jobs that dont call for any academic preparation past of the problem of economic inequality is that credential inflation has closed off more and more of the job world to people who only have high school diplomas george c leef vice president for research john w pope center
