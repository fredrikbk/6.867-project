the worlds capital going global qatar in u k play shows its deal thirst where to put &# billion doha qatar this tiny emiratein the middle east is perhaps best known in the west for being home to al jazeera the popular arabic language network soon it may become even better known for its deal making appetite the &# billion approach last week for j sainsbury plc the british supermarket chain by investment funds controlled by the qatari government is the latest signal that persian gulf countries which have an estimated &# trillion in their coffers are starting to flex their muscle governments around the world are seeking higher returns for their foreign exchange reserves it is a shift that could alter global financial markets pushing prices higher for such high yielding assets as stocks corporate bonds and real estate while crimping demand for safe but low yielding treasurys and the dollar nowhere is this clearer than in the cash rich middle east which is benefiting from lofty oil and natural gas prices the qatar investment authority is the youngest of the investment arms of the gulf countries but it is quickly making a name for itself as the most aggressive of its peers both in terms of its style and its goals as the approach to sainsbury demonstrates "if we invest in treasurys and get or inflation will eat it " sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jaber al thani qatars prime minister says in an interview "we need high returns we need to find a way to break through the cycle of the dollar and interest rates we are taking the lead in investing in new instruments " the professionals at qia manage about &# billion although a fraction of the &# billion controlled by neighboring abu dhabi its assets are likely to increase rapidly because qatar has among the worlds largest natural gas reserves every week qia has to find a home for about &# billion a figure which could easily double by according to qia staffers and analysts "qatar has real staying power " adds zubaid ahmad vice chairman of investment banking at j p morgan securities who has focused on some of the middle eastern private equity firms sheikh hamad has ultimate responsibility for qia from palatial offices on the second floor of a marble building he oversees the way qatars mountain of money is deployed he says he is learning from his older "brothers " the kuwait investment authority and the abu dhabi investment authority but is determined to surpass them as the agency that gets the first call whenever top notch alternative investment firms need cash most of the gulf investment authorities allocate their capital to the first rank of private equity funds either megafunds with the best track records such as blackstone group or more specialized firms like providence equity partners by contrast staffers at the qatar investment authority openly declare their desire to be principals and to do deals directly in meetings with top executives at private equity funds qia officials generally make small investments in the funds themselves and ask for huge co investment opportunities qia was one of the gulf funds that approached blackstone about making a minimum &# billion investment in the private equity firms management company according to people familiar with the matter it was also among the largest investors in the listing of fortress investment group llc qatar would like to earn at least annually on its investments such returns though can be hard to come by and the authority runs the risk of appearing to overpay for trophy properties the qataris are part of a group that bought chelsea barracks former home to the famed coldstream guards from britains ministry of defense paying gbp million &# billion for the acre london site or more than triple the expected price it also has a big stake in the canary wharf office development in london and through its real estate arm qatar is also buying property in paris and milan the &# billion auction last fall for thames water a british utility was the first deal in which qia made a splash but it was bested by australias macquarie bank ltd qia staffers say thames water represented a victory showing that qia wasnt willing to pay any price to win analysts say the bid showed qia was a novice at the takeover game and was outmaneuvered qia is less bureaucratic than its peers and can pounce more quickly than the rest still the relative lack of structure and process can be a weakness as well as an advantage every year by law the kuwait investment authority receives a minimum of of the gulf states oil revenue to invest staffers at qia have no such certainty they say they express their wishes then "we invest whatever comes our way " explains one senior staffer there isnt a clear distinction between what is the emirs private wealth and what belongs to the small population of qatar in a sense the emirs family was the predecessor to qia qia has hired u s law firm white &amp case llp to help advise it on best practices for investing the approach to sainsbury points up both sides of the qatari investment style the qataris havent followed the usual private equity playbook qatar doesnt have sector specialists to spearhead investments the team in london responsible for the sainsbury deal known as delta two has more expertise in property than in retailers that may prove a disadvantage as sainsburys core supermarket business needs buttressing and the company is in a battle with a unit of wal mart stores inc for the no supermarket position in britain by sales after tesco plc the qataris havent announced a detailed plan for sainsbury other than to say they plan gbp billion of capital expenditure a figure analysts say the company had committed to spending and to help it expand abroad the qataris also lack the well developed incentive programs for management often proffered by private equity firms such plans can help retain and attract executive talent at the same time the qatari investment arms can live with lower returns than most private equity firms and can accept higher risks without jeopardizing their survival they also could be seen as a safer acquirer because for political or diplomatic reasons they would be more likely to bail out any of their troubled companies "we cant be profit at any cost " says one senior staffer at qia see related article
