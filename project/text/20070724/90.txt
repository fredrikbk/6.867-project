syria occupies lebanon again as of this minute syria occupies at least square miles of lebanese soil that you are now reading about it for the first time is as much a scandal as the occupation itself the news comes by way of a fact finding survey of the lebanese syrian border just produced by the international lebanese committee for u n security council resolution an american ngo that has consultative status with the u n because of the sensitivity of the subject the authors have requested anonymity and have circulated the report only among select government officials and journalists but its findings cannot be ignored in meticulous detail supplemented by photographs satellite images archival material and lebanese military maps predating syrias invasion used as a basis of comparison with syrias current positions the authors describe precisely where and how lebanon has been infiltrated in the area of the village of maarboun for instance the authors observed syrian military checkpoints a mile inside lebanon in the birak al rassass valley they photographed syrian anti aircraft batteries on the outskirts of the village of kossaya they found a heavily fortified camp belonging to the popular front for the liberation of palestine in violation of u n resolutions and lebanese demands this is a story to which i can contribute my own testimony in may i paid a visit to lebanon just a month after syria had announced that it had fully withdrawn its troops from lebanon in compliance with resolution the rumor in beirut was that a company of or so elite syrian soldiers remained encamped within lebanon near the druze village of deir al ashaer i decided to have a look after a long drive over rutted roads i found it or rather what i found was a hillside outpost that i was able to enter without crossing any apparent international border the man in charge was a syrian intelligence officer who "invited" me into a sweltering tent while he phoned his commanders for instruction after a few tense minutes of silence with the soldiers inside the officer reappeared explained that the camp was yards inside syrian territory and ordered me to go from there i went to the village where the mayor insisted the camp was several hundred yards inside lebanon who was right inclined as i was to believe the mayor it was hard to sort out contending claims over remote parcels of land a week later then secretary general kofi annan announced the u n had "verified all syrian military units had withdrawn including from the border area " it seemed that was the end of the story i should have known then that anything "verified" by the u n must be checked at least twice i should have known too that anything to which mr annan devoted his personal attention would inevitably become worse last september mr annan paid a visit to syrian dictator bashar assad after the latter had declared he would treat any attempt by the u n to deploy peacekeepers along the lebanese syrian border as a "hostile act " to defuse the impasse mr annan simply accepted mr assads assurances that syria would police its border and prevent arms smuggling "i think it can happen " said the diplomat at a press conference "it may not be but it will make quite a lot of difference if the government puts in place the measures the government has discussed with me " what happened predictably was the opposite in may fatah al islam a terrorist group whose leadership was imported from damascus attacked lebanese army outposts outside the palestinian refugee camps of nahr el bared and biddawi causing a bloody standoff that continues till this day in june current secretary general ban ki moon issued a report citing numerous instances of arms smuggling from syria to hezbollah and the pflp yesterday hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah boasted that he once again has missiles that can reach tel aviv missiles he could only have obtained via syria israel confirms his claims mr bans report is notable for its clarity and seriousness taken together with the border report it paints an alarming picture though the land grabs are small affairs individually they collectively add up to an area amounting to about of lebanese soil in u s terms the proportional equivalent of arizona of particular note is that the area of syrian conquest dwarves that of the israeli occupied shebaa farms the farms which israel seized from syria in and which amount to an area of about square miles are claimed by hezbollah as belonging to lebanon a useful pretext for it to continue its "resistance" against an israeli occupation that ended seven years ago needless to say hezbollah which purports to fight for lebanese sovereignty makes no similar claims against syria for his part mr assad refuses to agree to a demarcation of his border with lebanon just as he refuses to open an embassy in beirut the ambiguity serves him well he can seize lebanese territory without anyone appearing to take notice supply terrorist camps without quite harboring the terrorists and funnel arms to hezbollah at will all without abandoning the fantasy of "greater syria" encompassing lebanon the golan heights and israel itself it would of course be nice to see the arab world protest this case of illegal occupation given its passions about the subject it would also be nice to see the media report this story as sedulously as it has the controversy of the shebaa farms dont hold your breath on either score in the meantime the only countries in a position to help lebanon are france and the u s they could strike a useful blow by closing their embassies in damascus until such time as damascus opens an embassy with all that it implies in beirut
