spin control copter contract gives lockheed choppy ride added features slow new presidential fleet planning for birds owego n y the official presidential helicopter marine one makes the journey from the white house lawn to nearby andrews air force base in just minutes does the president need state of the art videoconferencing broadband access and other high tech gear to be at his disposal for such short hops that question is at the center of a fight that has boiled into view in recent months over the design and construction of a new fleet of marine one helicopters a navy program to replace todays aging fleet of presidential choppers was accelerated after the terrorist attacks with the white house arguing that extra communications electronics and security gear such as the latest antimissile defenses are necessary to protect the president during an age of terrorism but adding all the bells and whistles has added cost and complication to the prestigious &# billion contract that lockheed martin corp landed in lockheeds bid beat out sikorsky aircraft corp the united technologies corp unit that had made every marine one since the early s yet early delays in the helicopter program eventually gave lockheed the nations biggest defense company a black eye that cost it a much larger chopper contract as soon as lockheed won the contract it was besieged with government requests to add features that would turn the new helicopters into the hovering equivalent of air force one the presidential jumbo jet that means taking a plush executive aircraft and outfitting it with much more electronics and communications gear that offer features from telephone handsets at each seat and bolstered defenses against a nuclear blast the upshot is that lockheed is hard pressed to meet its schedule in a program that illustrates some of the problems that persistently bog down big defense contracts the projects first phase which lockheeds bid said would cost &# billion actually is costing almost &# billion the navy says the marine one saga reflects the difficulties the pentagon often encounters when it tries to marry new technology to existing aircraft and weapons designs david walker the u s comptroller general and head of the congress general accountability office says the defense department often contracts for major projects requiring advanced technology that hasnt yet been developed or tested it then regularly makes so many changes in demands as the projects unfold that costs multiply and delays extend to years richard aboulafia an aerospace analyst at teal group a consulting firm calls the new marine one project "a classic case of mission creep " with all of the added features "its a helicopter being devoured by its own contents " he says he estimates the overall program cost now is approaching &# billion not the &# billion originally thought the navy which oversees the program says it wont have an updated estimate of the total cost until later this year over the past two and a half years the plan for the helicopter grew so overloaded with requests that the navy recently conceded that the chopper must be fundamentally redesigned yet the white house is still in such a hurry to get its hands on the new birds that it will take delivery of the first five in even though they will not have all of the capabilities of later versions the first five marine ones will then be removed from service when redesigned models arrive in "theyre trying to create essentially a flying tank with every known technology to defend it " says anthony cordesman a defense expert at the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank pentagon officials and people involved in the marine one program counter that the commander in chief must be secure and connected at all times "the world had changed on sept " says andrew card the former white house chief of staff "it was critically important that the president be safe and able to communicate in any venue virtually instantaneously " the navy says the current presidential choppers are safe but the new marine ones will be even more capable in the meantime the navy is spending more than &# million to continue to upgrade the existing fleet it was mr card who in the wake of the sept attacks urged the pentagon in to accelerate its plans to replace the aging marine one fleet since dwight eisenhower flew in the first white house helicopter in marine one has been an emblem of the presidency historic images are embedded in the national consciousness such as richard nixon leaving the white house for the last time on aug turning to flash "v" for victory signs as he boarded marine one some of the iconic green and white choppers are now years old and after so much safety equipment and electronics were loaded on in piecemeal fashion that the larger of two models designed for passengers was reduced to carrying the new helicopters will carry up to passengers from the start the new marine one was destined to be one expensive bird meant to be a flying oval office each chopper was originally pegged at about &# million which even adjusted for inflation is more than the government paid in for each of two modified boeing air force ones under fixed price contracts that were more common then boeing co had to eat big cost overruns on the jets though since the government has spent millions of dollars installing broadband and other communications equipment by pentagon standards where weapons development can take decades the marine one program would be a furious sprint to deliver the first helicopters by the only chance of meeting such an ambitious schedule was to adapt an existing helicopter model rather than start from scratch in an upset lockheed beat out sikorsky lockheed hadnt actually built choppers but it had experience integrating electronic systems into them for marine one lockheed proposed a model made by agustawestland an italian british unit of finmeccanica spa about of the helicopters already were in use by several countries armed forces its cabin was bigger than sikorskys and it had three engines to the sikorskys two which lockheed said enhanced safety in case an engine failed lockheed won the contract in january because "our assessment was lockheed could do it with less modification in less time and at less cost than their competitor " says william balderson deputy assistant navy secretary in charge of the marine one program lockheed executives say they were stunned when within days the navy unveiled a long list of white house required top secret equipment that wasnt in the contract and which would add weight and cost most details of marine ones equipment are classified at lockheeds owego plant recently a full scale painted mock up of the helicopters cabin had its window shades drawn and doors locked to prevent visitors from peering inside the only test accessories on view were telephone handsets like those found on airliners with a groove for swiping credit cards whats known is that beyond reclining seats and an executive restroom the new marine one will be armored and wired to the hilt it is to have electronic devices to jam the guidance systems of missiles flares to confuse heat seeking missiles broadband connectivity and encrypted wireless communications to prevent eavesdropping lockheed has built a room resembling a massive acoustic chamber in which each helicopter will be blasted with electromagnetic energy to test operations in a nuclear explosion among other scenarios the ambitious program has faced doubts david duma the pentagons top weapons tester warned congress in that the project was being rushed so much that new helicopters would be delivered without necessary testing potentially jeopardizing the safety of its important passengers last year congress threatened to withhold money unless the navy secretary assured adequate testing the navy and lockheed locked horns over how to get all the work done the navys mr balderson says lockheed initially wasnt fulfilling key specifications such as the crash worthiness of the fuel system the two sides even argued over how to ensure the choppers safety in the event it flew into a flock of birds he says that the initial problems werent related to significant additional requirements but to differing interpretations and more misunderstandings "than we normally have and that caused schedule slides in the first year " lockheed executives bridled at some navy demands for structural reinforcements and additional flight tests it felt were redundant until mid there "was a very difficult pushing back and forth on what you really need and what we can do versus a very time pressured schedule " says jeff bantle lockheeds third marine one program manager who was brought in to smooth relations with the navy lockheed and the navy had to make bigger than anticipated trade offs on the first batch of helicopters in order to reduce weight among other things the choppers initially wont come with devices that deflect engine exhaust a feature to help defend against heat seeking missiles videoconferencing gear has been deferred a harsh navy report on lockheeds early performance cost the company later the air force cited the report as an important factor in its decision not to award lockheed a contract for a search and rescue helicopter lockheed "could not reliably meet important schedule requirements and had difficulty in systems engineering" and coordinating with contractors according to the nonpublic navy assessment which was quoted early this year in a public government accountability office document lockheed says that criticism was "no longer current" because it had overcome the first year challenges of the marine one program it soon became clear that the plan to adapt an "off the shelf" helicopter wouldnt work one reason was that the airframe and engines just couldnt carry all of the required equipment and passengers as far and as fast as the white house wanted the plan has been overhauled in favor of building what is essentially an all new helicopter meaning lots of fresh design work and flight tests before it is safe enough for the president to carry a full suite of electronics and extend the helicopters range to miles will require more powerful and still untested engines a new transmission a new main rotor lengthened by feet and a new longer tail section to accommodate the bigger rotor thats on top of a new tail rotor to fix a long known cracking problem that has played a role in a handful of crashes concerns about cracking in the tail rotor of the same model aircraft briefly grounded british navy choppers after a crash and led canada to impose some flight restrictions on its fleet lockheeds mr bantle says "we dont have a full definitive" solution to the tail rotor problem yet agustawestland says a new tail rotor design has undergone hours of flight tests the redesign also means that the navy will have to acquire five more helicopters than expected the original plan for helicopters called for delivery in of five simpler interim models to meet the white houses need for quick replacements then fully equipped versions would be delivered in and the original five would be retrofitted but the fully equipped models now will be so different that the navy says it will be cheaper to replace the first five with new choppers both the navy and lockheed say that the project is now on track this month the first newly built marine one test helicopter made its maiden flight and the navy and lockheed say they are recouping lost time in order to meet the schedule lockheeds mr bantle says his computer models show a delivery date of oct up from oct a few months ago still key configuration decisions remain for the fully equipped second batch of helicopters will the personal communications handsets have blackberry type keypads or resemble traditional phones videoconferencing may yet prove too complex and heavy for the tight space lockheed is studying whether a system can be installed or whether it must devise a portable unit that could be carried aboard marine one only when needed lockheed and navy officials say the final cost wont be excessive frank meyer president of lockheeds unit in owego says all of the extras are justified because the choppers will "be in service for many decades to come and provide a very important service to the nation " for his part mr card now a private citizen says he doesnt think the price tag for new the presidential choppers is unduly steep marine one "helicopters have a very very long life to them " he says "its not like its going to depreciate by the day it leaves
