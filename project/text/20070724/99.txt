the new wal mart effect cleaner thai shrimp farms amid the fishing villages of chanthaburi province bracketed by the gulf of thailand and the khao soi dao mountains the inherently messy trade of shrimp farming is undergoing an environmental overhaul spearheaded by wal mart stores inc the destruction of mangrove swamps and the pollution of natural waterways with waste from shrimp ponds has long drawn the ire of environmentalists but in the past two years rubicon resources llc a los angeles based supplier of farmed shrimp to wal mart has bought and upgraded roughly thai shrimp farms among rubicons changes increasing the testing and documentation of what is in its ponds planting mangrove elsewhere to make up for the trees destroyed by its farms and standardizing treatment of the water discharged from its ponds rubicon is pushing to meet a year end deadline that all phases of shrimp production adhere to environmental and social standards backed by wal mart red lobster operator darden restaurants inc and other big buyers the u s based industry group that drafted the standards the global aquaculture alliance plans to unveil similar guidelines this year for farming of tilapia and catfish with standards for salmon following later wal mart pledges to endorse those too and to require compliance from its suppliers but the new standards come with controversy an estimated of thai shrimp farms most of them small operations run by families living on site either lack the resources to make necessary upgrades or balk at the certification fees as costs they likely wont recover that could widen the gap between the haves and have nots in thai shrimp farming and world aquaculture as a whole providing a greater advantage to large well capitalized suppliers like rubicon shrimp is the largest seafood crop imported to the u s totaling metric tons last year and thailand home to one of asias most advanced aquaculture industries is the the largest exporter of shrimp to the u s &# billion worth annually aquaculture the practice of raising fish crustaceans or mollusks in captivity for human consumption is gaining importance as wild fish populations dwindle if current consumption rates continue a scientific study predicted all wild aquatic species currently harvested for food will fall below a tenth of their largest historic population by roughly half of the seafood consumed globally is already farm raised and as that expands wal mart and others are seeking to reduce the environmental problems it often leaves in its wake the changes afoot in the thai shrimp ponds reflect the world spanning industry rattling reach of wal marts push for environmental sustainability the bentonville ark retailer has prodded its suppliers to cut their packaging and pare their reliance on nonrenewable fuels it has relentlessly promoted long lasting but slow selling compact fluorescent light bulbs it is the worlds largest buyer of organic cotton purchasing more than million pounds a year and it has pledged to eventually buy its wild caught fish only from fisheries certified as environmentally sustainable wal mart first threw its weight behind the aquaculture alliances shrimp farming standards in announcing that by the end of this year it would buy all its shrimp from farms certified as meeting the standards the endorsement drew attention wal mart buys more shrimp than any other u s company importing tons annually about of u s shrimp imports with wal marts nod "we went from trying to convince individual facilities to become certified to having long waiting lines " says george chamberlain president of the aquaculture alliance complying with the mandate isnt easy achieving certification takes three to six months on average and rarely does a farm pass without needing to shore up aspects of its operations farming shrimp produces substantial pollution from the waste generated by the crustaceans themselves to a range of water borne contaminants in extreme cases farmers let their ponds flow untreated into the nearest river souring the environment for native wildlife under the new standards contaminants must be removed from the farms discharge with filters settling ponds and by infusing oxygen usually with mechanized paddle wheels that churn the pond water the quality of that discharge must be meticulously monitored other requirements farmers must replace any mangroves cleared for their ponds by planting three times as many of the trees elsewhere applying antibiotics to the shrimp is prohibited because the drugs can seep out of the ponds and weaken the immune systems of wild species the farms must pay workers the prevailing local wage many small farmers in thailand have disregarded the aquaculture alliances standards which like the antibiotics ban they say duplicate those already established by the thai department of fisheries code of conduct for aquaculture farms as well as standards imposed by european buyers and some thai farmers see little benefit in paying inspection fees amounting to a fraction of a penny per pound of shrimp produced or upgrading facilities where necessary because wal mart wont reimburse them for their costs nor pay a premium for certified shrimp wal mart views those costs as the industrys responsibility "it duplicates the procedure and it doubles the expense " says pinyo kiatpinyo president of thailands network of shrimp farmer cooperatives which comprises small farmers nationwide others see the standards fueling a continuing consolidation of the industry wal mart prefers to buy from fewer stronger suppliers with control over all phases of production rubicon for example owns seafood processing plants roughly farms and importing and exporting operations "short term the costs of meeting the standards are onerous " says brian wynn rubicons president and chief executive "long term they are beneficial because they set up barriers to entry to nonintegrated companies " in the past two years rubicon spent more than &# million amassing its portfolio of thai farms and improving their operations to meet certification standards "we have buffer canals water treatment processes mangrove conservation and we take care of public canals around our farms " says chana tanglertpanya president of rubicons aquaculture division in thailand "we also make good relations with the local villagers " wal mart says it doesnt foresee needing to shift some of its shrimp buying out of thailand because of farms failing to meet the standards but it can if it must "proactive suppliers and farmers will see this opportunity and respond" by complying with the standards said peter redmond wal marts vice president of seafood and deli "the rest of the thai production will sell on the open marketplace the same way it always has " meanwhile some environmental groups criticize the aquaculture alliances standards as too weak alleging they stop short of significant environmental safeguards to instead allow producers a lower hurdle for gaining compliance the world wildlife fund is overseeing the drafting of environmental standards for aquaculture production of species in the hope that wal mart will either adopt them or prod the aquaculture alliance to match them james hookway contributed to this article
