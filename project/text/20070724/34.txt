exploring a surprising link between obesity and diet soda do unhealthy people drink diet soda does diet soda make people unhealthy those are some the questions raised by a surprising new study that links consumption of soft drinks both the sugared and diet variety with a higher risk for a range of obesity related health problems high consumption of regular soda which contains about calories a can has previously been linked with obesity and diabetes in kids and teens as well as high blood pressure in adults but the finding that diet soda drinkers faced similar health risks is unexpected because the zero calorie drinks are often touted as a way to help people prevent weight gain and related health problems the results may simply signal that the diet soda drinkers in the study were less healthy to start with and they had turned to sugar free beverages to help with weight loss or because they had diabetes the study investigators who oversee the respected framingham heart study in massachusetts noted also that the type of person who drinks diet soda may be more likely to eat less healthful foods but they also cited research suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may affect a persons satiety or cravings for sweets "there have been suggestions in the literature that diet soda may not be innocuous " says vasan s ramachandran associate professor at the boston university school of medicine and senior investigator on the study "we have explanations that we offer as theories but we need additional research " the research was immediately criticized by the soft drink industry and some nutrition researchers "there is no plausible physiological mechanism to explain this and causes me to question the accuracy of the methodologies used in this study " says dean ornish clinical professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco and chairman of the pepsico health &amp wellness advisory board the new report from the framingham study compared soft drink consumption among nearly middle aged men and women overall soda drinkers were at higher risk for metabolic syndrome a collection of health problems including being overweight and having blood sugar levels signaling diabetes risk the risks of metabolic syndrome were about the same whether the soft drink was sugared or sugar free the study authors noted that the research doesnt prove sodas cause health problems barry popkin professor of global nutrition at the university of north carolinas school of public health and frequent critic of the soft drink industry says he doesnt "put much credence" in the diet drink findings in the study which was published in the journal circulation he noted those findings included diabetics who are at higher risk for health problems and more likely to use sugar free beverages when diabetics were excluded the data were weaker showing only a higher risk for health problems among soda drinkers dr popkin says other research contradicts the findings including a study that found overweight people who consumed diet beverages didnt gain weight the american beverage association which represents soft drink companies said it is "scientifically implausible" to suggest diet drinks could cause weight gain or elevated blood pressure "all of our industrys beverages can be part of a healthy way of life when consumed in moderation " said aba president susan k neely in a statement but the data on diet soda have been mixed one previous study showed a link between diet soda consumption and weight gain in boys some research has suggested that artificial sweeteners may "condition" diet soda drinkers to develop a preference for sweet higher calorie foods other studies have questioned whether the caramel content of both regular and diet soft drinks may play a role in insulin resistance nutritionists say the study should be a wake up call for soda drinkers noting that a zero calorie beverage cant undo the damage of an unhealthful diet betsy mckay contributed to this article email healthjournal wsj com pop culture people who consumed one or more sodas a day were  more likely to have metabolic syndrome  more likely to be obese  more likely to have higher blood sugar  more likely to have high blood pressure source circulation
