craftsbury vt and learned to row single scull in a single person boat with two oars "there was no cell service and dial up internet was a luxury " she says "we rowed up to six hours a day i ate i slept and i rowed " as the end of the week neared she asked herself "what on earth am i doing living in new york " she realized that the city didnt satisfy her love for the outdoors she returned from camp and a few months later landed a new job in her home state of connecticut in november of last year she moved to rowayton a small town located on the long island sound about miles from manhattan

york her workouts were sporadic and too indoor focused she would regularly run in central park two to three times a week as a volunteer at the achilles track club acting as a guide for a blind runner but she also liked to weight lift at the gym near her upper west side apartment and swim at a nearby indoor pool if she worked late was tired or had dinner plans with friends shed skip workouts "i made it a point to get three workouts in a week minimum but my workout schedule would change every week " she says ms cizek recently completed a four week learn to row program at the maritime rowing club in nearby norwalk five minutes from her home "i wanted to learn more and improve " says ms cizek "you also get a bit spoiled at camp having someone clean your boat and put things away for you " now that her program is over ms cizek says she wants to "row like a mad person as much as i can " she now rows tuesdays wednesdays and fridays at a m for an hour and saturdays from a m to a m the boathouse is closed on sundays and mondays ms cizek says that one of the great things about rowing is that its a total body exercise because of this she has only been swimming at her local ymca about once a week shes also going to the gym far less much of her strength training consists of bodyweight based exercises like dips push ups squats lunges and sometimes plyometrics exercises that use explosive movements to develop strength and speed which she does at the gym or in her apartment at least once a week in the summer in the winter when rowing workouts are less intense and often indoors she does her full body strength routine at least two days a week still rowing has not eclipsed her running "rowayton is all along the water and you never get sick of it the views are visually spectacular and you can constantly change up your route " she says "in central park i always felt committed to the same six mile loop " she runs about five miles four times a week in the evenings after work during the week and early sunday morning ms cizek says she never exercises when injured and avoids overdoing it "i never run two days in a row " she says if she runs on a day that she rows then its in the evening she rarely runs on saturdays after a two hour row because she finds it wipes her out the diet "im hungry all the time " says ms cizek "i have a naturally high metabolism but when i exercise i turn into a furnace and i have to snack throughout the day " ms cizek tries to eat organic food as much as possible "but if im starving and i want a hamburger ill go out and get one " she says for breakfast she blends a raw fruit shake later in the morning she might have a yogurt or an energy bar sometimes she is so hungry after a morning row that shell stop off at a restaurant on the way to work to have scrambled eggs fruit and toast for lunch and dinner she might have kale with chicken and sesame oil topped with nuts and braggs soy flavored amino acids which she prefers to bottled salad dressing having a refrigerator at her new job a luxury she didnt have at her new york office helps her control what she eats she now brings groceries to the office to prepare salads for lunch the cost ms cizek spent &# for her eight session learn to row package an annual membership at the rowing club cost &# which includes the use of boats as well as a training space with rowing machines that shell use in the winter and basic lifting equipment her ymca membership costs &# a month ms cizek says her cost of living is about the same in connecticut even though now shes paying more for a car the effort "the frustrating part is that it takes so much time to get your oars and your boat ready " says ms cizek "youre out of the water almost the same amount of time youre on it " ms cizek wakes before a m to get her boat on the water by a m "its a struggle when the alarm goes off and i have a bad habit of hitting snooze " she says ms cizeks coach recently convinced her to try rowing in a quad with three other women her coach thought the experience of rowing with others would help ms cizek with her single rowing "it was stressful if you have an itch you cant stop " she says "youre on rhythm and you dont want to make everyone stop and ruin everyones zone " the benefit "i dont have a tenth of the stress i had living in the city " she says "working for a smaller company and in an office that has windows that open to the outdoors instead of working out of a high rise where i stared at a depressing gray wall and breathed recycled air makes a difference " she says "i have more peacefulness and dont get that sick feeling in my stomach anymore its about quality of life " is city life good for working out discuss write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
