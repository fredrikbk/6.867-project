should you sip your vitamins through a straw as nutrient fortified sodas juice teas and flavored water proliferate on store shelves questions remain about whether these beverages really provide health benefits coca cola co which already sells diet coke plus a cola fortified with vitamins and minerals plans to expand its newly acquired glaceau vitaminwater line of enhanced flavored water to more supermarkets convenience stores and vending machines across the u s and beyond coke is also adding vitamins and fiber to its dasani bottled water pepsico inc now offers sobe life water enhanced with four b vitamins and its zero calorie sparkling drink tava will be infused with vitamins and chromium when launched next year next year jones soda co will roll out an energy drink with amino acids the explosion of nutrient laced drinks reflects consumers desire for more healthful choices than soda these drinks combined u s volume more than tripled from to according to the beverage marketing corp compared with growth for the u s beverage industry over all frenzied competition is fueling increasingly bold marketing claims vitaminwaters peach and mango "endurance" flavor containing as much vitamin e as two apples claims it can "enhance physical endurance " jones sodas energy drink with amino acids will "provide clarity and focus " says peter m van stolk president and chief executive ads for airforce nutrisoda slender say the fizzy soda made by ardea beverage co helps "healthily manage your weight " and ardea officials claim another flavor packed with vitamin c magnesium and other nutrients was a factor in improving test scores of seventh graders in south carolina who got a can for breakfast for days but some nutritionists say these enhanced drinks may lead consumers to pack in more calories than they need popular drinks such as sobe life water and vitaminwater often contain about calories per bottle thats less than sugared sodas but certainly more than plain water many health experts say there is little evidence to suggest that fortified beverages make a significant difference in health and they question whether the drinks are worth their hefty retail prices which can run twice as high as those of plain bottled water or unenhanced sodas "the manufacturers say it provides people with another source of vitamins and minerals and that is true " says anita sandretto a lecturer at the university of michigans school of public health in ann arbor "but whether it has any effect on preventing disease or making people healthier is still scientifically unproven " many people already get most of the nutrients in these beverages from other foods or multivitamin pills vitamin c and several b vitamins frequently infused in drinks because they dissolve well in water already are commonly found the u s diet say health experts for example each ounce serving of passion fruit and citrus flavored sobe life water has of four types of b vitamins considered essential to helping cells make and use energy but a bowl of breakfast cereal or a couple of slices of bread typically offer even more than that amount meanwhile other nutrients often lacking in peoples diets typically arent in enhanced drinks or are present in such small quantities that they dont make much difference dasani plus for example has one gram of fiber per serving or of the daily recommended amount fiber helps regulate digestion but can become chunky in liquids or create an aftertaste making it difficult to put in drink form bob murray director of gatorade sports science institute at purchase n y based pepsico says drinks like his companys propel arent designed to be the main source of vitamins instead nutrient packed drinks are "an insurance policy " brandon james a year old sophomore at the university of memphis says he thinks pepsis propel a vitamin enhanced water helped clear up his acne he started drinking propel because he didnt like the humdrum taste of plain water and was looking for a fast way to get his vitamins mr james who says he gets no compensation from pepsi has created a group on facebook called "i get all my vitamins from propel " drink makers have lots of leeway to promote these sodas teas fruit juices and water the label on vitaminwaters power c brand tells consumers "legally we are prohibited from making exaggerated claims about the potency of the nutrients in this bottle therefore legally we wouldnt tell you that after drinking this eugene from kansas started using horseshoes as a thighmaster or that this drink gave agnes from delaware enough strength to bench press llamas " vitaminwater maker glaceau which coca cola acquired after buying energy brands inc for &# billion in may says its labels are meant to be funny and that consumers dont interpret their pitches as health claims the food and drug administration which regulates the claims food and drink makers can put on their labels doesnt require companies to seek approval for claims before the drinks reach store shelves usually the agency would intervene only when suspicions or complaints arise kim rawlings an fda spokeswoman says "structure function" claims regarding how a nutrient aids the function of the body must be "truthful and not misleading " this would include touting benefits such as more endurance or energy specific health claims of links between a product and disease are supposed to be backed by scientific evidence at the federal trade commission which regulates advertising claims mary engle associate director for advertising practices says the agency requires beverage makers to provide truthful advertising supported by scientific studies beverage companies like glaceau point to research showing the general nutritional benefits of consuming recommended vitamins and minerals "were not trying to sell snake oil and promise everything in the world " says carol dollard chief operating officer at glaceau "were just saying that these nutrients can help " beverage makers and nutritionists agree that putting certain vitamins in liquid form accelerates absorption into the bloodstream water soluble nutrients like vitamins b and c enter the bloodstream directly solid foods may take longer to process and sometimes contain compounds that interfere with vitamin absorption but health experts say that the situation is slightly different with fat soluble nutrients such as vitamins a d and e such vitamins may enter the digestive tract more quickly if they are consumed in a beverage but how much you absorb will depend on how much fat is in the digestive tract overdosing on vitamins in these drinks is unlikely says eric rimm associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at harvard medical school in boston unneeded water soluble vitamins are excreted after they are consumed excess fat soluble vitamins are stored in the bodys fat tissues to be released as needed there are certain risks to very high doses of some of these such as vitamin a but the chance of absorbing dangerous levels by drinking a lot of beverages is extremely low nutritionists say mr rimm is worried that some nutrient enhanced energy drinks and teas often contain herbs or other additives such as echinacea or st johns wort eating too much of them could be risky because the effect of the herbs isnt well known he says but even the most supercharged drinks arent as healthy as eating fresh fruits and vegetables which contain hundreds of compounds that could have health benefits says barbara rolls a nutritional sciences professor at pennsylvania state university in university park pa chewing also makes consumers feel fuller than drinking she adds though beverage makers insist that enhanced drinks lure some consumers away from sugary calorie laden sodas cc brunk an year old in lancaster pa kicked her soda habit last summer after discovering a grape flavored variety of vitaminwater called formula named for rapper cent "it felt healthy to drink it " she says each bottle has half the recommended amount of many nutrients including as much folic acid as cups of cooked broccoli she drinks as many as three bottles of vitaminwater a day her mom doesnt mind spending as much as one third more for vitaminwater than cokes regular dasani bottled water and ms brunk says she plans to bring her new beverage habit along to college at west chester university in pennsylvania this fall "its essential " she says
