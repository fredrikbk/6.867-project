puncturing the &# tire drivers fault cost durability of tires that dont go flat factoring in the safety issue tires that keep rolling for miles after being punctured might seem like something every consumer would want but many drivers who have purchased vehicles with these newfangled tires known as "run flats" in the industry say that while they do run after losing air pressure they come with a list of problems replacements are expensive and can be hard to find durability can be poor for some drivers these ills outweigh the convenience of not having to stop at the side of the road jack the car and change to a spare tire the tires have become available on a wider range of vehicles in the past two years but havent caught on quite as quickly as manufacturers expected while they used to appear mostly on expensive sports cars like the chevrolet corvette they are now available on more basic passenger cars bmw ag made them standard equipment on the latest version of its entry level series cars which went on sale two years ago toyota motor corp and honda motor co mount them on some of their minivans for consumers who have long viewed tires as a cheap long lasting commodity the spread of run flats has led to frustration and sticker shock at replacement time the minivan driver who has become accustomed to spending &# to &# per tire can be surprised to find that each replacement run flat on his new van costs &# in addition he may have to replace two tires at once to maintain proper tread wear balance a lesser problem with many conventional tires run flats whose makers include bridgestone corp goodyear tire &amp rubber co and pirelli &amp c spa are constructed differently from conventional tires and have a thicker reinforced sidewall that is stiff enough to support a vehicles weight after losing air pressure they allow you to continue driving for roughly to miles after damage that would leave typical tires flat and unusable pressure monitoring systems alert the driver when the tire loses air auto makers pitch run flats as a safety feature because they let drivers avoid stopping on busy highways and other dangerous locations they also say they like the design flexibility they get by eliminating the space consuming spare tire even though run flats are heavier the lack of a spare tire can save vehicle weight overall helping fuel efficiency on the downside the tires force people to find specific replacement models often from a dealership selling their make and model of car critics say that even if there is a dealer within the tires run flat range your particular tire may not be in stock that may not matter if a motorist gets a flat on a late night trip home from work or on the way to an important meeting the types of scenarios tire makers often cite but the prospect is more daunting in the middle of a lengthy road trip especially when tire shops and car dealers may be closed when john mctavishs bmw series sedan got a flat during a two day mile trip he was miles from his bonita springs fla home so he and his wife returned home and took a different car "it seems to me the lack of a spare with these tires is a major disability if you take a trip on a weekend or holiday or if you are caught without tire pressure more than miles from a dealer " mr mctavish says mike filipek an engineer with bridgestone firestone says that run flats have roughly the same speed and distance limitations as the compact "doughnut" spares found in most vehicles in a pinch one can also replace a run flat tire with a conventional one long enough to complete a trip he also says the company began working on run flat tires only after drivers repeatedly said in surveys and studies that they wanted them "consumers truly want the smallest amount of hassle in their lives and run flat tires move in that direction " says mr filipek still unlike other safety equipment such as side air bags antilock brakes and electronic stability control run flat tires have yet to gain the broad acceptance that tire makers had expected indeed more than a decade after they began to appear on a handful of sports cars run flats are available on relatively few vehicles and account for only about of the tire market their price has helped hold back run flat tires tire makers say they can cost as much as more than comparable conventional tires but those comparable tires are higher performance conventional tires that typical buyers wouldnt consider in the real world run flats can easily cost double what consumers are accustomed to paying harmon fischer a retired supermarket executive in jefferson la and bmw mini cooper driver calls run flats "possibly the biggest rip off " in part because they cant be repaired like conventional tires or at least many shops refuse to patch them because they lack the necessary certification required by the tire makers developed in part for the unique hazards of off road rally competition and military use run flat tires began turning up on a handful of exclusive passenger cars including the exotic porsche in the late s and chevrolet corvette and plymouth prowler in the mid s they have since been used on lexus mercedes benz and bmw cars and certain toyota and honda minivans most run flats are really high performance tires and as such have higher prices and shorter tread life than typical mass market tires the newest models increasingly have been designed for family oriented vehicles like large and midsize sedans and crossovers such tires will have longer tread life and lower prices than earlier run flat designs still bridgestones mr filipek doesnt expect consumers historically slow adoption rate of the technology to speed up appreciably "i remember how long it took people to switch to radial tires from the older bias ply tires so i fully expect run flats to catch on slowly " a recent study by j d power &amp associates placed run flat tires on a list with stability control night vision systems blind spot detection and side impact air bags as features that consumers find most attractive before knowing the estimated market price the tires were the second most highly rated feature among consumers before they knew the cost but their high price hurt consumer interest after the cost was revealed run flats fell to seventh on the list behind stability control backup assist and premium sound systems
