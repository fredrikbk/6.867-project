governments get bolder in buying equity stakes foreign governments flush with cash and no longer content with the meager returns to be had on safe but low yielding investments like treasurys are becoming increasingly aggressive players on the equity front the new boldness of these government controlled investors was on display sunday night when entities controlled by the governments of china and singapore agreed to invest as much as &# billion in return for stakes in the big british bank barclays plc in doing so chinese lender china development bank and temasek holdings pte ltd the singapore governments investment agency could play a role in the outcome of the biggest bank takeover battle ever that increasingly bitter contest pits barclays against a consortium of european banks led by royal bank of scotland group plc in seeking to acquire dutch banking giant abn amro holding nv the barclays deal is the latest in a string of investments in u s and european companies by governments in asia and the middle east temasek last year became the largest shareholder in london based standard chartered plc a bank that has most of its assets in asia in may the chinese government invested &# billion in blackstone group on the eve of the u s private equity giants initial public stock offering and last week an investment fund controlled by the government of qatar made a &# billion takeover approach for british supermarket chain j sainsbury plc one of the largest potential acquisitions ever by a state owned fund while potentially boosting their investment returns such deals expose the government controlled funds and other entities involved to risks that range from simple investment losses to political backlash if it continues the trend could also reshape global financial markets bidding up prices for more speculative assets like stocks corporate bonds and real estate while crimping demand for safer investments like treasury bonds "there has been a fairly spectacular increase in financial assets under management by governments " said dominic wilson director of global macro and markets research at goldman sachs group "the scale of the issues around such investment is different than anything the world has ever seen neither governments nor the markets know exactly what they should do with the assets " china development bank plans to invest as much as &# billion in barclays in what could become the largest overseas investment by a chinese company to date the planned investment is part of a broader deal that also includes as much as &# billion in funding from temasek and would enable barclays to buttress its bid for abn amro should barclays succeed in acquiring the dutch bank the deal ultimately could leave china development bank with a stake of about in the newly enlarged barclays making it by far the biggest shareholder if completed the barclays deal would provide further evidence of an important global shift in wealth "this is basically a flow of capital from emerging markets to established markets " says john studzinski former chief of investment banking at hsbc holdings plc and now head of blackstone groups mergers and acquisitions advisory group which advised china development on the deal the private equity firms role shows how private and public investors are joining together to create powerful forces "going forward you have to look at where wealth is being created i think its a very logical trend " adds mr studzinski to be sure investors controlled by foreign governments have bought stakes in western companies before one example the kuwait investment office which grew into an investment heavyweight as oil prices boomed in the s amassed sizable holdings in several major companies including the then british petroleum and germanys daimler benz ag but what distinguishes the latest wave of investment is the sheer size of the sums involved which could give those investors the potential to affect strategy and bolster or block corporate transactions like takeovers china development banks agenda in the barclays deal is somewhat unique say people close to it it hopes that substantially expanding its existing but narrower relationship with the year old british bank will help accelerate its own transformation from a policy institution to more of a commercial bank and give it a much higher profile overseas but many other recent deals reflect the quest by china and other countries for higher returns on their mounting foreign exchange reserves those holdings traditionally were invested in safe liquid investments that could be quickly converted to cash to buy up local currency if it came under speculative attack but in many countries especially china and the oil producing nations of the middle east global trade has swelled those holdings to far more than might be needed to stabilize their currencies since such holdings have increased a year according to u s treasury calculations well ahead of the average rate of global foreign exchange reserves now stand at about &# trillion an additional &# trillion to &# trillion held by "sovereign wealth funds" brings total assets controlled by governments to "roughly &# trillion " or of global gross domestic product the treasury says as a result governments are treating these reserves less like rainy day funds and more like pools of investment capital sameer al ansari executive chairman and chief executive officer of state back investment firm dubai international capital says he is scouring the worlds largest publicly traded companies looking for a place to invest as much as &# billion his next target a u s company that he has already identified but will only describe as "a household name " mr ansari says dubai international which has &# billion under management is hoping to announce the u s deal in september his company bought a major stake in london based hsbc holdings plc earlier this year and this month bought of airbus maker european aeronautic defence &amp space co and of indias icici bank ltd the new wave of investment carries numerous risks most obvious is the potential for political backlash political pressure to block or restrict these investments appears to be mounting in the u s a dubai companys deal last year to buy a british ports operator that operated several american ports ran into political obstacles as did a attempt by chinese oil company cnooc ltd to buy u s oil producer unocal corp dubai ports world ultimately agreed to sell off the u s holdings and cnooc pulled out of the unocal bidding in europe there is a rising clamor to restrict foreign investment german chancellor angela merkel said last week that state controlled investors might use stakes in european companies to pursue political rather than only financial goals the european union should think about ways to protect its firms from politically motivated buyers she said mentioning the u s s interagency committee on foreign investment in the u s as a possible model cfius reviews the national security aspects of overseas deals others have been more outspoken ms merkels powerful conservative colleague roland koch governor of the german state of hesse has warned in stark terms about encroachment by industrial groups such as russias oao gazprom as well as financial investors controlled by china and other emerging economies "we havent only recently gone through the trouble of privatizing companies like deutsche telekom and deutsche post so that the russians can nationalize them again " he told german media even the idea of such sales could inflame nationalist passions as occurred last year when there were riots in thailand following temaseks attempt to buy thai telecommunications provider shin corp critics say backlashes could go beyond issues of foreign investment and hurt global trade "once you start to define what sensitive sectors are you realize that clever lobbyists can identify nearly every sector as sensitive because everything is connected with everything " says norbert walter chief economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt "this will open a wide door for protectionism " he says another risk is that the investments go bad the financial landscape is littered with examples of foreign buyers being duped by savvy locals into overpaying for assets the singaporeans for example lost money on dot com flameouts "the governments management of its hoard of cross border assets either in the form of reserves or in some type of sovereign wealth fund is likely to be a source of political controversy and frictions as the inevitable losses are recorded " edwin truman a former u s treasury official and now a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics warned in a recent speech the trend toward more aggressive government investments also has the potential to reorder global financial markets "we have entered a whole new world " says jim oneill head of global economic research for goldman sachs international in london "we are at the early stage of a secular process where the relations between the prices of stocks and bonds will change the whole world is discovering the equity culture " while singapores temasek which manages about &# billion in assets has long invested in private companies mostly in asia the barclays deal launches onto the international stage a large but so far little noticed chinese institution in contrast to temasek whose main role is to invest government money china developments main business is lending to companies and local governments for government backed infrastructure projects in china under year old chief chen yuan china development bank has been run increasingly like a commercial entity and one with a growing international agenda china development boasts an international advisory council including major figures in global finance like maurice "hank" greenberg the former head of insurer american international group and sir edward george former bank of england governor mr chen is the son of one of the chinese communist partys most senior early leaders the late chen yun who along with mao zedong and zhou enlai is enshrined in modern chinese political lore as one of the partys "eight immortals " the younger mr chen graduated from beijings prestigious tsinghua university and served for many years as a chinese central bank official before taking the helm at china development in under terms of the barclays deal china development will buy up to billion euros &# billion of new barclays shares initially amounting to a stake china development will then buy as much as billion euros worth of additional barclayss shares if the british banks bid for abn succeeds and if regulators agree china development had just &# billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of last year to finance the deal it will raise funds by issuing debt on chinas domestic market
