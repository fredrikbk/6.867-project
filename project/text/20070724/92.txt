the afternoon report early iphone numbers online edition nearly a month after gadget geeks besieged apple stores and at&amp t outlets for the release of the iphone at&amp t gave investors their first glimpse at official numbers on sales of the sleek hybrid handset at&amp t reported a rise in net income as the telecommunications giant continued to digest a batch of acquisitions but what grabbed everyones attention was the fact that it activated iphone subscribers in the last two days of the quarter iphones ballyhooed opening weekend some of those subscribers were new at&amp t wireless customers making them a addition at at&amp t which made a bet that the iphone could supercharge subscriber growth and help the company get an edge on archrival verizon wireless still the numbers were a lot lower than many wall street forecasts for unit sales after monitoring the iphone frenzy in late june goldman sachs doubled its prior estimate of units sold over the weekend piper jaffray estimated that roughly were sold over the weekend and j p morgan analysts who had conceded initial demand "might have been somewhat disappointing " still thought about units were snagged so whats going on cue the parade of caveats at&amp ts report only detailed the number of iphone subscribers it activated an important distinction from unit sales activation glitches played a role in a spate of stories about cranky iphone customers who couldnt get their phone working some at&amp t subscribers who bought the phone for business purposes tried for hours to connect them before finding out that they needed personal accounts to use them others experienced a delay in transferring their numbers to at&amp t in part because of the volume of sales at&amp t acknowledged at the time that a high volume of requests to activate the phones were slowing its servers down alas neither at&amp t nor apple said how many early iphone buyers caught the bleeding edge of the activation process although an at&amp t spokesman did say the "vast majority" of customers found activation a snap also of note at&amp ts tally doesnt include online sales of the iphone which could be significant as such even some seasoned analysts found it tough to understand what the numbers mean and since the financial terms of apples exclusive deal with at&amp t were undisclosed its unclear what iphone sales even mean to at&amp t "lacking a complete understanding of the economic relationship between apple and at&amp t it is virtually impossible to derive any sort of sensitivity analysis for iphone results and at&amp ts earnings " said deutsche bank analyst greg miller in a research note the only option seems to be to wait for further detail on iphone sales fortunately it wont be a long wait apple reports tomorrow
