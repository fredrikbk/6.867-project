scurrilous george two years ago george galloway a member of the british parliament came to the u s and attempted to make a mockery of an investigation into allegations of corruption within the united nations oil for food program readers will remember that oil for food started as a way to feed iraqi children but became a vehicle that saddam hussein used for bribery and extortion mr galloway dismissed accusations that he benefited substantially through a charity he was involved with the mariam appeal from saddam evidence that he and the appeal had received lucrative oil benefits had been released by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations of which i was chairman in testimony to the subcommittee mr galloway denied the accusations and later attacked the integrity of his accusers including me his bombastic denials won him international attention but now thanks to an investigation conducted by the british parliament the truth is out last week the house of commonss committee on standards and privileges issued a damning report presenting "undeniable evidence" that mr galloway and his political operation at the mariam appeal benefited from saddams regime through oil for food this report is the fourth official investigation from the u n to the u s to the u k to condemn mr galloway for his misconduct the committee report which is remarkably thorough and objective is highly critical of mr galloway ruling that he violated the house of commons code of conduct on numerous different counts in fact the committee ruled against mr galloway on every count brought against him it concluded that mr galloway through his extensive misconduct brought the house into "disrepute " it also chastised him for his inappropriate conduct throughout their investigation including making inconsistent statements acting belligerently and verbally attacking key witnesses "mr galloway has consistently denied prevaricated and fudged in relation to the now undeniable evidence" that his political operation and he indirectly received money from saddam husseins regime via oil for food the committee recommends suspension from the house of commons for a month a rare and severe punishment and that mr galloway apologize to parliament for his improper behavior the report relied heavily on evidence uncovered by my subcommittee the u n s investigation and the u k charity commission but the parliament report went further even enlisting a forensic scientist to determine that other official iraqi documents which provide detailed descriptions of mr galloways personal involvement in nefarious deals were authentic moreover the report reveals the official iraqi minutes of a meeting between mr galloway and saddam in which mr galloway overtly discusses iraqi oil deals the very deals hes denied knowing about according to the minutes which have been authenticated by the iraqi government mr galloway complained to saddam that problems with oil prices are reducing "our income" and delaying "our dues " these documents should quash any notion that mr galloway did not know about oil transactions and had no idea his wife and his political operation were receiving under the table money in short this report and the volumes of evidence presented in it appear to confirm that mr galloway was neck deep in oil for food deals and that his vociferous denials were nothing more than a web of misleading half truths mr galloway is already claiming that the parliaments report relies on fraudulent documents and mendacious witnesses his shtick rings hollow it is clear that he is putting up to borrow his words "the mother of all smokescreens " consider that roughly six months after his senate testimony in october my subcommittee released another report presenting extensive evidence that mr galloways testimony was filled with false or misleading statements that evidence included bank records showing that his wife received &# from an oil for food deal and that the political operation he portrayed as a childrens charity received at least &# from oil deals days later the u n s investigative committee revealed a different oil deal in which &# went to mr galloways wife and other deals in which hundreds of thousands of dollars went to his political operation more recently the u k charity commission concluding that the mariam appeal improperly received at least &# from oil for food deals chastised mr galloway and the appeals other trustees for breaching their duties at each point mr galloway has vehemently denied every accusation and all the evidence but the record should be clear mr galloway appears to have been personally involved in oil deals under the oil for food program and indirectly through his political operation and his wife received hundreds of thousands of dollars as a result the u k report exposes a fraud who personally benefited at the expense of the iraqi people the very people he was pretending to help mr coleman is a republican senator from minnesota
