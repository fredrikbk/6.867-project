veto victory lame duck or not president bush will retain his veto power to his last day in office and as an example of how to put it to good use consider his underreported victory last week on collective bargaining rights for the nations federal airport screeners in march senate democrats had slipped the right to unionize those screeners into a bill to implement the recommendations of the commission but last week majority leader harry reid quietly stripped the union provision from the bill after mr bush threatened a veto and republicans promised to sustain it apparently mr reid did not relish a repeat of the political showdown that his predecessor tom daschle lost in over unionizing employees at the nascent department of homeland security that fight was one reason democrats lost control of the senate congress created the transportation security administration in without union rights so the agency would have the flexibility to deal quickly with changing terror threats rather than have to clear any change in work rules with a union democrats insisted at the time that those screeners be government employees in the name of national security but now they want to ignore the security argument in the name of adding more dues paying members to union rolls mr reid may have hoped that mr bush would shrink from killing an entire anti terror bill over a single provision but the presidents willingness to do so demonstrates how the veto can be used to change the political debate and defeat bad legislation may there be many more examples in the coming months see related letter "letters to the editor bargaining would let tsa collect whats due" wsj july
