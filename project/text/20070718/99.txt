politics &amp economics u s sounds alarm on al qaeda moves pressure intensifies on bush to eradicate pakistani haven unrest surrounds musharraf new terrorism threat alarms from washington are being sounded in large measure because of what intelligence reports say are signs that al qaeda has rebuilt a base in pakistan that could be a launching pad for attacks in the west u s policy makers under pressure to eradicate this haven with or without the cooperation of islamabad describe a vexing dilemma any major unilateral effort by the pentagon inside pakistan say u s officials could spark a local backlash strong enough to topple president pervez musharraf a leader president bush has called washingtons strongest ally in the fight against al qaeda the u s intelligence community in an assessment released yesterday said osama bin ladens terrorist network remains "the most serious threat" to the u s homeland pakistans tribal areas which abut the afghanistan border have become a haven and operational command for al qaedas senior leadership probably including mr bin laden and his deputy ayman al zawahiri u s intelligence officials say al qaeda leaders according to u s officials are using the border region to train recruits from europe and africa while reaching out globally to affiliate groups particularly in iraq and north africa al qaedas core leadership "can execute some level of control over the organization " while both recruiting and deploying personnel said ted gistaro an official on the staff of the director of national intelligence and a principal author of yesterdays assessment the national intelligence estimate many counterterrorism officials question whether gen musharraf who is also pakistans military chief has the will or political support to mount a major operation inside the tribal areas against al qaeda and the taliban the islamist fundamentalists who ruled afghanistan until late "the bush administration is in a huge bind here " says seth jones a terrorism analyst at the rand corp a think tank with offices in washington "it doesnt have much of a military option " some u s politicians questioned the timing of the assessments release saying it could be used to distract the public from the bush administrations troubles in iraq others said it shows the administrations failures in combating terrorism senior intelligence officials said the report had been originally requested in growing unrest surrounding gen musharraf helps explain why worries among u s terror watchers have escalated so markedly in recent weeks a suicide bomber killed people yesterday at a rally in islamabad for pakistans suspended chief justice police said meanwhile u s and pakistani officials say the security environment in pakistans tribal areas has deteriorated markedly during the past months in september gen musharraf struck a peace agreement with tribal leaders in the area which resulted in islamabad withdrawing troops in return for the tribes pledge to forcibly remove foreign and al qaeda fighters but the pact has had the opposite effect say these officials by allowing al qaeda and the taliban to increase their autonomy and presence in the area the federally administered tribal areas or fata there are also signs that the taliban and al qaeda presence has spread into the nontribal regions of pakistans northwest frontier province there is also emerging evidence that the talibans influence is reaching the pakistani capital this month gen musharrafs troops launched a siege on the red mosque a center of radical and fundamentalist teaching in islamabad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of students and leaders identified by pakistan as taliban supporters pakistani officials said the action was taken after gen musharraf recognized the threat of the growing "talibanization" of pakistan the taliban and al qaeda have used the bloodshed as a rallying call for an even broader campaign against gen musharrafs government the raid on the red mosque also led leaders in fata to call off the truce with the islamabad government in recent days militants in the tribal areas and islamabad have killed hundreds of pakistani troops and citizens in suicide attacks mr zawahiri has also called for the assassination of pakistans leader senior u s and pakistani officials said the raid on the red mosque was part of a broader effort by gen musharraf to push back the taliban and al qaeda pakistans government isnt declaring its truce with the tribal leaders dead but it has rushed troops into the north west frontier province in recent days pakistani troops have also re manned checkpoints in fatas north and south waziristan districts pakistan and the u s are also seeking to drastically increase developmental aid to the tribal areas in coming months the two countries have pledged nearly &# billion for the fata during the next five years largely on schools roads and medical clinics islamabad and washington are also cooperating to further develop a frontier corps of troops focused on policing the pakistani afghanistan border "now having dealt with the mosque its pretty much crossing a line and theres no going back " said richard boucher assistant secretary of state for south asia "i think it shows that the government of pakistan is prepared to move to act against a dangerous militancy " the pentagon has launched limited operations inside the tribal areas such as missile strikes and intelligence gathering activities but senior u s officials balked at more aggressive action for fear of destabilizing gen musharraf many pakistan watchers say gen musharraf would be hard pressed to rid the tribal areas of al qaeda and the taliban even if he has the will to do so the groups operate in remote mountainous areas that neither islamabad nor earlier british colonial governments ever controlled elements of pakistans security forces helped fund and arm the taliban in its earlier years raising questions about their willingness to conduct military action against the militia gen musharrafs ability to act could be compromised by his increasing political weakness at home the pakistani leader has survived in power in part through a political alliance with a coalition of islamist parties many of whom are sympathetic to the taliban many of gen musharrafs supporters in washington hope the pakistani leader seizes on the red mosque incident both to crack down on islamist militants but also to build bridges with secular political parties that have opposed his rule these groups have supported the pakistan leaders moves against the taliban and the red mosque while still calling for a return of civilian rule to their country
