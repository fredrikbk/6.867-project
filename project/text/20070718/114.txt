lists of subprime related bonds they planned to hastily sell to investors some of the assets were from a fund managed by basis capital a large hedge fund manager based in australia and were put on the block by citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co according to people familiar with the matter basis yield alpha fund last week informed its investors it had lost around in june another fund called basis pac rim fund was down that month basis said the declines came after bond dealers abruptly marked down the value of the securities which it said were "otherwise fundamentally sound " investors are struggling to place values on assets tied to subprime home loans because some of these instruments arent actively traded investors worry that they are holding securities on their books at values that are no longer accurate "the funds reported performance in part reflects the unprecedented declines in the valuations of a number of highly rated" securities bear brokers wrote in a letter disseminated to clients yesterday last week moodys investors service and standard and poors the two big credit rating services knocked down their assessments on hundreds of mostly lower rated subprime backed bonds delinquencies and defaults have been rising on subprime mortgages which are taken out by borrowers with shaky credit backgrounds some of these mortgages were subject to fraudulent loan

index which tracks the performance of various classes of subprime related bonds hit new lows yesterday in the past few months the portions of the index that tracked especially risky mortgage bonds with junk grade ratings had been falling but now the portions of the index that track safer mortgage bonds with ratings of triple a or double a are also falling sharply the portion of the index that tracks triple a subprime debt issued last year has fallen about in the past week the portion of the index that tracks low rated triple b bonds is down more than this year investors have been buzzing for days trying to explain the latest losses in the abx index which signaled a deepening panic in the mortgage market several factors have been at play including the ratings downgrades it also could have been related to mortgage backed securities holders hedging of positions by making bets against the index or it could have been because speculators are betting the subprime woes will worsen the index isnt a perfect indicator of the health of these securities because it represents only a narrow slice of the subprime bond market and it isnt widely traded nevertheless investors are watching it closely "the decline in the abx indexes has been significant and certainly some people are panicking and shorting it further because many assets they own are going down in value " says alan fournier
