the bush doctrine lives jerusalem newspapers in israel yesterday were full of stories about president bushs call on monday for the creation of a palestinian state and an international peace conference while israeli officials were quoted expressing satisfaction with the fact that "there were no changes in bushs policies " commentators questioned whether the saudis would participate in such a gathering and whether israeli prime minister ehud olmert with his single digit approval ratings could uproot israeli settlers from the west bank but all the focus on the conference misses the point mr bush has not backtracked an inch from his revolutionary middle east policy never before has any american president placed the onus of demonstrating a commitment to peace so emphatically on palestinian shoulders though mr bush insisted that israel refrain from further settlement expansion and remove unauthorized outposts the bulk of his demands were directed at the palestinians "the palestinian people must decide that they want a future of decency and hope " he said "not a future of terror and death they must match their words denouncing terror with action to combat terror " according to mr bush the palestinians can only achieve statehood by first stopping all attacks against israel freeing captured israeli cpl gilad shalit and ridding the palestinian authority of corruption they must also detach themselves from the invidious influence of syria and iran "nothing less is acceptable " in addition to the prerequisites stipulated for the palestinians mr bush set unprecedented conditions for arab participation in peace efforts he exhorted arab leaders to emulate "peacemakers like anwar sadat and king hussein of jordan" by ending anti semitic incitement in their media and dropping the fiction of israels non existence more dramatically mr bush called on those arab governments that have yet to establish relations with israel to recognize its right to exist and to authorize ministerial missions to the jewish state accordingly saudi arabia which has offered such recognition but only in return for a full withdrawal to the borders will have to accept israel prior to any territorial concessions mr bush also urged arab states to wage an uncompromising battle against islamic extremism and in the case of egypt and jordan to open their borders to palestinian trade if the israeli media largely overlooked the diplomatic innovations of mr bushs speech they completely missed its dynamic territorial and demographic dimensions the president pledged to create a "contiguous" palestinian state code for assuring unbroken palestinian sovereignty over most of the west bank and possibly designating a west bank gaza corridor on the other hand the president committed to seek a peace agreement based on "mutually agreed borders" and "current realities " which is a euphemism for israels retention of west bank settlement blocks and no return to the lines most momentous however was mr bushs affirmation that "the united states will never abandon the security of israel as a jewish state and homeland for the jewish people " this means nothing less than the rejection of the palestinians immutable demand for the resettlement of millions of refugees and their descendents in israel america is now officially dedicated to upholding israels jewish majority and preventing its transformation into a de facto palestinian state beyond these elements the centerpiece of mr bushs vision was the international conference the israeli press hastened to interpret this as a framework for expediting the advent of palestinian statehood yet it is clear that the conference is not intended to produce a state but rather to monitor the palestinians progress in building viable civic and democratic institutions the goal mr bush said will be to "help the palestinians establish a strong and lasting society" with "effective governing structures a sound financial system and the rule of law " specifically the conference will assist in reforming the palestinian authority strengthening its security forces and encouraging young palestinians to participate in politics ultimate responsibility for laying these sovereign foundations however rests not with the international community but solely with the palestinians themselves "by following this path palestinians can reclaim their dignity and their future and answer their peoples desire to live in peace " unfortunately many of these pioneering components in mr bushs speech were either implicitly or obliquely stated and one might have wished for a more unequivocal message such as that conveyed in his june speech on the middle east still there can be no underrating the sea change in americas policy toward the israeli palestinian conflict brought about by this administration if under u n resolution israelis were expected to relinquish territory and only then receive peace now the arabs will have to cede many aspects of peace non belligerency and recognition well in advance of receiving territory similarly mr bushs commitment to maintain israels jewish majority signals the total rescinding of american support for resolution which provided for refugee return moreover by insisting that the palestinians first construct durable and transparent institutions before attaining independence mr bush effectively reversed the process set out in the oslo accords whereby the palestinians would obtain statehood immediately and only later engage in institution building peace for land preserving the demographic status quo and building a civil society prior to achieving statehood these are the pillars of mr bushs doctrine on peace but will it work given the palestinians historical inability to sustain sovereign structures and their repeated rejection of offers of a state the chances hardly seem sanguine much of the administrations hope for a breakthrough rests on the palestinians newly appointed prime minister salaam fayyad who is purportedly incorruptible nevertheless one righteous man is unlikely to succeed in purging the palestinian authority of embezzlement and graft and uniting its multiple militias the saudis will probably balk at the notion of recognizing israel before it exits the west bank and jerusalem and palestinian refugees throughout the region will certainly resist any attempt to prevent them from regaining their former homes iran and syria and their hamas proxies can be counted on to undermine the process at every stage often with violence yet despite the scant likelihood of success mr bush is to be credited for delineating clear and equitable criteria for pursuing palestinian independence and for drafting a principled blueprint for peace this alone represents a bold response to hamas and its backers in damascus and tehran the palestinians have been given their diplomatic horizon and the choice between "chaos suffering and the endless perpetuation of grievance " and "security and a better life " so too the president is to be commended for not taking the easy route of railroading the palestinians to self governance under a regime that would almost certainly implode now his paramount task is to stand by the benchmarks his administration has established and to hold both palestinians and israelis accountable for any failure to meet them mr oren is a fellow at the shalem center in jerusalem and the author of "power faith and fantasy america in the middle east to the present" norton
