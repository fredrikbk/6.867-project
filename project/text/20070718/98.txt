politics &amp economics how far will russia take dispute with the west military deployment response to u k move could clarify outlook moscow as russia promises a response to britains expulsion of diplomats and threatens to abrogate a key arms control treaty a central question for the u s and europe is how far moscow will take its deepening chill with the west the answer may emerge soon in kremlin statements about its plans for military deployments and for relations with britain the latest focus of kremlin ire russias foreign ministry said it would make a "targeted and appropriate" response to britains expulsion of four russian diplomats monday itself a retaliation for moscows refusal to extradite a suspect in the poisoning in london of kremlin critic alexander litvinenko most diplomats and analysts believe the kremlins increasingly anti western rhetoric and policies are mainly for domestic consumption ahead of presidential elections next year but the stakes could be high president vladimir putin threatened last week that unless the west addresses russian security concerns he would freeze russias commitment to the conventional forces in europe treaty the agreement limits heavy military deployments in europe and ensures each side knows what movements the other is making another key arms treaty eliminating intermediate range nuclear missiles from europe could fall next in february mr putin said the treaty no longer serves russias interests if russia withdraws that would free moscow to extend the range of its new fast radar evading iskander cruise missiles and as it has occasionally threatened base them in the russian enclave of kaliningrad bordering poland and lithuania russia also has the ability to block any plans sanctioned by the united nations to give independence to kosovo and it can block international efforts to limit irans nuclear program both are foreign policy goals that the u s and europe consider critical for their security in the case of the diplomatic tiff with the united kingdom "this can go far if both sides decide to get into a competition over who can spit farther " said sergei karaganov a dean at moscows higher school of economics "it can rapidly get out of control " analysts say it probably wont get that bad while russia has promised to be firm with britain for example it doesnt want to jeopardize its own citizens ability to travel between russia and the u k where many of the russian elite have property and business interests british companies including bp plc also have major investments in russia that could be damaged in any escalating political conflict similarly military analysts say it makes little strategic sense for russia to rekindle an arms race and the main concern is that ending treaty obligations to allow verification of missile stocks and military deployments could make the future much less predictable "this is a political issue the kremlin is really very bruised and upset at what it sees as the nato alliance trying to impose its will on russia " said rose gottemoeller director of the carnegie endowments moscow center but she noted moscow has left the door open for a deal on the conventional forces in europe treaty leaving days before a suspension takes effect ms gottemoeller said that like western countries russia is spending its defense money on trying to create a leaner more mobile force to dismantle europes arms control treaties and pile up weapons on the borders of the eu which poses "zero threat" to russia would make no sense she said similarly pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which ensures no nuclear missiles based in europe are pointed at russia would be self defeating and while the iskander missile inspires nervous respect within the north atlantic treaty organization deployment in kaliningrad seems unlikely "it makes a handy threat to articulate but i just dont think its where the russians are right now " ms gottemoeller said a greater risk some say is that the kremlin could stir up russian antiforeign sentiments that could burn out of control fanned by kremlin controlled media most russians are increasingly convinced the west is exploiting russian weaknesses and looking to spoil an economic revival that has pulled millions out of the penury of the s anti western sentiment has also taken hold in russias rising wealthier classes who the west had hoped would be closer culturally and politically diplomats and analysts say the kremlins anxiety about next years presidential elections is one reason for the heightened anti western rhetoric mr putin has promised to step down when his term ends while his named successor will presumably win easily in a tightly controlled poll the kremlin is anxious to avoid a fight among the elites over who that successor will be "putin is fanning the image of an external enemy to give him an even stronger hand in controlling the political process over the next seven to eight months " said mark kramer professor of cold war studies at harvard university but mr kramer said some of the anti western campaigns in russia have quickly gotten out of hand in the past after the u s bombing of serbia the government permitted protesters to pelt the u s embassy with paint until someone fired a grenade at the building after the kremlin harshly criticized estonias removal of a soviet era war memorial from its capital earlier this year kremlin backed youth groups besieged estonias embassy in moscow and harassed its ambassador britain whose ambassador complained earlier this year that he has been harassed and stalked by kremlin backed youths in moscow has been singled out for special ire because it has offered safe harbor to some of the kremlins most vociferous critics including oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen separatist leader akhmed zakayev russian state run tv has suggested both have worked for the british intelligence service along with their fellow exile mr litvinenko who was poisoned with polonium in london in november russias foreign ministry yesterday called britains expulsion of four of its diplomats this week "a well staged action to politicize" the death of mr litvinenko who russian state television suggests was killed by mr berezovsky in a plot to mar russias reputation
