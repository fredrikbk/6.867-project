basell in terms of looking at other large acquisitions said mr bigman the deal underscores the companys belief that there is long term value in commonly used commodity chemicals even though many north american and european companies are getting out of that business as new capacity to cheaply produce commodity chemicals builds up in the middle east and asia demand for basic products will continue to be strong and prices will continue to be set in north america and europe because the new capacity wont be enough says mr bigman "if youre focused on long term value and profitability the more basic chemicals are maybe the more interesting place to be " he adds
