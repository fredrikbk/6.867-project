biblical destruction within the last few days a trench two feet deep starting from the northern end of the platform where jerusalems dome of the rock sits has begun working its way toward the southern end of the temple mount the work is being done without any regard for the archaeological information or treasures that may lie below destruction is particularly great in places where bedrock is no deeper than the trench some of the digging is being done with mechanical equipment instead of by hand as a professional archaeological excavation would be conducted i dont know who are worse the muslim religious authorities digging up jerusalems temple mount or the israeli authorities who are allowing it to happen that the waqf the muslim religious trust that serves as custodian of the site should wish to install new electric and telephone lines is understandable provided that the necessary trench is first dug as a professional archaeological excavation that is the required procedure everywhere in israel before work can be undertaken at sites with archaeological significance at the temple mount even more care is required this is the holiest site in the world to jews where the deeply religious fear to tread lest they step on the holy of holies solomons temple and the second temple built by herod the great once stood on this site the site is sacred to muslims as well known in arabic as the haram al sharif the noble sanctuary it is presently graced with the magnificent dome of the rock and al aqsa mosque the waqf is not acting illegally according to one report israeli prime minister ehud olmert has quietly granted permission for this destructive dig otherwise the excavation would be a clear violation of israeli law the israel antiquities authority when queried about the matter replied "no comment " so the dig is proceeding without interference from israeli authorities perhaps their attitude is a product of fear otherwise it is inexplicable significant remains pottery tesserae from ancient mosaics tiles and even architectural fragments have already been observed in the soil from the excavated part of the trench as they have in the past palestinian leaders claim that neither solomons temple nor herods temple ever existed on the site in a recent interview palestinian justice minister taysir tamimi stated "about these so called two temples they never existed certainly not on the haram al sharif " the waqf has a long history of ignoring israels antiquities laws and israel has a long history of ignoring these violations as early as the waqf excavated a pit without supervision that exposed a foot long six foot thick wall that scholars believe may well be the eastern wall of the herodian temple complex an inspector from the antiquities department saw it and composed a handwritten report still unpublished before the wall was dismantled destroyed and covered up presiding over a lawsuit against israels government and the waqf to prevent such depredations israels supreme court found in that the waqf had violated israels antiquities laws on occasions many involving irreversible destruction of important archaeological remains the court declined to enter an injunction however expressing its confidence that in the future israeli authorities would correct their past errors this confidence has proved unfounded in to accommodate a major expansion of an underground mosque into what is known popularly as solomons stables in the southeastern part of the temple mount the waqf dug an enormous stairway down to the mosque hundreds of truckloads of archaeologically rich dirt were dug with mechanical equipment and then dumped into the adjacent kidron valley when archaeology student zachi zweig began to explore the mounds of dirt for antiquities he was arrested at the behest of the israel antiquities authority for excavating without a permit for over two years prof gabriel barkay of bar ilan university together with mr zweig has been engaged in a major sifting operation of this dirt after he obtained a permit from the antiquities authority finds have included thousands of artifacts from all periods going back more than years they include a seal impression of a probable brother of someone mentioned in the bible babylonian arrowheads dating to the destruction of jerusalem in the th century b c as well as other arrowheads from battles on the temple mount thousands of coins many dating to the great revolt against rome beautiful jewelry and even an ancient egyptian scarab protests against these waqf excavations have been lodged by prominent israelis from every point on the political spectrum including from the late mayor teddy kollek author amos oz archaeologists ephraim stern currently head of israels archaeological council ehud netzer who recently discovered the tomb of herod the great eilat mazar who is excavating what may be king davids palace in jerusalem prof barkay who in a long career discovered the oldest biblical text dating to about b c and the nonpolitical committee for the prevention of the destruction of antiquities on the temple mount all to no effect the international community must be mobilized to stop this demolition of history while the waqf would never allow a professional archaeological dig on the site its own destructive excavations continue unabated mr shanks is editor of biblical archaeology review and author of the forthcoming "jerusalems temple mount from solomon to the golden dome" continuum
