the strong euro europeans are fighting over exchange rates again and the rift is instructive about national economic competitiveness american mercantilists who want a devalued dollar might take note almost since he took office two months ago nicolas sarkozy has blamed the euro for la grande nations economic troubles claiming that the single european currency is "overvalued " the new french president said exchange rates and "aggressive" monetary policy should be used to spur growth his pushiness made berlin uncomfortable enough to push back much to the benefit of europe which has little to gain from sarkozy style economic interventionism "it is clear that the independence of the ecb european central bank is a centerpiece of the euro zone " angela merkel said monday after meeting her french counterpart in toulouse kudos to the german chancellor for standing up for the central banks autonomy but mr sarkozys little crusade also misses the economic point leaving aside the bad repercussions for investor confidence and inflation of weakening the ecbs independence monetary policy is neither too tight nor to blame for dragging down the euro economy gdp is forecast to expand by about this year a breakneck speed by european standards at the same time inflation remains stubbornly close to the ecbs comfort zone of an interest rate of is hardly signaling tight monetary policy true the euro has rallied spectacularly this year particularly against the dollar the single currency is up about against the greenback since december alone but so is the british pound which strengthened about vis a vis the dollar during the same period the euros trade weighted index calculated against the currencies of its most important trading partners has risen only about since the beginning of the year and measured against gold the single currencys value has actually declined in other words this is the story more of dollar weakness than euro strength and mr sarkozys complaint is better made to the u s federal reserve than to the ecb frances worsening trade deficit reaching of gdp last year seems to underpin mr sarkozys exchange rate concerns for a country that practically invented mercantilism falling exports hurt french national pride but an "economic patriotism" view of the world hurts frances ability to think clearly the countrys export performance compared to its euro zone peers suggests that home grown problems are far more significant frances market share of euro zone exports has dropped around since the start of the monetary union in germanys by contrast has increased while spains and italys remained roughly unchanged these countries also use the euro and suffer the same interest rates france is losing ground against neighbors especially germany that have passed economic reforms coupled with corporate restructuring and labor flexibility thats what makes their exporters competitive globally and the economy strong french growth which in the past was broadly in line with the euro area average was percentage points below the single currency zones last year france is also stuck with the highest unemployment rate among the countries sharing the euro according to eurostat innovation and outsourcing are keys developed countries need to make the most of in a globalized economy and france is lagging in both only of french enterprises are active in innovation according to a eurostat survey published in february thats the lowest rate among the old european union states unions have made it even more difficult than in other countries to move production sites outside national borders as is their habit the french are turning to the state in search of economic salvation while other eu countries have reduced the size of government in recent years the french went the opposite way in the euro area government spending as a percentage of gdp fell to last year from in in france it rose to from during the same period what might restore frances economic glory are mr sarkozys supply side reform proposals making overtime tax free to end the hour week limiting union powers to shut down the economy during strikes and reducing the size of government are some of his more promising ideas that parliament has begun to discuss for frances sake and the worlds lets hope mr sarkozy sticks to this domestic reform agenda and stays out of euro zone monetary policy
