real estate finance moodys says it is taking hit ratings firm loses business as tougher cmbs stance spurs issuers to rate shop moodys investors service says it is paying a high price for its tough stance on lax lending standards for commercial mortgage backed securities in a new report that assesses the status of the market the moodys corp unit said it was passed over and not hired for of the commercial mortgage backed securities rating assignments issued in the past few months as a result of its requirement that issuers add an extra layer of credit enhancement moodys said issuers are "rating shopping" meaning they were hiring competitors that would hand out higher ratings on securities because moodys makes money rating the creditworthiness of bond issuances blacklisting could potentially eat away at the firms bottom line if the trend continues commercial mortgage backed securities are pools of real estate loans sold to investors as bonds which offer varying levels of risks and rewards assets backing cmbs loans range from office buildings to shopping centers cmbs volume in the u s soared to &# billion during the first six months of this year a increase from &# billion in the year earlier period according to industry newsletter commercial mortgage alert but on april moodys put the brakes on this frenzy by announcing it was raising subordination levels of commercial mortgage backed securities in an effort to enhance the credit quality and further reduce the possibility of widespread defaults this meant the ratings agency would require an increase in the amount of lower rated bonds needed in transactions to take losses before the higher rated ones were affected a move that raises the cost of structuring the securities for the issuer in a cmbs pool lower rated bonds or those at the subordinate level can offer better returns than the more highly rated investment grade bonds but the lower rated bonds are the first to be hit with losses the moodys edict sent shock waves through the real estate world at a time when there were already fears the subprime mortgage implosion which mainly affected the residential sector would spill over to the commercial side the cmbs market is about half the size of the securitized residential mortgage market but the moodys announcement gave credence to concerns about frothiness in the commercial market scaring investors and forcing banks to raise yields on cmbs offerings to make them more attractive among moodys concerns were interest only loans and property valuations based on aggressively underwritten cash flows at a time of record low initial yields moodys now says it is taking a hit for being the first rating service to publicly announce it would significantly raise subordination levels in a report on the cmbs market scheduled for release today moodys wrote it has been shut out of eight of the past deals with a face value of &# billion since april "we used to rate of the deals but since our announcement we were not asked to rate of them " says tad philipp a managing director for moodys "our market share has done a complete flip " on a recent cmbs offering issued by morgan stanley which included fixed rate loans on multifamily commercial and manufactured housing community properties s&amp p and fitch issued the ratings morgan stanley didnt return calls seeking comment on why it selected these two rating outlets moodys says it cannot comment on the details of a specific deal or issuer but suspects its higher subordination levels are the reason it isnt in on most of the deals analysts say the rejection of moodys by some issuers typically investment banks is a direct result of its april announcement since the lower rated bonds needed to increase subordination levels are more expensive moodys move could trim profit margins for cmbs issuers it is customary practice for cmbs deals to be rated by two agencies so moodys two ratings rivals fitch ratings and standard &amp poors a unit of mcgraw hill cos are the likely beneficiaries for their part both say they share moodys concerns about lax underwriting but havent seen the need yet for wholesale change an s&amp p spokesman says "these concerns have already been incorporated into our approach to rating cmbs " fitch managing director zanda lynn admits the ratings agency has been on a few more deals during the third quarter but she chalks it up to investor appreciation of its methodology alan todd executive director and head of cmbs research for jp morgan securities a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co wrote in a recent note that neither s&amp p nor fitch has explicitly announced that they will increase subordination requirements on upcoming transactions but he expects they will slowly do so "they will just do it more quietly " he said in an interview jennifer s forsyth contributed to this article
