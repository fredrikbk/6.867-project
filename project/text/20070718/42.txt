dow jones board approves sale backing of news corp offer puts pressure on family a bancroft exits meeting the board of dow jones &amp co voted to approve news corp s &# billion bid for the company last night with two directors abstaining from the vote and one leaving the meeting early according to people familiar with the matter leslie hill a member of the bancroft family and dieter von holtzbrinck abstained from the vote while christopher bancroft who has been actively seeking alternatives to the news corp bid left the meeting early these people said one person familiar with the deliberations said that legal liability prevented the two bancroft members from registering "no" votes but that their sentiment was against the deal the backing of the member board sends the offer to the bancroft family which controls the majority voting power of the company for a final vote the family is set to meet monday and will be given several days to consider the deal the boards endorsement puts some pressure on the bancrofts to back a sale but doesnt obligate family members who have been divided over the bid to do so dow jones chief executive richard f zannino bancroft family trustee michael b elefante and bancroft family member lisa steele voted to recommend the offer mr zannino had previously said he took no position on the deal the board of dow jones issued a statement saying it "would be prepared to approve and recommend to the dow jones stockholders including the bancroft family stockholders " the news corp proposal at &# a share news corp said it was "grateful" to dow joness board for its vote dow jones also said in its statement that news corp s board would authorize the deal if enough members of the bancroft family "indicate promptly" their support for a deal by signing voting agreements heading into the meeting dow jones which publishes the wall street journal and advisers to the family saw family approval as too close to call said people familiar with the situation family advisers estimated that they would need less than half of the familys voting power or about of the total voting power in the company to win approval of a deal because they expected a high number of nonfamily holders would support the transaction news corp also indicated that shareholders would be able to receive designated news corp shares for their dow jones stock such exchanges can help ease the tax burden for shareholders though holders could also get cash family members and company executives were hoping to extract a few extra dollars from the &# a share originally offered by news corp chairman and chief executive rupert murdoch but none was forthcoming at this stage pushback from the family could produce a slightly higher offer in the very final stages or scuttle a deal the lack of full bancroft endorsement could be a blow to mr murdoch and the rest of dow jones management who have worked hard to create editorial independence guidelines for the company under news corp "if theres a dissenting director the approval is still perfectly valid " said joel greenberg a mergers expert at law firm kaye scholer but he said "you could damage the asset being sold and it does give any plaintiff trying to attack a deal a good source of information to tap " those kinds of worries are why boards of directors push aggressively to secure unanimity in approving mergers and acquisitions it also protects their own liability from shareholder suits but when it does happen the dissent is nearly always tied to the price or strategy underlying the transaction as of yesterday afternoon two of the companys family directors were actively engaged in pursuing alternatives to mr murdoch according to people familiar with the matter christopher bancroft has been talking to internet entrepreneur brad greenspan about a proposal to buy a portion of the company mr greenspan who has talked to other family members was working on a more detailed proposal to send to dow jones representatives yesterday and is looking for investors according to a person familiar with the matter mr greenspan is working with advisers at new york firm dinosaur securities mr bancroft serves as a trustee overseeing shares that account for about of the companys total shareholder votes ms hill owns less than of the companys voting power her mother jane cox macelree serves as a trustee for or owns shares that account for about of it the family initially rejected mr murdochs offer only to reverse itself and agree to sit down and talk to him about six weeks ago after several weeks of delays occupied by negotiations on an editorial independence agreement and due diligence events quickened monday when the heads of the two companies had lunch at news corp headquarters representing dow jones were mr zannino company advisers and two of the companys directors lewis b campbell ceo of textron inc and m peter mcpherson the board chairman over a lunch of chicken breasts and salmon in a small corporate dining room mr murdoch looked confident and relaxed after attending a summit of media executives in idaho last week according to people familiar with the meeting messrs mcpherson campbell and zannino all said they were uncertain about the familys position these people said mr mcpherson said the two sides had made progress in coming to an agreement on editorial principles to protect dow jones and that it would be a shame not to "get across the goal line" with the family one of these people said each of the directors told mr murdoch that the familys vote was difficult to call and that by raising his offer he would increase his chances of winning them over mr murdoch listened to the directors pleas but told them "it was hard enough to get my board to &# " according to a person familiar with the discussion news corp s total investment in dow jones would be much greater than the &# billion value of the offer given that news corp would have to take on dow joness debt and medical liabilities and make other investments in the company the two sides discussed how the familys vote would likely break down both said they expected about half of the familys vote was leaning in favor of a deal later in the conversation mr murdoch raised a subject previously discussed between the two sides the possibility of nominating wall street journal editor at large paul steiger to news corp s board of directors these people said the editorial independence pact provides for a board seat as well as five members of an independent board that would oversee the hiring and firing of three dow jones editors and otherwise have certain rights to protect editorial integrity mr steiger who stepped down as managing editor of the journal this spring and is scheduled to retire from the company at the end of the year said he hadnt been contacted about such a plan "nobody has talked to me about this " said mr steiger who continues to oversee the journals coverage of the deal the bancroft family is expected to meet monday in boston home base of hemenway &amp barnes the law firm that manages most of the familys holdings and will conduct the voting process the family poll wont be a simple head count the firm is expected to conduct the vote according to the voting power of individual family members and trustees while most family members own some shares directly the vast majority of the familys stake is held in trust some family members own more stock than others or are beneficiaries of a larger portion of the family fortune that means only a minority of the family is necessary to sell the company mr elefante the familys lead trustee and a dow jones board member will play a crucial role mr elefante sits on most of the familys key trusts and a number of family members have relied on his counsel in forming their own opinions on the offer mr elefante and a hemenway &amp barnes colleague kurt f somerville are the only trustees on one of the familys biggest trusts indeed mr elefante has told board colleagues he can deliver a little less than half of the familys stake that rough one third of the companys voting power likely would be enough to cement a sale to mr murdoch that is because some of the total voting power of the company rests in the hands of non bancrofts almost all of these holders many of them arbitragers are expected to support the deal only of the voting power is required for approval but news corp will need to leave itself some extra margin given a chunk of shares typically remain unvoted in merger
