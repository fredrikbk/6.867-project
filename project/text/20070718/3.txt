abbey lincoln in command new york i never thought of myself as a philosopher " abbey lincoln said sitting on a brown velvet sofa in the parlor of her upper west side manhattan apartment "but i am i think about the life i live a figure made of clay i think about the things i lost the things i gave away " two sentences in ms lincoln had slipped from spoken reflection to reflexive singing quoting her song "throw it away " yet it was seamless so natural was the flow an organic declarative power is perhaps the greatest charm of ms lincolns artistry during a career that spans more than a half century she has emerged as one of this countrys most commanding singers defining jazz vocal values even as she transcends the genre rising in stature as shes aged at despite recent open heart surgery shes unfettered and in moments bursting with energy "im still writing every day " she says sitting across the room from the baby grand piano at which she often composes and surrounded by some of the portraits shes painted over the years her father her mother "the merry dancer " a mythical figure for which she named one song her sprawling but modest ground floor apartment is filled with artifacts of those who have inspired ms lincoln a bust of saxophonist charlie parker a photo of singer billie holiday and of her achievements a national endowment for the arts "jazz masters" award but its no museum she envisions the place one day as a community arts center moseka house after the name she was given years ago by an official in zaire born anna marie woolridge in the th of children ms lincoln began her performing career as gaby lee early on she met the lyricist bob russell who became her manager "hes the one who named me abbey lincoln " she recalled "he told me abraham lincoln didnt free the slaves but maybe you can handle it " the most liberating elements of ms lincolns legacy may be her original compositions and lyrics back in ms lincoln performed a star studded three night stand at manhattans alice tully hall billed as "an anthology of her songs " the concerts seemed like a slowly unfurling banner of identity from a singer who manages to exude both an elders wisdom and a childs wonder who suggests by example the many paths possible for jazz vocalists willing to go their own way shell likely summon the same spirit in august headlining both days of new yorks charlie parker jazz festival on the new "abbey sings abbey" verve ms lincoln frees her compositions from their previous trappings theres not a piano to be heard on these tracks ms lincolns rich supple and slightly grainy voice is instead in the company of acoustic electric and pedal steel guitars with bass drums and an occasional accordion or cello the recording leans on ms lincolns relationship with jean philippe allard the producer and polygram france executive who nearly years ago signed her to what is now the verve music group ms lincolns "the world is falling down " released in at a time when both she and the label were reviving their profiles was both a commercial and critical success eight albums followed with musical collaborators ranging from saxophonist stan getz to tap dancer savion glover helping solidify the reputations of both singer and label but mr allard and jay newland the engineer for most of ms lincolns albums had long envisioned a more straight forward less refined presentation of ms lincolns songs "we heard them as folk tunes " said mr allard from his paris office ms lincoln had in fact planted the suggestion herself with her version a decade ago of bob dylans "mr tambourine man " and last year while working on an album by the african pop singer ayo messrs allard and newland captured ms lincolns "and its supposed to be love" in a rootsy arrangement by guitarist larry campbell ms lincoln who was in the studio for that take approved "how can we strip so much away without losing something " mr campbell recalled wondering of his assignment for "abbey sings abbey " "i wasnt sure it would work or that abbey would like it but the songs themselves are so powerful i was a fool to worry " jazz bassist scott colley and drummer shawn pelton known primarily for rock grounded most tunes in the slow swing ms lincoln favors but they find new grooves too especially on "the music is the magic " three songs feature accordionist gil goldstein and cellist dave eggar as arranged by mr goldstein "there arent many people who can write tunes like these " said mr goldstein "that sound so familiar youd think they must have existed a long time ago " of course theres much life history packed into these songs a half century ago ms lincoln had spent two years in honolulu singing in nightclubs and catching an earful when theyd visit of billie holiday and louis armstrong whose styles greatly influenced her own soon after she appeared with jayne mansfield in the film "the girl cant help it " in performance she garnered attention as much for how well she filled out a red dress formerly worn by marilyn monroe as for her voice "max said that he hated that dress " ms lincoln recalled of drummer max roach who was her husband from to "i burned it and never looked back " with mr roach she was drawn into a world of cutting edge musicianship and bold activism in ms lincolns electrifying cries were emblematic of the outrage underpinning mr roachs landmark album "we insist freedom now suite " her original lyrics for her album "straight ahead" candid sparked discussion of racial prejudice and even prompted one critic to brand her a "professional negro " "we all paid a price " she said calmly but it was important to say something it still is " cassandra wilson is one of many singers who feel a great debt to ms lincoln "she opened up doors " ms wilson once told me "not just in the sense of career possibilities but as empowerment to be myself when i sang " and for alto saxophonist steve coleman who has performed and recorded with ms lincoln "the most unusual thing about her is her brilliant sense of phrasing and placement its a unique sense of time something difficult to put into words but essential to real freedom " "abbey sings abbey" opens with the albums one melody not composed by ms lincoln "blue monk " by pianist thelonious monk for which she wrote lyrics in it ends with ms lincolns "being me " which contains the line "being me i dared to be myself alone " ms lincoln did and still does bearing jazz culture like few before her mr blumenfeld is a katrina media fellow with the open society institute documenting the experiences of musicians in new orleans he writes about jazz for the journal
