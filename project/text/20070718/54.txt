fix picks the british open online edition in carnoustie quickly became "car nastie " and who can ever forget how it happened the brutality of the insanely tight fairways and the devilishly high and thick fescue became evident to the horrified onlookers when the first round leader rod pampling followed up his opening with a nightmarish to become the only first round leader in the history of golfs major championships to miss the halfway cut no one since has lived through such a horror oh and something else happened on sunday with a frenchman who rolled up his trousers to show us his nice legs while standing in the barry burn but im sure no one can remember exactly what it was given french history im sure the guy didnt surrender easily ahhh i kid of course we remember jean van de velde who can forget just as i can tell you where i was during any number of political assassination attempts in my youth i remember exactly where i was in a now prominent member of espns football broadcasting staff then a member of the same golf club as i was stuck his head inside the clubhouse door after finishing a round with his son "whats up with the golf " he asked "van de velde is on the th tee with a three shot lead " i answered "i dont need to see this " he said and left but in what has become something of golfs zapruder tape the van de velde tape has been shown endlessly on tv im surprised congress didnt investigate for this years visit to carnoustie for the th playing of golfs oldest championship weve been promised a nicer softer friendlier carnoustie and the golfing gods seemed to have delivered on that promise even if the r&amp a didnt really mean what it said scotland never to be confused with the sahara desert is even greener than normal crayola is looking for a deeper green for its crayons the weather has been wet cold and wet some more without even of a rumor of the sun the grass hasnt grown the rough is wispy puddles appeared on the greens this week but then the wind ah the wind is always the question in scotland isnt it following the years first two majors at the brutal augusta national and the even more brutal oakmont soft would be nice wouldnt it dont believe it at yards par carnoustie is the longest course in the open championship rota and the final three holes would drive a scotsman to drink or more likely not to drink theyre that tough with the wet and cold the course will only play longer as the fairways wont have much run the balls wont fly as far and the golfers themselves will be looking for a wee dram while the winning score might not be six over par as it was in there arent a whole lot of birdie holes out there and what birdie holes there are come on the opening nine this is a major championship man so hitch up your kilt and get on with it just remember to put some warm shorts on underneath tiger woods is of course the two time defending british open champ he is on one of his streaks but one that is amazing for how little attention its gotten woods has clearly spoiled us in the past four majors he has finished first first second and second and yet his "failure" to hold mid round sunday leads in the years first two majors is what were talking about and maybe im guilty of setting the bar too high for im about to dismiss the chances of this three time champ he won in too woods has won the open championship with scores of and under par in other words when his driver doesnt betray him and its a putting chipping and imagination contest by hitting only one driver in holes last year woods demonstrated yet again that no one has a more imaginative or stronger mind in the game this year is more of a straightforward test the other streak of failing to hold on to a lead as we head into the years third major one that greg norman managed to do by himself back in all four of s majors is by the australian contingent which is halfway through the "saturday slam " aussie stuart appleby held the saturday night lead at this years masters while countryman aaron baddeley was atop the u s open leaderboard on saturday night at oakmont while norman held the lead on the four saturdays in he won only the british open will aussies take this years open championship i think not no the fix pick for this years open championship is jim furyk he finished fourth last year tenth in at this course and high up the leaderboard at the years first two majors including a tie for second with woods at last months u s open he was fifth and third in his last two starts on the pga tour furyk is capable of a putting exhibition such as van de velde put on in but is golf smart enough not to hit driver two iron into the gunk with a three shot lead on the final hole of course if the rain continues to fall a second choice would be the u s open winner argentine angel cabrera his nickname the duck mr carroll a news editor at the print journal plans to watch this years open in a rainsuit with a bottle of whisky at his side he can be
