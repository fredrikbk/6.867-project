common sense whole foods chief disappoints by sowing wild oats online smartmoney there are probably only a handful of chief executives who could plausibly serve as role models for capitalism and i wouldve put whole foods market ceo john mackey among them he transformed the grocery shopping experience for millions of americans when whole foods results disappointed investors he slashed his salary to &# a year now we learn that mr mackey assumed an online identity to extol whole foods and bash rival wild oats markets you can imagine the sinking feeling i felt as i read these and other details of his online persona ive put my own money in whole foods stock which has paid off handsomely and encouraged others by recommending it repeatedly in this column most recently ive praised the proposed merger with wild oats lambasted the federal trade commission for its misguided antitrust action and recommended investing in wild oats so this is more than a passing disappointment when a ceo misbehaves it has practical implications for millions of investors and in this case me i use the word "misbehave" with some deliberation mr mackey has staunchly defended his right to assume a fictitious identity and say whatever he wants in cyberspace im not disputing that and ill leave it to regulators to decide if any laws were broken the evident thrill of assuming a false identity online or otherwise eludes me but im not so naive as to pretend it isnt there think of all the literature in which masquerade balls figure prominently no one suggests that dressing up donning masks and assuming another identity is wrong on the contrary its fun the problem is when a false identity and the accompanying lack of accountability leads to unacceptable behavior sometimes with tragic consequences with the advent of the internet assuming fictitious identities has become rampant and the online alter ego even has a warm and fuzzy name sock puppet still the premise of mr mackeys comments that he was a nonpaid fan of whole foods and critic of wild oats was false even if the sentiments themselves were genuine they werent at least not all the time mr mackey has said he sometimes played "devils advocate " saying things he didnt believe no one would have given his views much credence if hed used his real name and title more to the point if he had used his real name he most likely wouldnt have said these things none of this changes my view that the ftc is way off base in challenging the proposed wild oats merger on antitrust grounds if anything the revelations would seem to undercut the agencys reliance on mr mackeys own descriptions of whole foods market dominance and its ability to crush a rival he is hardly a reliable source as the embarrassing puffery on the internet makes clear since these revelations wild oats share and option prices have dropped evidently on concern that the deal is less likely this week the stock is trading at about &# whole foods has offered &# a share in cash that makes my arbitrage strategy all the more attractive still its a reminder that there are no sure bets in investing who would have guessed that deal prospects would be rattled by something so bizarre longer term i believe mr mackey needs to demonstrate some humility a little contrition and a lot more maturity he doesnt have to give up his individuality and quirkiness which have served him and investors well no one is perfect and this neednt be more than a blemish on mr mackeys record but just because something is legal doesnt mean you should do it especially when youre the ceo of a publicly traded company mr mackey is a role model a highly compensated and visible one and should hold himself to the higher standards that customers suppliers employees and investors are depending on james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
