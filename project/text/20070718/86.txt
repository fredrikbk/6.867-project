no cancer benefit found in mega veggie diet study associated press hopes that a diet low in fat and chock full of fruits and vegetables could prevent the return of breast cancer were dashed by a large seven year experiment in more than women the government study found no benefit from a megaveggies and fruit diet over the u s recommended servings of five fruits and vegetables a day researchers noted that none of the breast cancer survivors lost weight on either diet that led some experts to suggest that weight loss and exercise should be the next frontier for cancer research the study appears in todays journal of the american medical association "it sends us back to the drawing board " said susan gapstur of northwestern universitys feinberg school of medicine who wasnt involved in the new study but co wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal "should we really have focused on dietary components like fruits vegetables and fat " ms gapstur asked "or should we be focusing in addition to diet on lifestyle factors including physical activity and weight " for now the message for the million breast cancer survivors in the u s is that they dont need to go overboard on veggies researchers said "this should really lift some of the guilt if women are feeling im just not doing enough " said study co author marcia stefanick of stanford university the research was kicked off by a &# million grant from the late wal mart heir john walton and got an additional &# million in support from the national cancer institute earlier research on whether a healthy diet prevents breast cancer has shown mixed results the new study was designed to be more rigorous in this experiment all the women had been successfully treated for early stage breast cancer their average age was when the study began a group of women were randomly assigned to a daily diet that included five vegetable servings three fruit servings ounces of vegetable juice and grams of fiber in most cases a serving equaled a half cup french fries and iceberg lettuce couldnt be counted as vegetables the women were allowed to eat meat but were told to get no more than to of their calories from fat a goal they ultimately were unable to achieve as a comparison another women were assigned to get educational materials about the importance of eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day the women in both groups kept food diaries regularly but not daily through the course of the study during the next seven years the cancer returned in about the same proportion of women in both groups women on the special diet and women in the comparison group about of both groups died during that time most of them from breast cancer in the megaveggies group the women changed their eating habits substantially mostly by increasing fruits and vegetables to as much as servings a day they failed to meet the fat target but did eat less in fat calories than did the comparison group
