leading the news business kkr blackstone ipos put their style at risk for decades kohlberg kravis roberts and blackstone group have been chock full of ideas about how to run companies better go private load up on debt push big equity stakes into managers hands make gutsy decisions without being at the mercy of short term market reaction that formula has created many billions of dollars of wealth so its eerie to see these two savvy u s investment firms straying from their own precepts as they rush to go public blackstones initial public offering now trades at less than its opening day price even as the overall market has surged kkr is running a few weeks behind it has filed to go public but hasnt completed its offering the firms unwittingly created a big headache for themselves by showing in their ipo filings how rich their top executives have become aided by friendly tax treatment its never wise to tell people youve outwitted the taxman sure enough the multibillionaire status of blackstones steve schwarzman and kkrs henry kravis has touched off a crusade to tax deal makers gains at higher rates but theres a more fundamental problem blackstone and kkr cant readily combine their scrappy operating styles with the niceties of a public listing in the sarbanes oxley era despite well intentioned gestures in their prospectuses both private equity firms have created a transgenic mess take something as basic as outside directors private partnerships dont have them public companies do so kkr and blackstone are getting their first dose of outside board involvement yet both firms have opted for voting and governance structures that keep decisions with the insiders who have called the shots since kkr and blackstone opened their doors thats fine until the firms face a decision where insiders interests dont clearly align with those of outside holders what bonuses should top producers enjoy how much cash should be reinvested for all shareholders benefit and what level of overhead is appropriate many private equity shops enjoy expensive china renowned art and the like even if independent directors are figureheads they need to argue the public investors case acknowledging this blackstone and kkr have set up "conflicts committees" on the board which will scrutinize quandaries lets hope for the best but any enterprise that regards a conflicts committee as a necessary part of good governance may be off to a shaky start it gets worse as private partnerships both firms made gutsy decisions without worrying what outsiders thought kkr did no deals in resisting pressure to stay active during a market slump it spent years trying to crack the european market without much luck before creating a major profit center it will be a lot harder to stick by such maverick decisions amid public ownership with all the quarterly earnings calls shareholder resolutions and investor hubbub that comes with at some level both firms know this over the years blackstone and kkr partners have been eloquent advocates for the virtues of being private both for the companies they acquire and for their own shops as they told it being private encouraged wise long term decisions independent of fickle public holders who fixated on quarterly performance so what changed their minds quiet period regulations prevent kkr and blackstone from saying much about their decisions to go public which do seem to fly in the face of the firms traditional philosophies cynics suggest that its mostly about market timing exploiting the current bull market to fetch hefty valuations in their ipo documents kkr and blackstone lay out a sober minded business case for going public among other things they argue that it will deepen their pools of capital help them make acquisitions and create efficiencies in syndicating their largest investments perhaps both firms are well run profit machines that have expanded brilliantly in recent years but the cachet and flexibility associated with a strong stock can vanish when markets head south thats an especially serious problem for expertise oriented firms including private equity shops that rely enormously on maintaining a strong public image blackstone spokesman john ford says his firm doesnt intend to let its stock price become "a distraction " thats easier said than done a skidding stock can make lenders more hesitant to finance deals or chief executives more reluctant to hitch their fates to a particular private equity groups proposal in extreme cases that downward cycle can feed itself in ways that are hard to stop theres a historical parallel from a long ago bull market in booz allen hamilton inc the management consulting firm went public at &# a share after a strong run of growth doubters muttered about conflict of interest hazards and the erratic nature of public markets booz allen executives at the time minimized such fears adding that the new access to capital markets would be a boon the worriers were right hard times hit within months employee morale suffered a former booz allen executive remembers that board meetings became uncomfortable as the lone independent director agonized over decisions that might affect insiders and public investors in different ways eventually booz allens leadership opted to go private again other holders were cashed out in by then the firms fortunes had changed so much that the going private deal was done at &# a share
