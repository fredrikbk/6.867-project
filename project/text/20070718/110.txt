shoppers arent swayed by credit disclosure data credit card disclosure information designed to prevent consumers from overspending may have the opposite effect on many shoppers according to a new study that suggests new bankruptcy laws may not be working as intended the study paid for by the american bankruptcy institute and the ford foundation concludes emotion plays a much larger role in consumer spending behavior than awareness of credit card debt for many shoppers the study asserts knowledge of interest rates and mounting debt can be so depressing that it spurs them to binge to alleviate the gloom "shopping is a highly emotional experience for people " said the studys author richard wiener a professor of law and psychology at the university of nebraska "people who have the tendency to shop to end a bad mood are unlikely to be influenced by enhanced disclosure for them it will not reduce spending " of the consumers whose spending decisions were studied by mr wiener about one out of every five said they tended to shop to end a bad mood mr wiener said the proportion among consumers in general could be higher because many consumers dont understand how moods influence their spending decisions the findings could put pressure on both lawmakers and credit card companies to find new ways to educate consumers about spending related emotions the abi a nonpartisan organization that represents more than bankruptcy professionals and academics said the credit card industry had no role in financing the study the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of requires credit card companies to provide customers with specific information detailing how interest rates will affect their credit card bills that requirement was aimed at discouraging consumers from excessive credit card use by clearly explaining the effects of high interest rates and long pay off periods a senate bill the credit card minimum payment warning act would require heightened disclosure of the consequences surrounding making only the minimum monthly payments on credit card debt mr wiener said his study indicated the legislation may not work as planned either "we all know how good it feels to take out that credit card and buy movie tickets or a new vcr " he said "what the disclosure data attempt to create is wise use of credit through simply providing information but that doesnt go far enough " mr wieners study involved a random sample of individuals who filed for bankruptcy in new york and nebraska it also involved consumers in those states who didnt file for bankruptcy both sets of participants were asked to answer a survey and engage in a simulated "online shopping trip" designed to explore how they made spending decisions half the participants received credit card disclosure information that had been the standard before current bankruptcy laws took effect in the other half received the standard information under current laws the results showed the enhanced disclosure information worked only on shoppers who had been ambivalent about making a purchase anyway it had no effect on those who had strong emotions about the purchase the enhanced disclosure had little effect on shoppers credit card knowledge "we found that even when we gave people enhanced disclosure information they did not gain an understanding of their credit cards " mr wiener said mr wiener said credit card companies have an incentive to push for an approach to disclosure that actually benefits consumers "the responsible approach is to come up with strategies to actually help consumers understand how their emotional reactions work with credit " he said "hopefully now the credit card companies will take up the battle " some consumer psychology experts warn that even emotional instruction wont solve the problem "you can warn people all you want about the problems of taking on high interest debt but its not until you offer a positive alternative that people will change " said travis plunkett the legislative director for the consumer federation of america in washington
