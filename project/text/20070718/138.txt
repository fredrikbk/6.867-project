when the irs shows mercy to home sellers being a crime victim is usually no cause for celebration but there is at least one consolation the irs may give you a tax break when you sell your home most people who sell their home after having owned it for at least two years dont have to pay federal taxes on their gain a sale in less than two years after the purchase however often triggers some sort of tax hit but even owners who need to sell in less than two years may qualify for special relief if they had to sell because of "unforeseen circumstances " according to a law while those words can be hard to define a recent survey of internal revenue service rulings indicates the agency generally has been "very sympathetic" to taxpayers in cases of unexpected distress such as crime victims says gail levin richmond a law professor at nova southeastern university law center in davie fla looking for ways to protect gains from home sales may seem counterintuitive in view of the current housing slump but while prices generally have flattened or fallen in many parts of the country in recent months home values in many markets are still significantly higher than they were two years earlier sellers may still be able to reap handsome short term gains even if their home doesnt fetch the price they once had dreamed about says david stiff chief economist at fiserv lending solutions in cambridge mass a unit of fiserv inc the general rule is that you can exclude a gain of as much as &# if filing a joint return with your spouse or as much as &# if single or filing separately under certain circumstances to be eligible for this full exclusion you typically must have owned your home and lived in it as your primary residence for at least two of the five years prior to the sale this rule applies only to your main residence not a vacation home even if you cant meet the two year tests you still may be eligible for a reduced exclusion if you had to sell because of "a change in place of employment " health reasons or those "unforeseen circumstances " an irs publication offers a general definition of unforeseen circumstances as "the occurrence of an event that you could not reasonably have anticipated before buying and occupying your main home " but how does the irs react when presented with specific taxpayer queries in the latest issue of a quarterly publication of the american bar association tax section ms richmond summarizes so called private letter rulings since in which the irs agreed that taxpayers had sold in less than two years because of "unforeseen circumstances " the irs rulings dont identify any of the taxpayers or give dollar amounts technically a private letter ruling applies only to the taxpayer who requested it and isnt supposed to be used or cited as precedent but such rulings are considered important anyway by lawyers and accountants because they offer a window into the irss thinking in one ruling a taxpayer had to provide a separate bedroom in order to adopt an orphan child from another country in another ruling released recently marriage was the issue taxpayers a and b each had purchased a home later they met got married and bought a new larger home for their blended family they each sold their prior homes taxpayer b had owned it less than two years the irs said the occurrence of the marriage and the need to "suitably accommodate their blended family" represented "unforeseen circumstances " crime victims often win the irss sympathy in one case a taxpayer was leaving home when an assailant held a gun to the taxpayers head and forced the taxpayer into the taxpayers car "the assailant was agitated unpredictable and made repeated threats" on the taxpayers life the irs said in the ruling for about an hour the taxpayer was forced at gunpoint to drive the assailant to several locations including an atm and withdraw money for the crook the irs concluded that the taxpayers main reason for selling that home was an unforeseen circumstance in another case two taxpayers moved from one state to another bought a home and then became aware of "various criminal activities" in their new neighborhood their son was assaulted and threatened and one of the taxpayers was assaulted by several neighbors resulting in a trip to the hospital emergency room because of the assault and general nature of the neighborhood the two taxpayers sold their home and bought a new one the irs agreed the "primary reason" for the sale was an unforeseen circumstance calculating the reduced maximum exclusion can often be tricky heres a simple example suppose you and your spouse sold your home at a &# profit after having owned and lived in it for only one year you sold because of a move from new york to california to take a new job or some other unforeseen circumstance since the exclusion amount is pro rated you typically would qualify for half the maximum exclusion since you had owned the home for half of the two year period and thus would be able to exclude your entire &# gain see irs publication for more details on second thought never mind a federal appeals court panel reverses its own decision at issue was whether marrita murphy owed taxes on a &# award from her former employer for "emotional distress" and loss of reputation the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit panel ruled last summer that the award didnt represent "income" within the meaning of the th amendment and wasnt taxable the court also said a tax law was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed taxation of awards for mental distress and loss of reputation the justice department asked the court to rehear the case the panel did so and changed its mind "we reject murphys argument in all aspects " the panel said much to the dismay of ms murphys lawyers others however praised the decision mary b hevener a washington lawyer at baker &amp mckenzie wrote a poem that concluded "the service today is relieved the law reads as it had believed ms murphy is taxed the tax bars relaxed her arguments were ill conceived " briefs sen john ensign a nevada republican joins the senate finance committee readers seeking
