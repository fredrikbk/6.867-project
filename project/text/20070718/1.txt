i feel like an idiot land project gone wrong shows how even well off lured by go go climate spruce pine n c on a crisp fall afternoon in a crowd gathered under a big tent near the penland school of crafts an artists colony tucked in the blue ridge mountains while a harpist played real estate developer tony porter talked up a plan he promised could bring big financial payoffs to the isolated community and anyone who invested in it at the party and in subsequent sessions mr porter and others at his company peerless real estate services inc described his vision for a lot residential and retail development called the village of penland according to people who heard the pitches and received promotional documents mr porter said the village would provide places for artists to live and sell their work to baby boomers and retirees who were flocking to the area in droves and rapidly driving up land values but the developer said he needed investors to launch the project in time to catch the real estate wave to help them get in on the action mr porter promised to arrange loans of as much as &# million according to offering documents and other materials circulated by mr porters company and reviewed by the wall street journal even more enticing mr porter and documents promoting the project said investors would receive large cash payments as much as of the proceeds when the loans closed the investors also were promised they wouldnt have to make down payments with their own money and mr porter or one of his companies would make their monthly mortgage payments for at least a year according to the documents in a civil suit filed in june by the north carolina attorney general against mr porter and more than a dozen associates and related companies the suits alleges they used inflated appraisals and phony down payments and performed other misdeeds to cheat investors and mislead the banks over the next several years investigators say nearly investors mostly well heeled professionals including real estate lawyers doctors and air force officers borrowed more than &# million from a handful of banks including winston salem n c based bb&amp t corp the th largest u s bank nearly all of the money was turned over to mr porter nearly five years after the tent party no houses have been built weeds are invading the lawn at the empty sales office payments stopped on many loans in april or may according to borrowers and court records it isnt clear what happened to the money mr porter collected some was allegedly spent on other real estate projects and luxury trips by investors and employees of mr porters company to the greek islands and swiss alps "these developers squandered more than &# million in financing leaving consumers stuck with property that isnt worth what they owe on it " said attorney general roy cooper "i feel like an idiot now " says henry gerrits an engineer in cary n c who worked with mr porter to borrow &# and then invested it in penland purchasing four vacant lots mr porters lawyer douglas kingsbery says the developer is at an unspecified location in north carolina and unavailable to comment he says mr porter disputes allegations in the suit and "very much wants to do everything he can to make sure that all of the individuals who invested in the project receive all of their money back " the lawyer said he couldnt comment further due to the "active criminal investigation " most of the attention surrounding sub prime and high risk lending in recent months has focused on lower income or high risk borrowers who didnt realize they were taking loans that would be difficult to repay but the village of penland project shows how the go go climate of a real estate boom combined with an environment of easy borrowing also infected well off borrowers with healthy credit records many of whom now say they should have realized the deals were too good to be true no one has been charged with a crime but state and federal agents are combing through the penland project the suit by north carolina attorney general alleges that mr porter and several associates engaged in a "continuing pattern of unfair and deceptive business practices " including using "insider sales" to artificially inflate the apparent value of the land they were selling and submitting multiple applications for loans secured by the same piece of property the suit demands that the defendants refund the &# million in loan proceeds borrowed by investors and repay the loans federal bureau of investigation agents have raided mr porters office the fbi wont confirm or deny an investigation jimmy tallent chief executive of united community banks inc blairsville ga with &# million in loans tied to the project says he now believes mr porters project was built on defrauding his and other banks that many borrowers misrepresented their financial situation on loan documents and that the cash payments from the developer at the closings were improper "when you add all of that together that is wrong that is fraud that is criminal " mr tallent says mr porter who is fond of slapping backs and sporting hawaiian shirts was welcomed by many in this picturesque corner of the appalachians when he bought more than forested acres in his credibility was bolstered by a &# million loan obtained in from a predecessor of alesco financial inc a lender based in philadelphia that was used at least partly to get the north carolina project underway alesco declined to comment mr gerrits became intrigued when a real estate broker in charlotte n c emailed him in december saying village of penland promised "guaranteed" returns of up to &# million soon he and about prospective investors attended a meeting with mr porter mr gerrits and other investors say mr porter told brokers and investors he could arrange loans from local lenders and major banks such as bb&amp t united community banks inc and first charter corp in one scenario participants could buy as many as lots for &# apiece or a total of &# million per investor and receive as much as &# cash back at closing according to court filings mr gerrits says mr porters company peerless real estate services inc helped him arrange two loans totaling &# he bought four lots at penland mr gerrits says he was duped by mr porter he declined to say whether he received a cash payment at his loan closings sherron shields of san leandro calif heard about the village of penland through a friend in july the year old loan officer in oakland calif agreed to buy eight lots she let his company help arrange for her to borrow a total of more than &# from four banks ranging from &# to &# at the closing ms shields also received &# which she says she believed was payment for the one year lease on the lots one of the first signs of trouble came in an email to some investors last year mr porter said the lots they had purchased werent rising in value as quickly as predicted then ms shields and other investors got a letter from mr porter stating that he couldnt afford the mortgages citing the "significant downturn" in the u s real estate market ms shields tried to sell her lots but appraisers laughed when she revealed what she had paid for them investigators now say many lots sold for as much as &# are actually worth no more than &# the four banks now are demanding that ms shields make the loan payments totaling about &# a month "this whole thing has really traumatized me " she says "i had great credit i pay my debts this isnt how i do business " rachel dollar a santa rosa calif attorney and expert on lending fraud says borrowers didnt break the law unless they knowingly misrepresented their financial situation on a loan application such as by concealing other loans they were simultaneously obtaining or falsely calling the proceeds of a second loan a cash down payment "if all they were doing was not exercising due diligence they cant be held criminally liable " says ms dollar who has no connection to the penland situation attorneys for the borrowers say they are trying to reach deals with the banks to avoid having their clients assets seized
