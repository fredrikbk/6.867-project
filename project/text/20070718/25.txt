chinas lenovo to base its global ad hub in india hong kong chinese computer maker lenovo group ltd plans to centralize its global advertising operations in bangalore part of a move by multinational companies to tap the creative firepower of indias low cost work force lenovos india team will help dream up global marketing campaigns aimed at dozens of countries including the u s france and brazil though not china marketing for the ibm thinkpad line the quintessentially american brand that lenovo inherited in when it purchased the personal computer arm of international business machines corp will be handled mostly by the bangalore hub lenovos decision reflects the continuing erosion of the geographic hierarchies that have long ruled the advertising industry "the old model was you think it up in new york or london and send it around the world " says shelly lazarus chairman and chief executive of wpp group plcs ogilvy &amp mather worldwide lenovos longtime ad agency which is a partner in developing the india hub "now we have to be able to think it up anywhere as our clients are thinking about their brands more globally weve had to adjust our model " lenovo is already an unusually global company it has a chinese chairman and an american chief executive and it rotates its headquarters between raleigh n c hong kong beijing and paris depending on where its top executives are at any given time the india born chief marketing officer deepak advani is normally based in raleigh but he is spending the summer in india the company sells computers in more than countries so creating versatile ads that can air in multiple regions could significantly curb its marketing costs but the structure of its hub is flexible and its teams in india will work closely with marketing teams on the ground in the dozens of countries where lenovo sells computers "india cant develop things that will magically be applicable across all cultures " says mr advani "were going to continue to tap into the creative minds in new york and paris " indias advertising industry is already experienced in creating commercials that cut across language barriers many ad campaigns launched nationwide in india run in about different languages to accommodate the countrys many dialects to help bridge linguistic and cultural gaps indian agencies often rely on images rather than dialogue to tell stories "if you have dialogue and you dub it it looks like a bad kung fu movie " says mr advani some of lenovos most successful ads in the indian market tell stories without using any words one called "castaway " is meant to showcase lenovos face recognition technology the ad features a shipwrecked man returning home with a grizzly beard and tattered clothes after years spent on a desert island his wife doesnt recognize him but his lenovo computer does helping him win her back another commercial originally developed for the indian market shows a man so absorbed by his computer that nothing can divert his attention in the ad his dog tries to get his attention first by barking then by speaking japanese and finally by dancing other big companies besides lenovo are relying more on india based agencies for creative input work done by indian agencies can cost one eighth what work from london or new york costs according to an analysis by r and ad spending in india rose to &# billion last year up from according to tam media research earlier this month lowe worldwide an agency owned by interpublic group plc announced plans to launch a hour production studio in india to serve clients around the world the firm is reorganizing so that indian creative staff will increasingly work alongside colleagues in london and new york on global accounts in early july lowe acquired the remaining of the indian advertising firm lintas that it didnt already own tony wright chief executive of lowe says india may emerge as a center for developing technology and strategy for marketing on mobile phones which is seen as the industrys next hot platform "india has leapfrogged the internet and gone straight to mobile " says mr wright "for the next three or four years mobile marketing is going to be the way forward for the whole world " meanwhile publicis group sas leo burnett india has been tapped to work alongside the chicago office of leo burnett on the next phase of mcdonalds corp s "im lovin it" campaign and it has developed a spinoff campaign that will run in countries in asia percept profile one of indias largest marketing firms recently won a global public relations account from a nissan motor co division wpps jwt india handles global accounts for unilever plc and has created television ads for detergent that air in latin america and many parts of asia and last year bt group plc awarded a contract valued at nearly &# million to tribal ddb india the digital marketing arm of indian advertising giant mudra to manage a global online marketing project still india has a long way to go to compete with madison avenue or london as a center of the global ad industry one major obstacle is a talent shortage the advertising sector has to compete for indias top graduates with better paying industries such as financial services "were all fighting for the same talent " says arvind sharma chief executive of leo burnett india lenovos india hub already has a staff of about employees and lenovo expects to double that over the next months as it gears up international marketing efforts linked to its sponsorship of the beijing olympics about of the hubs current employees are from lenovo and the other are from ogilvy until recently lenovos marketing efforts were scattered all over the globe with offices in beijing india and the u s all working on independent campaigns mr advani got the idea for the hub because he was impressed by the slick lenovo ads that ogilvys india team had created for the indian domestic market some of the tv ads feature bollywood brother and sister stars saif ali khan and soha ali khan still some analysts are skeptical greg paull a principal at r says the best ads often speak to subtle cultural nuances and points to the budweiser "wassup" ad series "those ads were extremely successful but they dont travel well " says mr paull "they relied on insight into the american male " in any case lenovos hub wont handle advertising for china lenovos largest market in part because the cultural and language issues are more difficult to bridge marketing for lenovos china operations will continue to be based in china
