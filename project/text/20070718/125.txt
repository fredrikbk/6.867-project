the seattle art museum a work in progress seattle casual strollers in downtown seattle happening upon what appears to be a new glass and steel office building on first avenue might justifiably wonder whether its "sam" logo denotes the corporate headquarters of some previously unknown car company seattle american motors this impression is reinforced by an expansive showroom at street level affording window shoppers a view of a succession of identical automobiles sequentially engaged in a gravity defying somersault instead its the unlikely exterior of the just opened flagship facility for the seattle art museums growing art conglomerate which also boasts a popular new waterfront outpost for outdoor sculpture at gritty olympic park as well as a distinguished asian art museum in sams original home a serene art deco building nestled in idyllic volunteer park the automotive display is part of the museums newly acquired "inopportune" by cai guo qiang the most high profile showpiece of the museums astoundingly turbo powered acquisitions spree of the past few years most museums expand to make room for their existing permanent collections sam expanded to from square feet so that it could persuade local donors to augment its permanent collection in time for its th anniversary next year that campaign successful beyond the wildest curatorial dreams added nearly owned pledged and promised works to the collection acutely aware that her art acquiring friends were being wooed by more prestigious institutions mimi gardner gates sams longtime director urgently wanted to "keep the great seattle private collections in seattle " now with important works from the collections of barney ebsworth virginia and bagley wright jon and mary shirley susan and jeffrey brotman and jane lang davis among others promised to the museum shes admirably accomplished her goal the inaugural display of about works in the museums large new double height special exhibitions gallery shows off the recent acquisitions area of greatest strength modern and contemporary art some other new acquisitions have been integrated into the permanent collection galleries throughout the museum that said the immediate driving force for this project was not sams long range plan to expand but washington mutual banks urgent need for more office space it was wamu that first suggested to sam in that they strike a deal for joint development of the land that sam already owned adjacent to its building designed by robert venturi of venturi scott brown &amp associates architecturally distinct but lacking much distinction the new story museum building with its vertically ribbed panels of stainless steel and glass was designed by an up and coming architect brad cloepfil of allied works architecture who is also in the midst of controversially recladding and reconfiguring the iconic edward durrell stone building at columbus circle in new york soon to house the museum of arts &amp design dwarfed by wamus new headquarters mr cloepfils museum addition reads as an appendage to the story corporate tower directly behind it the museum currently occupies only four of its buildings floors with an option to expand starting years from now to some or all of the eight floors above it now being leased by wamu the bank will always occupy the top four floors of the cloepfil building from the outside sams addition bears no family resemblance to its younger sibling the eccentric postmodern venturi building sheathed in sand colored limestone theres an abrupt unmediated divide between the new well behaved facade and the more fanciful older one with no conciliatory gesture of acknowledgement let alone kinship fortunately that changes once you enter the museum where the flow between the two buildings is almost seamless mr cloepfils airy pleasingly proportioned galleries are spaciously installed by the curators giving the artworks ample room to breathe the venturi interior has been largely redesigned but retains some of its original detailing and flooring so there remains a subtle sense of whether you are in the new or the old wing as if to make up for long years of light deprivation in the older building mr cloepfil overachieves in his manipulations of natural light in famously overcast seattle he has seen fit to outfit his facility with five different means of managing sunlight unmediated glass light diffusing shades blackout shades filtering scrims and most confoundingly an elaborate system of vertical stainless steel shutters which he prefers to characterize as "brise soleils " these can be manually adjusted to admit more or less light by harnessed workers perched on an exterior catwalk whats unaccountably missing is a coherent presentation of the museums growing and eclectic collection my confusingly disjointed lurch through the galleries made me feel as critic jen graves of seattles "the stranger" recently wrote that the installation "works like an ipod shuffle" a discordant apple allusion in microsoft country especially given the fact that director gates is stepmother to tech mogul gates the young ms graves found this mix energizing to this old hand the vagaries of random play were often an exasperating annoyance the seattle shuffle starts the minute you set off from the escalator on the first gallery floor when you find yourself somewhere in the middle of the contemporary installation at the pop stop straight ahead you are literally confronted by what appears to be a stop sign except that it says "go" a work by iain baxter your eyes are immediately drawn past that sign to the spotlit presence through a doorway at the far end of the gallery of one of sams star acquisitions john singleton copleys "dr silvester gardiner " the museums first and only th century american painting this purchase like some others was partly funded by the proceeds from deaccessions of other sam owned works bye bye contemporary hello to the very recently formed incomplete collection of early american art its gaps are partly filled with borrowed works including william merritt chases "the nursery " labeled "anonymous loan" but according to previous press reports belonging to stepson bill gates similarly the european paintings display gets a significant boost from private lenders including microsofts co founder paul allen whose rare round botticelli "madonna of the magnificat " is one of those galleries highlights instead of continuing the chronological american sequence which would entail a u turn from your original path you are more likely to shuffle straight ahead toward the american indian section where the northwest trove is one of the museums greatest strengths from there a gallery devoted to aboriginal art makes a smooth stylistic segue but then the capricious deejay sam mixes it up leaving behind the didgeridoo for the subtle strains of korean culture the curators justify these and other jarring changes of pace by asserting that they "build bridges between cultures and between the past and present " in the words of chiyo ishikawa sams deputy director for art sometimes the unorthodox juxtapositions are clearly purposeful and illuminating but there are also times when entering the next gallery feels less like crossing a bridge than like jumping off a cliff as in the leap from a display of contemporary african art to a roomful of european old masters like the museums installation its collection is still a work in progress for now some of the glaring holes are being filled through loans and special exhibitions such as "inspiring impressionism " a show organized by the denver art museum which opens in seattle in the summer of bill gatess collection of american art would go a long way toward filling other gaps in sams holdings but his stepmother is enigmatic whenever shes asked about those prospects mr gates and his wife melinda are listed as donating "&# million and above" to sams capital campaign a new book published by sam to celebrate its reopening tantalizingly promises that "more generous bequests of artworks are yet to come " although the expected testators are as yet unnamed with wealthy art aficionados and community pride on its side sam has the potential over time to move up in the museum ranks as it scales the heights of its new building for now it has come a long way in a short time ms rosenbaum writes on art and museums for the journal and blogs as culturegrrl at www artsjournal com culturegrrl
