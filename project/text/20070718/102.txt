they would be "they know we never remove anything " mr sunde said he maintained that his companys business practices are not illegal since torrents arent housed on their servers but are instead housed on the hard drive of users "we werent surprised by this " scholastics ms holton said "the internet itself has exploded as a center of chat and misinformation the degree to which people are going to make things look authentic is pretty astonishing not only pictures but actually videos as well " scholastic is printing a record million copies of "harry potter and the deathly hallows " many of which have already been shipped security is extremely tight with the publisher priding itself on its procedures that have been developed over the course of the prior six harry potter novels its unclear when the copies were uploaded to the various sites or where they originated but word quickly spread through the internet via blogs and news aggregator sites many referring to a report on the blog torrent freak which tracks file sharing or the practice of making files available for other users to download over the internet smaran dayal of pune india one of the posters on torrent freak said he got a tip that the material was available on a bittorrent and publicized it "it seemed like the real thing " he said digg a popular news aggregator site linked to torrent freak which was quickly inundated with visitors causing it to go down for several hours at one point the widely used technology blog tech crunch also linked to the torrent freak posting and another valleywag wrote that harry potter was leaked and the news spread like fire some of the leaked pdfs are difficult to read the torrent freak post notes "die hard fans of the series will undoubted rush to grab a copy of the torrent for themselves but anybody else would really have to see whether reading the book a week before the rest of the world is worth risking their eyesight and brains squinting to make out what happens when harry confronts he who must not be named for the last time " the postings sparked a fierce debate among bloggers as to whether they should write about the alleged leaks and whether they should link to the file sharing services that contained them some commenters blasted writers for spreading the news while others praised them "great cant digg now for the rest of the week for fear of spoilers " a poster called "listor" wrote on digg on the same site another calling himself vctr said whoever put the book online deserves harsh punishment "he will be sent to azkaban if he get arrested " at tech crunch a poster named "lee" was all for spreading the harry potter news "to think that copyright protection laws are in place to protect authors moreso than protecting the publishing industry is misguided fantasy do you really think the authors and makers of books and music will go starving really information wants to be free copy to infinity " kyle good a spokeswoman for scholastic said copyright infringement protects the book whether the internet postings are real or not "at the moment were interested in taking a lot of stuff down " she said "we could pursue legal options later " copyright law is clearly on the side of ms rowling and scholastic "legally the protection is absolute " said david s korzenik a partner in the new york law firm miller korzenik sommers "and electronic infringements are easier to identify than print infringements you can set up fair easy searches and then get orders to close them down " booksellers said that even if the authentic book is posted online it wont have an impact on sales or on harry potter fans "we wont sell a single copy less " said steve riggio ceo of barnes &amp noble inc the nations largest book retailer "people want to read the book " mr riggio noted that barnes &amp noble has already pre sold more than million copies maria papp who manages gullivers books in fairbanks alaska said she has been told that "deathly hallows"
