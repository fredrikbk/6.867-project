its as simple as this detroit is not delivering the goods your defense of the auto industry against raising fuel economy standards ignores the fundamental failure of automakers to respond to the already skyrocketing price of gasoline "the drive a toyota act " review &amp outlook july you suggest a gas tax is the only way to curb american consumption of oil but that assumes the auto industry responds rationally to higher gas prices by producing more fuel efficient vehicles history proves otherwise over the past seven years the price of gas has doubled and despite promises to make more fuel efficient cars and trucks detroit has continued to churn out huge suvs hummers and pickups ironically you suggest it would have been irrational not to continue building these gas guzzlers because additional labor costs add about &# per vehicle compared with japanese or korean competitors thus forcing automakers to manufacture the vehicles with larger profit margins than more fuel efficient cars okay lets consider the &# rebate offered with the dodge ram pickup truck and similar high priced rebates for other huge white elephants stranded on dealer lots if those dollars had been invested in fuel saving technology they wouldnt have to offer rebates that are two to three times as large as the labor cost differential instead detroit opted to virtually bribe americans to buy vehicles that will cost them much more for fuel and send many more dollars overseas to buy oil from nations hostile to our interests finally you admit that "technology exists to further increase fuel efficiency " but warn that to employ it would hurt the big three because it will make their cars more expensive less competitive and reap smaller profit margins huh this ignores the price of gas which you said would drive the market and the hue and cry of people who are shedding their gas guzzlers in droves our analysis shows that with gasoline at &# per gallon the average consumer who takes out a five year loan to buy a car or truck will save money because the increase in monthly loan payments is less than their savings on gasoline expenditures fuel economy especially for trucks is cash flow positive from the first month mark cooper director of research consumer federation of america washington gm currently builds vehicles americans dont really want while the gm corporate types were hauling their truckloads full of salary stock options and bonuses to their banks realtors and brokers year after year japans automakers were quietly feeling our nations pulse watching world events unfold adjusting their corporate strategies and building our automotive future what does gm stand for visionless pathetic leadership master blame gamers out of touch with american consumers laggards i could go on the bottom line i am not going to buy a vehicle from a company that is so lame obviously im not the only one kudos to toyota honda nissan and others for quietly slapping gm and ford and chrysler around they needed it i can only hope that rick wagoner goes to bed each night thinking about his achilles heel the prius mark nickels manitowoc wis i desperately want to back the u s automakers when i buy a car but the big three and their labor forces need to stop whining and start delivering over the years they took the easy way out and caved into union demands that they could not sustain and now the whole state of michigan is paying for it at the same time gm did not see a short term benefit in hybrids while toyota was looking forward years who could have imagined instability in the middle east affecting fuel prices now detroit is struggling with suv withdrawal and its hurting meanwhile the uaw and other unions continually throw in with the tree huggers instead of recognizing that even if the corporate executives are on the other side of the negotiating table they need a healthy employer for their long term well being as a frequent traveler every time i rent an american car i am reminded of why i no longer have one my sympathy for detroit is undermined by brittle interiors clumsy handling a big gas bill for a very short trip topped off with scuffing my shoe on the ridiculous foot operated parking brake that hasnt evolved since when i bought a one ton truck i gave ford every chance to match the value of the nissan titan im sorry to report that ford couldnt get within &# of the titan with an f with fewer features and less confidence from this consumer i decided it wasnt my job to subsidize bad management decisions and union demands that result in workers making &# and hour to play cards because their contracts guarantee a job when there is no work to do i was a happy owner of a brand new saturn the second year it was available i recall it was a success until the managers in detroit tightened their grip on the start up division and began forcing shared platform components from the other gm units after buying saab the gm visionaries saw fit to outfit the saab with components from the chevy malibu having rented a car that "you knew america could build" but that only avis would buy i suddenly lost my appetite for a saab convertible steve town erie colo
