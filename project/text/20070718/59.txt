fundamental change in pakistan two sisters turn up heat on musharraf amid rising violence opponents of islamists protest military control lahore pakistan sisters asma jahangir and hina jilani have been gadflies for three decades of pakistani governments in the s they sprung their father from jail in a landmark case against military detentions in the s they helped launch human rights groups that challenged harsh islamic laws along the way theyve been audited arrested and shot at now the two lawyers are front and center in a democratic movement that is creating major political headaches for pakistans president pervez musharraf a key u s ally many moderates in pakistan feel mr musharrafs military government has divided the country failing to stem the rise of islamic extremism that is an increasing threat to the nations security the sisters argue that government crackdowns including secret arrests and allegations of torture are adding fuel to the fire last week pakistani commandos raided the red mosque in the center of islamabad pakistans capital to rid it of islamic militants who had holed up there for months about people died since then in a spate of revenge attacks suicide bombers in the countrys northwest have claimed more than more lives yesterday evening a bomb exploded at a rally for a judge suspended by the government killing at least the rising discontent with mr musharraf has created an opening for some of mr musharrafs fiercest critics including the two sisters "hes a ruthless bully who believes in his own lies " says ms jahangir in an interview in the lahore legal aid office the sisters share tapping ash from her cigarette she adds coolly "its nothing personal " controversial government decisions have fueled the opposition in march the human rights commission of pakistan which the sisters helped found and run persuaded the countrys supreme court to accept a case that is trying to force pakistans security agencies to account for hundreds of people allegedly picked up in antiterrorism sweeps many suspects are believed to be held at secret jails and sometimes tortured as the case was unfolding mr musharrafs government suspended the courts chief justice citing allegations of misconduct in office chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry has said his dismissal was partly linked to accepting more human rights cases and has publicly appeared with ms jahangir to drum up support for his cause on sunday ms jahangir attended a political rally in support of the chief justice dancing in the streets of lahore with other lawyers the human rights commission and more than other nongovernmental organizations have held regular protests in which lawyers teachers doctors and other groups shout anti musharraf slogans such as "musharraf dog " and "go musharraf go " on monday the government withdrew some of the charges "i feel very optimistic for the first time " says ms jahangir years old "its a different pakistan " some dismiss the sisters who have both also served as human rights envoys to the united nations as being good at news conferences and protests but bad at building bridges in pakistans conservative society "they are only representing a certain class of people secular liberals " says muhammad ali saif one of the lawyers representing the government in the case against the chief justice "they make a lot of noise they get fame and recognition and then they market themselves " but this time the efforts of ms jahangir and ms jilani and the controversy theyve sparked have tapped into new worries among pakistans professional and business classes for years theyve viewed mr musharraf as a bulwark against muslim radicals today many are questioning mr musharrafs commitment to both law and order after last weeks military raid of the red mosque ms jahangir joined other groups calling for a probe into how a mosque in the middle of pakistans capital became an armed encampment for islamic radicals the bush administration has long viewed mr musharraf as its best bet in pakistan for combating islamic extremism after the militarys raid of the mosque the u s government continued to offer statements of support it recently pledged &# million in aid over five years to help spur development in lawless tribal regions the latest dollop in billions of dollars in military and economic assistance the u s has offered pakistan since the sept attacks in the u s "president musharraf has been a valued partner and ally " said deputy state department spokesman tom casey at a regular press briefing friday "we share with him an understanding of the future that we would like to see for pakistan and that is one that we believe is shared by the vast majority of pakistanis which is for a modern moderate islamic state that works with the united states and other members of the international community to fight against extremists like al qaeda and the taliban " yet the mounting political pressure on mr musharraf is complicating his efforts to maintain power the army general faces widespread demands within pakistan to resign from the military if he wants to be re elected as president again so far hes resisted either ditching the uniform as he is constitutionally required to do by the end of this year or allowing the return to pakistan of his chief political opponents the unrest hasnt dimmed a bright economic outlook in the eight years since mr musharraf took power in a military coup per capita income is up and the karachi stock market the countrys largest is trading near record highs economic growth has averaged more than a year for the past four years along with a strong economy mr musharraf has sought to create a more socially liberal environment he has recruited like minded officials to mobilize moderate muslims his own vision for pakistan was enshrined in the phrase "enlightened moderation " which emphasizes religious tolerance and gender equality in a country where "honor killings" of rape victims are illegal but widespread "we dont want the talibanization of pakistan " the president told reporters at a news conference in february "we think pakistan is a progressive moderate islamic country " unlike most other predominantly muslim countries pakistan has a history of elevating women in society its long boasted an elite cadre of female professionals civil servants and business executives the charismatic benazir bhutto who served two terms as pakistans prime minister was the first woman elected to lead a muslim country pakistans ranks of influential women are now expanding as fast economic growth gives rise to an urban middle class and dual income families yet critics charge that even as hes preached moderation mr musharrafs military led government has undermined the very institutions that could protect rights and curb extremist behavior the chief justices suspension provided a tipping point they say because it laid bare what mr musharraf will do to stay in power "a military dictator has exposed himself " says the year old ms jilani she like her older sister speaks in the same matronly tones about challenging pakistans most powerful institution the army theyve been at it a long time their first major test came on behalf of their father malik jilani a civil servant turned politician who was in and out of jail during the rule of army commander muhammad yahya khan after pakistans loss of its eastern section now known as bangladesh in a war with india the country gave way to a civilian government yet mr jilani went back to jail for his perceived support for the separatists with asma taking the lead his daughters served as his lawyers arguing that a civilian government couldnt use a military order to detain their father in mr jilani was released both sisters went on to study law ms jilani received her degree first while ms jahangir married and started a family before graduating in they set up lahores first all female law firm with two other women ms jahangir and ms jilani helped establish a "womens action forum" that organized the first public protests against the hudood ordinance an islamic penal code established under the military rule of gen mohammad zia ul haq in about two dozen women including the sisters were arrested after protesting when a young blind girl who had been raped ended up in jail for adultery the women spent days in jail singing protest songs and chanting "down with zia ul haq " according to ms jilani they were released after "driving the prison staff crazy " she says emboldened the sisters sought to broaden the opposition to military rule in they joined ex judges journalists and other activists to establish the human rights commission of pakistan the gregarious ms jahangir became chairwoman her sister more subdued and scholarly became vice chairwoman the commission accepts money mainly from norway but not from "major powers " including the u s says ms jahangir both sisters decline to give more details despite pakistans subsequent return to democracy the country continued to enforce islamic laws that threatened severe punishments in ms jahangir defended a year old boy who had been sentenced to death for allegedly scribbling blasphemous words on a wall of a mosque ms jahangir won an acquittal on an appeal to the lahore high court during the hearing demonstrators demanded the death of the boy and his lawyers at times the sisters say extremists have come close to killing them twice in the s armed intruders broke into ms jahangirs home once when she was there sleeping with her son in ms jilani was advising a year old in a divorce case when the clients mother entered with a hired assassin the man pumped three bullets into the daughter killing her in an apparent attempt to erase the disrepute the divorce would bring the family a fourth bullet hit the wall above ms jilanis head police shot the killer in the stairwell today the unmarked legal aid office has several layers of security a thick wood door with a peephole blocks the entrance off the stairwell visitors must pass guards with metal detectors and government assigned police lounge on couches with submachine guns pointing skyward the police protection hasnt softened the sisters opposition to the government unlike some groups that cheered mr musharrafs bloodless coup in for the order it restored to pakistan the sisters lambasted the return of military rule following the sept attacks in the u s the sisters stepped up their criticism of mr musharraf in its annual report the commission asserted that "hundreds accused of involvement in militant activities were jailed in almost all cases illegally " and that use of torture "was increasing " that year the government amended its anti terrorism act allowing suspected militants to be held for up to a year without charge the commission began compiling a list of names of people who had vanished apparently arrested in the antiterrorism sweeps many ms jahangir says were involved in the independence movement of baluchistan a state in southern pakistan agitating for more autonomy the commission enlisted its local chapters around pakistan to visit relatives and confirm the missing names began to pour in of pakistans "disappeared " according to ms jahangir some families visited the sisters legal aid offices in lahore beseeching them for clues to their kin ms jahangir received a flood of phone calls from relatives asking the same questions "any news of my son when will you know more " she admits switching off her phone to avoid the calls harder to ignore the young men who would come to her office after being released from secret detention they appeared physically and emotionally damaged ms jahangir says the thought of how she would react if her son had been one of them chilled her "i saw these young men come in their heads would flop from side to side their eyes couldnt focus " ms jahangir says pausing to compose herself "these are not men who come back as loyal citizens of this country " by the missing persons list had grown to people worried that the government would use any mistake in their lists to cast doubt on their exercise the commission followed up with families to make sure the relatives hadnt been released or perhaps entered twice under similar names by they had whittled the names down to as staffers studied the lists checking and rechecking ms jahangir says she got to know almost every case by heart ms jahangir believes the government has at times thwarted her efforts to conduct field investigations in january as she headed to baluchistan somebody fired a ring of warning shots around ms jahangirs convoy local police blamed the baluchistan liberation army a rebel group but declined to investigate she says she believes the army was responsible mr musharrafs supporters accused the sisters of shedding their independence by attending meetings of rival political parties and accepting funds for the commission from western governments "shes lost all credibility " says tariq azim khan minister of state for information and broadcasting ms jahangir says that when invited she attends meetings of all political stripes including those of the islamic fundamentalist party jamaat e islami by early this year the commission had ended up documenting about missing person cases it submitted them to the supreme court asking security agencies to account for their whereabouts in march the court agreed to hear the petition and several others related to missing persons after chief justice chaudhrys suspension ms jahangir rallied to his defense the chief justice drew throngs of people wherever he delivered speeches to local bar associations one drive to lahore from islamabad which normally takes about five hours exceeded as cheering crowds surrounded the justices car a group of lawyers rode on the cars roof the government says the chief justice was asked to step down because he harassed other judges intimidated police and lawyers and otherwise abused the perks of his office officials say opposition lawmakers some of whom stepped in to represent the chief justice whipped up the ensuing protests "theres a political show going on " says mr azim khan the government spokesman last month the chief justice his lawyers and ms jahangir were blocked from leaving the karachi airport by pro government demonstrators gunfire between protesters left at least dead both sides blamed the other for instigating the riots and protesters on both sides appeared to be armed shots also pinned down reporters in the offices of a local television station after the killings mr musharraf threatened to curb live media coverage of protests but later backed off ms jahangir blamed "state endorsed brutality" carried out by the mutahida qaumi movement or mqm a karachi based party allied with president musharraf "the aim is to silence depress and decimate the civil society of pakistan " her commission said in a statement despite the chief judges ouster pakistans civil society hasnt been silenced one morning last month veiled ladies and small children sat quietly in cushioned chairs until they were called to address the three supreme court judges in a hearing about their missing relatives at the hearing government lawyers announced that they have traced more than prisoners out of the or so names submitted to the court they denied that the government was mistreating any prisoners one of the veiled women is amina masood her husband masood hamed jangua owner of a travel agency and computer training center disappeared on july after the subway bombings in london he was on his way to a bus stop to visit a friend in the northern city of peshawar ms masood who denies her husband had any links to extremist groups says she hasnt heard from him since
