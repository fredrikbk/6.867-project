kpmg and justice the justice department received its well earned comeuppance in the kpmg tax shelter case on monday when federal judge lewis a kaplan dismissed the charges against of the defendants career prosecutors will want to appeal but its time for attorney general alberto gonzales to assert some leadership and let the ex defendants pick up the pieces of their lives the kpmg prosecutors would do well to move on as well instead of attempting to defend a corporate crime policy that the justice department has already repudiated in part as a result of their excesses in this case last december justice rewrote the thompson memorandum on corporate prosecutions excising some of the policies that led directly to mondays dismissals but while main justice in washington has disavowed the thompson memos positions on attorney client privilege and employees legal fees the u s attorneys office for the southern district of new york continues to defend the actions taken under those policies in this case in mondays ruling judge kaplan suggested that the memo itself and not merely the southern district of new yorks aggressive interpretation of it represented a violation of defendants due process rights in other words the governments stated policy of starving the accused of funds to defend themselves was itself unconstitutional an appeal now would require that one part of the justice department ask an appellate court not merely to overrule judge kaplan but to uphold legal tactics that the justice department now claims were inappropriate maybe they could call the case southern district of new york v gonzales some have read judge kaplans decisions as an argument that white collar defendants are entitled as a matter of constitutional law to millions of dollars to mount a defense this was never the point whether the legal costs are small or large the government has no right to interfere with a citizens ability to defend himself in court if it does there must be some mechanism for holding the state to account for interfering with due process this is not contrary to what judge kaplan himself implied in court earlier this month a purely economic question it is a matter of principle judge kaplan ruled last year that the government had overstepped its bounds in coercing kpmg into denying legal assistance to its former employees he tried mightily to find a way to remedy that interference short of dismissing the charges but the one remedy he attempted to pursue a civil case by the defendants against kpmg to get their legal fees back was denied by the appeals court in this situation it is not enough to say "well let the wronged parties sue for restitution or compensation " the government had a duty to respect the rights of citizens suspected of a crime and it disregarded that duty in doing so it surrendered the legitimacy that undergirds its right to try people for crimes in this case judge kaplan noted explicitly in his ruling that prosecutors behaved as illegal bullies in an attempt to coerce plea bargains and thus avoid having to prove their tax evasion claims to a jury for these defendants this process has already lasted two years all of them have amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills and in some cases millions worth rather than dragging them through another year or more of appeals mr gonzales should send a message about due process to other prosecutors by closing down the case
