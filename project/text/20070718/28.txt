boom in buybacks helps lift stocks to record heights companies are buying back their shares at a furious pace one of the big reasons the dow jones industrial average is pushing toward the question is how long can they keep it up in recent weeks companies as diverse as oil producer conocophillips health care products giant johnson &amp johnson and discount retailer wal mart stores inc have announced ambitious buyback plans in the first quarter alone companies in the standard &amp poors stock index spent nearly &# billion to repurchase their shares more than in any previous quarter companies have increasingly resorted to buybacks which boost stock prices and per share earnings by reducing the supply of stock in public hands as a way to return cash to shareholders in doing so they have supercharged the stock markets rally yesterday the dow industrials broke through the mark for the first time ever before slipping back to close at up points their fourth consecutive record close many analysts and investors question how long the buyback boom can continue and how much support stock prices can derive from buybacks over the long haul some companies are financing their share repurchases with borrowed money which is likely to get more expensive if interest rates continue to rise meanwhile corporate profit growth has slowed this year which will limit the cash available for buybacks "i want to be a believer in buybacks " says s&amp p analyst howard silverblatt "the problem is that the track record is not there" for stock buybacks to be the underpinning of a long term bull market the surge in buybacks began in late aided by low interest rates and easy access to cash but it has since picked up pace share repurchases have topped &# billion for six straight quarters a streak that seems likely to continue once data for the just ended second quarter are in hand s&amp p analysts say companies announced &# billion of buyback plans during the quarter up nearly from a year earlier according to thomson financial the total represents the maximum authorized for share repurchases over a given period while buyback announcements typically boost share prices companies dont always repurchase all the stocks they are authorized to buy some of the biggest programs unveiled in the second quarter were launched by home depot inc &# billion wal mart &# billion and general electric co &# billion all three companies are components of the dow in the current quarter they were joined by johnson &amp johnson which announced a &# billion buyback earlier this month the &# billion that s&amp p companies spent buying back their shares in the first quarter was up more than from a year earlier and about twice what they paid out in dividends some investors prefer buyouts to dividends because dividends are taxable but there is no tax due on a share buyback unless investors sell their shares amid rising profits however many companies have increased their per share dividends too the dividend yield of the s&amp p or dividends per share as a percentage of the share price has risen slightly since late when total buybacks pulled ahead of total dividend payments it now stands at up from still relatively low by historical standards because they tend to increase per share earnings and stock prices buybacks can be advantageous for corporate executives whose compensation may depend at least in part on achieving profit and share price targets they can also benefit executives with large holdings of stock options after a buyback the number of shares those executives would get from exercising their options represents a bigger stake in the company insiders corporate officers should have a good sense of what their company is worth and whether its share price reflects that says jeffrey bronchick chief investment officer at los angeles based money management firm reed conner &amp birdwell if the company has cash to spare and it considers its shares undervalued a buyback makes sense if on the other hand its stock is expensive paying a dividend makes more sense he says in practice companies dont always act so rationally they often buy back shares when stock prices are high because they have cash available or they may sell shares to the public when prices are low to raise cash a common practice during the s was to use buybacks to mop up shares generated by employees exercising stock options as a way to prevent earnings per share from being diluted companies also sometimes buy back shares as a way to hit earnings per share targets in some cases companies and the nations economy as a whole might be better off if they spent their money on new plants and equipment rather than retiring shares says douglas cliggott chief investment officer at greenwich conn money manager dover management "in many cases going the share buyback route is effectively throwing up your hands and saying we give up we dont know how to grow " he says "does it really make sense that a current day industrial conglomerate should be buying back stock rather than trying to improve its fundamental position in the industries it is operating in " just as private equity firms typically finance their acquisitions by issuing debt backed by the companies they buy many u s companies are raising the amount of debt on their balance sheet through buybacks while reducing their number of public shares federal reserve figures show that nonfinancial companies took &# billion worth of stock off the market in the first quarter during the same period they took on &# billion in debt companies dont appear to be using those borrowings to finance new plants or equipment says northern trust economist paul kasriel "the data support the view that corporations are stepping up their credit market borrowing in order to finance their share buybacks " he says in some cases companies may be doing so to keep themselves from becoming takeover targets for private equity firms in other cases the strategy may merely reflect a view that the company can easily afford to carry more debt and that using the cash raised to reduce shares outstanding benefits shareholders for s&amp p companies the proportion of cash to debt on their balance sheets has held steady around since about double the percentage in the late s according to s&amp p data
