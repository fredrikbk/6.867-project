business bookshelf the boom beyond our borders the elephant and the dragon by robyn meredith norton pages &# anyone interested in the marvel of modern day china and india routinely encounters a host of "gee whiz" factoids that illustrate each countrys high octane growth shanghai for example had skyscrapers in by last year it had about more than los angeles and chicago combined india meanwhile is home to three of the worlds biggest information technology firms and ibm employs people there an increase since of yet its just as easy to uncover bad news sixteen of the worlds most polluted cities are in china and even if the country survives an environmental catastrophe say the pessimists it will be hit by an economic one of its publicly traded companies are worthless according to a high ranking chinese government official speaking earlier this year it has also been estimated that the banking system is carrying close to &# trillion in bad loans chinas premier wen jiabo has even admitted that the economy is "unstable unbalanced uncoordinated and unstable " cassandras dont lack for alarming material about india either close to of the population is illiterate and remains dependent on agriculture much of it at the subsistence level while an antiquated infrastructure stifles the countrys ability to grow "whatever you can rightly say about india " the nobel prize winning economist amartya sen has written "the opposite is also true " ditto for china in "the elephant and the dragon " robyn meredith a hong kong based correspondent for forbes magazine neatly navigates between the boom and the gloom her account of india and china today is accessible to the general reader but also brimming with enough data and first person reporting to get the attention of even those jaded by the recent breathless coverage of bangalore and beijing as ms meredith shows comprehensive market oriented reforms chinas began in indias in have sparked a new dynamism and remarkable economic growth in the s alone more than million people escaped poverty in the two countries lifting the per capita standard of living beyond the wildest dreams of previous generations "we got more done for the poor by pursuing the competition agenda for a few years " says one of indias former finance ministers "than we got done by pursuing a poverty agenda for decades " in "the elephant and the dragon " we see the average citizen enjoying unprecedented opportunities but also the effort of businesses to capitalize on them "i look at apartments at night " says a general manager from philips a dutch company that manufactures light bulbs among much else he measures chinas economic progress by its growing illumination he observes for instance that chinas rural homes have an average of three light bulbs now but had none before the economy opened up helping a nation of billion people to "see the light" is for philips big business elsewhere ms meredith shows us the different steps taken by a hong kong company to produce linen sweaters buying flax from france having it shipped to tianjin on chinas eastern seaboard then trucked to a city miles away where it is cleaned straightened and ironed and then trucked again more than miles for dyeing and knitting the finished product then travels two hours by truck to hong kong where it is transferred to a plane for distribution in the u s thus the metamorphosis in modern chinas business rhetoric assembly lines are out supply chains are in ms meredith reminds us of just how far both countries have traveled in the past half century or so in china million to million people starved to death from to because of maos collectivizing farm policies and nearly all of the countrys universities were shuttered for more than a decade during the cultural revolution in india the post independence experience with socialism and central planning subjected the economy to what became known derisively as "the hindu rate of growth " cumbersome inefficient patronage laden enterprises sustained poverty rather than alleviating it over time the irresistible logic of capitalism coincided with a juggernaut of globalizing technology to overturn the old paradigm and usher in reform ms meredith acknowledges that as a result of such changes the u s has lost jobs to china and india based outsourcing and "offshoring " but she notes that american consumers have gained all the more with a range of products and services at lower prices she also claims that the much lamented u s trade deficit with china is overstated much of it is derived from the practice of western companies assembling goods in china and then exporting them to the u s the money we pay for such products although counted in the trade deficit is actually headed to non chinese firms and stockholders can china and india maintain their sizzling growth rates ms meredith does not dwell on the question as much as one might hope but its clear that both countries need to liberalize their rules governing banks and financial markets burdensome regulations interfere with lending indias banks for example must channel about one third of their loans to agriculture and household businesses the effect is to send capital into unprofitable enterprises both countries also need a more basic deregulation of everyday commerce according to the world banks doing business report which measures the effect of government regulations entrepreneurs in india and china suffer from high taxes and intrusive bureaucrats they also have trouble enforcing contracts and getting licenses to operate for all the progress in short the elephant and the dragon still have a long way to go mr rees is a senior director at the white house writers group a washington based consulting
