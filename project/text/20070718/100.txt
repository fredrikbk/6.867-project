private labels stock on growth new york ralcorp holdings of st louis has seen sales surge close to over the last few years thanks to steady sales of its cereal crackers cookies and jellies but dont look for the ralcorp brand name on your supermarket shelves the food company is the among the largest private label manufacturers who make their profits by producing goods that are sold under the labels of various retailers and grocers it is a hot sector because more consumers are beginning to trust these cheaper store brands sold under names like wegmans or shoprite and pay less than national brands plus private label products are getting a boost from some missteps by traditional food providers sales of private label peanut butter at ralcorp for instance got a boost from conagras recent recall of its peter pan and great value peanut butter products amid concerns about salmonella contamination says bb&amp t capital markets analyst heather jones "it helped consumers to see that there may not be as much difference in private label and branded products " she said that is putting pressure on traditional manufacturers of branded food products to put a cap on prices spend more on marketing and work harder to differentiate their offerings kraft foods inc for instance has seen its share of some food categories drop amid competition from private label now it is beefing up its marketing while private labels have penetrated almost every consumer group in the u s the market share in the food industry at about has been the strongest high commodity costs and thin margins have made it harder for traditional makers to innovate in recent years making their brands more vulnerable in europe where a fewer number of retailers have a dominant market share private labels presence in some parts of europe is in the range of to be sure private labels share in the u s food market has been almost flat for the last few years but that could change as a flood of more sophisticated store branded offerings hit the shelves recent research from international business machines corp for instance found that three quarters of all consumers surveyed in the u s and u k dont see any benefit in buying branded food products a majority of consumers surveyed felt the quality and safety of private label products were the same as similar branded products neil stern a senior partner at retail consulting firm mcmillan doolittle says that private labels in the u s could be headed in the same direction as europe but that changes wont happen as quickly or in the same degree because u s retailers are more fragmented than their counterparts across the pond still private labels in the u s have already grabbed strong shares in categories like milk cheese and eggs which are harder to differentiate "the existence of a sophisticated private label like we are beginning to see weighs on the pricing power of the major packaged food companies " says edward jones packaged food analyst matt arnold mr arnold says that kraft foods is "a great example of what can happen if you dont do a good job of managing the private label threat " with private labels making inroads into categories like cheese kraft has had to fight harder to hold its ground according to euromonitor krafts share of the u s packaged food market dipped from in to in mr arnold says that the macaroni and cheese maker has now been making a major push to spend more on marketing "the benefits are not showing up as yet but it takes time for your investment to show returns " says mr arnold "more recently they have been narrowing price gaps and hopefully will be able to hold share " kraft says it approaches private labels like any other branded competitor and is always innovating to provide consumers with added benefits at the right price irrespective of the product involved on the flip side kellogg co has done a great job fending off private labels with its kashi brand of healthier and organic cereals says mr arnold much of private labels growing acceptance has come from a much greater effort among the large retailers to push their in house brands "when i started in this business private label was just a higher margin item offered to consumers at a lower price " said tom ewing an executive at private label maker t marzetti co who has been in the industry for two decades "today it is a key part of their retailers marketing strategy " a recent mckinsey &amp co report done in partnership with the grocery manufacturers association found that some retailers have managed to achieve much higher than average private label dollar share even in categories once thought to be strictly branded territory in spaghetti sauce industry average private label dollar share is around but wegmans made this category a priority driving its private label dollar share above the industry average to beyond according to the mckinsey report while private label retailers like kroger co have driven up their dollar share in the natural cheese category to to some branded food companies have been trying to tap the lucrative private label business themselves a move that can sometimes be cannibalistic of their own internal brands dean foods which sells horizon organic milk has a substantial private label business while conagra also sells both private label and branded products analysts believe that dean foods move to tap both markets is prudent because of the high level of private label penetration in the milk category but conagras private label business has drawn more critics "conagra doesnt have many leading brands as it is " said mr arnold the company may be cannibalizing some of its own brands he added conagra representatives couldnt be reached for comment
