the evening wrap mortgage backed insecurity online edition markets met federal reserve chairman ben bernankes latest pronouncements on monetary policy with a nod but listened carefully to his thoughts

testimony to addressing regulatory matters he vowed the fed would propose banning certain mortgage practices and said that the fed wouldnt bail out subprime lenders who are now encountering problems collecting payments "we dont want to reward lenders for making bad loans " he said but if earlier comments suggested that policy makers saw subprime issues as walled off from the rest of the economy
