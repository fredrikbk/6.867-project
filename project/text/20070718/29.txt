calling all videos alex gurevich loves to log on to youtube to watch music videos and comedy sketches on breaks from work but the year old entrepreneur from san francisco fretted that he couldnt take the fun with him on his cellphone mr gurevich assumed that signing up for a mobile video service would require a "superexpensive" phone and more than &# extra a month in fees so he was surprised to find in january a free new mobile video service called mywaves that works with his basic motorola razr now he is glued to it regularly attempting to amuse his friends with stand up comedy clips and other videos he has transferred to his phone "why would i sign up for another service if i can get this for free " he says mywaves inc of sunnyvale calif is one of a flurry of start ups offering new ways to access internet videos on cellphones hoping to overcome barriers that have prevented mobile video from taking off in the past for years cellular carriers including verizon wireless and at&amp t inc have offered licensed video content for cellphones such as sports highlights tv shows and music videos but these services which carry monthly subscription fees offer limited content programmed by the carrier and usually work only on certain phones adoption has been slow now the new services are taking a different approach allowing users to view a wider array of internet video clips without locking themselves into a subscription and without purchasing a fancier phone the services each operate slightly differently but users can view online videos using any standard video enabled phone videos can be wirelessly downloaded to a handset for viewing later or sometimes streamed over cellular networks to be watched in real time the quality of the content is rarely as crisp as users are accustomed to online and viewing can be limited by the amount of storage on a phone but the services are generally free powered by advertising and independent of particular carriers some new offerings say they have attracted nearly a million users and are attracting tens of thousands more a day recently launched mywaves offers hundreds of thousands of videos from a wide range of sources its online library organized by "channels " includes clips acquired through arrangements with content providers culled from available podcasts or provided by users themselves people can access videos through a

themselves online users can send a video to their phones directly from the page where it resides by downloading some software to their computers internet browser or they can upload videos to an online account prompting the service to send a text message to a cellphone containing a link to the video guppies which doesnt offer streaming transmits videos that are available in a variety of popular digital formats the service doesnt work with content that media companies protect with proprietary software such as longer form tv shows and movies these new services are part of a broad sweep of mobile companies trying to get consumers to translate their fanaticism for online video watching to smaller screens popular video sites such as google inc s youtube have been branching into mobile by creating condensed mobile web sites and preloading versions of their services on popular handsets like apple inc s iphone carriers such as at&amp t verizon wireless and sprint nextel corp have also been wooing customers with services that offer features like live tv but still the services havent caught on of the nearly seven million users who watch mobile video or tv from their phones every month the vast majority watch clips sent to them from family or friends rather than video prepackaged by a carrier according to research firm m metrics inc overall just of u s cellphone users subscribed to a mobile video service in the first quarter of up from in the year earlier period according to market researcher telephia inc the new services are trying to open up the mobile video

advertising such as small text ads in the bottom of text messages or sponsored content from brands consumers are also voicing concerns about storage higher end cellphones increasingly come with up to megabytes of memory and slots that can accommodate more but many new phones still come with just four or so megabytes which may accommodate only a few several minute long clips streaming video which is viewed in real time rather than downloaded and stored for later can be an option but only in areas where the network speeds are fast enough "the experience just isnt really there and there is too much lag time " says ben bajarin a digital media analyst for market research firm creative strategies in campbell calif but he says that consumption of mobile video content will continue to rise particularly as media companies create more content designed to entertain users for a few minutes at a time many of the new companies envision themselves as technology not content companies and are starting to enable users to transfer other media to their phone like music and phones in the same way they can transfer video "we dont want to be perceived just as a catalog " says cellfish medias ceo fabrice sergent who says the companys goal is to become a mobile version of itunes "the idea is really to create a seamless experience from the pc to the phone and from the phone to the pc "
