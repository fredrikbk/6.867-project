the daily fix vick faces indictment goodell faces decision online edition in an offseason marked by a crackdown on bad player behavior off the field atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick may be the latest to face penalties mr vick was indicted for charges of sponsoring a dogfighting operation that led to death for canines that entered the ring and for those not ready to fight the smoking gun published the grisly indictment several columnists urge nfl commissioner roger goodell to suspend mr vick "if goodell is truly the new sheriff in town and wants to be consistent and at the same time let every player in the league know he plays no favorites then how can he not take action against vick " new york daily news columnist gary myers asks "because he boosts tv ratings because hes one of the most exciting players in the league he cant go soft because vick is a marquee player " mr myers however adds that according to his unnamed sources the commish wont suspend mr vick based solely on the indictment msnbcs michael ventre says mr goodell has carved out for himself with the approval of the players association a justice system that doesnt require waiting for the criminal justice system to act and the nfl will want to distance themselves from the qb mr ventre writes "whatever the evidence the coming weeks and months will feature a gusher of bad publicity involving vick the atlanta falcons and the nfl details about the investigation will leak more people will come forward about the extent of the despicable pastime allegedly perpetrated on vicks land when the general public starts to hear gory tidbits about the savagery that was allegedly condoned by the falcons quarterback he will be persona non grata in society let alone the nfl " but philadelphia daily news columnist rich hofmann urges patience "for goodell there is no danger in acting too slowly here " mr hofmann writes "if people want to be disgusted by vick and the allegations it is their right if people want to condemn the commissioner for allowing this kind of accused miscreant to play in his league so be it but what is the alternative and how would you square it with anybodys sense of justice after all even a hanging judge waits for a conviction before ordering the rope " whatever the league does the falcons are free to cut mr vick a move msnbcs mike celizic urges but as washington post columnist michael wilbon notes the team had been planning to build around mr vick even letting their backup go the whole episode reinforces for san diego union tribune columnist nick canepa that the chargers made the right call in trading the no pick in the draft to the falcons who picked mr vick and instead selecting at no "a nice fellow a tailback named ladainian tomlinson who has scored touchdowns and thrown for six more since that fateful day " the british open is returning to scotlands carnoustie where six over was the winning score in thanks to a brutal course layout this time around golfers are anticipating an easier time of it the scotsmans alan pattullo says the course has a shot at redemption offers a history lesson and concludes with an homage to carnousties environs "st andrews is regarded as the home of golf but for many it is in carnoustie where the games soul resides " mr pattullo writes "unlike the fife university town carnoustie has no great pretensions but those who claim the area to be unattractive or lacking in charm have clearly not visited thrill seekers can either get a hit from the view out to the north sea or by simply wandering up its narrow vennels the main thoroughfare has its usual blights including the only thing worse than a tanning salon a disused one but the bars have been reinvigorated by the throngs of fans who again have reason to discuss the pressing matters of the day why is the tenth hole called "south america " and how the hell do you pronounce carnoustie anyway " paul lawrie who was slightly less flummoxed by the course then pronounced "car nastie" than the rest of the field in and won the championship as a result is the last european to win a major "this seems unfathomable when one considers the way the euros have mostly clobbered the u s aces in ryder cups for more than a decade " dave perkins writes in the toronto star will the europeans break their losing streak at carnoustie fix golf guru tim carroll offers his pick st louis post dispatch columnist bryan burwell was at the far oaks golf club in caseyville ill for a different tournament the u s deaf golf championships kevin hall the current leader has competed on the pga tour "if you have ever swung a golf club and achieved even some brief moment of golf perfection you surely can gain a large level of appreciation for watching men and women like hall and all the other deaf golfers play without the advantage of hearing " mr burwell writes "golf is most of all a hand eye coordination sport yet there is no small benefit to the sense of sound in enjoying the game the club swishing through the grass cleanly smartly clipping the blades and slashing into the ball is one of the sports sweetest sounds a ball well struck with the echo of metal pinging into that compressed dimpled ball and the distinct rattle of a ball falling into the cup are all auditory sensations that a golfer feeds off but hall has never experienced those sensations " yi jianlian and his handlers dont want the year old no pick in the nba draft to play for the milwaukee bucks the team that drafted him the widespread suspicion is that theyre objecting to the relative smallness of milwaukees chinese community but chen haitao the owner of mr yis current chinese basketball association team says the problem is that the bucks are so stocked they wont give the rookie ample playing time yes really columnists compete at the fun game of who can express the most incredulity "did chen notice that the bucks were last year and havent had a real power forward since larry krystkowiak was on the floor instead of sitting on the bench in a suit " asks michael hunt in the milwaukee journal sentinel "did chen catch the fact that charlie villanueva the latest to try to fill the position is coming off an injury or that villanueva is really a small forward or that the bucks were so desperate last year that they played ruben patterson who might be foot standing on his wallet at power forward of course the bucks drafted yi at no because there are some really high shelves at the cousins center that need dusting " si coms chris mannix says the whole idea is misguided "if yi decides he wants to re enter the nba draft next season he would have to sit out the entire season " mr mannix writes "im not just talking about the nba season yi couldnt play anywhere not in the states not in europe and certainly not in the cba if he does yi would continue to remain the property of the bucks and how exactly would sitting out a season help yi how would that help the chinese national team which is hoping to make a big splash in the beijing olympics improve instead of a getting a bigger stronger more skilled yi next summer the team would have a rusty player whose growth has been stunted by his own governments short sightedness " chicago sun times columnist greg couch revisits a comment by white sox general manager kenny williams about addressing the teams bullpen needs "he said it last october late in the season knowing that the bullpen was killing the sox " mr couch writes "so he rebuilt that bullpen for this year structured it around his style his tastes his beliefs it was his pet project and its one of the worst bullpens of all time im sure williams is banging his head on a wall somewhere trying to figure out how he can fix an entire bullpen by the trading deadline days from now his impatience is part of his charm i guess but he cant do it the sox are done its his fault " tip of the fix cap to reader lee d hoffman found a good column from
