arizonas lettuce crop finally the company paid the u s government &# million to settle allegations that one of its latin american units had paid protection money to terrorists all that in just months much of the adversity was beyond chiquitas control yet it added up to a hefty loss last year but the banana giant seems determined to right its ship by morphing from a commodity based company into a
