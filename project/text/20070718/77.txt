making the jump from creating ads to devising goods questions for jonah disend company redscout title ceo toronto based advertising concern mdc partners is expected to announce today that it has acquired a stake in redscout a consulting firm that works with marketers such as johnson &amp johnson and pepsico inc new york based redscout offers services such as trend watching brand consulting and package design it also tries to help marketers develop new products something madison avenue has long tried to add to their arsenal mdc parent of ad agencies such as crispin porter &amp bogusky and kirshenbaum bond &amp partners thinks the redscout acquisition could give it an entree into product development "we think there is an incredible opportunity to cross fertilize them redscout with our other firms and share their knowledge and expertise in developing brands " says miles s nadal mdc partners chairman and chief executive jonah disend the year old founder and chief executive of redscout talks below about the issues that arise during product development and points out some of the biggest consumers trends in the marketplace the wall street journal many ad agencies have flirted with trying to get into product or services development as a way to gain new revenue streams but its never really caught on why do you think they havent been able to make that part of their business model mr disend the discipline of making ads is often about being as different as possible from the competitors this is not necessarily the goal with product development and certainly not the starting point so often with advertising you think how do i add brand value through communications so that i make them want my brand versus your brand we think how do i add value to the thing itself in order to drive desire also there is a totally different mindset when it comes to innovation versus marketing almost every time i interview someone from advertising and i ask them to come up with an innovation solution for a category they immediately go to marketing and promotions solutions they may get to targeting and distribution but they rarely get to the foundational elements of the thing itself these foundational elements include the achilles heel of a competitor that can be exploited in our new product recognizing categories which are desperate for a new approach such as jetblue to the airline industry identifying a new behavior that is begging for a new service offering or spotting technologies or capabilities in a clients stable which are being underleveraged these are all critical to innovation wsj how many products has your firm developed for clients mr disend about to weve done a tremendous amount of skin care and beverages alcoholic and nonalcoholic weve helped develop media properties and some food products we recently helped develop the new positively ageless skin care line for aveeno wsj many ad firms are trying to add product development as a way to expand their business model and change their compensation structures mdc wants its firms to exchange their services for a stake in the product or company how are your deals structured and has your firm ever received a stake in a product or company mr disend we havent gotten any stakes when you are self funded its hard to do this because you need to pay salaries but with mdc behind us there may be more opportunity to have more interesting compensation models because with their backing we have the room to look at different compensation arrangements with our clients what weve done in the past is charge a fee for a product and sometimes we underestimate how successful that product will become wsj what are some of the problems that arise when you develop products for marketers mr disend problems arise when you get too attached to an idea and forget the very reason you developed the idea in the first place we believe that a good new product idea or brand comes from a combination of a consumer insight a marketplace opportunity and is attached to a cultural thread or trend which helps to give the idea currency if you arent careful you can forget any or all of these three elements and get completely attached to the execution quickly the conversation becomes about the color of the package and you lose sight of the bigger picture if you dont hold on to the initial reason you were creating the new idea you can end up with a very shallow idea wsj much of your business relies on being on top of the latest trends or consumer insights what are the biggest consumer trends we are seeing right now mr disend the peter pan syndrome there is a growing trend towards childlike behavior and cultural regression among adults it is harder and harder to tell how old someone is because year olds dress like year olds and still play with toys it is not so much the childlike fashion or toys that i find interesting but rather a consumers desire to embrace a childlike naivete adults play with videogames or toys from kidrobot as a way to avoid adult responsibilities consumers spend &# to have cherries painted on their louis vuitton bag because they want to forget their worries and pretend they are living in neverland also i think that there is a countertrend to the "prosumer" trend the time magazine person of the year being the me trend i call this consumer the enlightened couch potato they know they are empowered and can do things themselves but they dont necessarily want to they want to be surprised and delighted in a clever way cynicism and antimarketing is getting old long live the marketer another trend i am seeing i call substantial decadence there is a return to decadence but this time consumers justify it not because they deserve it but because it is actually good for them now when a consumer goes to the spa it is not in the name of luxury as much as it is about enabling them to think better and when someone drinks red wine sure the buzz is nice but it is really about all those great flavonoids healthy compounds in fruits beverages and certain drinks wsj why be acquired mr disend we are ambitious we have lots of things we want to do including getting bigger we reached a point where without some capital investment we stop taking risks because your cash flow can run out so this was about finding a partner that will help us grow wsj what will you do with the money mr disend expanding internationally is first and foremost wsj why mr disend all of our clients are internationals such as nike pepsi and johnson &amp johnson but its not just about having an outpost in a country its about thinking globally coming up with global insights and understanding consumers in different parts of the world there is also a lot of growth is coming from international markets also its about coming up with ideas for example in japan the skin care and beverage markets are very sophisticated so if you are there you can figure out trends or see trends before they come here
