unusual faa bid stirs turbulence raytheons rivals grumble over pitch for air traffic control contract after decades of relying on ground based technology to control traffic in the sky the federal aviation administration is looking to the heavens and a few major companies for a better solution three separate teams are vying to get in on the ground floor of a &# billion plus project that is expected to become the cornerstone of the next generation air traffic control system the system scheduled to be in widespread use no later than is expected to improve safety and help reduce costly delays it will use precise navigation data from the u s governments global positioning system satellites which are now in common use for all kinds of consumer products officials say this will allow airplanes to fly closer together while simultaneously broadcasting their position to air traffic controllers and other pilots it will augment the nations aging radar based system which doesnt track aircraft as accurately and is having trouble keeping up with increasingly crowded skies this month teams led by raytheon co lockheed martin corp and itt corp are submitting proposals to deploy the first stage of this new system the faa plans in august to pick a single contractor the winner will build a ground system for the new plane tracking service while also helping set standards for the next years of air traffic management raytheon has taken an unusual approach that has sparked grumbling by its competitors and one that could provide a lesson for companies seeking government contracts from budget strapped federal agencies hoping to erode lockheeds dominance in this segment raytheon went beyond the faas request and proposed piggybacking on existing commercial communications systems rather than building new ones by tapping partners xm satellite radio holdings inc and verizon communications inc which have already spent billions on their networks to reach consumers raytheon is proposing a solution that it said could be deployed faster and less expensively it could also open the door to providing more communications services to flying passengers though that element isnt part of raytheons pitch or immediate plans all three bids rely on a combination of ground stations and gps satellite signals for air traffic control data but currently only raytheon is proposing to use satellites specifically xms satellites for weather as well making data about adverse weather conditions more quickly and widely available the waltham mass aerospace contractor said its system could provide universal coverage from almost the first day also xm already provides such services to a growing number of private and corporate planes making it possible that they could switch to the new system at less cost verizon and its network of more than cellular phone towers could house the ground systems itt also has a ground network in place through its partnership with at&amp t inc but itts bid uses ground relays for weather data andy zogg raytheons vice president of airspace management and homeland security acknowledged that the company is taking "a little riskier" approach but "given the importance of ensuring safety and efficiency in already crowded skies and airports we simply couldnt pass up the opportunity " he said the faa said cost and speed will be the deciding factors for this part of the air traffic modernization program known as automatic dependent surveillance broadcast or ads b the faa said the technology has helped reduce small plane accidents in alaska by by providing radar like service in remote areas where pilots previously flew at their own risk it also is gaining ground internationally "this is one of those remarkable instances in which everybody agrees this is the direction we want to be heading its a question of how quickly can we get there " said faa administrator marion blakey the faa envisions a system that would rely on a network of ground stations that would be able to receive signals from airplanes and instantly distribute them to controllers and other aircraft it would use a separate frequency to beam live weather information to all flights faced with the prospect of record air traffic and a system that is so delicately balanced that a single thunderstorm can ground flights nationwide the faa said the ads b program cant be sidetracked contractors will pay for much of the upfront development in return for sharing potential profits that might sprout out of services such as time sensitive flight and planning data that could be carried over the new network the faa has about &# million budgeted for this year and &# million for next year overall the government expects to spend about &# billion to help set up the framework of the system airlines and other users will spend about &# billion primarily for new electronic equipment according to people familiar with the competition raytheons aggressive proposal took the other competitors by surprise particularly lockheed which had been considered a favorite because of its participation in the ads b pilot program in alaska vincent capezzuto the faas director of surveillance and broadcast services said the government will gladly consider new ideas as long as they work he said the faa will consider how quickly the contractors can get their systems up and running as well as how easily they can expand to meet future needs "its up to the vendors to propose the solution its not up to the government to help them propose it " lockheeds team includes harris corp honeywell international inc and sensis corp lockheed officials declined to provide details about their bid or address whether they had overhauled it in response to raytheons entry "it is not appropriate to publicly share our teams competitive offering before the faa completes its evaluation " said lockheed spokeswoman anna dipaola itt said it hasnt been intimidated by the competition and has stuck by its proposal said john kefaliotis who leads itts team itts other partners include thales sa which already provides ads b equipment in france and australia as well as science applications international corp "weve proposed to the faa the best solution the one that theyve asked for and the one that we think serves the flying public the best " mr kefaliotis said
