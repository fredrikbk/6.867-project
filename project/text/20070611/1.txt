americas a mexican revolution mexican tycoon carlos slim recently moved up to second place from third on the list of the worlds wealthiest individuals with bill gates giving away so much of what he has earned it is now likely that mr slim the owner of telefonos de mexico will one day advance to first place yet no matter how good his numbers look there will always be an asterisk next to the slim name in the record books i call it the barry bonds problem even if mr bonds breaks hank aarons home run record he will never be regarded as an equal to mr aaron because most baseball fans dont think he competed on a level playing field mr slim faces a similar legacy problem when compared with creative entrepreneurs like mr gates the software billionaire made his fortune as an innovator who added value to his customers lives mr slim got rich largely by maximizing his opportunities in an environment where he enjoyed monopoly privileges snowballing wealth and a commensurate amount of political influence mr slim is only the most famous of the mexicans who have made a killing by way of monopoly privilege the mexican economy has opened radically in the past two decades but a small number of critically important sectors including fixed line telephony in which telmex controls of the market still enjoy protection from competition nowhere in the world are the economic costs of the slim "business model" better understood than in his own country there is wide agreement among economists that the pricing power of these dominant players has pushed up the cost of doing business in mexico and made the economy uncompetitive with its international rivals this is why mexican modernizers are celebrating a supreme court ruling last week that struck down key provisions in a radio and television law designed to protect broadcasting giant televisa owned by emilio azcarraga and the smaller tvazteca owned by ricardo salinas pliego from new competition critics refer to the legislation as "the televisa law" because it was drafted by televisa lawyers the high courts ruling doesnt directly speak to mr slims telecom monopoly or to similar ones in oil electricity transportation and cement but it does instruct congress on the priority that the constitution places on equal treatment under the law by doing so it raises the bar for lawmakers on issues related to fair competition and sets a precedent that is likely to have an impact on other segments of the economy not open to competition including mr slims fiefdom one of the provisions rejected by the court granted current holders of concessions under analog broadcast i e the existing duopoly the rights to the new spectrum that will open up under the coming conversion to digital broadcast this practically ensured that new competitors would not be able to enter the court also rejected as unconstitutional the provision that made renewal of licenses automatic and grandfathered rights and terms of previous concessions regardless of how laws change the court further defended competition by ruling that bidders that want to participate in radio and television spectrum auctions must first receive a favorable ruling from mexicos competition commission the supreme court decision hasnt gotten a lot of attention outside mexico but it could be one of the most important economic developments in the country in recent years thats because it represents a sea change in mexican jurisprudence which in turn reflects a change of similar magnitude in mexican culture only two decades ago the notion that the mexican elite might see its privileges cut off by the action of an independent supreme court was unthinkable back then it would not have been hyperbolic to say that such a ruling would signal the advent of another mexican revolution this revolution thankfully is peaceful but for a people who lived under one party rule for years it can seem just as radical the north american free trade agreement has both pried open mexicos economy and by increasing information flows helped lead a transition to democracy this political shift is characterized by a national outcry against a system rigged to favor the political and business elite and obstruct economic mobility the challenge that hard left ideologue andres manuel lopez obrador was able to make to the presidency last year was at least in part a manifestation of this popular frustration the current debate in civil society may be about the televisa law but it is really a broader discussion about what the ground rules for competition ought to be the high court reflects this cultural change not only by acting with independence but also by making public its deliberations in favor of competition the courts decision opens the way for president felipe calderon who ran on a competition platform less than a year ago to take a leading role in answering concerns about equality under the law he will be under tremendous pressure by the media moguls to do otherwise which is why the issue is an important test for his young presidency one easy way for mr calderon to establish his bona fides on this issue is to name gonzalo martinez pous and rafael del villar to the federal telecommunications commission cofetel both men carry strong pro competition credentials and were named to cofetel by former president vicente fox but the senate nixed their nominations as part of its work on the televisa law even though it acknowledged both were qualified now that the court has ruled that congress has no power to vet the executives choices for cofetel mr calderon can renominate them and show that he wants a serious pro competition regulator the president can also take a proactive role in redrafting the provisions the court struck down and sending them to congress this should include an accelerated schedule for the countrys conversion to digital broadcast to be sure it will mean a fight the dinosaurs will be waiting for him and working the senate as they did last year he will have to take his case to the public and that wont be easy since his adversaries still control the airwaves yet on his side will be plenty of modernizers who understand that failure to deliver equality under the law will mean the failure of mexicos struggle for liberal democracy the stakes are that high and history will judge mr calderon accordingly
