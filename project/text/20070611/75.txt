the afternoon report bush returns to the grind online edition president bush got a heros welcome when he toured the balkans wrapping up a weeklong european tour but when the president touches down in washington later today it likely wont take long for him to feel under siege the president has made overhauling immigration laws one of his second term priorities and he told reporters he would return home determined to revive a bipartisan compromise measure that appeared all but dead after twice falling short of the votes required to close off debate last week senate majority leader harry reid elected to pull the legislation from the floor and move on to other business but mr bush made it clear that he wants the bill back at the top of the agenda "ill see you at the bill signing " the president said when asked about the proposal during a stop in bulgaria saying "we made two steps forward on immigration we took a step back " mr bush plans to eat lunch with a group of republican senators on capitol hill tomorrow in an attempt to sway conservatives who have come under tremendous grassroots pressure to vote against a bill that detractors claim provides amnesty to illegal immigrants the bill also faces opposition from democratic lawmakers who among other provisions dont like a guest worker program in the measure that they worry may create a permanent underclass of immigrant laborers amid the back and forth over immigration senate democrats were also getting set for a vote of no confidence on attorney general alberto gonzales who continues to ride out an uproar over his management of the justice department despite numerous calls including some from prominent republicans for his resignation democrats have hammered mr gonzales over the firings of federal prosecutors for what they charge were improper political considerations and for his conflicting accounts of his knowledge of and involvement in the dismissals mr bush has stood by mr gonzales who has been close to the president since his days as the governor of texas and today he deemed the no confidence vote a "meaningless resolution" that would have "no bearing" on mr gonzaless fate "theres no wrongdoing " mr bush said "ill make the determination if i think hes effective " the senate vote is scheduled for late this afternoon and is seen breaking along party lines meaning it will fall short of the votes needed for the resolution to survive arriving in sofia bulgaria mr bush received the sort of welcome that he has seen in few other nations in recent years thousands lined the streets along the route of the presidential motorcade offering a sharp contrast to the throngs of protesters that had greeted the president and other leaders at the group of eight summit in germany last week
