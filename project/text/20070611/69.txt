conclusions of several u s economic policy experts the most obvious reason is that economies need workers and workers need people to watch their children affordable caring and engaging child care options allow parents to go through their workday with greater confidence and fewer disruptions parents whose child care needs are met are greater assets to their employers and to regional economies says jen wohl director of the children youth and families program of the national economic development and law center a nonprofit group that aims to revitalize depressed communities at the same time organized child care also creates jobs and contributes revenue to other sectors researchers say but businesses and state governments need to create a more efficient child care infrastructure that

ucla i know other faculty who actually seem to enjoy commuting they choose to live in distant suburbs and happen to own nice cars with good stereos if their commute is five minutes shorter each day have they been made much better off if people knew that they could drive faster due to effective congestion policies would they "sprawl" more and live further from their jobs peter gordon writes i agree that u s highway traffic problems are not as bad as elsewhere in the world but many americans have high expectations and some of the nations worst commutes have been getting the most attention still traffic congestion where it exists is actually a no brainer in fact its necessary we insist on free access to roads in most places and as a result we actually rely on congestion to ration scarce road space what strikes me as interesting is how comparatively little congestion we get in spite of both policy failures and growth in population income and travel online today wsj com subscribers can
