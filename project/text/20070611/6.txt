bidens deterrence plan who do we attack after the next joe bidens proposal to catalog nuclear materials as a deterrence by facilitating forensic research after an attack "csi nukes " editorial page june leaves me cringing forlorn and angry that such an idea is supported by a u s senator he says that "we will hold accountable any country" and that "would risk condemnation or suspicion " perhaps the idea here is that the likes of bin laden and ahmadinejad choke to death laughing at such toothless threats to their nuclear ambitions sen biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee has not held accountable those nations that openly support our demise attack our personnel citizens and assets and ignore sanctions by a feckless u n ducking its promises of accountability the u s has not held kim jong il accountable for any of his broken promises most recently think &# million worth of accountability with non response firmly on his watch just what would joe biden do differently if additional forensic evidence backed up the obvious pound the table stamp his feet make a threatening speech i propose as demonstration of our determination to win resolve strength and follow through on the relatively simple matters already fallen behind us john siebold boise idaho predictably sen biden misses the point he says "deterrence cannot rest on words alone it must be backed up by capabilities " as the israelis proved years ago it also takes "will " congress is doing its best to prove that all the deterrence in the world cannot make up for a failure of will norriss m webb lake oswego ore sen biden suggests that we can "deter" would be nuclear terrorists with improved nuclear forensics his idea is important creative and ultimately incomplete he states correctly that "the u s has long deterred a nuclear attack by states by clearly and credibly threatening devastating retaliation " he then suggests that nuclear forensics examining samples from an intercepted attack or air and ground debris from a realized attack can be the "new deterrence " as mutually assured destruction was to the cold war sen bidens argument goes so will be nuclear forensics to the war on terror but theres a problem with this argument nuclear forensics is just a way to figure out where nuclear materials came from just as tracking missiles or bombers during the cold war was a way to identify the provenance of weapons however sen biden does not address the crucial next step once we know where the nuclear material came from then what do we retaliate with nuclear weapons against a state sponsor with conventional weapons does our response depend on whether the state sponsor provided the nuclear materials willfully or negligently and whats the burden of proof do we have to be sure that a country provided materials in order to retaliate against it or sure sen bidens solution in short may tell us where nuclear materials came from but it will not answer the larger and more important question once we know what do we do michael pereira new york
