pakistans stock boom rally rolls on despite political woes pakistani president pervez musharraf is caught in a political maelstrom as an election looms and popular criticism of the military installed leader mounts yet pakistans stock market is soaring to record levels investment managers and stock analysts say the main reason is that despite gen musharrafs political woes his governments economic policies a successful privatization program financial deregulation and other changes have worked the result an unprecedented influx of fresh foreign and local investment and sharply reduced government debt are paving the way for longer term expansion and some analysts believe that even if gen musharaff should lose power any new government would likely keep in place his main economic policies "structurally the economy now is on much firmer footing to sustain growth for next three to five years " says mudassir malik director of karachi based bma capital management which runs the &# million pakistan opportunity fund the countrys first offshore dollar based fund that view has been reflected in a surging stock market the karachi stock exchanges index has jumped more than this year reaching

wake of saturdays announcement of the government budget for the fiscal year that begins july the budget designed to sustain robust growth and appeal to voters greatly increases the amount of development spending but imposes no changes in taxes on capital market activity the spurt on pakistans stock exchange has been powered by a record inflow of foreign funds which is expected to exceed

fiscal most of the investment comes from persian gulf countries whose investors have bought into many recently privatized state enterprises "it is very clear from the inflow of both direct foreign

total market value of &# billion foreign investors have targeted the financial energy textile and cement sectors in particular popular stocks with foreign funds include oil &amp gas development corp pakistan state oil national bank of pakistan and pakistan telecommunication market analysts predict that pakistans stocks will remain attractive because they are significantly cheaper than those in

current situation " says ryan floyd vice president for emerging markets at new york brokerage firm auerbach grayson "the pakistani economy is very vibrant despite the politics and violence " adds mark mathews a singapore based asia strategist with merrill lynch the apparent disconnect between pakistans political problems and its buoyant economy has become a striking paradox in recent years pakistan is expected to register growth this year the government has targeted for the coming year under gen musharraf and his economic czar prime minister shaukat aziz a former citigroup inc banker pakistan has pursued an aggressive privatization program in the past four years the government has sold more than &# billion in state assets including banks telecommunications and industrial companies the program has particularly been successful in improving the financial sector with privatized banks now accounting for almost of the banking industry analysts credit privatization with easing the burden on the governments finances resulting in significant improvement the countrys fiscal position debt as a percentage of gross domestic product fell to in down from in when gen musharraf came to power in a bloodless coup that has lowered the risk premium that investors assign to pakistani financial assets still the markets immunity from political unrest could be tested soon as the possibility of fresh crises loom gen musharraf who has said he intends to seek a second five year term as president after parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year is under mounting attack "if it comes to a point where uncertainty increases about gen musharrafs political future it could start impacting the investments " says sakib sherani an economist with abn amro bank "there will be a potential reassessment and a wait and see attitude " but some analysts expect basic continuity in economic policies even if gen musharraf fails in his bid to retain power they reason that almost all the countrys mainstream political parties as well as the powerful military are committed to economic liberalization
