regional economic roundup a special report stopping the brain drain getting college students to come is one thing getting them to stay after graduation is something else harrisburg pa a common refrain in pennsylvania is that the state is a "net importer" of college students but a "net exporter" of college graduates with its roster of colleges including the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh and pennsylvania state university in state college pennsylvania attracts more out of state freshmen who graduated from high school in the past year than any other state federal data show but many students take their diplomas and run leaving pennsylvania with the third oldest population in the nation as measured by the number of people and older the result the state is struggling to attract the type of cutting edge companies that would make it a major participant in the "knowledge based" economy one driven by highly skilled workers and industries like technology science and health care the state is on a mission to change that three years ago pennsylvania developed a program called keystone innovation zones or kiz designed to do two things keep the best and brightest college students from leaving and foster the creation of science and technology companies kiz has awarded &# million in grants for research faculty to pennsylvania colleges offers &# million in tax credits annually to new companies and encourages hundreds of firms to extend paid internships to students in the belief that collegians who have worked in the state are more likely to stay "theres a natural inclination when you come out of college if there are jobs available to stay in that area " says dennis yablonsky the states secretary of community and economic development "were trying to create an environment where this is easier to do " the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency has provided &# million in scholarships and internship wages for those studying in the science and technology fields the state also has set aside of the &# billion it received in tobacco settlement payments for bioscience research some of which is being disbursed to state colleges attracting and retaining recent college graduates in an effort to create a more knowledge based economy is "one of the hottest trends in economic development today " says rob derocker executive vice president of development counsellors international a new york firm that helps companies relocate research suggests that a large pool of well educated young people can be just as important to creating a vibrant economy as big employers and real estate development in regions where a larger fraction of the work force is college educated wages rise among everyone in the community not just the degree holders says leah platt boustan who teaches economics at the university of california los angeles but for that to happen competitive jobs must be available as well as a vibrant nightlife and other forms of entertainment she says in one study ms boustan and her colleagues looked at alabama west virginia and massachusetts over periods in which the states received federal funding for advanced education and research results showed that massachusetts kept the graduates due to the rapid growth of the technology industry in boston and its suburbs alabama and west virginia didnt because they lacked the jobs and amenities students were seeking a higher concentration of degree holders may help boost a states economic growth according to enrico moretti who teaches economics at the university of california berkeley his research shows that a one percentage point increase in a citys share of college graduates can equate to a to percentage point increase in productivity which he calls "remarkably robust " but employees with advanced degrees in the most productive states arent necessarily educated there he says while states that invest in higher education retain more graduates than those who dont they also are "financing the human capital in los angeles san francisco and new york " says mr moretti the finger lakes region of upstate new york lost tens of thousands of jobs in recent years when the large manufacturing companies that supported the economy closed plants and downsized the region which also is the states biggest wine producer is now trying to entice cornell universitys viticulture and enology students to set up wineries or related businesses in an attempt to transform the area into the napa valley of the northeast cornells program is funded in large part by the state which also is subsidizing a new lab to research grape genetics and winemaking among similar initiatives in other states kalamazoo mich has joined with the monroe brown foundation to offer &# in scholarships and wages to nearby college students who take part in an internship at one of local companies including stryker corp s stryker instruments unit columbus ohio has launched a program called attract talent to woo and retain young professionals from ohio state university through internships affordable housing and outreach "sectors and communities that are going to be competitive in this global economy are going to be competitive based on their knowledge resources " says mr yablonsky "the basis of a knowledge economy really has to be the colleges universities and health care " while attracting and retaining students is a statewide initiative cities in pennsylvania have their own marketing programs to tout the virtues of their particular locales to both college students and young professionals harrisburg the state capital is publicizing qualities that philadelphia and other big cities cant always offer affordable housing and a low key rural or suburban existence the affordability factor appeals to rachel el mourli a year old mother of two and a premed undergraduate student at harrisburg university a native of long island n y ms el mourli doesnt believe she can afford to settle down in the new york area where median home prices are &# on long island and &# in manhattan around harrisburg median home prices are &# ms el mourli says she hopes to settle in the harrisburg area after she completes medical school the university offered her a lucrative financial aid package "there are hundreds of start up companies that have to do with science and technology around here " says ms el mourli she said her internship at the technology council of central pennsylvania a nonprofit organization dedicated to the growth and success of technology companies in the region gave her an "in" with all of these tiny start ups "they all want to have a network so they join the technology council " she says creating a knowledge based economy doesnt happen overnight and investing in higher education is just one piece of the intricate puzzle that economists still dont completely understand even when all of the pieces are in place the transition from rust belt to intellectual artery can take years to succeed pennsylvania will have to win over students like year old stephanie byers who grew up in state college pa and graduated from penn state last month after majoring in graphic design ms byers is applying for jobs in bigger cities like san francisco where "theres more to do and people are excited about their work " she says "for graphic design id like to get into big firms and pennsylvania doesnt really have a lot to offer " she says but there are signs that pennsylvanias effort is working on some consider daniel wright a year old sophomore at dickinson college in carlisle pa pursuing a dual major in biology and math he hopes to start a business that will genetically modify crops to contain vaccinations or add nutritional value when he first arrived in pennsylvania from the san francisco bay area he had every intention of returning to california but he reconsidered after networking with biotech companies and associations through his internship at hanson technologies inc a local start up that has received &# million in funds from state agencies the company produces sensors to detect disease causing agents in food and water "if pennsylvania continues to encourage small start ups it might not be such a bad call to stay here " mr wright says ms lacapra is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be reached at lauren lacapra wsj com
