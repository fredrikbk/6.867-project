politics &amp economics at fdic a firm hand for banking industry sheila bair causes stir in her first year as chairman and gains some unlikely supporters washington one of washingtons most vocal supporters of strict new bank lending standards is neither a democrat nor consumer activist but a republican white house appointed capitol hill veteran during sheila bairs first year as chairman of the once sleepy federal deposit insurance corp she has irked some republicans and many in the banking industry with calls for tougher government regulation among other things she froze efforts by wal mart stores inc and home depot inc to start up federally insured banks more recently she caused a stir by suggesting that some wall street investors bear responsibility for causing the blowup in the market for subprime mortgages all this comes at a critical time for the banking industry its federally regulated banks have enjoyed a relatively light regulatory hand for much of the past decade but control of congress by democrats who support more oversight over bank lending and rising defaults by subprime borrowers have raised questions about how long that might last in breaking with other federal regulators including the federal reserve ms bair is pushing for changes that would have broad ramifications for millions of homeowners and companies she has urged the fed to assert its authority and to extend tougher lending standards over companies that operate without federal oversight such as the state licensed mortgage lenders that proliferated during the subprime boom such a move could make it harder for high risk borrowers to obtain a mortgage but could also drive down foreclosure and delinquency rates "i dont work for banks " ms bair said in an interview "im a public servant my job is to make decisions that i think are the right public policy " ms bair said she embraces an innovative banking system but added there must be oversight and regulation when markets falter "i very much believe in the market but i think you have to set rules for the market and markets dont always work the way they should " she said ms bair years old is the th chairman of the fdic an agency created in to restore confidence in the banking system following the thousands of bank failures during the great depression the fdic offers limited federal deposit insurance to bank accounts as a way of deterring customers from withdrawing their money during tough times which in turn would forestall the wave of bank failures that occurred in the s today the fdics examiners and a &# billion insurance fund backstop &# trillion in u s deposits bank regulators typically make policy changes slowly and uniformly a style ms bair has challenged this has led some in the industry and inside government to grumble about her willingness to place such a high value on consumer protection and what they call her relative distrust of the market her supporters by contrast praise her willingness to stake out tough positions "shes dealing with reality " said robert dole the former kansas republican senator for whom ms bair worked during much of the s as a legal counsel and on his presidential campaign "the reality is the democrats control the congress she has an obligation to deal with the problems and work with the people who are there " ms bair ran unsuccessfully for congress as a kansas republican in she worked in government relations for the new york stock exchange and later held a senior post in the treasury department after president bush was first elected she left washington in to teach financial regulatory policy at the university of massachusetts but returned to lead the fdic in june earlier this year ms bair predicted that the problems that might stem from the strained subprime mortgage market would worsen she pushed congress to hold accountable wall street investors and the companies that service such loans "i think we should hold the servicers and investors feet to the fire on this " she told the house financial services committee in april "it was clear to investors that these were high risk i think everybody needs to share the pain now " ms bair said these companies should develop strategies that would allow borrowers with expensive loans to work out more manageable monthly payments which in turn could reduce the number of delinquencies and foreclosures this unexpected position won her the support of some democrats when senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd d conn held a closed door meeting with bankers and wall street executives to discuss the subprime market ms bair was the only regulator invited to attend "she has a good institutional understanding of what the role is of a regulator in a democracy " said house financial services committee chairman barney frank d mass "i think shes thought about that a lot " ms bair also led the fdics decision to place an month moratorium on applications by wal mart home depot and others to obtain a federally insured bank this put her in the middle of a showdown between the banking industry which wants to preserve its market position and the large retail and automotive companies that want to offer consumer banking services her decision bought time for congress to consider banning commercial ownership of banks a move that would upend almost a century of precedent unlike some of her other decisions this move was warmly supported by most in the banking industry but was also cheered by those on the left such as labor unions who criticize wal marts employee practices ms bair has authored a childrens book "rock brock and the savings shock " which encourages children to save money she has tried with limited success to encourage banks to offer inexpensive small denomination loans to consumers which would supplant the high cost short term loans that such consumers can take out before pay day she has also begun a task force aimed at getting the roughly million people who dont have bank accounts into the banking system "we were created because the banking system had failed and confidence in the banking system was no longer there " ms bair said referring to the great depression "just given our historic origins i think we have a particularly close connection with the general public perhaps more so than some of the other bank regulators " robert steel the treasury departments under secretary for domestic finance and a former goldman sachs vice chairman said the fact that some in washington might bristle at ms bairs approach isnt necessarily a bad thing "i think theres a good dialogue and some tension probably is appropriate " he said
