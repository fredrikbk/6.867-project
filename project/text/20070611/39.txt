in canada a funds messy downfall for thousands of average investors lured by the sizable returns on hedge funds boaz manor and his colleagues seemed to offer a chance to enter a world normally open only to the rich the outcome now looks like a cautionary tale for small investors seeking to tap hedge fund riches according to canadian authorities the year old mr manor was a founder and principal of the portus group a toronto based collection of investment entities that offered an appealing product for as little as &# a person could buy into an investment vehicle that supposedly guaranteed the investors principal while putting some of the money into a collection of hedge funds that could provide a healthy return between and portus attracted about &# million from roughly individuals mostly canadians "it was a hedge fund for the masses " says j p bisnaire general counsel of manulife financial corp the canadian insurance giant that steered several thousand of its clients into portus investments in early however portus collapsed amid escalating canadian regulatory inquiries into whether it was living up to promises it made to investors portus entities were put into receivership and mr manor left for israel the ontario securities commission filed still pending charges of securities law violations against him in the roughly two years since the fall of portus government investigators have uncovered a tangled tale involving caribbean bank accounts allegedly falsified business records a swiss banker and &# million in missing diamonds last believed to be in hong kong the collapse prompted manulife to reimburse its customers the money they sent to portus a total of more than &# million says mr bisnaire and file a still pending lawsuit against a bank that had been involved with portus mr manors israeli attorney says his client doesnt have any comment but during court ordered questioning in israel by the receiver mr manor denied wrongdoing saying he merely worked at portus and didnt control the operation the portus saga has been unfolding at a time when regulators and others have begun expressing concern about the risks that hedge fund investing could pose for average investors while the scandal has produced headlines in canada it has received little attention in the u s hedge funds are lightly regulated pools of capital that put money into a wide variety of investments more than hedge funds control an estimated &# trillion of capital with little government oversight and few public reporting requirements hedge funds generally have been open only to institutions and wealthy individuals but with all the news coverage given hedge funds and their sometimes outsized returns regulators worry that average investors might be lured in by unscrupulous operators last year for instance keith gilabert a valencia calif hedge fund operator pleaded guilty in los angeles federal court to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with raising some &# million from more than investors federal prosecutors said mr gilabert stole funds and lied about his investment track record he is awaiting sentencing mr gilaberts lawyer declined to comment given the hoopla around hedge funds these days "there will be more cases coming " says ralph lambiase director of the securities and business investments division at the connecticut department of banking one way smaller investors could get into the game is through a vehicle known as a "fund of hedge funds " such funds which are regulated by the securities and exchange commission have professional managers who put investor money into a basket of hedge funds although such funds still tend to be open only to well heeled investors sec commissioner roel campos for one argues that they should be opened more broadly while direct hedge fund investing is too risky for the average person having a professional intermediary provides "a crucial and meaningful layer of investor protection " mr campos said in remarks at a hedge fund conference earlier this year the portus arrangement in canada was similar in some respects to a fund of hedge funds mr manor and a colleague formed portus in and registered with canadian regulators portus offered an investment package that included a complex combination of bank notes stocks and options with returns tied to a group of hedge funds according to the pending ontario securities commission case against mr manor and others from portus portus paid referral fees of or more to agents who sent it customers the commission said a report released last month by the portus receiver accounting firm kpmg alleges that false records were created through a cayman islands firm showing that about &# million of stock had been purchased for the investment package when no shares had actually been bought meanwhile about &# million of client funds were "diverted" for improper purposes such as running portus and paying referral fees to agents who brought in customers the receivers report said the receiver has managed to recover about &# million of that amount from bank accounts in the turks &amp caicos islands with the help of a swiss banker named jean pierre regli hired to transfer cash to accounts in europe when the portus scandal broke mr regli contacted authorities and offered his help mr reglis name popped up in different context in a case involving langbar international ltd whose shares traded on londons alternative investment market until late when the company said it couldnt verify the existence of several hundred million dollars of bank deposits on its books british criminal investigators opened an inquiry which hasnt yet produced any charges langbar has filed still pending monetary claims in a london court against several individuals including mr regli a former director who allegedly helped run the company the company contends that mr regli knew the bank deposits didnt exist it also obtained a contempt citation against him for failing to comply with a court order mr regli denies any wrongdoing in the langbar matter and says his attorney is fighting the contempt citation "which is unfounded on the merits " in the portus case the search for funds continues including the &# million the receiver says went to buy diamonds the recent receivers report said that the stones were supposedly kept for a time in a safe deposit box in a hong kong bank everyone questioned including mr manor denies knowing where the diamonds are
