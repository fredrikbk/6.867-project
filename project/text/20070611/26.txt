general retreat theres a rumor going around that robert gates is the secretary of defense wed like to request official confirmation because based on recent evidence the man running the pentagon is democratic senator carl levin of michigan for that matter is george w bush still president we cant help but wonder after the bush administrations refusal last week to renominate marine general peter pace to a second two year term as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mr gates had earlier sent the names of general pace and his deputy admiral edmund giambastiani to the white house for approval as his choices for the nations top two non civilian military posts mr bush had agreed but then on friday mr gates or some impersonator declared at a pentagon press conference that he had decided not to renominate the two men because he wanted to avoid a "quite contentious" debate on capitol hill over iraq mind you said mr gates his decision had "absolutely nothing to do with my view of general paces performance or that of general sic giambastiani whatsoever " its just that general pace was vice chairman for four years and has been chairman for two more and was one of mr bushs main iraq war generals so mr gates the ostensible leader of our fighting men and women concluded that he didnt want to do any political fighting of his own for general pace the veteran of combat in hue city and the first marine to hold the chairmans job will now be the shortest serving chairman in more than years mr gates nominated admiral michael mullen to replace general pace and because the chairman and vice chairman dont typically come from the same service branches admiral giambastiani also had to go to his credit the admiral declined mr gatess offer of another job and will retire as well mr gates seems to think he can succeed as the anti rumsfeld by appeasing the likes of mr levin but his kowtow only makes mr bush look weaker as a commander in chief who cant even select his own war generals mr levin was quick to brag about his latest conquest confirming for reporters that he had told mr gates that general paces nomination would have resulted in a fight the democrat will now return mr gatess favor by holding senate hearings on the administrations detainee and interrogation policy mr levin is seeking thousands of documents to further embarrass mr bush and were told mr gates is urging the white house counsels office to accommodate the democrat the irony is that mr pace is less responsible for our iraq troubles than is general george casey who mr gates was happy to support for army chief of staff this year despite similar democratic threats as lead u s commander in iraq in general casey always had one eye on a u s exit and failed to counter the spread of sectarian warfare he also opposed the current "surge" in baghdad while general pace whatever his private advice has been a loyal public supporter of mr bush congressional approval ratings have been falling as democrats devote their energies to repudiating the iraq war and a confirmation battle might even have helped mr bush make his case against precipitous withdrawal general casey was confirmed with only "no" votes while general paces reward for loyalty is early retirement other officers eager for promotion wont forget that precedent general paces fate is one more example of mr bushs recent habit of abandoning those most closely identified with his iraq policy paul wolfowitz received only tepid support from treasury while he was besieged at the world bank while i lewis "scooter" libby may soon go to jail because the president has refused to pardon him with mr libby what is mr bush afraid of jeopardizing his approval rating a pardon would be a two day story his opponents cant hate mr bush more than they already do and his supporters would cheer to see the president standing by the man who stood by him when others in his administration cut and ran the levin democrats arent seeking some new "bipartisan" strategy that will avoid defeat in iraq they want to blame mr bush for defeat so they can destroy his presidency and elect a democrat in mr bush cant change that through appeasement in washington but only by improving the facts on the ground in baghdad we thought he hired mr gates to make that happen not to act as a beltway middleman for carl levins desires
