regional economic roundup a special report a new ballgame sports stadium dont have to drag down the local economy as long as theyre done right san diego local boosters have long pitched new stadiums for professional sports teams as economic development tools even while academic research shows they are nothing of the sort the overwhelming evidence is that sports venues put a drag on local economies by eroding spending on other activities and boosting municipal costs so how to explain san diegos petco park a &# million project that included &# million in public money since the new home of major league baseballs san diego padres opened in this citys downtown in completed development within a block area around the ballpark has topped &# billion according to the centre city development corp a public nonprofit group leading san diegos downtown redevelopment effort that figure includes residential units hotel rooms and square feet of commercial space another &# billion in residential and commercial development is either planned or under way "when they built the ballpark things exploded " says jerry sanders san diegos mayor since the key it appears is that instead of simply building a stadium and hoping for investment to follow the city of san diego and the padres undertook a more ambitious plan to transform a languishing industrial neighborhood known as east village that included the unusual and sometimes controversial arrangement of padres owner john moores acting as a master developer of some blocks around the stadium through his firm jmi realty inc the project faced more than a dozen lawsuits many of them from opponents of its public funding all of them eventually dismissed "we took a broader urban planning perspective " says erik judson who oversaw petcos construction as the padres vice president of development "our intent was to create more than a ballpark " even though it is only a few years old petco already feels like part of the fabric of downtown san diego the stadium is tucked into the southwest corner of east village an iconic building of sandstone and steel that has views of san diego bay to the west and balboa park to the north the surrounding neighborhood is dotted with contemporary midrise residential towers and renovated historic structures on game nights crowds mill about the streets some paying &# to watch the padres play from a grassy three acre park overlooking centerfield or ducking into hip spacious eateries for pizza and beer "the stadium creates a sort of bustle " says hallie smith a year old speech pathologist who paid &# several years ago for her east village condominium to be sure other publicly financed stadiums have succeeded in helping to generate economic activity coors field in denver home of the colorado rockies is widely seen as having helped spark the residential and commercial revitalization of the citys lower downtown or lodo neighborhood and the baltimore orioles oriole park at camden yards helped transform the citys inner harbor into a vibrant mix of hotel retail and office space the project was such a hit that the maryland stadium authority added m&amp t bank stadium for the national football leagues baltimore ravens in both cases as in san diego success depended on doing more than just building a ballpark the area around coors field benefited from historic preservation and guidelines encouraging residential development while camden yards was part of a broader effort that sought to create a sense of place but more typical is houstons minute maid park the home of the houston astros which opened in as enron field amid high hopes for downtown revitalization today the stadium is surrounded mostly by asphalt parking lots and a cluster of turn of the century buildings several blocks from the ballpark are wanting for tenants "a ballpark by itself is not likely to spur other development " says andrew zimbalist a professor of economics at smith college in northampton mass "it hasnt done it it wont do it " in "the economics of sports facilities and their communities " published in the journal of economic perspectives in mr zimbalist and john sigfried of vanderbilt university cite several studies that show no statistically significant positive correlation between stadium construction and economic development including one by sports economist robert baade a professor at lake forest college in suburban chicago that found "no significant difference in personal income growth from to between metropolitan areas that hosted a team in one of the four premier professional sports leagues and otherwise comparable areas that did not " mr zimbalist allows that a professional sports team can create a better quality of life in cities by helping to foster an urban identity and providing a shared experience but he says money spent watching professional sports detracts from spending in other areas such as other forms of entertainment while professional sports venues increase costs for cities in areas such as security sanitation and debt service such research raises questions about how much credit petco deserves as a generator of economic development indeed downtown redevelopment was well under way before the ballpark was built and san diego was enjoying an extraordinary economic boom resulting in downtown housing prices rising more than between and to &# a square foot from &# a square foot would the transformation of east village from low density warehouse district to hopping urban village have happened regardless "over time the area would have developed " says gary london president of london group realty advisors inc a san diego consulting firm "but the ballpark speeded up the time frame probably by a decade " city officials viewed the ballpark as a key anchor in their efforts to redevelop downtown some acres between san diego bay and interstate they figured a stadium could do for the acre east village what horton plaza a major open air shopping mall has done for downtowns gaslamp quarter a once hard luck district that is now full of restaurants bars and boutiques together they argued the two adjacent districts could create a hour downtown the ballpark measure san diego voters passed in by about allowed the city to acquire some blocks some of it through eminent domain it also required mr mooress jmi realty to take the lead in planning and developing the area around the stadium including two hotels two parking garages and the renovation of two historic buildings this arrangement allowed the padres to create a funding source for the city through a levy on hotel rooms and increased property taxes still the project faced considerable hurdles it was dogged by opponents of publicly financed sports facilities including one former city council member who filed about half the lawsuits against the stadium in with litigation putting the financing plan in jeopardy the padres suspended construction of the project mr moores meanwhile was caught up in a scandal when a san diego city council member resigned after she admitted accepting gifts from the padres owner in the midst of a vote on the project including air travel an investigation cleared mr moores of any wrongdoing construction resumed in but by that time the terrorist attacks of sept had discouraged investment in the ballpark area mr moores had counted on a number of partners but most backed off amid the recession the padres owner barely managed to get financing for a key project the room omni san diego hotel which includes luxury condominiums and direct access to petco via a pedestrian skybridge today he has invested some &# million in hotel and residential projects downtown san diego still presents some risk for investors much of the development around the ballpark was intended to be office space but as the office market slowed developers undertook residential projects now the softening condominium market has left east village with considerable inventory yet mr moores continues to build in his pipeline is the &# billion ballpark village a mixed use development with million square feet located on acres of what is now two parking lots meanwhile mr moores is trying to adapt the petco model to other communities through jmi sports llc in the phoenix suburb of goodyear ariz mr judson principal of the firm is working on a plan with local officials to transform a acre cotton field into a &# million seat spring training stadium for the cleveland indians surrounded by an urban village the strategy of including surrounding development in stadium plans is increasingly winning favor among developers but the scale of such projects and mix of uses can make them difficult to pull off still flush with success in san diego mr judson is undeterred "this is absolutely about trying to integrate development of stadiums and downtowns " says mr judson "we intend to get something done " mr herrick is a staff reporter in the wall
