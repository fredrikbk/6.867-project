ahead of the tape old formulas for bonds may get tossed alan greenspans interest rate "conundrum" is going into reverse last weeks selloff in the bond market sent the yield on year treasury notes from to the highest level since last july if one just looks at the economy the increase in long term interest rates might seem surprising u s gross domestic product has been expanding sluggishly for a year and grew at an annual rate of just in the first quarter with housing continuing to buckle and consumers getting pinched at the gas pump a great revival doesnt appear to be at hand bond investors tend to like slow growth it helps to keep slack in the economy and hold down the great enemy of bond buyers inflation the investment formula is supposed to go like this when the economy slows you buy bonds sending their price up and their yield down yet the formula doesnt seem to be working now contrast this with february when housing was still on an upswing the economy was growing much more quickly and the federal reserve was raising interest rates to forestall inflation back then the year treasury was yielding less than mr greenspan fed chief at the time told congress long term rates didnt make sense and called the situation a conundrum today we have the opposite it might not be so puzzling other developed countries were growing at a slower pace than the u s back in their central bankers were keeping interest rates low outside the u s on a global basis higher yielding treasurys were a relatively good place to put your money investors piled into them which helped to hold their yields down also stronger growth here meant the u s was the customer of choice for export oriented economies like china frequently the dollars that exporters brought home were recycled into treasurys pushing yields lower still now economic growth outside the u s is more robust than it is at home the organization for economic cooperation and development projects the economies of japan the euro zone britain and canada will all grow faster than the u s this year and outside the u s central bankers are showing a greater penchant to raise interest rates putting pressure on rates here in a world where capital flows seamlessly and instantly across borders old formulas for figuring out bonds might need to get tossed "in the past you could say what the u s gdp growth trajectory is and ill tell you what will happen to bond yields " says william sterling of new york investment firm trilogy advisors "we dont live there anymore " because the u s imports much more than it exports it is in effect borrowing from abroad to buy foreign goods that means that the u s needs to continually attract money from overseas to fund its spending with short term interest rates rising abroad and stronger economies making the rest of the developed world look more attractive u s interest rates might need to move up too to keep attracting foreign capital mr greenspans old conundrum looks nice in retrospect low rates fed a housing boom and a corporate buyout boom if the conundrum keeps moving in reverse it would mean higher borrowing costs for home buyers and companies instead send comments to justin lahart wsj com
