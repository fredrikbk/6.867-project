regional economic roundup a special report editors note its hard to like the incentives game that cities and states use to lure businesses its even harder not to play it the problem is a simple one taxpayers shell out huge amounts of money to attract companies to their communities many of which probably would have moved there anyway worse companies get this cash based on promises about new jobs and then too often fail to live up to those promises so why do so many governments play the game because they dont feel like they have much choice unilateral disarmament has never been the most popular political strategy now though as conor dougherty describes in his cover story governments are at least making it harder for corporate players not to cheat some cities arent forking over the cash until companies come up with the jobs other cities are insisting that companies give back money if their promises prove to be empty eventually governments may decide they would rather quit the incentives game entirely but in the meantime its good to know they are starting to play it a lot smarter
