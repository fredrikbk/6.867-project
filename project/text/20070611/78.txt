nicklaus is the face of the company and the main force behind its growth however the growth of golf related industries traditionally comes in fits and starts "we understand the risks and we think well be able to manage them " mr milstein says mr nicklaus nicknamed the golden bear won professional majors in his heyday from the s through the mid s and is considered by many the greatest golfer of all time although tiger woods who has won majors is on track to challenge that claim over the years mr nicklaus has translated his fame and expertise into a significant business enterprise but never quite as successfully as his long time rival arnold palmer or the younger charismatic australian greg norman whose businesses have included wine sportswear boats golf clubs real estate and restaurants twice mr nicklaus has suffered serious setbacks in the mid s his company golden bear golf inc overextended itself into areas such as oil and insurance forcing mr nicklaus to negotiate personal loans with

in the design group which accounts for at least half of the companys profits the company plans to step up the growth overseas where demand for golf courses is skyrocketing while there are courses in the world of them are in the u s with most of the new demand coming from abroad according to mr milstein and mr nicklaus mr nicklaus has courses under way or planned in india korea china russia ukraine the czech republic greece croatia and turkey mr nicklaus who logged more than hours on his gulfstream jet last year this summer will travel to kazakhstan to plan a course "were getting the lions share of the work for golf courses getting built " he said his reputation as a course designer has improved significantly since he began learning the craft in the late s by helping veteran designer pete dye create the harbour town golf links in hilton head s c his earliest solo designs were extremely difficult for average players it is said by golf experts that he built courses that suited his own style of play very long and favoring a left to right approach angle into greens but in recent years his courses have become more player friendly and increasingly include features such as short par fours and greens that can be reached with low running shots instead of only through the air making them fun to play while most of mr nicklauss designs lack the high aesthetic reputation of courses created by likes of tom fazio tom doak and the team of ben crenshaw and bill coore they are well regarded and mr nicklaus is deeply involved in about half of those his company produces those are known as jack nicklaus signature courses and carry a premium design fee typically between &# and &# million work on the other nicklaus golf courses is carried out by veteran designers at jack nicklaus design the nicklaus name on any course significantly increases its worth to developers because it allows them to sell the accompanying real estate or resort properties at a higher price under the traditional business model mr nicklaus got only the design fee and in some cases also a small cut of the developments profits working with the mr milstein however the company expects to finance and develop more of its own real estate "we can help the nicklaus companies capture more of those opportunities " mr milstein says all four of mr nicklauss sons and his son in law work for his company mr nicklaus says his goal is to scale back his involvement in the courses and build a company and brand that will outlast him "you look at bobby jones and that brand is worth more now than when he was alive " mr nicklaus says the company will also expand its branding business mr nicklaus says most of the sales for that business come from overseas especially japan korea and china he says there is "great potential" in the u s now that he has a strategic partner in mr milstein
