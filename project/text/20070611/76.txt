the daily fix three peats in paris online edition if spider man shrek and pirates of the caribbean can all return this spring and summer for a third go around why not justine henin and rafael nadal in the summer of the trilogy the french open didnt break with the trend both ms henin and mr nadal captured their third straight title at roland garros this weekend ms henin was first to defend her title on saturday the road to the french open championship was filled with players bigger and stronger but as the boston globes bud collins writes "as the continuing empress of france foot inch pound justine henin is determined to cut down and conquer anybody in her path even though theyre all bigger than she or maybe because they dwarf her " serbian ana ivanovic became ms henins latest victim disposed of in just minutes for ms henin her fourth title in five years became "a celebration of the end of a bitter family feud " writes jon henderson of the guardian ms henin had hardly spoken to her family for the better part of a decade but soon after her separation from her husband six months ago she reconnected with her family her three siblings watched in the stands as ms henin claimed her latest title the mens final was not unexpected on one side was roger federer the supremely talented swiss player pursuing the one title that has eluded him and the title of the greatest tennis player in history on the other side of the court was mr federers nemesis the man who is almost unbeatable on clay and who beat mr federer in last years epic final mr nadal writes the san francisco chronicles bruce jenkins "ive had the privilege of witnessing all of federers championships at wimbledon and the u s open and hes without question the most talented player ive ever seen but thank goodness for nadal and the french that combination has proved to be daunting for federer " mr federer entered this final with a glimmer of hope he after all had ended mr nadals match winning streak on clay last month and "federer had his chances so many of them that it was difficult to believe a man of his talents could be so wasteful " writes the times of londons neil harman in fact mr federer had ten break points in the first set to just one for mr nadal yet it was mr nadal who capitalized on that one opportunity and won the first set all of which leads mr harman to wonder "will this forever be one championship too far for the world no " the telegraphs andrew baker touches on the answer in a piece about the pairs rivalry "federers problem is that nadal will be around for the foreseeable future to stymie his efforts in the french capital nadal can expect another strong challenge from federer in paris next year the gauntlet has already been thrown down " mr collins puts it this way "well federer can put away the obsession of conquering paris for another year but its always there as ivan lendls unrequited lust was for a wimbledon title and bjorn borgs for the us open theres no future in federer using bogarts immortal line to bergman "well always have paris" because paris will always have him as long as nadals in town " lebron jamess first foray into the nba finals is turning into a nightmare the san antonio spurs dominated game and only a cavaliers run at the end of the fourth quarter kept the score respectable tony parker was a whirling dervish slicing through clevelands defense on his way to points tim duncan was well tim duncan scoring points grabbing nine rebounds and dishing out eight assists and manu ginobili put the nail in clevelands comeback getting fouled on a three pointer and completing a four point play the spurs performance leads bernie lincicome of the denver rocky mountain news to ponder "whether the spurs are a dynasty or not " after completing his review mr lincicome determines that "if the spurs dismiss the cavaliers as they should the spurs will be at best a paradynasty " but beyond talk of dynasties one thing is clear from game cavaliers coach mike brown needs to change his plan writes the cleveland plain dealers bill livingston first and foremost is to take larry hughes who is suffering from a foot injury out of the starting lineup "the mismatches have stopped in the fourth quarters of both games that is a tribute to the cavs heart it is also an indictment of the foolishness of wasting valuable minutes on a valiant non contributor but a non contributor nonetheless " mr livingston adds the problem with playing the injured mr hughes it means that mr james is guarding tony parker and the akron beacon journals terry pluto explains why this plan has been a disaster while mr duncan mr parker and mr ginobili combined for points game also marked the return of one of the nbas great clutch players writes san antonio express news buck harvey "robert horry hadnt done much since he returned from his two game suspension in the phoenix series to a standing ovation but then came sunday when horry played the way he often has in june " mr harvey writes after scoring just points in the past five playoff games robert horry scored five points sunday but more importantly grabbed nine rebounds and blocked five shots for the belmont stakes being the final leg of the triple crown is either burden or blessing when there is a chance to see the triple crown drought end the track in queens n y becomes the center of the sports world but with no chance of a triple crown winner the belmont stakes becomes relegated to an afterthought this years version seemed drifting toward that "the third leg of the triple crown looked like nothing more than the th race on a race card " writes the boston globes mark blaudschun "the belmont seemed ripe for curlin to make another run and become another horse who was good but not great " the lack of interest was evident in the size of this weekends crowd only filled the stands the smallest crowd since but for those who made the trek they witnessed as the new york times joe drape writes "a belmont for the ages " trainer todd pletcher decision to enter filly rags to riches elevated the race beyond an afterthought after all no filly had won the belmont in years the race began inauspiciously for winner rags to richs the filly stumbled out of gate but quickly recovered to set up in fifth just a few lengths off the lead down the stretch preakness winner curlin and rags to richs separated themselves from the field and went back and forth heads bobbing away to the finish in the end rags to riches held on by a head how rare was her victory mr drape points out that only fillies have started the belmont have run the kentucky derby with only three winning and of the that have competed in the preakness only four have won roger clemens made his long awaited debut saturday beating what could only be called a listless pittsburgh pirates team jack curry of the new times writes "the pirates stumbled around the bronx and showed why they were a safe team for clemenss ballyhooed return to the baseball grind " the real question is whether mr clemens can help propel the yankees to the playoffs and based on his debut not everyone was convinced "after all the anticipation clemens was adequate " the albany times unions brian ettkin writes "but the yankees arent paying &# million in clemens salary and luxury tax for adequacy " in fact mr clemens debut shouldnt instill any fear in minnesota twins fans says the st cloud times brian macpherson "you might think the return of clemens throws into question the previously unassailable certainty that the american leagues wild card this season would come out of the central division and thus put into jeopardy minnesotas postseason hopes "rest easy the yankees couldnt be more finished if someone had laid carpet on the floor in the basement and installed working plumbing " after six consecutive top three finishes lewis hamilton became the first black driver to win a formula one race capturing the canadian grand prix sunday he also grabbed the lead in the formula one standings mr hamiltons victory will go down as one of the most remarkable in the sports history says the guardians richard williams mr hamilton will be remembered "as the first driver whose approach to the job comes close to matching the sophistication of his machine he has single handedly raised the stakes for his own generation and those to come " writes mr williams "lewis hamilton won his first grand prix in his sixth race and the dominating emotion was well of course he bloody well did what do you expect the only mystery was why it took him so long " writes the times of londons simon barnes write to stephen grocer at stephen grocer wsj com
