kids today in the wake of shocking crimes such as the mass murder at virginia tech parents are bound to be worried about the safety of their children but there is good news to report americas children are actually safer since the early s crimes against children and adolescents have plummeted the dangers have decreased often dramatically in a review article in the journal of social issues last year sociologist david finkelhor and clinical psychologist lisa jones document that rates of crime have dropped by as much as depending on the nature of the offense the authors conclude "the era of continually rising numbers of child maltreatment and crime victimization cases is probably over " consider these facts youngsters are far less likely to be murdered today than they were in the early s according to u s justice department statistics since the juvenile homicide rate dropped by and the drop was even steeper for kids between the ages of and the improvement is not confined to homicide things have improved since for nearly every category of child victimization according to the national child abuse and neglect data system substantiated cases of childhood sexual abuse declined by and substantiated cases of physical abuse declined by this is especially striking because documented cases of both sexual and physical abuse had been climbing ever since the mid s teenagers in particular are much safer today than they were in the early s sexual assaults against adolescents have dropped by aggravated assaults by and robbery by according to the national crime victimization survey plummeting rates of crimes against children have been accompanied by striking improvement in other indicators of child welfare fewer children are living in poverty today than in the early s and the rates of teen pregnancy and teen suicide have declined as well is this news about americas children too good to be true mr finkelhor and ms jones dont think so the improvements are genuine regardless of the source of the data favorable trends appear again and again for example not only have official crime statistics documented a decrease in childhood sexual abuse but community surveys often involving those who never reported their victimization document the same decrease moreover the declines have occurred not only for unambiguous cases involving victims with sexually transmitted disease and confirmed by perpetrator confession but also for cases lacking any kind of corroboration if the decline were merely due to victims increasing reluctance to report abuse the decline would not have occurred for anonymous surveys as well as for official police statistics and it would not have occurred for both uncorroborated as well as corroborated cases the authors tested and ruled out several other hypotheses for the across the board reduction in child victimization the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic may partly explain the drop in youth homicide in some large cities but it cant explain why homicides dropped in rural areas too likewise policies regarding capital punishment cant have much effect on sexual molestation and other crimes not punishable by death so why have things been getting so much better for americans under age there are probably multiple causes for one thing more criminals are behind bars and more police officers are on the streets also there are more social workers child welfare advocates and others dedicated to improving the lives of children than there were years ago increased funding for programs designed to curb domestic violence likely played a role and heightened public awareness about sexual abuse would have made it harder for perpetrators to elude detection psychiatric medications have also played a role in the safety trend family physicians now prescribe more medication for psychiatric and behavioral problems thereby alleviating child maltreatment indirectly a hyperactive child receiving ritalin is less likely to be impulsive and get in harms way meanwhile depressed irritable adults taking prozac may be less likely to strike their children finally increasing prosperity during the s brightened the prospects of many people easing family tensions and reducing problems for kids we must not be complacent about the welfare of americas children and adolescents too many are still being harmed although the evidence of massive improvement is "extremely strong " as mr finkelhor and ms jones emphasize we still dont know exactly why crimes against children have dropped so dramatically researchers must now turn to identifying these causes so that policy makers can strengthen and increase these positive trends mr mcnally a psychology professor at harvard university is the author of "remembering trauma" harvard university press
