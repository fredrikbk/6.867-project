macys drops mock homes for martha stewart last spring macys inc chief executive terry lundgren came up with an ambitious plan to display a massive new line of home goods produced exclusively by martha stewart creating square foot mock "homes" in key stores home builder kb home planned to build the huge showcases inside macys stores in such cities as new york chicago and san francisco but macys now has canceled the mock home plan citing a sharp decline in the housing market in interviews friday macys officials said the company wont scale back the launch of martha stewart merchandise some items from the new collection a line of roughly home accessories such as stainless steel cookware china and glassware collapsible colanders and a wide array of towels linens and bedding will begin appearing in macys stores next month followed by the full collection in mid september that launch will be accompanied by a massive nationwide media and marketing campaign but macys furniture and home goods sales have been sliding in recent months "its no secret that our home store has been the softest part of our business over the past few years " mr lundgren said at macys annual meeting may just last week the retailer formerly known as federated department stores inc posted a larger than expected drop in may same store sales sales of big ticket items such as furniture are taking the biggest hit a macys spokesman said friday he noted that a number of retailers including j c penney co wal mart stores inc and sears holdings corp have recently said sales of home related goods were weak macys retreat highlights the difficulties facing mr lundgren as he continues to integrate the former may department store co locations that had long operated under names such as hechts foleys filenes and marshall fields at a time of growing competition for middle income shoppers rivals such as penney and kohls corp have gained market share by adding brands and designer lines to their clothing and home departments other elements of mr lundgrens plan to get shoppers excited about the national chain which now numbers about stores havent panned out either late last month macys replaced its marketing chief just months after hiring her and acknowledged that its shift away from promotional marketing to brand image advertising such as a flashy tv ad campaign intended to create a glamorous new image for macys failed to boost sales in some markets especially where local shoppers were more accustomed to being offered coupons and discounts "we probably moved too far too fast " says macys spokesman jim sluzewski macys is now reemphasizing coupons and savings to draw customers to the stores it acquired from may last week mr lundgren said in a prepared statement that he expects sales trends to improve this month and next due to the increased promotional activity mr sluzewski says it will involve more "public" promotions such as coupons published in newspapers coupons and discounts tend to be especially critical to sales of home goods mr lundgren and macys still view the martha stewart line as key to their plan to turn macys into the only major national retailer of upscale home goods at the shareholder meeting last month he said the line is expected to "have a positive effect on sales in the fall " sales of furniture and home goods account for about of macys annual sales which totaled nearly &# billion last year "its about market share " says timothy m adams ceo of macys home division "theres some business being done and if we do the martha stewart products right we can still win no matter how tough the business is " macys merchandising group ceo janet grove says macys "never launched anything of this magnitude before" nationally in all stores the company typically tests a new brand in a small group of to stores before taking it chainwide the merchandise will include among other things kitchen gadgets with unusual features such as a can opener with built in bottle opener and oversized spatulas for frying pans and a mainly white bedding ensemble with lace trim in a design based on ms stewarts heirloom bedding other basics will include towels in a variety of colors there will also be seasonal items such as ornaments and decorations that can be used to assemble an entire christmas tree china and crystal intended for formal use are scheduled to hit the stores in early deborah weinswig an analyst at citigroup with a "hold" rating on macys says a range of samples shown to analysts were "attractive and of high quality " martha stewart living omnimedia inc hopes the new line will capture about of the &# billion in sales that macys generates from home goods and that it will help macys build an even larger business says susan lyne president and ceo as for the mock home project "i think that as we got closer to launch we realized you cant do something like that in more than a few locations and we were better served initially in putting resources in some other form of marketing that works in locations " ms lyne says "it isnt a dead idea " she adds noting that the companies might attempt it in the future kmart sells just under &# billion in martha stewart everyday branded products and ready to assemble furniture in an arrangement that is due to expire in the martha stewart goods to be sold at macys generally have more embellishments and higher prices than the mostly bargain priced basics sold at kmart a unit of sears the macys line is based on designs and patterns in ms stewarts homes and on items shown in her magazines macys also carries martha stewart furniture by bernhardt but it isnt part of the exclusive martha stewart collection kb home spokeswoman caroline shaw says the idea for kb home to build a mock martha stewart home inside macys was sort of a "daredevil discussion" between former kb chief executive bruce karatz and macys mr lundgren she says the discussions were preliminary and the companies never hashed out details such as how much kb home would be compensated for the project or how much it would cost "it was one of those fun ideas that they talked about " she says adding that mr lundgren reached out to mr karatz who had a knack for building model homes to attract attention early in his career mr karatz built a model house on top of an au printemps department store in france in kb home launched "the simpsons house giveaway" contest building a replica of the home from the "simpsons" television show in las vegas in the company built a model home on the abc studio lot in midtown manhattan of "live with regis and kelly" for an on air giveaway the mock homes at macys were supposed not only to promote the martha stewart merchandise but also help promote the los angeles builders co branded martha stewart homes ms shaw says kb home decided to back off the idea last fall because the housing market had slowed and kb wanted to focus on building homes in the field rather than in macys stores "building a house inside a department store takes an immense amount of logistics and resources that both sides were not ready to allocate at that time " ms shaw says the decision wasnt related to mr karatzs departure in november after the company said an internal investigation found he backdated stock option grants ms shaw says the retailer and builder remain open to future marketing initiatives she says adding that kb intends to showcase the martha stewart macys products in its martha stewart communities so far five of the licensed subdivisions planned for this year have opened in communities including fairburn ga perris calif and katy texas new communities are slated to open this year in raleigh n c orlando fla and denver overall the program is likely to result in homes
