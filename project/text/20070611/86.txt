theory &amp practice how innovation can be too much of a good thing reducing the number can speed introduction of new product lines avery dennison corp loves to innovate in recent years the adhesive label maker has expanded into areas such as stick on automotive trim and heat transfer inks to label clothing but avery executives grew vexed a few years ago at how long it took to turn ideas into products schedules were slipping customers were chafing hoping to find the culprit avery hired george group consulting lp of dallas to examine its practices the surprising conclusion avery was jamming too many new ideas into its product pipeline without enough slack time to ensure that critical tasks stayed on schedule the remedy shrink the number of rollouts "weve got a much better understanding now of the organizations capacity for project work " says tim bond averys general manager for office products north america "instead of killing ourselves on too many projects we think were able to move a smaller number through the system more rapidly " similar insights have been standard wisdom on the manufacturing floor for decades factory managers learn about bottlenecks through the formal discipline of queueing theory that teaches them to keep a little slack in the system to handle the unpredictable but inevitable crunch times but the same notion can seem like heresy when applied to scientists designers or other creative types who launch new products "the theory of congestion and delay has incredibly broad applications " says james patell a stanford business school professor he teaches it to his students as well as to consulting clients such as pixar animation studios a unit of walt disney co michael george a former texas instruments co engineer and founder of the person george group says new product specialists usually ignore queueing theory because innovation is viewed as an art not a science he offers an analogy meant to elicit a more open minded response "if a freeway is getting congested do you load more cars onto the on ramp in the hopes that people will go faster or should you try to take some cars off thats what were talking about " in a book "fast innovation " mr george and two co authors tied many of their prescriptions to time tested factory efficiency formulas one derived in the s by european mathematicians felix pollaczek and alexander khintchine shows how high capacity utilization and high variability in task completion times can combine to create severe delays mr george says the pollaczek khintchine equation has been an eye opener with clients he recalls a visit with a large aircraft equipment maker whose engineering unit was plagued by delays "i talked about how important it is to keep utilization rates well below especially if you have high variability in how long it takes to get each part of the job done they said oh my god we dont provide any slack time at all we drive our engineers to of capacity " mr george says he learned the hard way about the perils of overloading developers schedules in the s he ran a company that made uninterruptible power systems it had only one engineer who knew how to design a certain kind of transformer if that engineer got backed up on a project everything else screeched to a halt the solution was to train a second engineer to help with simpler designs that gave the company extra flexibility and helped avoid log jams dan chow a senior vice president at george group points out another hazard even when engineers can churn out new products at a steady pace delays can crop up as other arms of the company such as testing marketing or legal are stretched too thin averys mr bond concurs close scrutiny of its innovation pipeline revealed that the company was overloading its plant planning managers with requests to test new materials there was no sure way to predict how long it would take to tweak averys plants to handle a different type of adhesive or thicker paper if early estimates on a few projects proved wrong scheduling delays would ripple through larger chunks of averys development efforts "so now we ask ourselves on each project whats the effort to benefit trade off " mr bond says "we dont want to have a few marginal projects stop us from doing our best on the big ones " speedier pipelines consultants are turning to classic queueing theory for ideas on how companies can bring new products to market faster among their tips run a leaner pipeline trying to develop too many ideas at once is a recipe for delays build slack into schedules if employees time is committed at near capacity minor snags can cause gridlock cross train employees for vital functions so they can be redeployed if needed diminishing bottlenecks rather than reinvent all aspects of a project look for ways to build on existing knowledge sources george group consulting l p james patell stanford graduate school of business
