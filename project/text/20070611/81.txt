the musharraf dilemma pakistan may be reaching a crisis point gen pervez musharraf who is chief of both the country and the armed forces is facing the most serious threat to his rule since he seized power in his high handed suspension in march of the chief justice of the supreme court iftikhar mohammad chaudhry has galvanized opposition from the urban middle class that had hitherto acquiesced in his rule on may street protests got out of hand in karachi leaving dead and contributing to a sense of worsening crisis mr musharraf has since tried to regain control by cracking down on independent media outlets and by jailing hundreds of opposition political activists but the protests continue the bush administration is reaching a decision point will it continue to provide unqualified support for mr musharraf on the grounds that he is too valuable an ally to give up in the global war on terror or will it pull the rug out from under him and insist on a transition to civilian democratic rule in this matter as in so many others george w bush should ask himself the wwrd question what would reagan do as it happens ronald reagan confronted a crisis remarkably similar to this one years ago involving another pro american dictator in another strategically important country ferdinand marcos had ruled the philippines home to two of americas biggest overseas military bases by martial law since he had loyally stood by the united states and fought against a communist insurgency but his rule started to unravel when opposition leader benigno aquino returned to his homeland in and was assassinated on the tarmac evidence pointed to conspiracy involving gen fabian ver commander of the philippine armed forces but a three judge panel acquitted ver and others and marcos promptly reinstated him he then shamelessly stole the presidential election from benignos widow corazon aquino hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest "people power" was supplemented by a rebellion within the philippine armed forces but marcos still had the loyalty of much of the army and was prepared to use it to hold onto power by force unless the u s intervened president reagan confronted a difficult choice he felt personally loyal to marcos and was afraid of the consequences of toppling him having little confidence in ms aquinos leadership abilities reagan abhorred the way jimmy carter had abandoned the shah of iran in and didnt want to make the same mistake but his secretary of state george shultz had seen early on that marcoss legitimacy was eroding "i became increasingly convinced that marcos was the problem not the solution " mr shultz wrote in his memoirs the secretary of state had refused to call for the dictators ouster but he had insisted that the philippines hold elections demands that marcos had finally agreed to the crisis came to a head on sunday feb as marcos was massing troops in manila to crack down on the post election protests the top level national security planning group met that afternoon in the white house situation room to decide whether to continue backing him only white house chief of staff don regan offered any support for marcos the rest of the foreign policy team said his day was done the president was reluctantly won over he authorized his friend sen paul laxalt to call marcos and convey the message by tuesday the dictator and his gaudy wife imelda were on their way to exile aboard a u s air force jet this was no aberration even while protests were erupting in the philippines a similar situation was occurring in haiti here too another pro american dictator jean claude baby doc duvalier was sinking and here too the reagan administration refused to throw him a lifeline forcing him into exile the reagan administration also played a role in getting the military regime in south korea to give up power and hold free elections in the same year with american encouragement taiwans chiang ching kuo ended martial law and began the transition to democracy the following year again with u s backing chilean dictator augusto pinochet held a referendum which he lost bringing his long reign to an end all these actions were taken notwithstanding the very real risk at a time when the cold war was still going strong of what would follow in the wake of pro american strongmen back then just as today lots of "realists" made the better the devil you know argument henry kissinger wrote an op ed expressing "grave concerns" about marcoss overthrow but what reagan and especially mr shultz realized was that giving a blank check to dictators was a bad deal sooner or later it would lead to an explosion that would make an anti american regime of the kind that arose in nicaragua and iran in more not less likely the best way to prevent such a disaster was by pushing for civil society reforms culminating in free elections something that previous administrations failed to do with somoza or the shah the choice is made more difficult in the case of pakistan because unlike the philippines or south korea it possesses nuclear weapons our ultimate nightmare is for those weapons to fall into the hands of osama bin ladens allies but that is extremely unlikely the coalition of religious parties the muttahida majlis e amal won only of the seats in the legislative assembly in even though mr musharraf hindered more secular parties from competing there is no reason to think it is any more popular today the two main opposition parties the pakistan peoples party led by benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league led by nawaz sharif have their own shortcomings including corruption and a history of dealings with islamic radicals but they represent the broad middle of pakistani society not the extremist fringe moreover mr musharraf has talked a better game than he has delivered he has taken at least &# billion in american subsidies since and in return he has sent his troops to fight against al qaeda and the taliban but he has also struck deals with tribal authorities in south waziristan north waziristan and bajaur that essentially turn over those vital border regions to taliban control no wonder terrorism in afghanistan is exploding taliban fighters receive training and support in pakistan possibly still from their historic patrons in the inter services intelligence agency which reports to none other than mr musharraf there have even been a number of incidents in recent months of pakistani troops providing covering fire from their side of the border for taliban militants assaulting afghan army positions mr musharraf has been useful but he is either unwilling or unable to do enough to combat the terrorists in his country there is no need for president bush to call for his ouster at this point any more than reagan called for marcoss ouster early on what he should do what reagan did in the philippines is to insist that the constitutional process play itself out that means that if he wants u s aid to continue mr musharraf should give up either the presidency or his post as army chief and allow free elections in october that could be contested by all legitimate political parties reagans words at moscow state university in still ring true today "democracy is the standard by which governments are measured " mr musharraf is not living up to that standard mr
