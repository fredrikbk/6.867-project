regional economic roundup a special report the road to growth money is flowing into public works in india as the government opens the way for private investment mumbai luis miranda has helped construct more roads airports power plants and classrooms in india in the past five years than most politicians here build in a lifetime he was never elected though he is a private equity investor the &# million in private equity funds he manages has helped establish three airports highways four power plants hospital beds and facilities to educate students he is bolstering indias creaky infrastructure at a pace the government couldnt match and he is doing it for a profit "what is exciting about investing in infrastructure is that you are building and improving india and you are doing it in a way that is commercially viable " says mr miranda the year old president and chief executive officer of mumbai based idfc private equity "we are at a tipping point here " he says referring to the growth of private sector investment in infrastructure in india indeed billions of dollars in private funds much of it from international sources is beginning to flow into the additional infrastructure india needs to keep its economy roaring the reason new delhi has been dismantling longstanding barriers and actively encouraging private investment in big public works projects private sector companies have been invited to manage airports for example which used to be exclusively government run the government is even helping lower the risk for private sector companies in road projects by putting aside tax dollars to cover their losses if toll road revenues turn out to be far below expectations the new wave of money which could reach more than &# billion in new private sector commitments to infrastructure investment this year is a watershed in india where private investors have long shunned infrastructure projects as difficult and risky in the past such public works projects regularly bogged down in red tape politics and corruption making it hard for companies to profit india today is paying a price for these obstacles the countrys rundown roads railways ports and airports are woefully inadequate to sustain indias robust growth which has been running at about an annual rate unless india breaks its infrastructure bottlenecks they threaten to crimp its expansion finance minister p chidambaram says the country needs &# billion in infrastructure spending over the next five years and close to half of that will need to come from the private sector to maintain the current growth rate and to bring millions of indians out of poverty even that may not be enough a government appointed committee of private sector bankers last month recommended that the infrastructure spending target be lifted another to &# billion counting on help from the private sector marks a profound shift in thinking by indian politicians and the indian public politicians who used to be suspicious of profit seeking companies are increasingly calling for public private partnerships realizing thats the only way they are going to get power and roads and ports to the people given the limits of government funding voters who used to think public services should be as cheap as possible if not free have realized you get what you pay for "ten years ago there was no concept of even paying for parking " says nilesh shah chief investment officer for icici prudential asset management co which manages a &# million fund invested in indian infrastructure companies the firm is part of a joint venture between indias icici bank and london based prudential plc "now pay and park has become the model the trend is shifting to users paying for the services they want " the attitude adjustment is already paying off in billions of dollars in private sector commitments new delhis overcrowded airport for example has been turned over to private sector investors including germanys fraport ag which will modernize expand and manage the facility toll roads are being built across the country by private developers and the private sector is constructing hundreds of special economic zones for exporters with their own power plants roads and running water in the past two years more than infrastructure mutual funds have been launched for indian investors raising more than &# billion to invest in construction engineering and power companies now a new wave of private equity money is flowing into the country citigroup inc and blackstone group of the u s launched a &# billion infrastructure fund in february and in april i plc of the u k announced plans to help invest as much as &# billion in indian infrastructure other funds are expected to follow "we have only begun to scratch the surface" in infrastructure investing says a balasubramanian chief investment officer at birla sun life asset management co an indian firm that has a &# million infrastructure fund "there is still a long way to go and there will be more and more private participation the ability of the government to raise funds is limited " all the new billions may have a tough time finding a place to park though good projects are still hard to find australias macquarie bank which invests in power plants and roads around the globe says that after it failed to win a bid to run an airport in india it hasnt found anything to invest in "we have not been able to find an asset that we would deem appropriate " said macquarie bank chairman david s clarke during a visit to mumbai "we only invest when we think returns are definitely going to be there " and some sectors may still be too political the power industry is the most desperate for new investment as most companies and consumers in india have to deal with regular blackouts the industry needs more than &# billion in new money over the next five years the government estimates however it is still strangled by state and federal regulations that restrict how much companies can charge as well as who they can sell to meanwhile politicians often demand low rates and even free power for their voters enrons &# billion power plant in western india to date the biggest foreign direct investment in india was derailed first by political and bureaucratic squabbling over what it should be allowed to charge for power and then by the meltdown of enron to this day it is not providing much needed power despite being mostly finished since the late s still a growing number of companies and investors are proving that public private partnerships can help the average indian even as they generate a healthy return for investors one of the companies mr miranda bought into ashoka buildcon ltd upgraded a stretch of highway running through the central state of madhya pradesh the mile road was so riddled with potholes and missing concrete and so narrow only one and a half lanes at its widest spots that it used to take trucks eight hours to cross it the bumpy ride would snap the axles of more than trucks a month leaving them stuck on the road causing long traffic jams today the trip takes three hours and a &# toll madhya pradeshs politicians arent complaining "states have realized that public private partnerships are the only way to get things built " says paresh mehta a vice president of finance and accounts at ashoka buildcon mr miranda is ready to help list the company with an eye toward a healthy profit on his &# million investment with the money from a public share offering ashoka buildcon would be able to build more "compared to two years back this is a huge change " says mr miranda "but there is still a lot of catching up to be done " mr bellman is a staff reporter in the wall street journals mumbai
