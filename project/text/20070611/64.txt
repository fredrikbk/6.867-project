regional economic roundup a special report fighting for survival is there life after a military base closes anniston ala is determined to make sure the answer is yes anniston ala after years of lobbying to keep their local military base open residents of this small city in eastern alabama lost the fight in fort mcclellan was going to close after years in the ensuing economic downturn anniston mayor hoyt "chip" howell jr and a small team took advantage of an increasingly popular federal law that gives local communities the responsibility and the risk for cleaning up and redeveloping closed military bases instead of waiting for the military to clean up leftover munitions the team hired its own private contractor and financed massive insurance policies to guarantee development then they set an aggressive schedule to turn the thousands of acres on fort mcclellan into a thriving residential and commercial center "our motto is faster better cheaper " says miki schneider director of planning for the redevelopment team "if you want to develop property at closed military bases you have got to have vision you have got to have patience and you have got to be creative " the approach has drawn some controversy on two occasions local developers have sued the redevelopment team in calhoun county court once alleging a lack of transparency in the bidding for property on the base the other time accusing the team of not properly disclosing finances mr howell and his team which lost both cases deny any wrongdoing and have appealed the cases to higher courts yet even as new projects on the former base thrive some local businesses say that they arent seeing the benefits the team defends the progress it has made "those who are critical of mcclellan i would just have to question what would they be doing if they were in charge " mr howell says after a base closure the military and the community set up a team to oversee redevelopment of the base land by law the military is obligated to clean up the grounds but with no hard deadlines and varying definitions of "clean " the result is often decades of delay due to bureaucracy and complications "its a problem with every base " says leon panetta former white house chief of staff for president clinton who has founded a public policy institute on the former fort ord near monterey calif "the military presents that its all going to be fine and dandy then they put the lock on the fence and they get the hell out of town the community is left holding the bag " to speed cleanups the federal government passed an act in that permits communities to privatize the work with the military guaranteeing the funds the program emerged out of rounds of base closures between and the defense department closed or realigned more than of its u s bases mark jones assistant secretary of the army for installations and environment says "we can clean up the properties ourselves but our experience indicates that its more efficient to have a private person do this for us " now with the military in the midst of another wave of closings privatization is becoming more popular eleven communities around the country are now handling cleanup themselves fort mcclellan which once housed some military personnel and their families and employed civilians dodged several rounds of closings in the early s closure was officially announced in with a closing date in initially the army took responsibility for the cleanup the grounds of fort mcclellan were littered with environmental hazards from unexploded or discarded munitions to leaking contaminated groundwater between and the army cleared acres out of more than that were known or suspected of contamination according to ms schneider meanwhile some citizens went jobless military retirees migrated and the local real estate market slumped some local businesses closed while others diversified to survive the fort mcclellan credit union expanded its clientele j&amp s boots started selling less western wear and more work boots super trooper went from retail military apparel to an online mail order business anniston officials decided they had had enough and the member redevelopment team took their fate into their own hands "we inherited the asbestos the lead based paint and buildings that werent up to code " says ms schneider the team initially secured about &# million in federal cleanup funds and in november hired matrix environmental services llc of denver colo to oversee the work the team later won additional cleanup funds &# million in and &# million this april as matrix moved ahead with the cleanup it expects to have cleared acres by this month mayor howell and the team sought developers and investors to occupy cleared land today the former base boasts more than families in homes and apartments and more than people work there among the tenants are a honda motor co parts supplier violin manufacturer howard core co two university branches a new private school a theater three restaurants a golf course three churches and a &# million park and recreation center one of the redevelopment teams biggest successes was luring lowes cos the home improvement chain announced in october that it will build an estimated &# million store at the edge of the former base the store may open by the end of this year and lowes says it could generate up to new jobs anniston officials anticipate the store could bring more than &# million in annual sales tax revenue the citys economy is already showing signs of bouncing back from several years in the doldrums after mcclellan closed the city reports that sales tax and lodging tax revenue which account for about half of its total revenue hit &# million last year after dropping to &# million annually in and the redevelopment team says new hires are anticipated on the base in the next three years on top of the lowes jobs for all its successes the project has drawn criticism the groups small size arguably has allowed it to work more efficiently but some developers allege the groups decision making process lacks transparency donald stewart a former u s senator and local developer sought a restraining order last september against mcclellan authorities in calhoun county court over the sale of some property on the base he says his bid to convert a building into apartments was about to be passed over for a lesser offer the court granted his request "they dont follow bid laws for land sales they dont have open meetings theres nothing about price and nothing about why they sold it for less than it was worth in the public record " mr stewart says mr howell the mayor concedes "we need to do a better job of communicating with the community all of the issues " but he says "we cant be completely transparent and still do business " adding that when it comes to bids "its not just the price its the quality of the project " also last september a group of local developers filed a lawsuit in county court alleging that the teams personal and commercial finances hadnt been properly disclosed the court ruled in january that two members of the team hadnt kept up with their disclosures and found it unreasonably difficult to obtain public information about the project such as contracts for land sales the team is appealing both rulings and has denied wrongdoing the executive director who wasnt one of the members named in the ruling left the team in january his resignation letter saying it was time for some "fresh energy and new ideas " other critics charge that redevelopment profits at mcclellan arent making their way into the greater community "there has been no new residential growth in the city of anniston the city has over vacant residential lots for sale " says phillip ledbetter president of anniston land co and owner of the local victoria inn the redevelopment team says it aims to turn mcclellan into a viable commercial and residential center for the city and the surrounding area and hopes to silence its critics with proof "if you dont bring people to live here you wont be able to support retail ventures " says the planning director ms schneider "were just to the point where we can start that lowes is the catalyst we need to keep it up " under the arrangement with the military any revenue generated by redevelopment projects goes to the redevelopment group which must then channel the money back into fixing up mcclellan the team says it currently has less than &# million in the bank given the steep costs for building maintenance road upgrades and groundskeeping moreover one group feels it has been completely left out of the redevelopment process military retirees at a recent pot luck dinner for post of the veterans of foreign wars just off highway near mcclellan it was hard to find anyone with much positive to say about the redevelopment team many of them had counted on retiring here only to find the base hospital and other services closed a few years later moreover many retirees say there are no specific incentives for them to move to mcclellan "ask the redevelopment authority what have they done for their military retirees " says james j coppola a vfw commander and retired army sergeant major "we bled for this country and we got nothing " ms schneider says "we have done everything we can to accommodate veterans we feel its part of our job to honor the men and women and the military history thats here " she says the army made the decision to close the hospital and the redevelopment team had no say in its fate she adds that the base still offers military retirees discounted gas and access to a recently expanded market on the base some business leaders acknowledge the hard road the team has faced "trying to get everyone on the same page on redevelopment has been a real challenge " says bill wakefield a lifetime resident of anniston and president of wakefields inc which has operated several department stores in town for more than years he says overall the area has "picked up some pretty good business i dont necessarily say that it has taken up the slack but it has lessened the blow " but the base he says is key to the towns fortunes "the only way for anniston to grow is fort mcclellan " he says "mcclellan is the future of anniston " mr mccary is a staff
