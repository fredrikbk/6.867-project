horseshoe crabs in political pinch over birds future creature is favored bait on shores of delaware red knot loses in court slaughter beach del on the high tides of spring horseshoe crabs crawl out of the water to go about the business of making more horseshoe crabs the crab has been at this for three or four hundred million years a record of tenacity that accounts for its pet name the cockroach of the sea from the crab perspective the best beaches on earth ring delaware bay where a bird called the red knot also takes a spring break during its world record migration a mile tour to the arctic from the southern tip of south america the crabs lay trillions of pebbly fat filled eggs the birds peck a few billion out of the sand then go on their way that arrangement went well until the s when the watermen who fish on the bay started using horseshoe crabs as bait in traps they caught so many that the red knots couldnt get their egg ration and the whole shorebird subspecies suddenly began to die off that led bird lovers to campaign for a moratorium on horseshoe crab catching across delaware bay new jersey imposed one last year this year delaware did too the watermen fearful of dying off themselves challenged delawares moratorium in state court pleading for permission to harvest a few crabs for a few months of the year on delawares side of the bay on friday just as the last red knots of the season were taking off for points north the watermen won the bird lovers who promise to keep fighting were shocked they had put together a powerful coalition of ornithologists birdwatchers and tourism promoters to rally for the ban in the crab catchers corner meanwhile expertise consisted largely of carl n shuster jr americas pre eminent authority on horseshoe crabs "this animal is feisty hes fighting me " dr shuster was saying one bright afternoon at high tide on slaughter beach he had just lifted a crab the size of a salad bowl off the sand around him hundreds more were busy doing what crabs do laying eggs and fertilizing them on the beach he twirled the crab "somebody bashed his brain in " said dr shuster "but its still kicking like the dickens by the way his mouth is right here " he added shoving a finger into its hidden maw dr shuster is years old he wore a sun hat with a silver horseshoe crab pin on it and a string tie with a wooden horseshoe crab for a slide on his advice as the crab egg famine deepened in the national marine fisheries service created a no crab catch zone in the atlantic off delaware and new jersey its official name the dr carl n shuster jr horseshoe crab sanctuary the crab moratorium in dr shusters opinion would make it hard for the watermen to put food on the table but wouldnt do much more than whats being done already to feed the bird thanks to his sanctuary plus a series of harvest limits the catch has already been reined in enough he believes delaware bays horseshoe crab population he says is returning to its highs of the s back then crabs were three deep on the beaches in may and june laying plenty of eggs to fuel the longest migratory flight the u s fish and wildlife service cited those measures in when it rejected an emergency petition by seven environmental groups to have the red knot declared an endangered species yet bird lovers are facing a maddening fact of crab life beyond anyones control baby crabs take years to grow up and make eggs "if youre watching birds die " dr shuster concedes "to wait years is certainly bothersome " the bird scientists who flock to delaware bay agree with dr shuster about that if nothing else only a moratorium they argue can guarantee the fastest possible renaissance of the crab "carl has good ideas about crabs but on crabs and birds were in opposite camps " said larry niles who leads a team of volunteer red knot researchers he was working late at a beach house across the bay in new jersey after a day out counting birds dr niles is the states former endangered species chief he consults for new jerseys conserve wildlife foundation a group devoted to "unbiased data for complicated situations " on the numbers dr niles and dr shuster have innumerable differences though both agree that fewer red knots have landed here recently down to last year from in they disagree about the number of birds on the bay historically and the number of crabs in it most of all they disagree over the number of eggs in the sand dr shuster maintains there are more and more dr niles insists there still arent nearly enough "all we care about " says dr niles "is the number of crabs coming ashore and the number of eggs they lay " some numbers in this dispute have dollar signs in front of them the red knots rest stop has become "new jerseys serengeti " as the audubon society puts it a wildlife tourism destination that draws thousands of bird watchers to the bed and breakfasts of cape may "why destroy this source of income " dr niles asks "why wreck a major shorebird stopover for the sake of a minor fishery " minor yes but its the only fishery frank eicherlys got on a gnatty evening he was under sail in his ancient skipjack dredger moving out of the bay and up delawares murderkill river to the dock at bowers beach on the deck lay a few sacks of whelk his three man crew struck sail tied up and hefted them onto a pickup weathered and wild bearded at mr eicherly is a rare waterman open to talking with outsiders about this dispute he has been hauling in whelk for years often mistakenly called conch it mostly winds up stir fried in asia aside from a short dredging season mr eicherly knows only one way to catch a whelk with a horseshoe crab in a trap at the bottom of the bay "i didnt think they were going to pull that moratorium on us " he said in his wheelhouse "they got us in a tight spot if we cant get bait birdwatchers go tell them to watch us watermen were a colorful lot and were an endangered species too " one answer to the bait problem has occurred to mr eicherly drain some blood from a live crab inject the blood into the bladder of a fish use that as bait and let the crab go free dr shuster believes he has a better idea he wants to let the watermen on delaware bay about of them handpick crabs on one condition that they dont touch the females having watched what crabs get up to on the beaches since dr shuster knows their preferences one male latches onto a female while she lays her eggs four or five extra males just hang around "the birds dont lose anything " he says "they dont eat the males all they need are the eggs " backed by a virginia whelk packer the watermen sued the state of delaware asking that its moratorium be overturned and for permission to collect male crabs six ecology groups slammed the male only harvest as "unscientific " but fridays delaware court ruling said the moratorium didnt have "a rational basis" and the state was getting ready to issue watermen their crabbing permits on slaughter beach the crabs had completed their afternoon duties dr shuster stood watching as they crept back into the bay "the bird people " he said "lost a golden opportunity to be magnanimous the male harvest can tide the watermen over " he righted a crab that had flipped on its back and was writhing in the sun "fascinating creatures " said dr shuster "but i do like the birds you know from an aesthetic viewpoint theyre prettier "
