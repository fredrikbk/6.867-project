utopia lost dows run up may be in peril perfect world looks a little bit less so as rising rates loom as investors pushed the dow jones industrial average up during the past year they came to believe in a "perfect world" scenario of steady growth low inflation and falling interest rates suddenly as interest rates have surged the world has begun to appear less perfect last week investors took back some of the run up and they are worrying how much more can the market decline richard steinberg president of steinberg global asset management in boca raton fla isnt waiting to find out he started taking money off the table about a month ago in his personal account he said he has liquidated stock holdings and gone entirely to cash for the first time in more than years he also has invested in an exchange traded fund that rises when the standard &amp poors stock index falls for clients he has avoided selling stock and paying capital gains taxes and instead has tried to offset the risk of losses by buying shares in the fund that rises when the s&amp p falls in fact he uses a fund that moves twice as much as the s&amp p rising two points for every point that the s&amp p falls and vice versa so while his clients holdings still fall in a down market the damage is mitigated "you bleed to death but you bleed a little slower " mr steinberg said he doesnt think the selling is over although he thinks that sooner or later it will be time to get back in "there is going to be some kind of dislocation to the market which will be a buying opportunity " he said the immediate problem facing stocks is that market interest rates have stopped falling and started rising the u s benchmark that investors watch the yield of the year treasury note soared to friday from just one month ago the turnaround in interest rates began as an annoyance and has become a serious headache because falling rates were such a big support for the stock gains rising rates remove several pillars of the bull market rising rates make it harder for buyout firms to finance takeovers with borrowed money and buyouts were one of the main supports for stock prices higher rates make bonds more attractive alternatives for big institutions such as pension funds they make it more expensive for businesses and consumers to invest and to buy things which hurts corporate profits and higher rates make dividend paying stocks less attractive compared with bonds while stocks rose friday major indexes failed to recoup three days of losses and remain below records set monday for stocks to recover and push higher investors will need to see bond yields stabilize or see some sign the economy is strong enough to shrug off higher market interest rates money managers are bracing for more ups and downs this summer market rates are being pushed higher by inflation fears both in the u s and abroad and strong economic growth overseas that is prompting foreign central banks to raise their base interest rates hopes have evaporated that the federal reserve will cut rates anytime soon interest rate futures contracts recently have signaled growing fears that the fed could be forced to raise rates home buyers are among the hardest hit by higher rates because many fixed rate mortgages are linked to the year bond yield earlier this year when market rates were falling mortgage demand began to recover which helped ease the housing markets pain lately mortgage demand has been falling again last week the mortgage bankers association reported that weekly mortgage application volume had fallen from the previous week a lot of investors thought the yield of the year treasury note would top out around last weeks swing above shocked people out of that complacency and contributed to the stock declines the yields highest level in the past five years was hit about a year ago when the stock market also was swooning as long as the yield stays below that level a lot of people will remain calm but some investors have warned that they could pull back from stocks if it gets much beyond as hopes for fed interest rate cuts have dissipated fears have grown that some of the markets other underpinnings such as corporate profits also could be affected if so some peoples high hopes for this years stock performance could be dashed "we are growing increasingly concerned that expectations are starting to get too high and investors could soon be disappointed at some point during the second half of this year " said research director nick raich of the private client group at clevelands national city corp in a report to clients after double digit percentage profit gains last year consensus analyst forecasts call for just a gain for big companies in this quarter mr raich said which he added is probably too pessimistic "the current earnings growth estimates for the third and fourth quarters of and respectively may not be though " he said many analysts felt the market was overdue for a pullback even without a deterioration in economic news one way to see that is to look at price to earnings ratios which measure stock prices in terms of companies underlying profits for several years until late corporate profits were generally rising faster than stock prices so price to earnings ratios were falling even though stocks were advancing compared with profits stock prices didnt look high at all but the stock rampage that began last summer changed that as price gains exceeded profit gains after bottoming out late last year at about times per share earnings for the previous months the p e ratio for the s&amp p has been rising again recently standing at about according to standard &amp poors investors dont mind seeing p e ratios rise as long as interest rates are falling because lower rates make stocks more attractive and justify the higher p es but when rates start rising stocks lose some luster and pressure grows for p e ratios to fall that could help explain the stock weakness p e ratios remain far from the speculative highs of and said merrill lynch stock strategist richard bernstein but that doesnt mean that stocks wont fall further "investors right now cant imagine how the leveraged buyout boom would end rising rates and rising equity valuations could do the trick " mr bernstein wrote in a report to clients
