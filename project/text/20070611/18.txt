caribbean draws more development less tourism curacao netherlands antilles at a recent conference on this dutch west indies island hotel and real estate executives raved about the record amount of development under way across the caribbean long a top vacation spot for americans but underlying their excitement was a more immediate worry tourism which is rising world wide is declining in the caribbean with overnight stays in the region down last year to million according to data from the caribbean tourism organization the decline has been even steeper in some of the places whose beaches and other charms have traditionally drawn the regions biggest share of tourists from the u s during the first quarter of this year american visits were down in jamaica in the u s virgin islands and as much as in the bahamas the cto says whether the decline is a blip or a longer term trend will go a long way in determining the economic health of the region tourism is critical to the caribbean making up of its overall economic activity according to the world travel &amp tourism council on smaller islands such as st lucia tourism can account for as much as of the economy the bush administrations announcement friday that it will temporarily ease passport requirements for americans traveling to the caribbean mexico and canada is expected to give caribbean tourism a temporary lift stricter rules which took effect in january right as the high season was under way caused huge backlogs of passport applications prompting many americans to change their travel plans and vacation closer to home "if it takes people three months to get a passport people are saying its just not worth it " says james r hepple director of tourism for trinidad and tobago but the longer term outlook for tourism also presents challenges apart from the passport backlog travel to the caribbean is being hurt by weaker economic growth in the u s and falling home prices which are making americans skittish about spending on discretionary items such as travel for a region thats heavily dependent on the u s even a small pullback by american consumers can have big consequences "once you sneeze in the u s were going to get pneumonia in the caribbean " says peter odle president of the caribbean hotel association which is based in puerto rico the falloff in travel to the caribbean also reflects growing competition from other regions around the world including asia and central america which are building beachfront resorts at a furious pace posing a long term competitive threat the caribbean traditionally has relied on its pristine beaches and proximity to the u s to set it apart from other destinations but that isnt enough anymore says vincent vanderpool wallace secretary general of the cto which is based in barbados costa rica for instance is gaining market share by promoting its combination of rainforest and beaches "for a long time the caribbean has been a place where we owned the tourism business " mr vanderpool wallace says "now the rest of the world is beginning to understand this is a good business too " last week travel web site tripadvisor issued its ranking of the top destinations with the "hottest beaches and coolest night life " miamis south beach and ibiza spain led the list but no caribbean islands made it "theres a lot of competition around " says john kester director of marketing intelligence and promotion for the united nations world tourism organization "you need to offer something more than just a beach " at the same time that demand is slowing a wave of construction is sweeping the region developers and investors along with governments are hoping to cash in on a demographic surge of baby boomers flush with cash and dreams of tropical vacations and second homes about hotel rooms currently are under development in the region equivalent to about of the regions current room supply according to lodging econometrics when the baha mar resort on nassau

project will cost &# billion "some of this may fluctuate a little bit " says greg ulmer vice president of sales and marketing for ginn resorts "we can shift with the market " but he adds "theres

there first with a new passport nassau paradise island is reimbursing travelers for the cost of their new passports if they stay at least two nights still rates have yet to be hit much revenue per

organization while some economists and analysts have their doubts about whether the caribbean will attract enough baby boomers to occupy all those new rooms hotel executives remain optimistic "i think youre seeing the real beginnings of the power of the wealth of the baby boomers " says tom anderson chief development officer for wyndham worldwide corp a parsippany n j based lodging company "theyre going to drive years of this" development the wttc also believes that american baby boomers and their increasing appetite for travel as well as second homes will create plenty of demand for caribbean travel the council expects regional economic activity from tourism to nearly double in years to &# billion from &# billion this year but only time will tell "i think the falloff is short term " mr vanderpool wallace says "but we need to become more competitive other regions are starting to add the same sort of sun sand and sea "
