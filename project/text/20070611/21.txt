fast pace high stakes lure business chiefs to private equity since he became chief executive officer months ago of nielsen the private equity backed media and consumer research company david calhoun has changed the companys name from vnu cut the workforce and operating costs by and hired a new finance chief and other corporate staff while keeping most managers the former vice chairman of general electric also put &# million of his own equity into nielsen if he triples the &# billion investment his private equity bosses have made in the next five or so years he could earn &# million to &# million the possibility of such a return and the opportunity to do something entirely new were behind mr calhouns move to nielsen after a year stellar career at ge so was the chance to stop globe trotting constantly and to spend more time at home as head of ges aircraft transportation energy and other industrial businesses he says he spent of his time over seven years outside the country traveling to china india and the mideast "i loved every minute of it but now i only have a few years before my two youngest children leave home " he said in a recent interview in his connecticut office just a minute drive from his home in nielsen he believes he has found "a healthy company that was undermanaged it needs a tune up not a turnaround " he is drawing on management skills he used at ge but he has discovered he can make changes faster than he did in a public company "if i had announced cost cutting and taken a big restructuring charge in a public company i would gotten pounded by the investment community " he says many corporate executives are leaping to private equity backed companies for similar reasons if they make their targets they are well rewarded and because they dont have to worry about meeting quarterly earnings projections they have more operating flexibility "wall street doesnt discriminate if you have a short term earnings hiccup because you made a wise investment " says nabil n el hage a harvard business school professor "so public company executives are forced to manage in sound bites and not for the long term " sure the executives at private equity backed companies invest their own money and they work with highly leveraged investors expecting steep returns who watch them more closely than they do directors at public companies but with everyones skin in the game there is also more collaboration "everyone is sharing the same goal of transforming a business and reaching some point of arrival youve agreed on in an agreed upon time frame of about three to five years " says chris bierly a partner at bains private equity consulting practice at nielsen mr calhoun years old says he has had to adjust to reporting to directors from nine investment companies who comprise his supervisory board at ge he reported to only one boss he usually talks with each of his directors weekly and meets with them monthly all but one james kilts former gillette ceo and founder of a small private equity firm lack his operating experience some are much younger than he is but all expect a say in everything from who he hires to how he spends money wilbur ross whose w a ross investment firm specializes in turning around distressed manufacturing companies says ceos of private equity companies must be "rapid agents for change " his staff does the cost cutting he says he looks for "dirty fingernail managers" who have experience in a particular industry and know how to expand the business "we have just three layers between the factory floor and a ceo " says mr ross "because we want to make sure he isnt removed from operations" or getting misinformation from middle managers mr calhoun at nielsen says he is learning about working in a leveraged environment at ge which generates billions of dollars in cash flow annually "you never thought about how you were going to fund an acquisition " he says now he is very attentive to debt "these investors help me evaluate and be comfortable with this " he adds they make quick decisions about even substantial investment choices which is rarely the case at public companies when a lower level executive proposed a &# million investment the board listened asked some questions and then "told him to go ahead immediately " says mr calhoun he and his bosses agree that nielsen can boost profit by knitting together its many businesses such as the nielsen tv ratings service and ac nielsen a gatherer of shopping information to combine data for customers another big growth opportunity is the internet "this is where so much advertising is moving but the measurements the return on investment calculations are wanting " says mr calhoun for now mr calhoun says he and his bosses "are in a honeymoon period " and he wont know how good a team they are until they hit a problem "teams always get defined during tough times " he says "not good times " email me at inthelead wsj com for a
