regional economic roundup a special report the little engine that could in many cities the hottest development is taking place along the train lines in cities across the country mass transit lines are the new frontier in urban development in dozens of cities from charlotte n c to denver to portland ore the hottest redevelopment project is happening next to the local train station aging transit hubs and stops along new and expanded train lines are being transformed into multi use developments that offer housing retailing restaurants and offices this transit oriented development as its known is being promoted by local officials and developers as a way to counter sprawl reduce traffic on the roads and revitalize struggling urban neighborhoods by some estimates there are about such developments in the u s with more in the pipeline reconnecting america a national nonprofit group that works to spur development around transit stops forecasts that by the number of households near transit stations will rise to million from six million today demographic and lifestyle shifts are among the primary reasons many cities and developers are willing to bet on transit oriented development a growing number of households include singles and retiring baby boomers who are opting to live in smaller homes in urban areas "i think we have a collision of things going on a desire to revitalize our cities connecting with the growth of smaller households that are desiring denser and more convenient living choices " says william millar president of the american public transportation association a nonprofit advocacy group in washington d c "this isnt to say that the traditional suburb is going away " he says but there will be more housing built "for this demographic who desire walkable communities with easy access to transportation " most successful transit oriented developments are public private partnerships local governments build or refurbish rail lines and surrounding infrastructure like roads and parking facilities private developers then build in the surrounding areas "theres a lot of research that shows that if the public sector puts money into a transit system they can expect three to five times that amount in private money" for adjacent development says marilee utter president of citiventure associates llc a denver firm that has worked with a number of cities on development around light rail systems these developments can pay off for cities in several ways research shows that the value of commercial and residential properties close to transit stations often rises and that translates into higher real estate tax revenues in that area economists from the university of north texas for instance found that between and office properties near suburban dallas area rapid transit stations increased in value more than comparable properties not served by rail values of residential properties rose more than a control group not served by rail in addition cities can extract fees from these developments including levies on the developers sales taxes from retailers and fees for business licenses and parking those funds can be reinvested in the transit system or in the development or anywhere else in the city one developer is betting that transit oriented development can help revive naugatuck conn naugatuck a town of people located miles northeast of new york city was once a thriving industrial center home to rubber chemical and candy manufacturers but over the past years the town has languished as its biggest industries have moved to other states or offshore one of the final nails in the coffin was hershey co s april announcement that it would close its peter paul plant where it churned out almond joy and mounds candy bars now developer alex conroy is planning a &# million transit oriented development that will include housing offices retailing hotels and entertainment on acres in downtown naugatuck the conroy development co plans call for rubber tire trolleys jitneys and buses to provide connections to the naugatuck stop on the commuter rail line that runs into new york so that cars wont be necessary for those working living and shopping in the development towns like naugatuck can take some encouragement from the washington d c suburb of arlington county va which has transformed its economic base through transit oriented development during the s arlington was in decline like many of the suburbs nearest to major cities in response the county planned five closely spaced metro stations along its aging commercial corridor stretching from rosslyn to ballston the plan was for these stations to anchor medium to high density mixed use development generally within a quarter mile of each stop the project has spurred approximately million square feet of development so far and the area around each station has an urban feel from to land values in the rosslyn ballston corridor grew to &# billion from &# billion says dennis leach arlington countys director of transportation although the corridor is only two square miles in area less than of the countys land area it is the source of more than of arlingtons real estate taxes he says "arlingtons approach to focusing transit oriented development around its metrorail stations has been central to the countys economic health " says mr leach "this approach has allowed arlington to continue to expand its tax base expand local services and invest in the conservation of existing neighborhoods " for all their promise transit oriented developments can be tough to get off the ground for one thing public funding for transit systems and the surrounding infrastructure often is severely limited land is more expensive for projects in established communities than it is in low density areas the involvement of city governments and transit agencies and sometimes state and even federal officials as well as representatives of the communities where developments are planned can make reaching agreements on details difficult and time consuming "its not that these challenges are insurmountable but for some places this is new and takes a more focused effort to really see this idea come to be " says shelley poticha president of reconnecting america others suggest that some cities clamoring to build extensive development around transit may be misinformed about the potential economic rewards ms utter of citiventure says that a lot of cities that are mainly funded by sales taxes are desperate for transit oriented development because they are betting on a windfall resulting from the retail component "but there is a great misunderstanding that transit attracts a lot more retail than it actually does " she says "on the other hand things like cinema museums and ballparks really attract riders and generate economic activity " and in some cities proponents may have to confront opponents who worry that transit oriented projects are a recipe for deterioration rather than development "in many parts of the country its the poor people of color and the young and old" that take public transportation says robert cervero an urban planning professor at the university of california at berkeley in some places he says mass transit carries a stigma that "reflects a deeper racial and class divide that continues to plague american cities " a few years ago mr cervero heard an owner of a mixed use project say that he didnt want tenants who specifically wanted to be located near transit because those tenants tend to attract an undesirable element this owner not only believed that these patrons would drag down rents but he also expressed concerns about having to absorb higher costs for security and cleaning the buildings recalls mr cervero "in his mind transit oriented development was a deterrent to economic development " he says "this obviously doesnt hold in global cities like new york where people of all walks of life from the wall street exec to the cleaning lady patronize transit " but it does hold he says in some smaller cities "where most well off folks drive " ms dunham is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she
