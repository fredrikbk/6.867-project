google intensifies microsoft fight complaints spur review over whether vista system violates antitrust pact google inc has told state and federal antitrust authorities that microsoft corp s windows vista operating system software puts rivals at a disadvantage in violation of microsofts antitrust settlement googles complaints center on desktop search or software that allows users to scan the contents of their hard drives emails and other personal information in a roughly page white paper sent to the justice department and state attorneys general in april google alleged that the latest version of microsofts dominant windows operating system makes it hard for consumers to use rival desktop search applications provided by google and others said lawyers close to the matter the white paper followed discussions google had for more than a year with government officials about the matter these people said the concerns raised are the latest chapter in the rivalry between google and microsoft that stretches from web search and online advertising to future markets for consumer software such as word processors "microsofts current approach with vista desktop search violates the consent decree and limits consumer choice " a google spokesman said brad smith microsofts general counsel disputed that contention while expressing willingness to address concerns of google and others "we dont believe that this feature is covered by the consent decree or that it raises any antitrust issues " he said googles allegations are under review by the justice department and state attorneys general who were parties to a consent decree that resolved the governments antitrust case against microsoft in a new york times article yesterday discussed googles concerns and reported differences between the justice department and some of the states about how to respond a report to the washington d c federal court overseeing the case is due later this month and is expected to be the first formal airing of the issue before the judge colleen kollar kotelly who has shown frustration over microsofts compliance with the settlement some states are pressing for action "we are at a critical juncture in deciding how to proceed and whether the justice department will be an aggressive partner in this continuing enforcement of the settlement decree " said richard blumenthal the connecticut attorney general he declined to discuss googles concerns citing the confidentiality of the process but he said the issue "concerns possible exclusionary conduct by microsoft that seems potentially contrary to the spirit and concept of the settlement " the flap extends a series of complaints about microsofts power which peaked in the late s in a battle over how microsoft dealt with rivals such as netscape communications corp in those days a focus was competing software that runs on a pc recently though microsoft has had a tougher time with google and other internet rivals whose services run largely independently of microsofts windows desktop search which requires a small piece of pc software is sometimes viewed as an offshoot of the web search market but internet companies view it as a key to building consumer loyalty and use of their various services one that could become more important as consumers store files across various online and offline locations in its april white paper google alleged that microsoft didnt allow search bars in vista that consumers can use to initiate searches to work with desktop search software other than microsofts said lawyers familiar with the matter in addition google argued it was practically impossible for consumers to turn off the indexing feature of microsoft desktop search software that catalogs users files which meant a computers performance was slowed down if it used a second desktop search application a microsoft spokesman said it is possible to turn off its own desktop search feature though acknowledged it isnt easy the company said consumers can access google desktop search in a variety of ways through vista including directly by icons on the desktop and in the "start" menu it further said that microsofts desktop search indexer doesnt use any computing power when googles own indexer or other applications are in use so it doesnt affect performance in the way google alleged microsoft executives said they had been working with the justice department state attorneys general and the technical committee that oversees the consent decree to work though potential violations by vista desktop search was among the features that were examined they said while microsoft made changes to vista based on that review it wasnt asked to alter desktop search they said microsofts mr smith said google lobbied u s and european antitrust authorities throughout about a number of features "we in fact addressed all of those issues " he said "were prepared to make changes as long as theyre within reason " google last year had complained that microsoft was using its influence over the browser software market to push its web search service to the disadvantage of rivals microsoft eventually made modifications to how search is handled in the latest version of its internet explorer browser microsoft has argued that regulators should give thorough scrutiny to googles recent agreement to buy online ad services company doubleclick inc for &# billion microsoft has alleged that deal presents antitrust issues for the internet ad market a charge google denies see related letter "letters to the editor
