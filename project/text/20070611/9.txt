boss talk ceo guides a new age of discovery zaslav rouses sleepy cable networks changing structure and programming sees cache of nonfiction shows as key like a well fed lion in one of its nature shows discovery communications inc meandered along for a decade in a sleepy haze the companys cable networks churned out profits without much effort a half public half private ownership structure muffled investor fireworks even its quiet location in maryland contributed to the slumbering reputation then david zaslav arrived in january he left a top post at general electric co s nbc universal to run the &# billion company home to the discovery channel tlc and animal planet within weeks he had ousted a cadre of veteran executives a first time chief executive mr zaslav has also shuttered discoverys chain of retail stores sold the travel channel and slashed the work force by more than most significantly mr zaslav orchestrated a &# billion deal in march to buy out cox communications inc s stake in discovery it is now owned by the publicly traded discovery holding co with the balance owned by advance newhouse communications inc discovery couldnt afford to stay on autopilot the internet with its many microniches is proving a bigger challenge to cable channels than to broadcast networks and growth in fees from cable providers is slowing but mr zaslav years old is in a unique position discoverys nonfiction shows are evergreens and wholly owned content that could have immense value excerpts from a recent interview wsj youre moving at lightning speed to overhaul the company how have you prioritized mr zaslav the biggest horse in our stable is the discovery channel so that was the first place that i went step one was to ask the question what is discovery when its at its very best as a result we decided to take off all the content that didnt relate to discoverys core mission to educate inform to satisfy peoples curiosity we decided to take off those nonbrand shows no matter what the ratings "american hot rod " "fbi files " "monster garage" theyre all gone wsj how did that go over with your programmers mr zaslav there was a big discussion and a lot of concern that the ratings would drop and that revenue would drop the surprise to a lot of people was that the overall ratings went up significantly about that was a confidence builder for us as we focus on making our brands stronger by sticking to the knitting youre never going to see any wet t shirts on our channels wsj two discovery channel shows that are getting noticed are "mythbusters " where science is used to test the validity of urban myths and "cash cab " a quiz show in a taxi why do they fit the brand mr zaslav discovery is a knowledge brand both shows are about making knowledge exciting enjoyable and stimulating its becoming hip to be smart and these shows fulfill our core mission of satisfying curiosity in ways that are relatable and fun for viewers wsj why did you decide to close the stores some were making money mr zaslav when i got to discovery communications one of the challenges was to look at all of our businesses as if it was a chance to start over is this business going to help us grow and are we in this business in the right way we decided we could reach more people and be stronger if we built a bigger e commerce operation and piggyback on existing retailers with our best products and best brands wsj do you worry that so much change so fast will cause whiplash among the troops mr zaslav before i started i talked to about people at discovery at all levels one of the resounding themes was that we need change and we want to win so i know theyre ready for it we have also tried to ease the transition by having very direct internal communication and lots of town hall meetings people are comfortable with change if they know theyre being heard and they know the strategy wsj a lot of companies try to centralize operations to save costs yet you immediately moved in the opposite direction why mr zaslav we reorganized much of the businesses to create clear leadership at the top of each of them for instance we hired angela shapiro to run tlc and put her in charge of everything the programming the pr the marketing before everything was very centralized promotions programming marketing it was all handled by a central shop you would ask somebody about a marketing campaign and there would be four people pointing at each other wsj some analysts have criticized discovery as moving slow on the web is that fair mr zaslav i think we have a ways to go but we have a core strength that really gives us an advantage our content is good today and it will be just as interesting tomorrow so i see nothing wrong with moving at a deliberate pace ive watched the marketplace and there are a number of people who i think are jumping out too soon a press release isnt a good reason to do this there should be a strong economic model wsj your biggest channels are fully distributed and advertising is soft across the industry what do you see as your growth engines mr zaslav we are going to grow by viewing ourselves as more of a content company and less as cable channel company espn has done a great job as a category leader in the u s for sports across all platforms new media magazines etc we can and should do the same to win with nonfiction discovery communications needs to own our genres like exploration adventure science natural history and anthropology we dont have sports leagues and studios to fight or share with the cherry on top and what really differentiates us is that our nonfiction categories travel so well internationally and have such a great shelf life we can take a franchise like "shark week" and show it in standard and high definition distribute the content through our direct to school education business sell it through dvd video on demand and mobile and finally deploy the same strategy in each of our markets around the world the added value is that the "shark week" footage will be just as exciting five years from now so we can get several more bites at the apple wsj how do you plan to jump start growth in those overseas markets mr zaslav discovery has traditionally had two factories we had a factory in the u s to build our programming here and then we had a whole separate factory for our international business were getting rid of that and building one super factory it will unlock a lot of margin opportunity but its also a model where we can pick one set of programs that will travel around the world we can spend a lot more money on programming because were only doing it once wsj the discovery channel recently aired a lavish miniseries called planet earth that attracted big audiences and stirred a lot of critical buzz what did that experience teach you mr zaslav it taught us that high quality programming can break through the clutter and really engage people in a meaningful way it also convinced me that we have to double down and launch a full channel thats dedicated to addressing the issues of whats happening to our planet were launching a new channel that will be called planet green and weve gotten enormous support from advertisers corrections &amp amplifications discovery communications inc is owned by discovery holding co and owned by advance newhouse communications inc a marketplace article monday incorrectly said the company was owned by discovery holding with the balance owned by advance newhouse wsj june
