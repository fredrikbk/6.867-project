regional economic roundup a special report safety first for cities in search of growth getting rid of crime definitely pays for many years logan circle was a place to be avoided no doubt the washington d c neighborhood only six blocks from the white house had potential on the original grid designed by pierre lenfant logan was one of the only circles designed for residential housing and it featured many stunning victorian row houses from that era but by the late th century the area had become a rats nest of urban decay it had pockets of rubble a visible reminder of the riots and drug use was open and rampant drawn by the cheap housing and the beautiful architecture a few pioneers braved the high crime in the s and s and decided to go into the neighborhood as investors connie maffin was one of them she and her husband bob bought a brownstone in when they would come home late at night they would occasionally hear a prostitute and her client cavorting under the stairs leading to their front entrance ms maffin united with others willing to change the neighborhood they spent years working with local police and took turns standing on the street corners on weekend nights to deter the johns who drove in from northern virginia slowly as crime waned businesses began to take a look today the neighborhood hosts a number of successful locally owned businesses along with that symbol of yuppie living a whole foods market houses that sold for less than &# in are now selling for &# million "it was the edgy neighbors that got it to the point that economic development groups would even stick their toe in the neighborhood " ms maffin says of those early policing efforts by herself and other residents "had we not made a good cake they couldnt have come in and done the icing " it may sound so simple but city after city has found that getting crime under control is the crucial foundation to stimulating economic development indeed the trend toward placing police sub stations in apartment buildings and shopping centers took off after cities found that establishing a stronger law enforcement presence in an area that was once written off established a beachhead for economic growth getting crime under control "is a preliminary " says david martin a researcher at the center for urban studies at wayne state university in detroit "it has to be taken out of the equation first " in fact many researchers say that one reason the return to urban living nationwide has been so dramatic leading developers to build thousands of lofts in central business areas across the country has been a drop in crime nationwide in more than people in every nationwide were victims of violent crime by the number of victims had dropped below out of every people yet some experts are worried that this healthy trend could be halted due to a worrisome uptick in crime in many cities over the past months the role of crime in revitalization piqued the interest of researchers who observed the remarkable renaissance of new york city a place that gained a reputation during the s and s as wild dangerous and increasingly ungovernable the city actually lost population from to with crime considered to be one of the main reasons for the urban flight however by the end of the s fbi uniform crime reports showed that new york was among the five safest large cities in the country about the same time the city underwent a real estate miracle as businesses clamored for office space and residential valuations began to soar amy ellen schwartz professor of public policy education and economics at new york university and two colleagues tried to quantify how much of new yorks real estate boom could be attributed to the citys ability to get a handle on crime which was credited largely to then mayor rudy giuliani and his police commissioner william bratton who emphasized greater police presence in the neighborhoods and aggressively attacking even petty crimes the researchers concluded that the drop in crime accounted for about a third of the increase in property values with the rest of the rise attributable to other factors including housing improvements whats clear says dr schwartz was that the property values increased the most in the areas of the city where crime fell the most though those also tended to be the poorest areas where the city made its most intensive investment in improving housing research published in the february issue of economic development quarterly by david bowes an economics professor at southeastern louisiana university found that retail developers will to some extent tolerate property crime in fact he found that retail developments increase property crimes by acting as a lure to thieves however he also found that retail developers were repelled by violent crime "what may be discouraging retail development is not higher costs associated with loss from theft or increased insurance rates but loss of potential customers who are reluctant to go into violent areas " writes dr bowes dr bowes finds that such strategies as tax incentives or even community support are not enough to foster economic development to be successful these must go hand in hand with strategies to reduce violence such as an increase in the number of security personnel or police officers and the installation of security cameras logan circle residents had been urging whole foods to open a store there for several years finally in michael besancon the companys regional president at the time agreed to go in believing that violent crime was starting to wane even though drug addicts were passed out in the former auto dealership building where he located the store it became the first major grocery store to open in the district of columbia in years "i wouldnt have done the deal if i didnt see that logan was turning it was a decision to embrace d c the entire city was turning around " says mr besancon now president of whole foods southern pacific region similarly high end loft condominiums began to spring up on los angeless skid row about three years ago about five blocks from a part of downtown that has already seen rejuvenation skid row remains one of the most disorderly neighborhoods in the city but crime has fallen in the surrounding police reporting district of central los angeles after staying relatively static at about serious crimes each year from to serious crimes in the area dropped to about by according to statistics provided by the los angeles police department developers around skid row are "jumping out ahead of the growth thats sure to come that way " says whitley collins a managing principal for the los angeles region with staubach co an addison texas based real estate firm that represents commercial tenants "its conceivable that five years from now skid row will be gone " he says even parts of detroit which suffers from both high crime and a depressed economy are showing signs of improvement as part of a crackdown on crime for the better part of two decades two or three crime families had terrorized cahalan street in springwells village in the southwest part of detroit near the ford motor river rouge plant the hoodlums would break into houses in the neighborhood pour gasoline on the floor throw a molotov cocktail and scram four residents died in the firebombings over a year period then in the past couple of years police put away the worst offenders cahalan street for a while continued to look like a war zone three darkened burned out houses pocked a two block stretch and another damaged house slumped precariously yet once the neighborhood was relatively safe the residents were willing to take charge says dennis nordmoe executive director of neighborhood centers inc a detroit based non profit thirty five people showed up at a neighborhood meeting on one of the vacant lots to sit in metal folding chairs sip kool aid and propose solutions "they said if you could just get us dumpsters we will take down these buildings ourselves " says mr nordmoe in the end the neighbors agreed to repeatedly call city hall urging the government to remove the ruined houses the effort paid off within six months the neighbors also mowed the vacant lots and even put up balloons on fences in an attempt to beautify the street now for the first time in many years its reasonable to talk about encouraging community groups to build new houses on cahalan street says mr nordmoe getting a handle on crime in such areas has also encouraged investment in springwells village businesses have come into the area and some longer standing ones have decided to renovate or freshen up their facades two years ago leonard artola opened a mortgage company in springwells village filling a niche for latinos moving into the area who needed a bilingual mortgage broker he put his premier mortgage funding office in a building he still owned from a previous business endeavor a bar that was destroyed in a firebombing "i was a little hesitant to go back to that same location because i cant say for certain that it will never happen again " mr artola says yet he took the chance "im not scared to be here i walk to lunch i do feel its getting better " he says ms forsyth is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be reached at jennifer forsyth wsj com
