who killed the immigration bill for a seasoned politician senate majority leader harry reid is unusually transparent politicians as a rule try to mask their political motives but upon yanking the bipartisan immigration reform bill from the senate floor last thursday mr reid declared its demise to be the fault of president bush he said the headline would be democrats voted for the bill republicans didnt and "the president fails again " it was "the presidents bill " mr reid insisted elaborating a theme he obviously hoped the media no friend of the president would echo mr bush he claimed was no help in limiting debate and speeding the measure toward a vote "where are the presidents men " mr reid asked "where are the presidents people helping up with these votes " true enough neither the white house nor most of the so called "grand bargainers" whod drafted the immigration bill were on mr reids side when he called for restricting debate through cloture they wanted a few more days to debate additional republican amendments they voted against cloture and when it failed mr reid snatched the bill from the senate floor yet mr reid was putting blame for defeat upon the one man mr bush whose unwavering support for immigration reform had never before been questioned now the fate of immigration reform the most important domestic legislation of the s rests solely in the hands of the senate majority leader mr bush and republicans cant put the bill back on the senate floor only mr reid can mr reid faulted the president for not lobbying for the bill and for being overseas at the g meeting in germany at a crucial juncture thereby helping to foster a widespread and erroneous impression that he mr reid was sparing immigration reform and the grand bargainers an embarrassing defeat quite the contrary the bill was "well within reach" of approval by the senate said sen edward kennedy of massachusetts the chief democratic drafter of the bill and its floor manager it was the opponents of the bill who had grown pessimistic and desperate a solid majority of republican senators had demonstrated their support by voting to retain the key provision making the million immigrants living in america eligible to stay indefinitely with special z visas this is the provision most detested by the bills conservative and republican detractors so what was mr reids real problem he indicated he feared republicans would offer an endless stream of amendments a filibuster in effect yet senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and pro bill republicans such as jon kyl of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina promised they wouldnt let this happen mr kennedy made a last minute plea to keep the bill alive but mr reid deep sixed it anyway mr reid said he favors the immigration bill and indeed he may but he also has political interests these include enlarging the democratic majority now in the senate and the election of a democratic president and its here that mr reids bush bashing language is most revealing for democrats in running against mr bush as a failed president would be ideal just as it was in the normal political pattern is that unpopular presidents with minimal accomplishments are succeeded by presidents of the other party the passage of sweeping and generous immigration legislation on mr bushs watch might jeopardize that the president might not look so much of a failure moreover the passage of that legislation would also take an issue that bitterly divides republicans off the table in truth mr bush had only a small role in shaping the actual immigration proposal before congress its not as mr reid claimed the presidents bill though the president certainly backs it the instigator of senate negotiations on immigration was sen mcconnell who believes a controversial issue like immigration can best be dealt during a time of divided government in washington in this case a democratic congress and a republican president the white house was invited to join senate talks but only after a number of sessions had already been held mr bush sent two cabinet secretaries michael chertoff of homeland security and carlos gutierrez of commerce they obtained one significant change dropping the obligation of illegal immigrants seeking a z visa to pay back taxes that requirement however was reinstated on the senate floor while mr reid criticized mr bush for doing too little on behalf of the bill the president may ironically have done too much when he attacked conservative foes of the bill for opposing "whats right for america " mr bush stirred an angry backlash and was scolded by supporters and opponents alike for political clumsiness mr bush plans to meet with senate republicans tomorrow but even among republicans his influence on capitol hill has all but vanished mr reid was also being disingenuous when he said that the senate needed to move on and take up energy legislation instead he plans to bring before the senate today a motion censuring attorney general alberto gonzales it is non binding and a purely political gesture when not castigating mr gonzales mr reid is to be visited today by republican supporters of the bill led by mr kyl who has withstood enormous pressure in his home state to abandon immigration reform and split with his chief ally mr kennedy mr kyl is to present the majority leader with a scaled down list of a dozen or so republican amendments these would be debated over two or three days along with democratic amendments if mr reid agrees to revive the bill republicans would promise to join him in seeking cloture thus thwarting diehard republicans seeking to filibuster the bill to death and by the way democratic senators do have more amendments after all as sen jeff bingaman of new mexico has pointed out the bill was brought directly to the senate floor skipping the committee process in which a bills details are routinely worked out now the details can only be dealt with through floor amendments mr reid bristled when mr mcconnell told him the legislative successes of the newly democratic senate would be meager without immigration reform not only that mr reid risks alienating hispanic and other immigration groups who are prepared to hold him rather than mr bush and republicans responsible if the immigration bill dies in the senate should it pass however mr reid will get considerable credit so will the president mr bush didnt author the bill but he has been a fervent backer of immigration reform since he was governor of texas he is the godfather of immigration reform mr reid can blame the president all he wants but the decision on resuming senate deliberations and in all likelihood passing the most significant immigration legislation since the s is his alone mr reid can be the hero who saved immigration reform or the goat who killed it mr barnes is the executive editor of the weekly standard
