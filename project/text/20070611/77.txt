the evening wrap judging gonzales online edition attorney general alberto gonzales has managed to survive a controversy over his handling of the firing of federal prosecutors and his leadership of the justice department and an effort to shame him into resigning looks poised to come up short the senate is expected to vote late this afternoon on whether to close debate on a resolution that says that "attorney general alberto gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the senate and of the american people " the measure has no constitutional force but its supporters believe that it could increase pressure on mr gonzales who has few vocal backers among his own party to quit "if all senators who have actually lost confidence in attorney general gonzales voted their conscience this vote would be unanimous " said sen chuck schumer the new york democrat who sponsored the measure still there seemed scant chance the bill would succeed even with the support of sen arlen specter the top republican on the senate judiciary committee democrats looked unlikely to round up the votes they need to move the resolution forward republicans believe that the vote is an attempt to embarrass president bush and though mr gonzales has drawn hard criticism from many republican lawmakers the party appeared determined to hold together in the face of a democratic challenge mr gonzales gave no indication today that he was considering leaving "i am not focusing on what the senate is doing " he said from a terrorism conference in miami "i am going to be focusing on what the american people expect of the attorney general of the united states and this great department of justice " the attorney general has shown a knack for sticking around even amid the most trying of political circumstances after a contentious senate hearing in april in which mr gonzales repeatedly claimed that he didnt remember details related to the dismissals of the u s attorneys calls for his resignation hit a fever pitch then testimony last month about his efforts as white house counsel to renew a domestic surveillance program over the objections of justice officials angered critics anew the president has stood firmly by mr gonzales speaking on the last lap of a european tour today in bulgaria mr bush said the no confidence vote is "meaningless" and wouldnt determine "who serves in my government " but if mr gonzales is holding up under political pressure the terrorism policies he helped mold were facing serious challenges as a federal appeals court ruled this afternoon that the government cannot legally detain a u s resident that it suspects is an al qaeda sleeper agent without charging him with a crime the decision rejects one the bush administrations central tenets about the authority of the president to combat terrorism the court wrote that to "sanction such presidential authority even if the president calls them enemy combatants would have disastrous consequences for the constitution and the country " the court said that ali al marri the only person currently being held as an enemy combatant on u s soil can be returned to the courts to face trial the ruling followed decisions last week by two military judges who found that the pentagon couldnt prosecute two men being held at guantanamo bay cuba because they werent identified as "unlawful" enemy combatants as mandated by the military commissions act mr marri a native of qatar was arrested at his home in illinois in and has been held at a navy brig in south carolina yields rise stocks flatten bond yields continued to climb
