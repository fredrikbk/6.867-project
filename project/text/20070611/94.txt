wons rise makes waves korean shipbuilding boom lifts currency hampering export oriented economy seoul south korea the south korean won has risen against the u s dollar since the start of appreciating more than any other asian currency and causing problems for the countrys export oriented economy the currencys strength forces south korean companies to raise prices of their products or cut into profit margins major manufacturers such as samsung electronics co and hyundai motor co in the past two years have seen their price advantage against competitors erode operating profits tumble and stock prices decline while many conditions affect the value of currencies economists and bankers point to a single industry for tilting the scale in south korea the countrys shipbuilders which are responsible for half the worlds value of vessels on order south koreas dozen or so large shipbuilders are experiencing their biggest boom ever because of rising global trade and chinas hunger for commodities but they also are a leading source of pressure on the south korean won since shipbuilders receive the bulk of their payment only when a ship is completed currently at least three years after an order is placed during that period shipbuilders turn to banks to protect or hedge the value of todays orders using a forward exchange transaction for example a shipbuilder that takes a &# million order today for a ship delivered in may receive a &# million down payment from the buyer and then hedge the other &# million it does this by offering to pay a bank in the &# million if the bank will at that time give the shipbuilder todays equivalent value in won or about billion won the bank then will go to the foreign currency market and obtain billion won which it will hold in an account earmarked for the shipbuilder the act of acquiring won today creates demand that raises the value of the currency and the rising value of the won reinforces shipbuilders desire to hedge and protect their future revenue "this is a vicious circle being created with the expectation that the won will become stronger causing it to happen " says hong sun young an economist at the samsung economic research institute in seoul but he doesnt blame the shipbuilders saying they are engaging in "very rational behavior " some of the wons strength of course comes from the relative weakness of the u s dollar or japanese yen but the surging growth of the shipbuilding industry along with its large size in the south korean economy it accounts for about of gross domestic product and trails only computer chips and autos as a source of export income have combined to form a particularly influential source of pressure on the won the rising value of the won is bad news for other south korean exporters for instance hyundai motors net profit fell last year as its dollar sales in the u s and euro sales in europe converted to fewer won back at south korea headquarters in addition with japans yen down against the dollar and euro hyundai has been unable to raise prices against japanese competitors such as toyota motor corp and honda motor co that enjoy greater brand perception with overseas consumers a hyundai spokesman says the company is focusing on a marketing campaign to lift its brand image in a meeting this past december executives from large south korean companies asked senior government officials to "manage" the wons appreciation by intervening finance and economy minister kwon o kyu later that month said the government would put a top priority on "managing such downside risks" of a stronger won this year but no one expects the shipbuilders to stop their hedging practices because to do so would put them at risk of eroding their profits in the future the won started rising sharply in the last three months of when the bank of korea stopped its longtime practice of intervening to keep the won steady as the won fluctuated more shipbuilders stepped up their hedging activities in south korean exporters led by the shipbuilders hedged a hefty &# billion according to the central bank the average annual exchange rate for the won rose against the dollar that year last year the value of hedging grew almost to &# billion as the wons average exchange rate gained another on the dollar the shipbuilders dont disclose precisely when they hedge but last month hyundai heavy industries co the worlds largest shipbuilder booked a record &# billion in orders for ships that will be delivered in and and early last month the won moved to its strongest level of the year won to the dollar the currency is currently trading at to the dollar economists note that other economic figures suggest the won shouldnt be strengthening against the dollar "the current account is equally balanced theres no huge trade surplus and no massive capital inflows " says frederic neumann an economist at hsbc in hong kong "you wouldnt expect appreciation based on the fundamentals " but economists believe the pressure on the won will continue because the shipbuilding boom is likely to stretch on until there is a global economic slowdown in addition the easiest fix sustained dollar buying by south koreas central bank poses a political risk to the korean government as consumers would end up paying higher interest rates since the central bank issues bonds with attractive rates to pay for the dollars it buys another option says mr hong the samsung economist is for the won to keep going until the market perceives that it has become overvalued against major currencies "then shipbuilders might change their expectations" and reduce their hedging he says lina yoon contributed to this article
