politics &amp economics a cooperative bush leaves allies wary memories of rejection persist as president now warms to global treaties washington president bushs penchant for rejecting international accords may be coming home to roost during last weeks summit of leading nations mr bush agreed to study a proposal from russian president vladimir putin to construct jointly a defense shield against missile strikes mr bush also pledged to "seriously consider" a german plan to cut global emissions of greenhouse gases in half by while mr bush opened the door to a new level of international cooperation in both cases his potential allies are wary because of the administrations history with international agreements on the same subjects their skepticism also threatens to isolate the u s as it pursues other priorities on washingtons agenda such as curbing irans nuclear program and pressuring the hamas run palestinian government to renounce violence and recognize israel in the run up to last weeks summit meeting mr putin denounced the bush administrations withdrawal from an antiballistic missile treaty similarly the europeans with whom mr bush is pledging to work on global warming continue to fume over a white house decision earlier in the bush term to reject the kyoto environmental accord over the past six years foreign leaders largely held their tongues when washington discarded such treaties but with anti american sentiments rising globally mr putin and others are no longer keeping their frustrations to themselves "theres a cumulative sense abroad that the u s turned its back on one multilateral pact after another " said charles kupchan a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations "that means foreign governments simply arent inclined to work with the u s the way they used to in the past they say why should we help " mr putin has been the most prominent of the critics accusing the u s of triggering a "new round of the arms race" by pulling out of the decades old abm treaty which limited the use of antiballistic missile systems that could be used to shoot down nuclear weapons germany and britain meanwhile have been increasingly vocal about prodding the bush administration to commit itself to the types of binding emissions cuts the u s refused to adopt during the negotiations over the kyoto accords the kyoto protocol which was adopted by nations but never submitted to the u s senate was shelved by mr bush shortly after he took office in at the time he said the treatys requirements that the u s cut its emissions by one third by would have done grave damage to the u s economy administration officials defend their decisions saying the cold war era abm treaty was inappropriate for a new era when u s national security is threatened by rogue nuclear armed nations such as north korea such views continue to rankle many foreign leaders german officials expressed irritation that the white house proposal to begin negotiations on voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions undercut german chancellor angela merkels top goal for the summit of the group of eight leading nations an agreement backed by the united nations on mandatory emissions limits british prime minister tony blair has said nations such as the u s will ultimately need binding emissions limits rather than the voluntary ones in mr bushs proposals a statement released at last weeks summit said the world leaders had agreed to pursue substantial cuts in greenhouse gases but didnt include the specific cutbacks sought by ms merkel countries such as germany and britain will be looking for evidence in coming months that the bush administration is serious about seeking multilateral deals on thorny issues one test will be iran where washington has been working with the u n and close european allies on a diplomatic solution to the countrys nuclear program mr bush has encountered pressure from many republican lawmakers to take a harder line against tehran possibly including military action and foreign governments are unsure of how firmly committed mr bush is to the diplomatic track american allies especially in europe also will be watching for how seriously the bush administration pursues its proposal to convene meetings of the worlds top greenhouse gas producers as part of an effort to develop nonbinding goals for reducing global warming many of the agreements the administration discarded over the past six years were largely unknown among americans as a result said year state department veteran price floyd "none of those treaties made much of a ripple in the u s and there was no blowback in america but overseas people noticed " mr floyd said he resigned earlier this year after tiring of trying to persuade other public affairs officials that the source of american unpopularity is its actions not its words he said senior state department officials did more than interviews with foreign journalists over the past six years as part of a campaign to sell american foreign policy to overseas audiences many of the questions concerned u s opposition to treaties such as kyoto or the agreement creating an international criminal court for war crimes trials he said but the more american officials took to the airwaves to defend administration stances the more unpopular the u s became around the world he said "we dont have a marketing problem its the product " said mr floyd who now works for the center for a new american security a washington think tank "our actions and our words dont match up "mr bush and his aides acknowledge that the u s is less popular than it once was they attribute this concern overseas to moves such as the invasion of iraq which the administration sees as vital to american security "theres a little bit of criticism out there evidently " mr bush said in a recent interview with several foreign reporters "i hear what people say and im very comfortable with my decisions absolutely " national security adviser stephen hadley told reporters recently that the initial u s push to withdraw from the abm treaty which was widely covered in russian media "was an area of disagreement" with russia "but we were able to talk that through and get russia behind it " but many russia experts say mr putins anger over the u s abandonment of the abm treaty along with other moves such as its effort to place missile interceptors in poland and elsewhere continues to grow "there is an accumulation of perceived slights that make russians think their security interests are being disregarded " said dimitri simes president of the nixon center a think tank in washington during a recent visit to russia mr simes said he was stunned by the intensity of anti american sentiment he heard from senior officials who saw u s military dominance as a growing threat mr simes said anti american feelings have been building for years "it took awhile but youre finally seeing the response " he said
