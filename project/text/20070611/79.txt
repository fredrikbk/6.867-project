religious roots ruling partys islamist past roils politics in turkey guls presidential bid worries secular elite a military e coup ankara turkey as the driving force behind turkeys bid to join the european union foreign minister abdullah gul plays a critical role in one of the most pro western governments in the nations history the year old is a leader of the akp a party with religious roots often cited as proof that islam and democracy can co exist "turkey is an inspiration for the region " he said in a recent interview "of course its a muslim country but its also a democratic secular state " yet when the akp nominated mr gul in april to become turkeys president the secular elite that dominates the nations army courts and bureaucracy reacted with alarm although it is the prime minister who runs the country the presidency is seen as the last remaining check on akp power thousands of protesters took to the streets there even were fears that the military which has removed four governments during the past years would stage a coup the political crisis has exposed deep fault lines in turkish society worried about the spread of radical islam in the region mr guls critics fear that he and his party have a secret agenda to dismantle the legacy of mustafa kemal ataturk who created the modern turkish republic in and instituted a strict separation between government and islam mr guls supporters see the crisis as no more than a power struggle between turkeys old guard and a newly assertive middle class from its religious heartland moderates throughout the middle east are watching closely how the crisis plays out they fear a fresh military coup in turkey still seen as a possibility if the akp emerges even stronger from elections next month would prove once and for all that religious parties however pro western are unwelcome in a democracy mr gul typifies a new generation of muslim politicians who are often university educated have worked and studied abroad and are fluent in the language of human rights democracy and the free market but his islamist past and that of other akp leaders such as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has made him a hated figure among hard line secularists "i believe the akp is trying to shed its past pedigree its islamist legacy " says umit cizre a professor of political science at bilkent university in ankara "but it cant seem to convince everyone else it has " mr gul was born in kayseri an old silk road trading city in anatolia the asian part of turkey kayserians are known for their piety conservatism and a strong entrepreneurial spirit "we have a joke here that if your child is bad at business you send him to university " says mehmet savruk an old friend of mr guls as a student in istanbul in the late s mr gul was religious often slipping away from cafes to pray he also became a lifelong fan of local soccer team besiktas it was at this time that he first was drawn into islamist politics inspired by necip fazil kisakurek a religious poet he joined the national turkish students union a right wing group influenced by the writers anti western buyuk dogu or "great orient " movement his activism earned him a short stint in prison after the military coup he was also a strong believer in another creed free market economics in the early s after gaining his doctorate in economics he held brain storming sessions with a group of fellow academics on how to loosen the states stranglehold on the turkish economy at the time turkey was dominated by big industrial companies run by a handful of politically connected tycoons whom the state pampered with subsidies and protectionist tariffs but their power was being challenged by the upwardly mobile anatolian middle class businessmen in places like mr guls hometown had gotten rich without state support and were demanding lower taxes and less state interference in commerce mr gul and his friends backed them "the ideas were against the establishment " says selim karatas a member of the group "the bureaucracy was a kind of communism you had to reduce it " mr gul moved to jeddah saudi arabia in where he worked for eight years as an economist for the islamic development bank the bank promotes economic growth in muslim countries and operates according to shariah the legal code of islam which bans the charging of interest on loans in jeddah turks and arabs peacefully co existed with american and european expatriates "it was a far more open city than anywhere in turkey " says mr karatas who also worked at the bank in the s mr gul returned to kayseri in for the circumcision of his son and a family friend asked him to stand as a candidate for the welfare party a fast growing islamist movement he won beginning a long political career when welfare party leader necmettin erbakan became turkeys first islamist prime minister in mr gul served as his adviser mr erbakan was an old style islamist hard liner he dismissed the eu as a christian club railed against zionism and dreamed of an islamic common market his first big foreign trip was to iran one of the wests biggest foes which set off alarm bells at home and abroad a few months later he visited another radical islamic state libya mr gul accompanied him on both trips friends say he was alarmed by mr erbakans decisions to go "he didnt think they would bring turkey any lasting benefit and wouldnt be perceived well in the west " says murat mercan an akp lawmaker and close friend the following year the turkish army squeezed the erbakan government out of power soon thereafter the welfare party was outlawed and mr erbakan was barred from politics in mr gul and a group of other modernizers including mr erdogan the current prime minister broke away from mr erbakans group and formed their own party the justice and development party better known by its turkish acronym akp it wasnt just foreign policy that set mr gul apart from the older generation of islamists his close friends included firmly secular turks such as nursuna memecan who lives with her political cartoonist husband in the u s mr gul sent his year old son to live with the memecans in scarsdale n y in the late s and to attend a u s school "he knows i dont pray five times a day or fast but he wanted his son to see a different lifestyle and learn english " says ms memecan mr gul and his wife also insisted that their daughter get a good education she is about to earn a degree in industrial engineering from bilkent university in ankara although studying there required her to remove her headscarf in class the akp sought to be a mainstream european style right of center party socially conservative and pro business capitalizing on disenchantment with a governing coalition mired in corruption scandals and a financial crisis it swept to power in the elections the new government got off to a rocky start when parliament rejected mr guls request to let u s forces invade iraq from turkish territory it took him months to repair turkeys strained relations with the u s but the akp was beginning to win over nervous secularists with a bold economic stabilization program under reforms recommended by the international monetary fund inflation fell foreign investment surged budget deficits were slashed and a privatization drive raised &# billion the party also reinvigorated turkeys year effort to join the eu its critics said it had an ulterior motive it hoped eu membership would allow it to reduce the armys role in turkish politics and provide greater protection for the rights of religious muslims the akp denies that the partys efforts to bring turkish law into line with eu standards got the attention of european officials it trimmed the powers of the military granted more freedom to kurds and made concessions on the divided island of cyprus "what we have done over the last four years is a silent revolution " says mr gul the akp also took steps that seemed to distance it from its islamist past it changed turkeys penal code to criminalize honor killings and marital rape and made it easier for foreigners including israelis to buy turkish assets mr gul was the driving force behind his countrys eu bid on oct the eu agreed to start membership talks with turkey yet mr gul raised concerns among secular pro western turks by reaching out to muslim countries as well he sought rapprochement with syria and iran sent peacekeepers to lebanon and invited hamas leader khaled mashal to ankara in february suspicions also persisted that the akp was pursuing a hidden agenda and that islamists were infiltrating the bureaucracy "gul is the smiling face of islamist politics " says murat yetkin a columnist with radikal newspaper prime minister erdogan tried unsuccessfully to end the ban on women wearing muslim headscarves in state institutions a touchstone of secularism the akp tried to make adultery a crime a move that also failed some akp controlled town halls imposed curbs on alcohol sales turkeys state television network decided not to buy the rights to air disneys winnie the pooh cartoon on the grounds that the piglet character was offensive to muslims who consider pigs unclean last year mr erdogan was criticized for trying to appoint a central bank governor with a background in islamic finance which adheres to shariah law and makes secularists queasy turkeys staunchly secular president ahmet necdet sezer vetoed hundreds of akp nominations for top civil service posts he refused to invite mr gul and mr erdogans wives to receptions at the presidential palace because they wore headscarves mr gul denies that the akp has a secret islamist plan "if we had a hidden agenda do you think we would try to anchor turkey in eu structures " he says "is there any evidence that we interfered in peoples personal lives they should compare the turkey of four years ago with the turkey of today " he says of his critics "who changed turkey and in what direction " the low level friction between the governing party and its foes erupted into a full blown crisis in april when the prime minister nominated mr gul to be president the opposition was outraged "they could have chosen a moderate " says onur oymen an opposition deputy "instead they chose someone who was one of the leaders of parties banned in the past because of anticonstitutional islamist activities " newspapers dug up controversial old quotes from mr gul and splashed them on their front pages mr gul allegedly said in for example that turkeys secular system had failed "and we definitely want to change it " mr gul denied ever saying such a thing opposition lawmakers boycotted the parliamentary vote on mr guls candidacy the military posted a statement on its web site invoking its role as defender of turkeys secular order a move many saw as a veiled threat that it would intervene to stop mr gul turks dubbed it the "e coup " turkeys top court ruled that the lack of a quorum because the opposition didnt participate made the parliamentary vote invalid hundreds of thousands of secular turks demonstrated across the country to protest the creeping islamization of turkish society the akp withdrew mr guls candidacy and called early elections to defuse the crisis but it also defied the elite telling the generals they take orders from the government not the other way around then it tried to change turkeys constitution so that the president would be elected by the people rather than parliament president sezer vetoed the changes and many now expect them to go to a nationwide referendum the popular mr gul would almost certainly win if he stood in a direct presidential election he has already said he will run if the akp succeeds in changing the constitution some fear that would lead to an all out clash with the military mr gul disagrees "i strongly believe the turkish army will respect the outcome of the election and the democratic process " he says in an attempt to appease its critics the akp has signaled a move to the political center unveiling a list of candidates for julys election that include women minorities and liberals radical holdovers from the welfare party will be out but some turks doubt that reconciliation is at hand "i was once very hopeful the akp could bridge the gap between the secular sector and islamic turks " says m hakan yavuz an academic who has written books about islamist movements in turkey "but theyve failed "
