regional economic roundup a special report on the waterfront a new city is rising in the old docklands of hamburg where people can live work and attend the philharmonic all in the same building hamburg juergen bruns berentelg knows what can make or break a city and he goes over a mental list of these things each morning as he heads to work across the canals and construction sites of hamburgs expanding waterfront mr bruns berentelg is chief planner of hafencity or harbor city the largest urban development project in europe a former director of global real estate company and developer tishman speyer in berlin he has been at the helm of other high profile urban projects successful and not now hes in charge of creating a new city in the old docklands of hamburg along the banks of the elbe river and hes determined to learn from past mistakes "hafencity is different " the energetic year old says in an interview at his waterfront office as ship masts clank construction cranes beep and tourist boats cruise by outside "economic development is not the center of our focus but rather urban development in the broadest sense we want to join economic social cultural and architectural forces in a way that translates into lasting urbanity " to that end hafencity is an ambitious mix of office residential commercial public and cultural space in a dense acre area alongside hamburgs booming harbor this so called blended approach whereby people can live work stay overnight or even attend the opera in a single building is still unusual but its no on the chief planners make or break list for the new harbor city rounding out his list meticulous planning clear lines of responsibility the right timing and sheer luck hafencity "has many of the ingredients to become a fantastic success " says philipp rode executive director of the urban age program at london school of economics and political science "and it comes at a good time when hamburg is booming " the citys first neighborhood is already complete one sunny afternoon office workers residents and tourists soaked up sun on the white concrete steps and benches of the magellan terraces a large waterfront square "its nice to come out at lunch and feel like youre in a neighborhood rather than just some office park " says marie tischer a year old executive assistant who works nearby at swiss logistics group kuehne + nagel the sandtorkai quarter as the neighborhood is called was carefully plotted between hamburgs historic speicherstadt warehouse city and its oldest harbor basin and was built about feet above sea level mixed use buildings stretch out into the water and despite each being designed by a different architect fit together like pieces of a puzzle current office tenants in addition to kuehne + nagel include german software giant sap ag and china shipping group others intending to move in include dutch anglo food conglomerate unilever plc german publisher spiegel gruppe and locally based germanischer lloyd ag a standards setting group for global shipping municipal planners estimate hafencity will help increase the hamburg city centers size by and add about new jobs over the next or so years it will do so by breathing new life into the harbor with apartments businesses shops restaurants schools and a university there will be no shopping malls but there will be a cruise terminal science center maritime museum and lots of public space the crown jewel when it opens in three years will be the imposing elbe philharmonic a glass sheathed structure by swiss architects herzog &amp de meuron built atop a former warehouse on the tip of a peninsula in the elbe it will house a concert hall luxury hotel and residential complex in terms of the buildings cultural and architectural impact its already being likened to the sydney opera house "symbolic architecture like the elbe philharmonic helps put the overall project on peoples mental map in hamburg and elsewhere " says mr rode "and the fact that it is mostly privately funded sends a strong signal that big money is believing in inner cities again " because the city of hamburg owns much of the land under development roughly million euros &# billion of its billion euro share of the project will be funded through lot sales the rest roughly billion euros is being carried by private investment individual projects have gone not to the highest bidders but to those with innovative ideas that fit the landscape meticulous planning and timing have been at the heart of hafencity from the start it was then mayor henning voscherau a member of the social democratic party who first had the idea for a new harbor city more than a decade ago city officials kept the idea under wraps until it was well advanced "operating secretly in this manner they kept the land prices low and avoided the typical public debate before the chick was hatched " says michael naumann the spd mayoral candidate for next year a small group of city officials and consultants drew up the master plan bundled all project responsibilities under the roof of hafencity hamburg gmbh a company wholly owned by the city state of hamburg and streamlined decision making for everything from building permits to subway extensions in with construction under way they brought in mr bruns berentelg as chief executive today "anyone who wants to do anything at all in the hafencity knows who he has to talk to " says mr bruns berentelg "we operate as a one stop agency in a transparent process so that all involved parties can work very very fast thats really key " thats probably the greatest lesson hes learned from past mistakes "when i was involved in redeveloping berlins friedrichstrasse in the s specifically the shopping district friedrichstrasse passage all the projects were being developed individually " he recalls "no one felt responsible for the overall planning idea retailers became insecure about the location " at hafencity everything has been coordinated down to the ratio of footpaths to roads while hafencity is just a short walk from the hamburg city center current subway stations already cover its northernmost areas its southern areas will be completed along with a new subway line in "this is a totally different situation from say the docklands in london where there was no public transport at all at the beginning " says mr bruns berentelg granted the harbor citys success to date also has to do with luck hamburg is well to do with many successful businesses tied to international commerce and more millionaires than any other german city home to the second biggest port in europe after rotterdam it is also in the midst of a boom last year the local economy expanded compared with in all of germany and that trend is likely to last as exports from china continue to grow the hamburg based hwwi economic institute forecasts that the citys economy will grow this year and in compared with and respectively for germany tourism is steadily on the rise too "eight years ago hamburgs tourism industry consisted of buses that drove cruise ship passengers directly from the harbor to berlin " says the head of a major german tourism group "now people actually stay and look around " but for all its attention to detail and its luck the real challenge for hafencity will be to find the right balance between planning just enough and planning too much or too fast "whats critical to the citys development is time " says mr rode of the london school of economics and political science the birth of a city he says "is a process of evolution that needs multiple agents " indeed while mr bruns berentelg likes to talk about the importance of allowing public spaces to develop on their own his team quickly moved to stop one early unexpected urban use of the magellan terraces skateboarders flocked to the curvy inclines and low lying steps in the amphitheater like square damaging some of its concrete slabs construction workers have since embedded metal spokes in the concrete to keep the skateboarders away "it was a lot more lively around here in the early evenings when the skateboarders were still around " says ms tischer the executive assistant "they were actually quite friendly " ms steinborn is a writer in hamburg she can be reached at reports wsj com
