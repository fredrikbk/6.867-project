counsels two actors on a love scene for the latest movie from yash raj films in typical bollywood style the closest the on screen lovers get to intimacy is a longing gaze and a brush of the hand enter walt disney co lured by yash rajs tradition of family friendly entertainment disney has struggled to make big money in india with its classic american fare now it has persuaded yash raj to make disney branded animated films with the voices of bollywood stars the joint effort to be announced tomorrow is part of the u s entertainment icons strategy to remake itself in high growth foreign markets such as india in many cases that means discarding disneys historic obsession with going it alone and instead joining with local experts to produce culturally customized fare in china for instance disney is teaming up with the state run china film group to release "the secret of the magic gourd " a movie about a talking vegetable that grants wishes in india it also is tapping local filmmakers to make a hindi feature film of its tv hit "high school musical " set against a possible backdrop of cricket rather than the originals basketball disney is "planting seeds today for growth tomorrow " says chief executive robert iger in mr iger talked about disney generating of its profit overseas within five years he says he still "likes that goal" but concedes it could be "difficult " in part because of the recent growth in core u s businesses last year a quarter of disneys revenue and operating income came from overseas indeed that growth has been a long time coming for the better part of a decade disney has made a priority of building its foreign business in television movies retail and theme parks a task initially assigned to mr iger himself when he was made head of disneys international operations but it turned out to be a bigger job than anyone expected mr iger says of those initial hopes "we were heady and those were heady days " in reality disney was "years away from having a global business that rivaled the domestic business " disneys traditional approach was largely to force feed its u s products from its burbank calif headquarters now it is going country by country with a particular focus on five hot markets india china russia latin america and south korea "were building disney from scratch " in countries such as india said mr iger citing the companys founder and namesake just "as walt did in the u s over years ago " the company has given more power to local managers and is tailoring its strategies for the local markets in china for instance where state regulation of television and movies is aggressive disney is leading its charge in retail selling its plush toys and mickey mouse clothing to consumers on a nationwide buying binge in latin america where disney is well known but historically considered an elite brand the company is attempting to move into the broader mass market in each case disneys international president andy bird says the goal is to build "a new generation that grows up with the disney brand " disneys new approach follows the route of other u s institutions efforts at foreign acceptance yum brands inc s kfc menus are tweaked country by country for instance to include rice porridge and bamboo shoots in china disneys biggest childrens television competitor in india new york based time warner inc in launched whats now the second rated childrens channel pogo with generous helpings of homegrown fare to complement its top rated cartoon network there in india the stakes for disney are huge the indian population under years old is bigger than the entire u s population and household incomes are rising fast but for years disney simply sold its u s movies and television shows to local distributors and broadcasters its movies in particular gained little traction in the market a problem also faced by other u s studios because of the strong indian film industry meanwhile with india lacking a large scale retail industry until recently disney saw limited opportunity for a consumer products business poor infrastructure discouraged theme park construction disney now has put television at the forefront indians burgeoning middle class places near obsessive focus on family and increasingly is paying for cable television the company launched disney channel and toon disney in india in and then last year made a rare overseas acquisition buying hungama the third rated childrens channel disney also waded into local productions spending a year developing and shooting dozens of television pilots and then launching two shows "dhoom machaao dhoom" about a teenager discovering her indian identity after living in america and "vicky and vetaal " about a boy and a friendly ghost trying to capitalize on indian fascination with supernatural themes the goal is for television success to pave the way for other lines of business one of those is a "disney artist" line of stationery stores which emphasize school supplies featuring disney characters to play to indian families emphasis on education the stores sell larger school bags than in the u s because indian schools dont have student lockers and sell thermos flasks because many schools dont have chilled water on a recent weekday in disneys store in the gurgaon suburb of delhi year old aryan gambhir wore a disney "power rangers" t shirt and fingered through disney branded stationery he said he also was a fan of disneys "winnie the pooh " and picked out a "jungle book" pencil case "pooh" balloons and "mickey mouse" candles for his brothers birthday the store is a joint venture with ravi jaipuria an indian distributor who helped establish such brands as pepsi and pizza hut in india mr jaipuria says he and disney plan to leverage franchise brands and tap the countrys mushrooming mall business by opening some stores the key he says is to make the offerings affordable disney previously misstepped by selling products in china that cost far more than most people were willing to spend disney and mr jaipuria also are discussing possible stores dedicated to franchises such as the "disney princess" line of toys as well as making disney brand flavored milk and ice cream disney also decided it needed a partner in the rough and tumble bollywood movie industry with its yash raj partnership disney landed one of bollywoods oldest and most successful studios to make "at least one animation film per year " says yash rajs chief executive sanjeev kohli the first venture will be an animated tale featuring the voices of bollywood stars saif ali khan and kareena kapoor but though the stars are big draws in indian cinema indian audiences arent used to seeing animated features on movie screens disneys local movie executive shyam p s says that disney will start with simple stories blending singing dancing humor and the "in your face" emotion typical of bollywood previously disney stumbled badly in china after overlooking cultural differences when it released its u s film "mulan " based on a chinese folk tale a decade ago the story was seen as too westernized a version when hong kong disneyland first opened its doors in many chinese visitors expected an amusement park like others in the country and were baffled by the storylines and unfamiliar characters connected with the rides some efforts to accommodate chinese culture also went awry serving shark fin soup at the theme park drew fire from conservationists disney first started re thinking its international ambitions in the fall of when michael eisner was chief executive at a retreat held in mr eisners apple orchard in vermont senior executives discussed growth opportunities against the backdrop of a slowing domestic market while mr eisner had led disney into a new wave of growth after taking over in he had focused largely on the home market in the late s the international business represented less than of overall revenue and a smaller share of profit according to people familiar with the figures executives argued the company needed to cast its gaze further afield and they agreed to appoint an executive with a mandate to increase the overseas business mr eisner persuaded mr iger then the abc television president to become disneys first international head at the next retreat at mr eisners aspen colo house in executives agonized over how to structure the overseas business some of the business divisions bristled at the thought of giving up any control on his initial trips to survey the overseas offices mr iger was confronted with an army of disgruntled executives who felt they had been overlooked by burbank for years according to some executives the way the businesses were organized was a mess disneys random expansion over the years created enormous overlap and little coordination among its offices in japan for instance mr iger says he discovered that the "guy who ran the studio didnt even know who ran television " he started cleaning up the bureaucracy slashing jobs and introducing a new layer of overseas managers promoted to become mr eisners no in he realized he had attacked only the "tip of the iceberg" in the international effort he says one obstacle loomed particularly large for both mr iger and his successor michael o johnson disneys different divisions battling to protect their overseas turf mr johnson left after three years when mr iger became ceo in he ordered up a study on how to exploit overseas opportunities more aggressively which recommended the five key markets mr bird says they decided to give those markets more authority so they could act in an "entrepreneurial manner " to help change the direction in india disneys indian television executive nachiket pantvaidya spent time in burbank learning disneys style of storytelling and talking about indian styles at one recent retreat he found himself sharing ideas with creative executives including disneys head of animation john lasseter the director of pixar hits like "toy story " mr pantvaidya says they combined disney channel and indian values to come up with three core themes for their shows "believe in yourself express yourself and celebrate your family " in effect he says they created a new genre of childrens programming in india they call "aspirational storytelling " aimed at a generation of children with broader ambitions than their parents in other cases disney is taking u s franchises and making indian versions of them such as "high school musical " whose indian cast members are likely to be chosen in an "american idol" style competition disney already aired a dubbed version of the american movie and launched "my school rocks " a dance competition involving hundreds of schools that uses "high school musical" songs disney has sold a cd of the movie soundtrack featuring hindi lyrics and indian instruments to spread the word further the cd has been more successful at reaching a broad audience than the dvd because of the lower cost disney also is making local feature film versions of "high school musical" in latin america and russia chief financial officer tom staggs says the plan is to invest &# million in films outside the u s over the next two to three years the cost of producing local shows in each market adds up but they dont have nearly the same budgets as u s shows each episode of "dhoom machaao dhoom" is filmed in a day on a rubble strewn television lot in northern mumbai at a cost of around &# a fraction of a u s tv episode disneys indian feature films will cost between &# million and &# million mr pantvaidya says local shows make up to of disney television programming the company hopes local shows will build interest in its u s franchises such as "hannah montana" and "kim possible " disneys princess line of toys featuring characters from several animated fairy tales got a recent push from a nationwide talent contest hosted by bollywood star dia mirza to crown indias own "disney princess " which disney televised the winner was a year old from mumbai meanwhile disneys own name is being promoted in india by merchandise unconnected to a character disney jeans also sold in china and europe the first disney jeans store opened in mumbai last year and disney says it plans to open of them with local licensee indus clothing ltd by the end of indias multitude of languages dialects and religions makes disneys strategy akin to "three dimensional chess " says mr bird mr p s disneys local movie executive says the company plans to release its first animated film in at least three languages hindi tamil and telugu later on disney may make live action movies specifically for the countrys south which has different tastes in movies and has emerged as an important market ultimately executives say disneys indian production could reach eight movies a year mr p s says the aim is to have indian audiences saying within a decade "lets go see a disney movie " geoffrey a fowler contributed to this article
