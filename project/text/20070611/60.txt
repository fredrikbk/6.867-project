regional economic roundup a special report a different path theres more to development than stadiums economic development isnt all about building new stadiums and technology parks local governments use all sorts of offbeat approaches to attract businesses and visitors and boost economic growth heres a look at three unusual ideas that cities and states are betting on a cool makeover many states think that hipness is the key to prosperity the theory proposed by economist richard florida of george mason university holds that the best way to spark economic growth is to attract and keep young workers in creative fields and that means making sure cities have cachet among the cool michigan for instance is devoting &# million in state funds and &# million in local funds to a "cool cities" campaign the state is promoting statistics such as the "bohemian index " which measures the number of artists and musicians in a city michigan is also using focus groups to figure out what creative types want and is creating "hot jobs in cool neighborhoods " a range of jobs in fields such as technology and pharmaceuticals some economists disagree with this tactic arguing that cities should build on the good qualities they already have rather than trying to reinvent themselves and some say that campaigns such as michigans try too hard for hipness a quality that should be effortless "its sort of tragic to have to have a policy induced strategy of coolness " says jamie peck a professor of geography and sociology at the university of wisconsin madison "its the complete antipathy to regular coolness its almost embarrassing to watch " karen gagnon the director of michigans program admits the campaign sounds a little hokey but she says the plan is "definitely much more than skate parks " with education and business development central to the effort and she adds that the program has been "working really well" so far with lots of interest from young entrepreneurs developers and filmmakers a roadside attraction its tough for a small city to gain traction in the tourism industry so many towns have tried to distinguish themselves with the big and bizarre cawker city kan for instance proclaims itself as the home to the worlds biggest ball of twine the city has fewer than residents and few businesses says linda clover official caretaker of the twine ball but thousands pass through each year to see the pound mass of threads "we dont have to promote it it promotes itself " she says while there is no estimate of how much cash visitors bring into the town ms clover says the local gas stations fast food restaurant and dairy queen get extra traffic in the peak months sometimes visitors opt to stay overnight at a local lodge like the ball of twine inn some development experts advise that places like cawker city should develop other entertainment resources "the general rule of thumb on tourism is that cities must have more to offer than a single attraction no matter how outlandish it might be " says nancy stark program director at the corporation for enterprise development a nonprofit based in washington d c "there must be a package of activities and justifications for traveling to the region " ms clover concedes "there arent a whole lot of other things here to entertain if they want to come here to relax we can help them with that " but for the time being the ball of twine will suffice although cawker city is "always looking for new ideas " says jack gracey the city clerk its content with the current tourist revenue forest under glass some cities are betting on unusual big budget attractions to lure visitors pella iowa for instance is working on an indoor rainforest called earthpark with a price tag of around &# million its plans also include a water park conference center condominiums retail shops and marina critics have blasted the idea some called it pork barrel waste after congress allocated nearly &# million for it others think such large scale projects are almost always a bad idea pricey ideas like these are "absurdly expensive and just plain absurd " says rob derocker executive vice president of development counsellors international a new york firm that helps companies relocate "even if its wildly successful whats the amortization how many millennia would it take to recoup something like that " the projects impact study estimates earthpark will bring in one million visitors and over &# million per year into the pella area moreover "having a world class eco based facility will help in work force retention " says david oman executive director of earthpark the group that proposed the rainforest and a former iowa gubernatorial candidate "its hard to get bright young people from either coast to move to the heartland "
