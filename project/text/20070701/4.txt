getting going popular advice you shouldnt take if youre in your s the world may not throw money at you but youll get plenty of free financial advice for instance you have no doubt been told to save diligently fully fund your employers k plan and avoid credit card debt and those are all good suggestions but there are other suggestions that arent quite so good including these four popular pieces of advice  amass cash if you are just out of school you probably have all kinds of financial ambitions including buying a car purchasing a home and trying your hand at stock market investing but according to some financial experts your top financial priority should be amassing an emergency reserve equal to six months of living expenses with this cash tucked away in conservative investments like money market funds and certificates of deposit lets be honest this is dull unrealistic and i would argue not all that sensible even if you regularly sock away of your after tax income it might take four years or so to amass six months of living expenses at that juncture you are supposed to leave this money in low risk investments where it will earn modest returns for the rest of your life sound bad it gets worse while you were building up your emergency reserve you were likely neglecting important goals like funding your k plan which might earn you a matching employer contribution and saving for a house down payment my advice forget the emergency reserve instead stick at least enough in your k to get the full company match next fund a roth individual retirement account if you still have extra money to save each year by all means stash it in conservative investments in a regular taxable account if you get hit with a financial emergency tap the money in your regular taxable account first but you could also borrow from your k in addition at any time you can pull out your roth contributions but not the accounts investment earnings without paying taxes or penalties you could also use your taxable account and roth for a house down payment once you have bought the house set up a home equity line of credit which you can then use as an emergency reserve  buy big that brings me to another piece of conventional wisdom thats often doled out to folks in their s buy the biggest house possible i have some sympathy with this suggestion if you are early in your career and you expect sizable pay increases in the years ahead you may want to stretch to buy a somewhat larger house after all if you purchase a place that you quickly become dissatisfied with you could soon find yourself trading up to a better home that will mean forking over a or selling commission mortgage application costs lawyers fees moving expenses and more dont however misconstrue what i am saying i am not endorsing the contention that real estate is the best investment you can make that you should buy the largest house possible or that you should take out the largest mortgage possible borrowing a huge sum to purchase an unnecessarily large house is financial foolishness you will saddle yourself with hefty monthly mortgage payments and a lifetime of large utility bills maintenance costs property tax payments and home insurance premiums rather when buying that first home you should strive to purchase a place thats the right size for you and your family and that you can see living in for a good long time  get a life insurance agents often push folks in their s to buy cash value life insurance arguing that its far cheaper to purchase these policies when you are young dont do it to be sure under the right circumstances and with the right policy from the right company cash value life insurance can be a decent investment but for those in their s these policies are unlikely to make sense remember the principal reason to buy life insurance is to protect your family and you may not even have a spouse let alone kids and if you are married with young kids you no doubt need a heap of coverage the cheapest way to get that coverage is with term life insurance which offers a death benefit and nothing more cash value life insurance by contrast combines a death benefit with an investment account because the premiums on these policies are so high you will likely skimp on coverage which means your young family wont be fully protected moreover if you buy a cash value policy you probably wont have the spare cash for other better investment opportunities such as funding a roth ira and your employers k  go for growth those in their s are encouraged to invest heavily in stocks because they have decades until retirement and thus plenty of time to ride out market declines this is good advice in theory in practice i would be a little cautious you dont want to invest heavily in stocks and then panic and sell during the next market plunge yet thats a real danger if you are new to the market and you have never lived through a market decline my suggestion start with stocks and bonds if you find yourself unperturbed by market swings move your stock allocation up to or after a year or two younger investors are often also told to favor highflying growth stocks growth stocks can be wild short term performers but the hope is that they will deliver superior long run returns unfortunately theres a good chance this hope wont be fulfilled academic studies suggest the highest returns are earned not by growth companies but by prosaic bargain priced value stocks i am not however suggesting you load up on value instead start by building a well diversified portfolio that includes both growth and value stocks as well as offering exposure to the broad u s market and to foreign markets if you later want to add a tilt toward value stocks be my guest but your top priority should be broad diversification
