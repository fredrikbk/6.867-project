personal business one stock one year what i learned for more than years ive written about the ups and downs of the stock market yet it never ceases to amaze me one day general motors reports horrendous losses and its stock goes up the next day a growth company shows impressive earnings growth and its stock price slides to try to unravel some of the mysteries of the stock market i set out to follow a single stock for a year armed mostly with a list of questions how do companies influence their own stock prices how do individual investors fare against the pros and what do analysts really do anyway id write a book on what i learned if i could see a stock through the eyes of those who admired it touted it traded it or otherwise made a living from it surely i could expose some of wall streets quirky secrets the result i hoped would be a better understanding of the behind the scenes workings of the market insight that could help small investors make better choices the first question to address though was which stock i nixed a few of the days hottest issues because their stories were too complicated or their businesses were too technical then i remembered the starbucks store in the basement of my office building everyone knew the coffee retailer and nearly everyone had a favorite drink or at least an opinion about the place when i punched the sbux symbol into my computer i discovered that this was a true star in the investing galaxy starbucks had climbed nearly between its public offering in and the end of a &# investment at the initial offering price would have been worth &# after a dozen years and four stock splits now more than a dozen years later could its stock keep climbing to find out i shadowed an analyst learned how starbucks opens stores watched a market maker trade the stock saw how computers running advanced mathematical formulas trade without human hands and stepped into the dark strange world of a short seller some of the findings surprised me growth isnt always what it appears to be investors zero in on a companys sales and earnings growth but they may have to dig under the surface to understand where the growth is coming from starbuckss stock for instance commanded a hefty price earnings ratio because the company was opening outlets at a caffeinated pace but that expansion succeeds only if starbuckss core business is perking along as well in recent months that core business has been slushy despite raising prices last fall adding breakfast sandwiches in thousands of stores and selling books and dvds the latest quarterly sales at starbucks stores open at least a year were up only from a year earlier well below the plus growth of recent years as a result starbuckss stock right now is around a month low starbuckss investors will have to decide if the slowdown is just a cyclical lull or if the main business has permanently cooled tepid same store sales growth could force a change in approach as wal mart stores has learned the huge discount retailer recently said it would slow down its expansion to intensify its attention to its existing stores stock buybacks may not be such a great idea wall street loves when a company says it will spend its cash or even borrow money to buy its own shares during my year following starbucks the company spent more than &# billion to buy back its stock research shows such moves can boost per share earnings and help the stock price but only if the companys business and growth prospects are strong otherwise the company may be spending precious funds trying to pump up its stock price when it should be reinvesting in its business on the other hand stock splits can be a positive sign for a companys shares wall street often scoffs at stock splits as meaningless though small investors love watching their shareholdings multiply turns out small investors may be on to something research shows companies that split their shares often perform better in the year after the split than other stocks because the splits reflect executives underlying confidence in the business in the months after starbucks declared its fifth stock split in fall the stock reached new highs professional investors have a secret weapon focus sure the professionals have more information than small investors will ever have they have more time to study stocks and more skills and tools but in the end they are guessing about the future just like we are what really sets the professionals apart is their focus on a single strategy the majority of them invest in one area growth or value big or medium or little stocks and they rigorously follow a set of guidelines if were going to pick stocks we should specialize too limiting our trading to one area where were strong and sticking to a strategy we can diversify with mutual funds or professionals who have expertise in other areas little investors have an even better secret weapon patience professional investors are rated and ranked every quarter giving them little incentive to stick with a stock through a long downturn but small investors who believe in a companys promise can hang on and reap rich benefits if theyre right investing for the long term is our one huge advantage over the pros just ask the folks who bought starbuckss stock in the s
