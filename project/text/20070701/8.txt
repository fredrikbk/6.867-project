love &amp money the best car your kids money cant buy i do not remember my first kiss but i sure do remember my first car it was a hideous car a gold four door buick lesabre circa that my grandparents handed down to me when they bought themselves a new car that was equally ugly this was not a car made for high school cool no matter because regardless of how un cool that gold four door lesabre was i was years old and i was mobile and that was all that mattered but im not certain thats all that matters today i look around and the only junkers and clunkers i see clogging the roads are largely under the stewardship of adults teens it seems are driving far better vehicles than they did when i got my first keys how can this be cars are still pretty expensive for a kid making minimum wage how can they afford cars that id be happy to drive today the answer no doubt is the parental upgrade moms and dads who pay for their offspring to drive vehicles a lot nicer than the kids could afford on their own sometimes it means parents buy the car outright other times it means supplementing whatever amount our kids can muster on their own and i wonder is it just another sign that were spoiling our kids or is there something else at work while running errands several weeks ago i drove by the same high school i attended a middle income public school and it seemed every other car in the lot was an upmarket honda a nice mazda the requisite mustang or even a prius conspicuously absent the modern equivalents of the chevelles the used camaros and the ratty monte carlos that populated this same lot in the early s i suspect that some of whats going on here is a reflection of the leasing craze cars otherwise beyond a familys finances in the traditional sense more easily fit into the monthly budget with a lease though the wisdom of leasing is debatable either that or parents are just killing their budgets on transportation for their children either way the end result is the same these kids arent buying cars with the dollars saved from baby sitting or after school jobs "it wasnt like this when i started driving " says one of my colleagues who first slipped behind a steering wheel in his car a ford falcon convertible in rough shape he says it had well over miles on it and "was pretty much leaking every kind of fluid you put in it " he remembers driving to visit his girlfriend in college a few hundred miles away "just praying the falcon would make it there and back in the snow on bald tires " every time it started he was thankful his parents he says could have easily afforded something nicer for him to drive they didnt though and nobody thought twice about it "you assumed thats what kids drove then " he says "our first cars were basically junk the nicest car i saw anybody drive was probably a three year old vw bug " but as a parent today he sees this issue entirely differently "theres no way id let my son or daughter drive something like that falcon " he says the primary concern is one all parents worry about safety at one point recently my friend says his college aged son was driving six hours from new jersey to maine to visit his girlfriend "and i wasnt about to let him drive something unsafe on that trip " instead he and his ex wife bought their son a new mazda and their daughter a new honda cars that came equipped with all the modern safety features but which were "well beyond what either of them could afford " my friend says "they were driving so much and we hated to think of them driving the cars they could actually afford kids die in car accidents and we wanted to at least reduce the odds " another friend here in the south wanted his kids to buy their own vehicles and he made that clear from the moment they started talking about cars in their early teens yet when that moment arrived his worry took over and he stepped in with extra cash to push their purchase price into a higher tier "the used cars they wanted to buy werent terribly bad " he says "and the cars did have some safety features but not whats available today as a parent you lay out these rules youre going to abide by with your kids and then you begin to think through the potential chain of events and you get to this point where you think i can give my kids a little extra money so that they can buy a safer car or i can just let them buy what they can afford every time i thought about that i always came down on the side of making sure my kids were safer i think thats why so many kids today have nicer cars than we ever had their parents are worrywarts like me " ive noted in this column over the years that i have in my garage a mazda miata the first car i bought for myself after college it died in with more than miles on the odometer the engine is toast many of the accessories no longer work but im keeping it because i want to restore it one day and present it to my year old son as his first car when he earns his drivers license the way i see it spending &# or so on necessary repairs is a lot more affordable than buying him a new car then again second thoughts constantly invade my planning miatas are tiny i was once sideswiped on a dallas freeway by an wheeler and i remember looking out my window and seeing the trucks front wheel even with my head as it scraped along the side of my tiny car i worry that maybe the miata what will be a year old vehicle by then wont be the safest car for him to be driving i also know though that he wont have saved nearly enough money in the next six years to afford a new or newish car on his own and what this means is that amy and i already know we will ultimately perpetuate this trend of kids driving cars they otherwise cannot afford call it coddling call it spoiling kids and instilling an entitlement mentality im fine with that so long as we feel secure at the end of the day knowing our son is on the road in the safest car we can afford
