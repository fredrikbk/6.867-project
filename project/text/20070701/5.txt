health costs college medical coverage paying that first tuition bill for a college freshman youll also need to think about health insurance almost all schools require that students have health insurance and most offer some kind of coverage for a fee but families may be able to save money by relying on existing coverage or by shopping for a policy the first step is to call your current medical plan "make sure your plan covers college students " says jim mitchell director of student health service at montana state university and the past president of the american college health association while some plans cover full time students only until theyre or many provide benefits until a student reaches or if the college isnt close to home also consider the type of coverage you have if youre in a preferred provider organization ppo which provides higher reimbursements when you use participating medical providers check now for network physicians and medical facilities near the college most national insurance carriers have online and phone assistance available to help families find physicians different arrangements may need to be made if the family is enrolled in a health maintenance organization hmo which typically covers emergency treatment but not other care outside of the service area "if their parents are in a tightly controlled hmo the students may not be able to get the care they need unless they come home to get it " says sandy praeger the kansas insurance commissioner and president elect of the national association of insurance commissioners tom richards senior vice president of products at cigna healthcare recommends that families enrolled in such an hmo find out whether their students can get "guesting privileges " which would enable them to use a different doctor near their college cigna allows hmo participants to see doctors and specialists in its national network anywhere in the country another consideration is the range of services available at the colleges infirmary usually free or for modest fees those health centers typically provide the same services as a primary care physician such as treatment for a cold stomach virus or suturing only a small percentage of college clinics have overnight facilities depending on the hmos policy and on the school location some families may want to switch from an hmo to a ppo during the next benefits enrollment period another option especially if the student is likely to need medical care not available at the college infirmary is to get a student health insurance policy about of students many of them from outside the u s need to find their own health insurance that might cost around &# a year but that varies with coverage terms and other factors while many schools offer high quality plans through insurers its important to review the coverage and costs and to shop around mr mitchell recommends getting a policy that covers up to at least &# in medical expenses some he says provide only &# or &# in coverage which is far too low because of the high cost of hospitalization additionally look at all the exclusions he says some policies dont cover risky activities such as mountain climbing or "injuries while under the influence of alcohol " policies often exclude medical expenses related to an attempted suicide the school offering is typically cheaper than a comparable individual plan says dan fishbein head of the student health business for aetna and school plans usually are designed to cover services not available at the college clinic finally whatever policy a student selects dont leave home without the insurance card even if it has mom or dads name on it
