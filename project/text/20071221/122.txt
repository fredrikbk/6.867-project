weekend journal the drivers seat the cadillac of cadillacs so the new cadillac cts is the motor trend car of the year accolades from an enthusiast magazine normally dont get much attention outside advertising copy but lets suspend disbelief for a minute and consider the award at face value a cadillac last won "car of the year" in just before the brand fell off the face of the earth indeed the rest of the s werent good to general motors flagship marque its prestige plummeting in the face of more desirable models from bmw mercedes benz and lexus things got so bad that the phrase "the cadillac of cars" was coined and applied to other makers vehicles gm got serious about resurrecting cadillacs reputation with the cts sedan a radical design that was antithetical to caddys soft old fashioned image now that the first cts has been displaced by the model its clear that even if the original didnt restore cadillac to relevance by itself in fact the escalade sport utility vehicle deserves more credit it did point things in the right direction five years and a few more model introductions later cadillac is arguably gms healthiest brand motor trends editor in chief declared that the new cts "shows detroit can build a world class car to compete with the best munich stuttgart and toyota city have to offer " true enough the cts is now a legitimate competitor to any sub &# sedan on the market the crux of the ctss transformation from challenger to contender is that it has actually become a good looking car while the versions shocking angular lines made its design seem raw and unfinished cadillacs stylists have completed the job with the new model the cts still echoes the blocky rough hewn original but its new skin has more curves particularly in the fenders the front end received a similar softening the combined effect is that the car looks more hunkered down over its wheels with a taut and aggressive stance a new intricate grille more befitting a luxury car enhances the look and draws the eye to a design that is no longer so cold and distant with the exception of a slice of gms infamous gray plastic along the bottoms of the front and rear ends the cts has an entirely unified and aesthetically satisfying appearance inside the improvements are more revolutionary starting with a wholesale upgrade of the materials and design the crowning achievement is an elegant implementation of the navigation system display this large touch screen slides into the center console at the push of a button all but disappearing while i will grudgingly admit there are legitimate reasons for these ugly lcds to have forced their way into our cars their appearance on the dashboard is hardly organic if anything can cause the german auto makers to feel shame for their maladroit efforts at integrating navigation screens the cts can cadillac has clearly set the industry standard under the hood a similar claim can be made but only if you order the optional version of gms liter v this horsepower direct injection gasoline engine uses technology developed for diesel engines to deliver the fuel directly into the combustion chamber allowing for more precise fuel metering and the promise of greater power output with improved fuel economy the motor revs quickly sounds beautiful and gives the cts bona fide sports sedan credentials staking a place amid the crowded field of rear wheel drive luxury sedans with sporting pretensions is a tricky business but cadillac has positioned the new cts almost perfectly to maximize its marketability like the old cts the new one is roughly the size of the bmw series but priced closer to the smaller bmw series its flashier than a mercedes c class more fun to drive than any lexus and more comfortable than either bmw with a base sticker price starting at &# or &# with the direct injection engine the cadillac is a pretty good value but for all the good things the cts brings to the table the car still suffers from being too heavy a common problem with gm vehicles at pounds the direct injection v cts with automatic transmission even outweighs its larger stablemate the cadillac sts competitors use lots of lightweight but expensive aluminum in their cars while gm seems to have adopted the more cynical view that most people care little about how many extra pounds theyre dragging around opting to save money on building the car instead of saving weight this is unfortunate as the ctss performance not to mention its combined epa fuel economy of mpg would benefit if the engineers could cut a couple hundred pounds whats particularly galling is that the ctss heaviness is squandering some of the potential of its great direct injection v even so the cts is a smart likeable car certainly deserving of consideration not that this in itself is really so earth shattering with all its tradition and the vast engineering resources of its parent company cadillac should be building competitive cars motor trends adulation really needs a finer point to it what really impresses about the cts is that it captures gm doing two things for which it historically has shown little capacity the first is continuing to improve a product over successive generations the second is paying attention to details both practices will be far more important to the companys long term success than the fleeting acclaim of this single model
