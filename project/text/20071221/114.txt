weekend journal review film droll elegant sweeney todd is bloody good johnny depp sings too water horse combines fun fantasy and heart tim burtons brilliant blood soaked screen version of "sweeney todd" begins with sticky globules of the red stuff on the wheels and cogs of what can only be gulp a meat grinder by now most audiences know the provenance of the meat and the gist of the ghastly story which remains intact this is not a revisionist plot in which the demon barber of fleet street invents the safety razor for the most part though the machinery of mr burtons production grinds exceedingly fine he and his screenwriter john logan have turned the darkly comical broadway musical into an elegant horror film starring johnny depp and helena bonham carter that takes pleasure in its own theatricality gives pleasure with caustic wit trusts the power of stephen sondheims score and exults in flights of fancy that only a movie can provide one of those flights arrives early when sweeney a grim revenant bent on revenge sings the chilling sondheim song about a hole in the world to make sweeneys point the camera darts and scurries through the victorian streets of a rat infested london thats sinister enough to qualify as a civic black hole johnny depps performance defines the title role for a new generation is there another contemporary actor who could have summoned up so much malevolence in such blithely minimalist style if so his name doesnt come to mind mr depp sings well though hes obviously no broadway baritone projecting to the third balcony and he succeeds at the improbable but essential task of making his tortured slaughterer sympathetic another marvelous set piece turns on comedy its the one that introduces helena bonham carters heedlessly unhygienic pie maker nellie lovett and that ends with mrs lovett terminating a bugs life with a rolling pin a comic spirit is indispensable to any production of "sweeney todd " but especially to this one since mr burton a filmmaker not known to blanch at the sight of blood dispenses it with stunning gusto in great arterial spurts that spirit is embodied not only by the delightfully raffish mrs lovett a hollow eyed rag doll with a rats nest hairdo who knew ms bonham carter had a great song and dance womans sense of timing but by sacha baron cohens sensationally funny pirelli a faker peddling a miracle elixir the rest of the cast is no less expert or enjoyable alan rickman as the vile judge turpin timothy spall as turpins even viler enforcer beadle bamford edward sanders as toby pirellis former assistant jayne wisener as johanna sweeneys long lost daughter and distinguished work has been done by mr burtons collaborators the cinematographer dariusz wolski the production designer dante ferretti the costume designer colleen atwood the editor chris lebenzon but then this film is of an artistic piece a vision of derangement and the seedbed of evil in which it grew i wouldnt have said that of the theater productions ive seen even though the show has been widely admired and endlessly celebrated since it opened on broadway almost three decades ago sweeneys wildly joyous throat slashings on stage always struck me as self conscious and slightly silly and if truth be told i tuned out of the screen version during one stretch of serial killings that finally gives way not a moment too soon to mrs lovetts radiant fantasy of her life with sweeney todd by the beautiful sea that was the only real lapse though for the most part tune outs are impossible like sweeney with his razor tim burtons movie grabs you and wont let go the water horse the water horse legend of the deep" doesnt open until christmas day but this lovely fantasy adventure may well figure in your plans for family entertainment the creature of the title hatched from a magic egg is offered in all unseriousness as the explanation of nessie the loch ness monster thats one of the films many endearing qualities it declines to take itself seriously yet manages sometimes simultaneously to be exciting instructive cheerfully absurd and genuinely affecting the setting is scotland several years into world war ii though most of the movie with its crucially wonderful creature effects was made in new zealand the story is yet another variation on a boy and his dog or a boy and his e t or in a kiwi context a girl and her whale the boy angus macmorrow is played with uncanny grace by year old alex etel he gave a similarly luminous performance three years ago in danny boyles "millions " the strong supporting cast includes ben chaplin who has never been better and emily watson angus knows his beloved father wont return from the war but knowing is one thing and acknowledging is another so its fortunate that the lonely boy finds the magic egg then befriends its emergent contents a hatchling he calls crusoe the little chick is charmingly clownish at first he has trouble distinguishing between a teddy bear and a dangerously live bulldog named churchill but crusoe grows by squirms and bounds into a leviathan supposedly celebrated in celtic legend the movie comes by its animals honestly it was directed by jay russell who did "my dog skip " and adapted by robert nelson jacobs from a book by dick king smith the creator of babe the talking pig "the water horse" isnt perfect and its connection to nessie is a shaggy dog story unto itself but worthwhile family films are in short supply and this one isnt just worthy its alive charlie wilsons war charlie wilsons war" was directed by mike nichols from a script that aaron sorkin adapted from the book by george crile on the star studded face of it this film is what thoughtful audiences should welcome a smart political comedy with the additional advantages of being significant and based on fact or at least on a best seller by an author with strong journalistic credentials and welcomed it may be but not by me i didnt believe a bit of it thanks to the movies style except for some newsreel and documentary footage and even that felt epoxied on tom hanks plays charlie wilson the flamboyant texas democrat who as a member of a congressional appropriations subcommittee in the s organized what was then the biggest covert operation in c i a history channeling billions of dollars to the ultimately successful mujahedeen rebellion against the soviet occupation of afghanistan julia roberts is joanne herring a fervent anti communist and one of the wealthiest women in texas and philip seymour hoffman is agent gust avrokotos who was seen as a misfit by the c i a but proved a master at implementing wilsons war its a fascinating story but mr nichols and his actors never stop reminding us how fascinating it is with the exception of mr hoffman a master of understatement everyone acts up a storm yet context is lacking no mention of the taliban that flourished in the wake of wilsons war not even a clear reference though i might have missed it to wilsons party affiliation maybe the worry about that was losing gop votes at the box office dvd tip how long has it been since you last saw "beetlejuice" if several years have drifted by it may be time to check out tim burtons ghost story again geena davis and alec baldwin are newlyweds killed in a freak accident jeffrey jones catherine ohara and winona ryder are the yuppie parents and bleak faced daughter who move into the newly dead newlyweds house and michael keaton is the majestically gonzo ghost who haunts it
