after the recalls two toy stories for chinese manufacturers product safety concerns bring struggle or shutdowns foshan china theres trouble in toyland some toy makers in southern china where factories turn out many of the worlds playthings are struggling this holiday season after a spate of massive safety related recalls in the u s many companies in this city a major toy manufacturing hub say they are regrouping as customers from america europe and elsewhere have canceled postponed or trimmed orders in response some are scrambling to tighten standards and step up testing to reassure western buyers others are looking to boost sales to russia the middle east and other less regulated developing markets "its very difficult to do business now " says deng xiling a sales manager at foshan city nanhai jiujiang calux plastic factory which makes plastic components for toys "customers require such strict testing that its not profitable " ms deng says her company decided to shut its painted toy operations after unsafe lead levels were found in paint used by a nearby factory that supplied toys recalled by mattel inc she fears her company could inadvertently receive tainted supplies as well the company laid off of its work force and expects sales to fall by to next year for the chinese toy industry product safety concerns have piled on top of other challenges wage and raw material costs have been rising sharply in recent years while the appreciation of the chinese currency the yuan against the dollar since july has made chinese goods more expensive in dollar terms these combined pressures have forced hundreds of toy makers in guangdong province home to foshan to close since the summer and toy executives say there is mounting evidence that the big trading companies that act as middlemen for western buyers are looking elsewhere especially vietnam where costs can be lower "generally speaking made in china is getting less competitive " says gu wu president of hk shenzhen industries development co a maker of radio controlled toys "people are afraid of any problems " mr gu says "its not only u s orders that are falling but european orders are also coming more slowly " millions of toys manufactured in china have been recalled this year for safety problems some resulting from design flaws that occurred outside china some from production problems in china such as unsafe levels of lead in paint the problems werent confined to mattel major players like rc corp toys "r" us inc marvel entertainment inc among others were forced to recall their toys but the business picture is mixed overall u s toy sales dont appear to be affected and chinese toy exports are up this year but big orders are placed far in advance so any visible shift in trade figures would take time meaning the statistics may not yet reflect the full toll pre ordered toy exports from foshan to the u s in the first nine months of the year were up compared with the period a significant slowdown from the growth rate posted the year before overall the citys toy exports to all countries were up nearly from january to september for guangdong province toy export growth began to slow in june but remains strong in october toy exports were up nearly from october one thing however is already clear toy makers profit margins are likely to shrink and retail toy prices are likely to rise as the money manufacturers spend on safety and quality checks increases stanley wong vice chairman of foshan dayi toy co which makes plastic electronic and stuffed toys says the company is raising its prices by about to cover increased testing ordered by customers including mattel and wal mart stores inc other companies in foshan say they are raising prices by about "in the past customers bringing in small orders usually had no requirements on testing " says chen zebin an executive at the foshan nanhai yanbu yuexing toy and garment factory "now they want testing for every piece " some toy makers complain foreign buyers are proving unwilling to cover the higher costs of ensuring that quality and safety standards are met "customers wont accept price increases " says zhu wenyan business manager of stuffed toy maker i j unit co in foshan "we are making no profits " the factory involved in the first mattel recall in august of fisher price toys possibly containing lead paint foshan lee der toy co has shut down entirely the plant office is secured with a yellow bicycle lock boxes of fisher price toys for toddlers can be seen stacked in the warehouse the factorys owner killed himself after the recall and the company laid off hundreds of workers their concrete dormitory on the factory grounds stands empty many other factories say they are weathering the storm mattels largest chinese supplier zhongmei toy co also in foshan says it has seen no decline in business since the recalls a red banner draped across its headquarters building says new workers are needed mattels handling of a series of recalls of chinese made toys which began in august has caused consternation among many chinese toy executives who feel that the u s company the worlds largest toy seller unfairly tarnished the reputation of chinese suppliers executives from mattel who have said some of the recalled toys had design flaws apologized to chinese government officials and the public in september but criticism of mattel remains strong among industry executives in guangdong and tensions are high at a toy factory that supplies mattel men in yellow mattel windbreakers and others with mattel identification badges tried to prevent a wall street journal reporter and researcher from talking to factory workers on the street in foshan two officials of the local public security bureau who said they had been summoned by the toy company then detained the reporter and researcher for about an hour in an office at the factory a mattel spokeswoman in the u s wrote in an email that it isnt company policy to prevent reporters from speaking with employees on public property relations between buyers and suppliers are becoming more contentious chinese executives say as both sides seek to protect themselves from potential safety problems foreign companies are trying to insist that factories accept legal responsibility for flaws while chinese manufacturers are looking to outside experts to certify that customers designs are safe carter keithley president of the toy industry association a u s trade group couldnt comment on the specifics but said the relationship between suppliers and american companies had likely become more strained over the summer "many companies are under a lot of pressure to survive " says mr gu of hk shenzhen industries which makes relatively high end remote control toys "in the past a lot of companies didnt really know what was expected" in foreign markets he says "everyone is trying to learn it just takes time " nicholas casey in los angeles and ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article see related article "in the u s playthings stay on customer shopping lists parents couldnt care less" wsj dec
