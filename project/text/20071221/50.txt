leap of faith as pigs in pokes go the democratic party bought itself a big one in michael dukakis was relatively unknown but he was also the last man standing only too late did his party along with the rest of the country realize mr dukakis was a typecast liberal a furlougher of felons and a guy who looked mighty awkward in a tank this is what happens when a party takes a flyer and it could be republicans turn with mike huckabee the former baptist minister and governor of arkansas is surging in iowa and is tied with rudy giuliani in national polls hes selling his party on a simple message hes not those other guys with their flip flops and different faiths and dicey social positions as to what mr huckabee is thats as unknown to most voters as the almighty himself mr huckabee is starting to get a look see by the press though whether the nation will have time to absorb the findings before the primaries is just as unknown the small amount that has been unearthed so far ought to have primary voters nervous it isnt just that mr huckabee is far from a traditional conservative hes a potential ethical time bomb on policy mr huckabees tenure in arkansas has shown him to be ambivalent about tax increases variously supporting sales tax hikes cigarette and gasoline taxes and internet taxes spending increased from to three times the rate of inflation hes so lackluster on education reform that he recently received an endorsement from the new hampshire affiliate of the national education association the first ever of a gop candidate the union cited mr huckabees opposition to school vouchers mr huckabee is a fan of greater subsidies for farmers and "clean energy " hes proven himself a political neophyte on foreign policy joining democrats to skewer president bush and glorify the "diplomacy diplomacy diplomacy" line most of this is out there thoroughly documented and even now slowly filtering its way to voters of more concern is what has not yet been discovered about mr huckabees time as arkansas lieutenant governor and governor in particular on ethical issues there are signs that mr huckabees background borne of the same arkansas establishment that produced bill clinton is ripe to provide the sort of pop up political scandal that could derail a general election campaign in arkansas mr huckabee was investigated by the state ethics committee at least times most of the complaints centered on what appears to be a serial disregard for government rules about gifts and outside financial compensation he reported &# worth of gifts in one year alone nearly double his &# salary five of the investigations resulted in admonishments two for failing to report gifts one was later overturned the other three for some &# that mr huckabee and his wife received but failed to initially report one of these admonishments involved a &# payment to mr huckabee from an opaque organization called action america that he helped found in while lieutenant governor and that was designed to coordinate his speeches and supplement his income mr huckabee caused an uproar when he used a &# account intended to maintain the governors mansion for personal expenses including restaurant meals dry cleaning and boat supplies he also faced a lawsuit over his assertion that &# worth of furniture donated to the mansion was his to keep sprinkled among all this are complaints about the misuse of state planes and campaign funds mistakes on financial disclosure forms and fights over documents related to ethics investigations any one of these episodes individually may appear penny ante but they add up to a disturbing pattern people ive spoken with who worked with mr huckabee in arkansas dispute the idea that he is "corrupt " they instead ascribe his ethical mishaps to a "blind spot" rooted in his beginnings as a baptist minister and a southern culture of gift giving they suggest he never made the mental transition to public office some will also argue mr huckabee is no more ethically challenged than mr giuliani who is getting pounded with questions about judith nathans security detail and giuliani partner clients the difference is that hizzoner is a celebrity whose past bones were long ago picked clean by the media crows even the nathan flap is an extension of news that made the rounds five years ago the obscure governor from arkansas is in contrast a deep sea for media diving most recent have been stories about his pardons and commutations as well as the news that r j reynolds contributed to action america mr huckabee who now wants a national smoking ban in public places responded that he never knew he accepted tobacco money which has inspired a former adviser to claim mr huckabee is being "less than truthful " whats next the gop is still reeling from its financial scandals which helped democrats tag the party with a "culture of corruption" in last years congressional races a huckabee nomination would also neutralize one of the biggest weapons against nominee hillary clinton her own ethically tortured past if the subject came up at all it would be a race to the arkansas bottom a matchup with barack obama could be worse since the "politics of hope" senator has so far avoided scandal and could bludgeon mr huckabee on his past democrats know it heres an interesting statistic since the beginning of the democratic national committee has released direct attacks on mitt romney rudy giuliani has warranted john mccain fred thompson mike huckabee four the most recent of these landed back in march gop voters may not have examined mr huckabees record but the left has and they love what they see so far gop voters do too most appear attracted to mr huckabees image as a "sincere" and "genuine" guy the former governor may be both of those but hes also got a past voters are going to want to look before they leap
