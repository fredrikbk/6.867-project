one man gridlock meet tom coburn senates dr no oklahoma conservative specializes in the hold stopping bills in washington on tuesday afternoon when most senators were preparing to leave washington for the holiday recess tom coburn was declaring his intention to stick around "the floors going to be open " said the year old oklahoma republican "im going to have to be here to try to stop stuff " stopping stuff is sen coburns specialty in a congress that has had trouble passing even the simplest legislation sen coburn who proudly wears the nickname "dr no " is a one man gridlock machine this year the senator who indeed is a medical doctor single handedly blocked or slowed more than bills driving lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to distraction he blocked a ban on genetic discrimination by health insurers he thwarted a bill to set up a program to track patients with lou gehrigs disease also nixed an effort to promote safe internet use by children and a resolution to honor the late environmentalist rachel carson on the th anniversary of her birth a bill that would authorize government mapping of the ocean floor and coastal areas no way one that would require more data collection on the availability and quality of broadband service uh uh if dr coburn had his way there would be no new funding for a justice department office to investigate unsolved civil rights era killings no promotion of wild land firefighter safety sometimes dr coburn an obstetrician who sees patients one morning a week disagrees with the proposals as a fiscal conservative he usually objects to what he sees as excess spending sometimes he just wants to force a debate or improve on items that would otherwise fly through the senate in a crowded legislative calendar not everything gets the scrutiny voters might imagine dr coburns weapon of choice is the "hold " a procedural maneuver that allows a single senator to prevent a bill from being passed quickly without a roll call vote or floor debate until a rule change this year senators could keep their holds secret and they usually did dr coburn notifies colleagues about his intentions to keep track dr coburn has four manila cards in the pocket of his suit coat he pulls out the list printed in tiny type on both sides whenever colleagues approach to discuss their bills in his offices intranet which staffers jokingly call the "write wing portal " theres a section for aides to look at bills that have incurred their bosss displeasure john kerry the massachusetts democrat and presidential nominee had several bills blocked by sen coburn this year one would help military veterans and reservists with small businesses dr coburn said it duplicated another program another would expand government backed venture capital investment in small business "i cant imagine the government can be good at it " dr coburn said negotiations between the two men stretched into tuesday night as the senate tried to finish tax legislation and a mammoth spending bill dr coburns remaining issues were "this point that point the other point " complained sen kerry "you cant have a one person committee for every single bill that goes through the u s congress youd never get anything done " dr coburn first ran for a seat in the house in prompted by his opposition to the clinton health care plan he was part of a wave of republican freshmen who promised to shake up the system and cut government waste he became an irritant to democrats and republicans alike in he delayed passage of a republican backed appropriations bill by proposing amendments in dr coburn kept a campaign promise to leave after three terms he returned to muskogee to be with his wife carolyn who was miss oklahoma of and to treat patients but dr coburn made another run in entering a senate race relatively late sent back to washington he started pushing pet topics one of which is to warn of the dangers of sex in the past he has held a slide show for young staffers depicting the effects of sexually transmitted diseases and the consequences of sex outside marriage in february after the democrats took over dr coburn wrote to his colleagues warning of his intention to block fast track passage unless his "common sense principles" were met which included new programs cant duplicate existing ones and new spending should be offset with other cuts "i think its good for our leadership to know theres a very vocal and effective right flank in our party and that can be used in negotiations with democrats " says republican sen jim demint of south carolina a conservative who often works closely with dr coburn the alliance with mr demint didnt keep dr coburn from slapping a hold on a bill mr demint supports the one that would set up a government registry to track people with lou gehrigs disease also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mr demint is one of senators sponsoring the bill "hes a physician and hes going to have his opinion on that " says sen demint who says he thinks he can win over his colleague this month dr coburn sent out a letter encouraging senators to talk to him about legislation they wanted to complete that had some democrats muttering about a "tyranny of one " last week senate democrats took to the floor complaining about republican tactics which senate majority leader harry reid called "obstruction on steroids " they pointed to the lack of action in several areas stymied by dr coburn including the lou gehrig bill "just give us a chance to bring that up on the senate floor " pleaded sen dick durbin of illinois who is the majority whip "how much time would it take thirty minutes " mr reid calling dr coburns tactics "unreasonable " said when the senate returns next year he plans to combine a number of blocked bills and bring the package to a vote dr coburn says he isnt to blame for slow progress democrats used too much floor time debating the iraq war he says and tried to move too many bills on the fast track he notes he didnt try to stop the spending bill the only legislation congress technically must pass in order to keep the government running as congress wound down dr no started to act a bit like dr maybe after winning some changes he agreed to let one of the kerry bills pass dr coburn dropped objections to giving the federal housing administration leeway to insure more troubled mortgages a key part of the administrations response to the housing crisis "i lost " dr coburn says "i decided because of the severity of the problem we face i cant win that point but i can at least debate it "
