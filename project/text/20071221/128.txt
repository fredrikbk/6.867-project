why a cable tv network is hiring the ink stained long the home of razzle dazzle tv highlights espn has been stocking up on reporters notebooks and ballpoint pens for more than a year now the walt disney co controlled enterprise has been raiding news organizations for sports journalists from big name players like columnist rick reilly of sports illustrated to behind the scenes talent like kristin huckshorn former deputy sports editor at the new york times and now a senior news editor overseeing espns new newsmagazine show "e " it has been a good time for poaching as newspapers and magazines struggle with declining revenue and cutbacks espn is still awash in tv money but this is more than a competitive shopping spree it is a step toward reinventing the franchise for years cable pioneers built empires by offering viewers distinct round the clock points of view and atmosphere rather than a collection of disparate programs mtv hbo and espn became great brands worth billions of dollars espn was unique in that it successfully moved into print with a magazine and the internet where espn com is one of the strongest sites on the web the brand espn created was a fun irreverent locker room driven by the highlights and hijinks of "sportscenter " which it aired several times a day updating all the while but as video begins to explode on the internet the highlight formula is showing signs of plateauing sports fans can go elsewhere to catch up on the days games and especially to indulge their local team loyalties tv ratings have flattened out and internet upstarts are luring away young sports fans who grew up with espn as part of the sports establishment meanwhile the high rates espn has commanded with cable operators for their channels the highest in tv cant sustain their earlier rate of growth so to remain the self proclaimed "worldwide leader in sports " the network is bulking up on content that is harder to duplicate rather than just introducing game video the idea is to serve up breaking news and expert analysis aggressively blanketing tv the internet the magazine and even cellphones in the new internet fed landscape a two minute video can be just as important and the espn brand isnt enough it needs individual go to names like mr reilly or espns existing web star "sports guy" columnist bill simmons "as more money moves towards the internet youre going to have to have talent " says john skipper espns executive vice president for content "the talent is going to have to come from traditional media " someone like mr reilly he says is worth a lot in such an environment "content is increasingly valuable particularly differentiating content there just are not that many guys who can provide that " take the networks recent coverage of major league baseballs steroid scandal keyed around the release of former u s sen george mitchells report on the subject after weeks of planning and buildup the coverage started in earnest dec two days before the reports release with a word piece by howard bryant a recent arrival from the washington post he spent two months reporting and writing about doubts within the baseball community about the transparency of mr mitchells investigation on the night of dec recently hired writers t j quinn and mark fainaru wada who broke big steroid news for respectively the new york daily news and the san francisco chronicle correctly forecast what fans could expect from the report espn the magazines longtime steroid expert shaun assael author of "steroid nation" followed the next morning with one of the first reports that mr mitchell would name star pitcher roger clemens a story he dictated from the back of a taxi according to espn com editor in chief rob king during the course of the day espn sent continuous updates on the story to the "crawl" at the bottom of its tv channels as well as mobile alerts informing fans of when to watch relevant press conferences and where to download the report espn says it registered million page views for its main story and close to one million downloads of the report it says an average well trafficked story on the site draws page views once the report was released espn had two teams of readers including one group of eight editors in its bristol conn headquarters digesting its contents and setting up guides on where in the report fans could find specific players and a glossary of terms until last year espn had been heading in a different direction led by executive mark shapiro the network pushed to develop original programming such as a reality show starring barry bonds and a racy drama "playmakers " some felt the journalistic part of the company took more of a back seat mr shapiro vigorously disagrees now president and chief executive officer of six flags inc he said in a statement that "journalism was my priority at espn " when mr shapiro left in mr skipper and john walsh executive vice president and executive editor began sharpening the news focus and mr skipper says there are no plans for more fictional movies before shepherding the launch of espn the magazine mr skipper ran disneys magazine and book publishing

and sports illustrated football writer jeffri chadiha along with editors such as dwayne bray of the dallas morning news and larry starks of the st louis post dispatch espn is using its tv money to outbid its smaller ink counterparts the company can promise salaries well into the six figures and tempt print reporters with tv airtime to help make them national household names just as it did with writers like sports illustrateds peter gammons after hiring him full time in the early s after twice failing to hire sports illustrateds mr reilly espn in october hired him away for a salary of more than &# million a year some espn executives believe that a writer like mr reilly known for columns that are heavy on human interest and humor might resonate strongly among women and more casual fans whom they want to attract "its like theyre running all over the sports landscape trying to money whip everybody into their barn " says terry mcdonell editor of sports illustrated espns cable tv operation is still a juggernaut it charges cable operators more than &# per subscriber per month an industry high that will jump to &# in according to derek baine senior analyst at snl kagan mr baine values espn at close to &# billion but the networks year to date ratings are down from a year ago the average number of households tuned into espn in declined in prime time and for the full day through last week after climbing over a similar period between and according to nielsen media research some of its brand extensions have failed a much touted mobile phone service went bust last year
