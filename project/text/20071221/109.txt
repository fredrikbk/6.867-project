weekend journal college footballs weirdest year ever as the bowls begin russell adams dissects a season of historic upsets dedicated fans of college football are conditioned to expect the unexpected the fates of their teams after all rest with teenagers who practice relatively little and perform in front of hostile crowds stuff happens but even by its own unpredictable standards college football this season has been totally nuts and bowl season figures to be even nuttier since according to las vegas oddsmakers only four teams that were underdogs of points or more have ended up winning and two of them did so this year on six different weekends this fall the second best team in the country lost to an unranked opponent heading into december west virginia needed only one more victory to play for the national championship and promptly lost to pittsburgh a team it was supposed to beat by four touchdowns "ive never seen anything like it " says mike seba a senior oddsmaker for las vegas sports consultants which sets point spreads for casinos in las vegas "anybody can win now its just incredible " the last college football season to see more than one major shocker was when oregon state beat washington and texas el paso beat brigham young in games where both winners were more than point underdogs but according to handicappers two of the three largest point spread upsets in the last years happened this season and that doesnt include what was arguably the biggest upset of all in september appalachian state which plays in the football championship subdivision formerly division i aa traveled to ann arbor and beat the then no ranked michigan wolverines the winningest team in college football history most casinos didnt even take bets on the game perhaps nothing has leveled the playing field in college football more than the emergence of pass oriented offenses like the "spread " a system that uses as many as five wide receivers at once in previous eras when teams ran the football on most plays the team with the deeper talent pool almost always won as more teams adopt this go for broke strategy its becoming easier for one or two particularly gifted players like a quarterback to have a bigger impact on the outcome teams that run the spread including appalachian state louisiana monroe and illinois were responsible for many of the years biggest upsets scholarship restrictions implemented by the ncaa in have helped to prevent elite schools from hoarding the best players the way they once did while the increasing number of outlets broadcasting college games has put more schools on television which helps immensely with recruiting richer tv rights deals and bowl game purses have also persuaded more schools to invest in their football programs no upset was more dramatic than stanfords one point victory over then no ranked usc in october at the los angeles coliseum over the past decade usc has won more than of its home games while stanford has lost almost two thirds of its road games in the last five years usc has had players selected in the first two rounds of the nfl draft while stanford has had two but with under a minute to play and his team down by six points stanford quarterback tavita pritchard who was making his first start found a rare advantage against the usc defense his primary receiver mark bradford was the only stanford player on the field who had been ranked among the top high school players in the country by the recruiting site rivals com the usc player who was covering him cornerback mozique mccurtis was one of the few trojans in the game who had not been a top recruit mr bradford caught a pass for the game winning touchdown stanford head coach jim harbaugh confessed that before the game he figured his team would be hard pressed to advance the ball yards let alone win "i just knew it was going to be tough to pick up a first down " he says as bowl season kicks into gear oddsmakers are bracing for more turbulence the bowls they say have always been less predictable than the regular season thanks to the long layoffs teams have the neutral fields they play on and the general lack of familiarity with opponents this seasons rash of upsets has narrowed the margins between elite teams and also rans and made it more difficult to handicap games even ohio state and lsu the teams playing in the bcs national championship game on jan lost to unranked teams this season "i expect a lot more upsets " says leo shafto a football oddsmaker for betus com an online sportsbook so what was this seasons biggest upset one obvious contender is kansas states shellacking of texas in austin the wildcats were point underdogs but ended up winning the game by creating a remarkable point swing illinois defeat of then no ohio state in columbus last month ranks near the top in the last years illinois has won only of its road games while the buckeyes have won of their games at home another measure is how the teams were ranked at game time when syracuse beat louisville on sept ken massey a statistician whose ratings help determine the bcs champion had syracuse ranked no in the country and louisville no one of the largest gaps any team has overcome this season jeff sagarin a former stock analyst in indiana whose ratings are also used by the bcs says the best way to gauge an upset is to compare the two teams statistics after the full season according to mr sagarins formula the years most surprising game was stanfords upending of usc the trojans final sagarin rating of was higher than the cardinals this analysis is confirmed by another measure the closing las vegas point spread on the game according to lvsc the spread for stanford usc basically a rough measure of how many points bettors think the favorite should win by gave usc a whopping point advantage that stanford actually won the game is a fact many bettors are still trying to comprehend the difference in prestige between two football programs can make an upset more significant one way to measure a schools football reputation beyond its record over the last decade is to count the number of top high school recruits it has attracted and the number of players who have been taken in the nfl draft virginias thumping of miami at the orange bowl is a good example in the last five years miami has had top football recruits according to rivals com while virginia has had only six miami has had players selected in the first round of the nfl draft over that time compared with virginias two then theres the question of the difference in the programs financial resources when louisiana monroe beat alabama at home by seven points in november it was nothing short of a fiscal miracle louisiana monroes total football expenses last season were &# million according to the u s education department thats about &# million less than alabamas but heres the real mismatch alabamas new head coach nick saban earns &# million a year the highest salary in major college football louisiana monroes coach charlie weatherbie earns &# which is one of the lowest salaries that means mr saban makes more in two weeks than mr weatherbie earns in a year
