apple rumor site to close as part of deal firm still wont know who leaked secrets is it a victory for jobs when apple inc sued a harvard university freshman nicholas ciarelli nearly three years ago it wanted the names of sources for some juicy scoops about still secret apple products he had published on his apple news and rumor web site think secret the suit sparked accusations that chief executive steve jobs was in essence attempting to censor a member of the modern digital press mr jobs never received the names of mr ciarellis sources but yesterday he obtained part of what he wanted think secret will stop publishing as part of a settlement mr ciarelli and apple announced still while mr jobs has now lost an online gadfly it isnt clear whether he really won his battle against mr ciarelli or what the case says about press freedoms in the internet era the settlement is curious because by all appearances mr ciarelli was winning the case that apple filed against him in early in california superior court in santa clara county in which it alleged that mr ciarelli had published trade secrets about unannounced apple products after mr ciarelli several months later filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on first amendment grounds apple effectively stopped litigating the case said terry gross the san francisco attorney who represents mr ciarelli "obviously the reason they were doing that is they knew they would lose " mr gross says indeed mr ciarelli now a senior at harvard said in an interview that he is shutting down the site because he has other career interests mr ciarelli suggests he was ready to quit anyway "ive been running the site since i was thirteen " mr ciarelli now years old said "ive been ready to move on now i have that opportunity " mr ciarelli declined to say whether he had received a cash payment from apple as part of their agreement though he said he was "very satisfied" with the terms of the settlement an apple spokesman steve dowling also declined to comment on the terms of the settlement "we are pleased to reach this amicable settlement and happy to have this behind us " mr dowling said the settlement brings to an end a long running legal battle that sparked controversy over press freedoms in an era when independent internet journalists sometimes face pressure from companies over their reporting on corporate news apple based in cupertino calif has been among the most aggressive in seeking to quash internet leaks about coming products in part because of the large and active community of rumor and news sites devoted to chronicling the companys every move mr ciarellis web site was often a major irritant particularly at this time of year during the first half of january every year apple unveils an array of new products at the macworld conference in san francisco in the weeks leading up to the conference apple news and rumor sites are often atwitter with speculation about what mr jobs will unveil at the event while the rumors are sometimes off base think secrets sources were often dead on for example in the days before apple filed its lawsuit against think secret mr ciarelli published a story predicting apple would introduce a low cost version of its macintosh computer without a monitor mr jobs in fact unveiled such a product the mac mini at macworld that year apples mr jobs is known to be a stickler for secrecy believing that it greatly amplifies the publicity and market impact of new apple products when the products are released a master of corporate showmanship he often teases his audiences with the line "one more thing " before announcing another series of surprises mr jobs for a time seemed committed to stanching the flow of leaks onto rumor sites around the time apple filed suit against think secret the company also sued several unnamed individuals in california state court in santa clara county the company said the individuals called "john does " had allegedly leaked word to the rumor sites powerpage and appleinsider about an apple product code named asteroid that was designed to let users plug musical instruments into their macs apple had subpoenaed the rumor sites for their sources of information though an appeals court denied that motion when asked about the lawsuits onstage at a wall street journal conference several months after they were filed mr jobs said he would pursue the cases all the way to the supreme court if necessary kurt opsahl an attorney at the online civil liberties organization electronic frontier foundation said "it would be surprising if apple didnt include a payment as part of the settlement given the bargaining position" of mr ciarelli mr opsahl helped mr ciarelli find his attorney in the apple case though he says he isnt privy to the details of the settlement earlier this year a california judge ordered apple to pay more than &# in attorneys fees incurred by powerpage and appleinsider as part of the separate lawsuit by apple mr opsahl was one of the attorneys representing those sites mr opsahl for one said he sees the decision to shut down think secret as a personal one by mr ciarelli not a victory for apple "it doesnt worry me too much the free speech implications of this " he said "there are plenty of rumor sites out there " mr ciarelli said his career plans are unclear but that they might include a future in journalism he said the settlement will also give him more flexibility to do a start up company if he chooses that path mr ciarelli has been both a reporter and editor for the harvard crimson the colleges newspaper throughout the lawsuit
