weekend journal taste houses of worship free christmas nothing chills the heart like seeing ones children punch drunk from visiting a succession of relatives over the holidays rip into presents like lions attacking a gazelle on one of those nature channel shows my family is facing a holiday dilemma which is how to disentangle ourselves from dysfunctional traditions like those of many young families we know our traditions entail juggling schedules to make relatives happy administering long greeting card lists buying trinkets for co workers and neighbors and wondering whether hell might not be housed in a shopping mall replete with muzak christmas ditties and endless viewings of "the santa clause " something is dreadfully wrong before we were married my wife and i discussed the old fashioned christmases wed one day celebrate we planned to carol make cookies with our children and teach them the true spirit of the season by serving the poor but somehow the holidays became for us a season when we have neither the time nor the inclination to celebrate we turned like many friends into variants of scrooge instead of ignoring the holiday we were bah humbugging our way through parties and meals and endless rounds of shopping one can almost empathize with the puritans whose ban on christmas had nothing to do with insipid greeting cards and everything to do with the holidays pagan roots and roman catholic imprimatur "whichever way one wants to slice it the end result is a net gain for the devil " asserts modern day pilgrim ralph ovadal pastor of pilgrims covenant church in monroe wis i dont know about his theology but the good reverend certainly sounds as if hes seen his share of holiday traffic but skipping christmas as two characters in john grishams delightful novella by that name attempt to do feels like surrender surely someone somewhere has found a way to make this season what the songs promise the christmas stories in washington irvings "the sketch book of geoffrey crayon" are credited with generating nostalgia for a style of holiday that america had never widely known a nostalgia furthered by charles dickenss "a christmas carol " these classics helped birth one of the first american instances of yearning for a nonexistent past for a time when as irving wrote "the world was more home bred social and joyous than at present " thats where my wife and i find ourselves pining for traditions we werent bequeathed and loathing the practices we have church historian jaroslav pelikans distinction is apt "tradition is the living faith of the dead traditionalism is the dead faith of the living " the way weve done holidays leaves us feeling like the living dead mr pelikan favored goethes admonition "take what you have inherited from your fathers and work to make it your own " presumably that doesnt include drinking oneself to sleep on christmas eve and watching television the entire next day a fatherly tradition in more than one household i knew as a kid this business of transmitting tradition can be treacherous but this season does evoke some ideals worth considering there is for example this notion of peace on earth which seems at odds with carting ones children halfway across the country when we get there we argue with various relatives about whether our time is being fairly distributed among a host of people who arent on speaking terms and why our children cant have toys that make electronic noises and why we wont stay with anyone who has live in cats there is likewise the tradition of giving which somehow became an escalating arms race of toys between various family factions with our children as the greedy beneficiaries we are no better even with strangers we are mortified at the thought of anyone the mailman the old lady down the street those charities that send you labels this time of year with your address on them giving us a gift without reciprocation we even stock emergency gifts wine glass ornaments copies of the aforementioned grisham novella oh the irony replete with blank labels on which to surreptitiously scribble the unexpected givers name but we realize that we must choose between furthering a malfunctioning traditionalism and cultivating deliberate traditions that we hope will flourish in the hearts of our children so this year were doing things differently for starters we will stay where we live rather than trek back to our home state we love our families but our days of re enacting santas frantic house to house dash are over were also scaling back on gifts our former co workers and cousins second wives are all very nice people but its time to stop the madness the same goes for our burgeoning card list with its fine gradations "should the walkers get a card with a picture or a letter or just a signature would the goldsteins prefer a hanukkah card or something generic " this holiday we are unilaterally disarming no matter how many acquaintances inundate us with starbucks gift cards and pepperidge farm sampler baskets we will not retaliate instead were going to make cookies sugar cookies and chocolate chip cookies and gingerbread cookies we might give some away but solely on the spur of the moment and without consulting a gift list while other people throw elbows in last minute shopping kerfuffles well be driving through neighborhoods looking at lights every night during advent weve read stories from the old and new testaments and our children have hung handmade ornaments representing these stories this week they gave a musical recital in a nursing home and if i can work up the nerve we may even go caroling will we succeed in making this season mean something to our children besides gifts and harried schedules i dont know but recently we received a solicitation from the ronald mcdonald house which lodges families of hospitalized children our year old read it a serious look on his face then he announced he was giving them the &# hed saved toward a robot "it makes me feel better when i give to someone else " he said "than when someone gives things to me " maybe its not a matter after all of engendering the christmas spirit out of nothing maybe the challenge with children is just to keep the trappings of the holidays from squashing the spirit thats already there mr woodliefs pamphlet "raising wild boys into men a modern dads survival guide " is available from the new pamphleteer
