weekend journal tastings the best wine bargains of where to find great deals nine bottles for &# or less just because something is inexpensive doesnt make it a good deal in our real lives we all know that that beef on sale might be fatty that cheap golf ball might not fly well and that bargain priced toy might be full of lead its the same thing with wine many of the low priced wines on shelves these days arent good values at any price because they arent pleasing theyre made in industrial quantities from watery grapes and taste more like some sugar alcohol concoction than wine this is especially true of the most popular varietals the hot sellers such as merlot and chardonnay in a tasting early this year of american chardonnay under &# for instance only six of almost wines rated good or better thats nuts at the same time though there have never been as many genuinely good wines available at low prices the trick in most cases is to look beyond the usual suspects the world right now is awash in wine as country after country from austria to uruguay improves its winemaking and seeks to compete in the international marketplace we went back over our blind tastings for to see how many wines that cost &# or less rated very good or better there were nine as we looked them over we were reminded again how important it is to search for bargains in unexpected places in the wine store here are those nine wines it would not be a good idea to look for these specific labels at this point because we wrote about them some time ago some really early in the year what weve tried to do is use them as examples to point you to larger categories that might be useful to keep in mind as you look for bargains in the coming year in one case as youll see the point is that regardless of what we think there are always exceptions also because this list is based on our blind tastings during some of todays great bargains chilean sauvignon blanc which we wrote about in for instance arent included in addition we found in a tasting that malbec from argentina continues to be a great deal overall three of our eight favorites cost less than &# though none rated very good or higher so they dont appear on this list having already concluded a couple of tastings for january columns we can assure you this list will be different next year powers winery muscat canelli columbia valley &# and maddalena vineyards muscat canelli paso robles &# in general sweet wines tend to be underpriced because theyre not very popular muscat canelli is a lovely fresh light sweet wine thats perfect for guests after a big meal in our tasting we generally found the wines beautifully made and as charming as a smile especially considering the low prices you really should think about taking a gamble on a muscat canelli even if youre sure you dont like sweet wines torres de anguix "barrica" ribera del duero &# if you are looking for bargains well made interesting wines at good prices you need to spend some time in the spain aisle of your wine store and this is just one example this was one of the most outrageous bargains of the year we wrote that it was "earthy and soulful with fine structure and medium weight highly drinkable and interesting and just about bursting with blueberry like fruit " ribera del duero is available at all price points but we found that it was a good value up and down the ladder and is definitely a wine to look for bodegas muga rose rioja &# toad hollow cellars "eye of the toad" dry pinot noir rose sonoma county &# chateau doupia rose minervois &# rose is suddenly very popular which is both good news and bad news the bad news we found in a tasting is that some wineries are trying to take advantage of its popularity by selling sweet simple and cynical rose exactly the kind of stuff that turned people off to rose in the first place and could kill this nascent trend the good news is that there are still quite a few excellent tasty dry roses on shelves from all over the world these three are from spain france and the u s american vintners have come a very long way in rose in a short time and spains roses have impressed us for some time but our blind tasting showed that the french still have a very special touch with rose and in a hurry or a jam thats where wed look for a lively dry rose geyser peak winery sauvignon blanc california &# this is a golden age for sauvignon blanc with excellent examples coming from just about everywhere from new zealand to chile to south africa with all of the competition its no surprise that there are some bargains to be had we think american sauvignon blanc has found a great middle ground with some of the weight of sancerre and some of the mouth popping liveliness of new zealand sauvignon blanc as we wrote about the geyser peak one of our long time favorites it "tastes true" and that is high praise for any wine georges duboeuf julienas &# whenever we talk about bargain wines we always note that there are some classics and our best examples are always beaujolais and muscadet from france we didnt conduct a tasting of muscadet this year but we did try a large sampling of beaujolais from the villages we found the wines delightful and excellent bargains but none more so than this julienas from duboeuf which we described as a "big earthy wine that could stand up to a steak chewy and complete dignified and serious yet with lively fruit at the core " not bad for &# in the coming year we would urge you to look for beaujolais from the villages brouilly chenas chiroubles cote de brouilly fleurie julienas morgon moulin a vent regnie and saint amour these are consistently some of the most effortlessly charming wines on shelves penfolds wines "koonunga hill" shiraz south eastern australia &# this is the exception over the past several years we have been disappointed with australian shiraz under &# in our tasting this year we found that the vast majority of the wines continued to be simple sweet and lacking charm but on the plus side the best of the under &# wines were better than in past years and this was the most notable example a wine that we described as "dark and rich with real depth serious wine with good spices " we certainly hope we find more shiraz like this in the future next week the delicious wines of melanie grayce west contributed to this column
