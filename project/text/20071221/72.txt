polls aside bush ends year with victories washington president bush is ending the year with the approval of just one in three voters according to the wall street journal nbc poll but he is enjoying a string of legislative successes in congress on matters from iraq war funding and the federal budget to energy policy tax increases and mortgage relief bush aides believe they benefited from overreaching by democrats flush with their election victory the white house began the year by laying out relatively modest goals on issues like energy and federal spending they clung to those goals even as some republicans in congress wavered white house officials wagered that voters care about concrete results and ultimately would blame congress not the white house if results failed to appear that made their hard line negotiating more effective as the year wore on democrats became more eager to reach accords on issues such as energy after the thanksgiving break administration officials said meanwhile with each victory on war funding on foreign intelligence wiretapping and on the proposed expansion of a childrens health insurance program republicans on capitol hill gained more confidence "i leave the year feeling good about our capacity to get some important things done " mr bush said yesterday at a news conference meeting with reporters this week speaker nancy pelosi said democrats might have raised expectations too high in their attempts to cut off iraq war funding some top democrats said they were surprised mr bush refused to cave in and negotiate a deal on childrens health democrats rejected comparisons with the republican congress of which famously overreached in its clashes with the clinton administration democrats also dismissed the white house view that mr bushs determination helped congressional republicans regain their political footing "heres the problem when people say they want a change the reference point is from george bush " said rep rahm emanuel the house democratic caucus chairman and a top party strategist "and now the republicans have decided to get closer in the photo to george bush i will pay their cab fare every day for them to go to the white house to do that ill rent the bus so the whole caucus can go " white house aides said they are developing contingency plans for next year aimed at shoring up the economy if necessary and perhaps at sweetening voters sour mood about their finances the nature and extent of administration proposals depend in part on whether the economy weakens as some experts predict but two possible prescriptions could include new health care proposals and mr bushs trademark tax cuts the president said his administration will "consider all options" to stimulate the economy he urged wall street banks to record all losses relating to the housing crisis immediately to tighten wasteful government spending he said his administration would consider options for overriding some congressional "earmarks " democrats say many republican successes resulted not from the popularity of their positions but from the high procedural barriers to passing legislation in the senate majority leader harry reids office this week sent out a list of procedural votes that republicans had forced in the senate contending it is a record democrats say they enacted five of their six major initiatives including raising the minimum wage passing energy legislation enacting recommendations of the commission helping make college costs more affordable and opening up stem cell research mr bush vetoed the stem cell bill but the rest became law while democrats made big concessions on their spending totals they say they realigned priorities within those limits they also say the childrens health issue will haunt the white house in the summer when states start to run out of money and ms pelosi said democrats would be "relentless" next year in seeking to hold the administration accountable on iraq
