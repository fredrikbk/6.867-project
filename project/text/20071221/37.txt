fraud seen as a driver in wave of foreclosures atlanta ring scams bear stearns getting &# million in loans atlanta skyrocketing foreclosures are a testament to how easy it was to borrow from mortgage lenders in recent years it may also have been easy to steal from them to judge from a multimillion dollar fraud scheme that federal prosecutors unraveled here in atlanta the criminals obtained &# million in mortgages from bear stearns cos including a &# million mortgage to calvin wright a new yorker who told the investment bank that he and his wife earned more than &# a month as the top officers of a marketing firm mr wright submitted statements showing assets of &# million a federal indictment alleged in fact mr wright was a phone technician earning only &# a year with assets of only &# and his wife was a homemaker the palm tree lined mansion they purchased with bear stearnss &# million recently sold out of foreclosure for just &# million bear stearns meanwhile posted the first quarterly loss in its year history as it wrote down &# billion of mortgage assets yesterday fraud goes a long way toward explaining why mortgage defaults and foreclosures are rocking financial institutions wall street and the economy the federal bureau of investigation says the share of its white collar agents and analysts devoted to prosecuting mortgage fraud has risen to up from in suspicious activity reports which many lenders are required to file with the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network when they suspect fraud shot up nearly between and in losses from fraud could total a record &# billion a increase from the previous year says arthur prieston chairman of the prieston group which provides lenders with mortgage fraud insurance and training the surge ranges from one off cases of fudging and fibbing to organized criminal rings the fbi says its active mortgage fraud cases have increased to this year from in in some regions fraud may account for half of all foreclosures "weve created a culture where a great many people know how to take advantage of the system " says mr prieston yet the system itself bears blame the evolution of mortgages into a securities instrument turned loan origination into a competition caution gave way to a push for speed and volume embroiled in an all out war for market share issuers reduced barriers to credit for example by offering so called "stated income" loans which require no proof of income "the stated income loan deserves the nickname used by many in the industry the liars loan " says the mortgage asset research institute which works with lenders to prevent fraud a recent review of a sampling of about stated income loans revealed that almost of the stated amounts were exaggerated by more than mari says it didnt take a rocket scientist to steal a fortune from mortgage lenders in recent years that much is clear from the atlanta scheme it was perpetrated in large part by a year old college dropout named gregory jerome wings jr aka g money his accomplices included a young nightclub owner along with the director of an underground documentary called "crackheads gone wild " a cautionary tale about drug addiction their scam was garden variety recruit borrowers with good credit to apply for gigantic loans often of the stated income variety using false income and asset statements find a mortgage broker willing to submit false information and find appraisers who will approve inflated values the perpetrators line their pockets with the proceeds using some as down payments or for future renovations some buyers diverted proceeds to themselves through shell companies the brazenness of the scheme is illustrated by the case of mr wright the new york telephone worker who posed as a highly paid executive to obtain a &# million mortgage from bear stearns recruited into the scheme by an acquaintance in atlanta mr wright with the help of ring leaders diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from that bear stearns mortgage to himself to mr wings and to others in the scheme according to a federal indictment in the very same week mr wright obtained a &# million mortgage on a second value inflated mansion near atlanta this time from bankfirst a unit of minneapolis based marshall bankfirst corp this deal also brought enormous spoils to mr wright mr wings and other accomplices "it was so easy its incredible " says akil secret attorney for mr wright who has pleaded guilty to bank fraud and is awaiting sentencing as profits from the scheme fattened their wallets these young men became the envy of their peers especially since their actions involved none of the dangers of street crime "you see a guy who is and hes driving a fancy car you go into clubs and everyone seems to know him and you kind of want to be like him " says defense attorney rickey richardson explaining how his client daryl smith got involved in the scheme "this wasnt drugs this wasnt guns this seemed clean and ok " residents of some fancy atlanta suburbs spotted the scheme they became suspicious when new homes in their neighborhoods sold for sky high prices then remained vacant after the same individual bought several such homes in one ritzy development neighbors alerted authorities one homeowner who helped expose the fraud and other schemes in his neighborhood now carries a loaded handgun in his truck "this is serious stuff " he says "we are putting people in prison for many many years " since federal authorities issued an indictment in april mr wings mr smith mr wright and about others have pleaded guilty to various counts including bank fraud and are awaiting sentencing another ringleader was convicted in federal court last month their sentences could be lengthy in an unrelated case an atlanta attorney with no prior criminal record was sentenced in august to years in federal prison on a mortgage fraud conviction mr wings declined to comment for this story as did messrs wright and smith in the wake of their downfall debate has been intense about how such an unaccomplished group could defraud top tier financial institutions out of millions prosecutors call the scheme sophisticated noting its reliance upon forged and falsified documentation lenders agree bear stearns says the scheme evaded its antifraud efforts by supplying false information at every step of the application process "we as an industry cannot eliminate fraud entirely " tom marano head of mortgages and asset backed securities for bear sterns said in a statement about the atlanta ring "we can and do continue to develop systems and detection techniques that evolve with the complexity of criminal schemes " but others contend that the atlanta case illustrates the recklessness with which lenders were issuing mortgages in recent years "this case should have been an indictment of the mortgage industry " says patrick deering an atlanta defense attorney involved in the case in an eye opening setback for prosecutors mr deering and other defense attorneys successfully defended three home builders against charges that they had participated in the scheme prosecutors had attacked the home builders for failing to raise red flags when they witnessed mortgages being issued far in excess of what the builders were being paid but some defense attorneys went on the offensive and attacked lenders for failing to guard against fraud particularly illuminating was the testimony of lucy lynch a former vice president of mortgage operations at bankfirst "fraud was not really a consideration in our world " ms lynch testified according to a trial transcript ms lynch said the bank relied on an outside "loan officer" at a reputable mortgage broker to serve as its "eyes and ears" in the real estate transactions as it turned out that person was indicted as part of the fraud ring ms lynch stressed that the bank took measures such as running all loan applications through a software program designed to detect fraud "and things that didnt seem quite right an underwriter could quickly pick those things out " ms lynch said according to a trial transcript "so as far as having an actual policy or procedure around fraud we didnt think it was necessary quite frankly " a total of &# million in loans from bankfirst were used by the atlanta fraud ring in some cases the bank gave its blessing to closing documents that showed unexplained payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars to obscure companies that turned out to be owned by the fraudsters on three different atlanta area homes over a three month period starting in late closing documents approved by bankfirst showed large payouts to the same companies ms lynch said the bank assumed that the cash was going to subcontractors for construction work but the bank never asked for invoices in an interview ms lynch says the bank was primarily checking to make sure the borrower wasnt being charged any additional fees or debt "we didnt do anything different from the rest of the industry "" she said adding that she believes her testimony helped convict three perpetrators of the fraud two borrowers and a real estate agent who helped lead the ring asked in court why the pattern of payouts didnt raise any red flags ms lynch responded "do you have any idea how many loans came into bankfirst during that time period " she said bankfirst typically allowed a " minute window" from the time it received closing documents by fax to the time it released the loan proceeds to the borrower ultimately prosecutors failed to convict any of the three home builders charges against one were dropped another was the subject of a mistrial and the third was acquitted before the case went to the jury "these were the wrong people on trial " says mr deering whose client home builder randall tharp was acquitted one of the biggest losers in the atlanta scheme was bear stearns a total of &# million in bear stearns loans were used by the enterprise the fourth largest mortgage that bear stearns originated in went to a borrower in the atlanta scheme that involved a mansion on which bear stearns lent nearly &# million today that mansion is in foreclosure and listed at &# million bear stearns says falsified income and asset documents are difficult to detect "if they are part of a sophisticated fraud ring " in the case of the &# million loan that bear stearns issued to mr wright the new york telephone worker the company says it verified mr wrights employment and assets but mr wrights attorney mr secret says "bear stearns certainly couldnt have verified any of the assets or any of the money it simply wasnt there " a relative newcomer to the mortgage origination business bear stearns in created bear stearns residential mortgage to focus on "alt a" mortgages a category between prime and subprime loans bear says its alt a loans included stated income mortgages that required verification of assets during its first full year of business in bear stearns residential mortgage originated mortgages for a combined &# billion according to data compiled by the federal reserve and analyzed by the wall street journal bear stearns residential mortgage rejected about of applications compared with an average denial rate of nationally according to the fed data bear stearns says that it had a lower denial rate because all of its applicants had already been screened through its "on line pre qualifying" site before they submitted a formal application since the scheme bear stearns says it has enhanced its monitoring of payouts listed on closing statements bankfirst stopped issuing residential mortgages altogether citing the declining market some banks victimized by the atlanta ring say they depended in part on a party called the closing attorney to protect their interests but often lenders neither choose nor pay for the closing attorney the buyer does in this case the closing attorney was part of the fraud ring the year old lawyer raymond costanzo jr known in the ring as "uncle joe " signed off on several fraudulent sales and collected &# from the scheme the indictment alleges in mr costanzo pleaded guilty to bank fraud and is awaiting sentencing of course the atlanta scheme wouldnt have worked if not for appraisers willing to approve values far in excess of what builders were charging for new homes indeed bear stearns and bankfirst say they ordered multiple appraisals of the homes they financed yet no evidence has emerged of appraisers receiving kickbacks and no appraisers got indicted in some neighborhoods the fraud scheme itself may have artificially raised values another explanation is that the appraisal market is fiercely competitive experts say some appraisers may offer inflated values in exchange for their standard fee of several hundred dollars a strategy that can win business without exposing an appraiser to charges of fraud "appraisers get sucked into these schemes because they are starving for work and many of them dont know what the heck they are doing " says carl heckman co founder of the georgia real estate fraud prevention and awareness coalition composed of appraisers lenders mortgage brokers and residents in the neighborhoods where the atlanta scheme operated values have plummeted many homes associated with the scheme are now in foreclosure some have sold for as low as of what buyers in the fraud ring paid "the banks are getting more and more aggressive in their pricing because they dont want to own these homes " says warren lovett a real estate agent with coldwell banker in atlanta mr lovett has taken listings for about foreclosed properties this year he estimates that half of the foreclosures hes encountered are due to fraud mark whitehouse rick brooks and stephanie chen contributed to this article
