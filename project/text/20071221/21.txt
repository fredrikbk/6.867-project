curtains for the necktie "neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together " leviticus thus was born somewhere in the sinai desert over years ago the sumptuary law ironically politics and clothing have mingled ever since generally speaking american politicians are the dullest dressers on the planet but three or four times a century our presidential contests have a direct effect on the sartorial life of the nation the last such occasion was when the rakish ronald reagan replaced the cloddish jimmy carter and helped usher in a new era of formality another revolution is now upon us though of a decidedly different character barack obama unquestionably the hippest candidate for the presidency since john f kennedy may do to the tie what kennedy helped do to the hat its a myth that jfk killed the hat simply by not wearing one to his inauguration actually that was the one instance when he did wear one but by ostentatiously eschewing a hat everywhere else at a time when the hats place in the male wardrobe needed all the high level support it could get a very public "nay" vote from that suave young handsome patrician helped tip the balance against it today the tie is in similarly dire straits sales are way down its status as the sartorial signifier par excellence of business seriousness and ceremony is in jeopardy california abandoned it at about the same time and for many of the same reasons that the golden state jettisoned reaganism the effete east held out longer but when wall street and the law firms went "business casual" during the last boom the necktie went on life support there it lingers kept breathing largely by the unwavering if unthinking allegiance of high ranking politicians but that too may soon pass away its one thing for a politician in the thick of a campaign to rally the faithful in all his shirtsleeved open necked down home glory "im one of you" the look is supposed to say accurately or not but there are or used to be occasions when the people dont want their leaders to look like one of them at least not what they look like when they are out washing the car mr obama breaks tradition on both counts he skips the tie at major indoor events not just outdoor rallies and rock the vote concerts sponsored by mtv he goes tieless not merely in his shirtsleeves or even with a blazer he carries the open necked look into a realm it was never meant to go with the two piece dark business suit this heresy earns the young senator praise from todays keepers of the style tablets the washington posts robin givhan the acid penned madame blackwell of the beltway could hardly contain herself "obamas tieless suit " she gushed "is a cross between the style of a s home from the office dad and a s gq man about town it is warmly safely nostalgically cool " others have noticed something else take the impeccably liberal jeff greenfield "ask yourself " he challenged his cnn audience "is there any other major public figure who dresses the way he does why yes it is iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad who unlike most of his predecessors seems to have skipped through enough copies of gq to find the jacket and no tie look agreeable " we can thank mr greenfield for being reckless enough to say what many were thinking but he mistakes mr ahmadinejads source mr obama may have gotten the idea from gq but the iranian president got it from the ayatollah khomeini one of the lesser known outcomes of the iranian revolution was the stigmatization of the tie as a tool of western imperialism the ayatollah even denounced some of his perceived enemies as "tie wearing cronies of the west " today in much of the islamist world the tie is seen as not merely pro western but anti islamic even though no prohibition of the garment can be found in islamic law there is a stricture against men wearing silk but muslim dandies can get around that by wearing cashmere or linen ties and many do its hard to think of anything less hip or less intended to be hip than islamist dogma on personal grooming yet despite traveling radically different routes along the way messrs obama and ahmadinejad somehow manage to wind up in the same sartorial spot sort of like the way ron paul and dennis kucinich share virtually identical foreign policies we should hope that the tie survives it is too noble a garment to let go for light and transient or dark and sinister causes the good news is that mr obamas foray into tielessness does not stem from deeply held ideology when it really counts he does the right thing no doubt should he make it to the end his neck will be covered on inauguration day just like jfks head nicholas antongiavanni is the pen name of michael anton he is author of "the suit a machiavellian approach to mens style " collins see related letter "letters to the editor its not ties that bind" wsj dec
