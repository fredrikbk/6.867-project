politics &amp economics u s natural gas plan riles canada terminal project stirs tension over politics environment economics st andrews canada when the people of this tiny seaside resort town learned that tankers filled with liquefied natural gas might some day sail near them toward proposed terminals in two maine towns they mobilized opposition to the plan from the highest levels of the canadian government that isnt a surprise given the opposition that has met proposed terminals for liquefied natural gas or lng in many coastal towns in the u s canadas opposition has drawn protests from the u s government in part u s officials complain that canada seems to have no problem with another proposed lng terminal on canadian soil miles to the east of st andrews that facility at st john new brunswick is being built by irving oil ltd part of a family owned canadian company the destination for most of the gas from this facility called canaport is energy hungry new england the same market the maine terminals would serve canadian opponents said the maine terminals would put ugly tankers in a region dependent on tourism would snarl sailing lanes and interfere with whale watching and point to a thus far unprecedented accident or attack on tankers carrying potentially explosive cargo they dispute assertions that the canadian government is favoring canadian terminals saying the routes to the irving oil facility are safer and dont pass through tourist heavy areas the dispute highlights tensions around lng technology which allows liquefied gas to be shipped in tankers from abroad to meet increasing gas needs in north america demand could go still higher if federal regulations are imposed on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants last week exxon mobil corp proposed building an lng terminal miles off the new jersey coast a proposal immediately opposed by some environmental groups it also highlights canadas increasing role in meeting u s energy needs it is the biggest source of u s imported crude lng terminals and other projects being proposed in the eastern half of the country are in part meant to meet growing energy demand in the u s northeast the u s currently gets of its gas from imported lng according to the u s department of energy by the agency predicts demand for lng will rise to of total natural gas consumption new england which already pays among the highest prices for natural gas in the world would gain if lng replaced more expensive gas from pipelines canadian prime minister stephen harpers government said it will block lng ships from reaching the proposed terminals in maine by enforcing sovereignty over a sea passage from the atlantic that has been used by ships of both nations for over two centuries secretary of state condoleezza rice and other u s officials have told ottawa that canadas position violates the law of the sea treaty which gives such commercial shipments an irrevocable right of passage the state department said canada shouldnt have the right to pick and choose which ships sail through those waters gregory francis thompson canadian minister of veterans affairs and canadas point man in this fight said moves by irving oil and other companies to build lng terminals in canada are unrelated to canadas opposition to the u s terminals "these are waters that are just too dangerous for this type of movement were just going to say no " said mr thompson who lives on the outskirts of st andrews before tankers can get to u s terminals they have to sail through head harbor passage a narrow strait between two canadian islands in passamaquoddy bay that could mean u s ships escorted by armed guards to counter a possible terrorist threat would interfere with canadian boat traffic "theyre carrying guns and theyre telling us to leave and were in canadian waters " said david welch a st andrews city council member who runs a whale watching business mr harper when campaigning as leader of the conservative party promised new brunswick that as prime minister he would bar lng tankers from using head harbor passage after mr harper became prime minister the st john telegraph journal one of the largest newspapers in the region called for him to oppose the maine terminals "where is the pm on lng issue " it asked in march the st john newspaper is owned by the irving family which also controls irving oil the company behind the st john lng terminal jennifer parker spokeswoman for irving oil says her company has never taken a position on the proposed u s lng terminals and said that the irving familys newspapers are held by a family controlled entity that is separate from the oil company james c irving the publisher of the st john telegraph journal says his newspaper is simply following the news "the issue the politicians see is sovereignty over canadian waters its a big political issue " he said the u s developers backing the lng terminals in maine worry that the canadian inspired delay could destroy them the federal energy regulatory commission normally would rely on canadas help to review navigation and safety issues before granting permits for the facilities according to a state department official canadian cooperation on issues related to the tankers stopped in fall "gas suppliers wont give assurance that well get supplies until we get permits until then every dollar we put in is at risk " said brian smith project manager for the terminal being proposed by quoddy bay lng llc at pleasant point maine which is just outside eastport quoddy bay is owned by closely held smith cogeneration inc of oklahoma city the quoddy bay project originally intended to be operational by will have the capacity to deliver as much as two billion cubic feet per day of natural gas the second terminal is being built by closely held downeast lng inc which is being financed by new york equity investment firm kestrel energy partners llc and is expected to deliver cubic feet per day in april michael wilson newly designated ambassador to washington by mr harper wrote to the federal energy regulatory commission saying a new canadian study concluded that the lng proposals posed safety and environmental risks that his government "cannot accept " canada he warned would "use domestic legal means" to prevent tankers from passing through head harbor passage the study done by senes consultants ltd an ottawa consulting firm said tougher measures are needed to keep tankers from interfering with other traffic or running aground but it also said head harbor passage is "more than adequate" to handle lng tanker traffic and that "it is possible to adopt an approach" that will minimize risks mr wilson said officials still see serious safety issues and will block shipments to u s facilities even if ferc grants permits
