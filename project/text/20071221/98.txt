the mortgage crisis fallout slow building of a rescue plan little known regulator kept pushing her idea california breakthrough washington in april a little known federal regulator named sheila bair floated a proposal at a meeting with mortgage executives could the industry freeze adjustable interest rates for needy individuals before they lost their homes the reaction was scornful recalls michael stevens senior vice president of regulatory policy at the conference of state bank supervisors "everyone hated it " he says "it went nowhere within seconds it was dead " seven months later president bush announced an industry plan to tackle the housing meltdown under which hundreds of thousands of struggling borrowers might get a five year freeze on their interest rates in many ways it looks a lot like ms bairs initial idea during those seven months the bush administration struggled to reconcile its distaste for meddling in markets with the clear signs the housing mess was turning into a financial crisis in pushing for a resolution ms bair chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp was a key agitator amid hostile investors a reluctant treasury secretary and nervous colleagues "she gets a lot of credit for raising this issue and highlighting the appropriateness of a more systematic approach " says robert steel undersecretary of the treasury for domestic finance the debate in washington now isnt about whether the administration went too far but about whether it went far enough quickly enough mr bush said yesterday that the government will "consider all options" to stimulate the u s economy years of lax lending by banks and other institutions has led to a surge in mortgage defaults over the past year as home prices have fallen moodys economy com forecasts that unless lenders greatly step up efforts to restructure loans three million of the million u s home loans will go into default in the months ending in mid and about two thirds of those will result in foreclosures the year old ms bair is a republican prairie populist a veteran bureaucrat and failed congressional candidate she started her campaign to draw attention to the burgeoning mortgage crisis in the spring with home prices falling and costs on adjustable rate mortgages rising the number of homeowners entering the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter of had broken a year old record at the april gathering of executives at the fdic known best for insuring bank deposits one attendee raised the possibility that the mortgage problems were "katrina like " investors who had bought up billions of dollars in subprime mortgages packaged into securities balked at giving borrowers a break en masse one problem loan servicing companies are under contract to collect payments on behalf of disparate groups of investors forgiving interest payments might open them up to lawsuits industry representatives assured ms bair they knew it was in their own interest to prevent foreclosures and that they didnt need federal mandates the bush administration was struggling to get a grip on possible solutions in early treasury secretary henry paulson was concerned about the practices of the subprime lenders who often didnt even demand proof of income from their borrowers but he and his team worried that prudent steps might worsen the situation in the short term even if they helped prevent a future crisis says a senior treasury official in june for instance federal regulators forced banks to tighten lending criteria making it harder for on the edge borrowers with adjustable rate loans to refinance into cheaper fixed rate mortgages mr paulson was also instinctively wary of intervening in markets when he and housing and urban development secretary alphonso jackson laid out options for mr bush at the white house at the end of august according to a senior official who was present the treasury secretary recommended pressing congress to expand the ability of the federal housing administration to guarantee mortgages extend the reach of credit counselors and bring industry representatives together to work out how to fend off foreclosures no one at that meeting pushed for an industrywide solution the official said "the recent disturbances in the subprime mortgage industry are modest theyre modest in relation to the size of our economy " mr bush told reporters soon after in late september however ms bair noticed a moodys investors service report revealing that lenders investors and loan servicing companies had softened terms on just one out of every subprime loans she emailed her counterparts at treasury and the federal reserve among others warning she planned to go public to demand more sacrifices from the industry she didnt get a single response she recalls in early october ms bair appeared at an investor conference in new york and urged the industry to convert large groups of adjustable subprime loans into year fixed rate mortgages at their original rates "make it permanent and get on with it " she told the investors "i wouldnt say that jaws dropped but there was a lot of unhappiness in the room " says brian gardner vice president of washington research for investment firm keefe bruyette &amp woods inc the bush administration was equally cool on oct mr paulson announced the creation of the hope now alliance made up of lenders mortgage servicers investors and credit counselors taking questions afterward he rejected a mass modification of loan terms in the days that followed as wall street banks suddenly started running aground mr paulson changed his mind citigroups losses mounted during october and its chief executive resigned the stock market gyrated treasury officials say there was no eureka moment but by the time mr paulson gave a speech at georgetown university on oct he was coming around to the idea that the mortgage industry wasnt moving fast enough to prevent foreclosures according to a treasury spokeswoman others were moving faster inspired by ms bairs ideas an economic adviser to california gov arnold schwarzenegger asked for fdic help an fdic official flew to california in late november and sat in on negotiating sessions with loan servicing companies four days later mr schwarzenegger announced a deal under which several servicers would agree to delay interest rate increases for vulnerable borrowers iowa attorney general tom miller who also says he was inspired by ms bairs ideas led a group representing more than states to pressure mortgage servicers treasury officials say they were heading toward an industrywide rescue plan before the california deal was announced many in the business believe that action by states raised the pressure for a national accord "gov schwarzenegger i think that was the real breakthrough " ms bair says on dec mr bush unveiled a plan under which million subprime homeowners might get expedited refinancing packages or have their adjustable rates frozen for up to five years "there are many american homeowners who could get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or a little help from their government " mr bush said with secretaries paulson and jackson at his side
