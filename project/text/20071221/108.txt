weekend journal catalog critic welcome to the club its called the holiday gift that keeps on giving and these days "of the month" clubs offer more than those familiar shipments of seasonal fruit the concept introduced in by pear grower turned mail order giant harry &amp david has been embraced by scores of catalogs and online merchants in the last few years particularly in the gourmet category clubs of america a year old lakemoor ill company has eight monthly programs with plus members overall and harry &amp david it now offers more than clubs including one that features cheesecakes cookies and pies we looked at more specialty oriented clubs cheeses olive oils even kringles theyre a scandinavian pastry in three or four month "sampler" versions we quickly discerned that no matter how good the goodies a club can fail in its essential mission if it doesnt make a strong first impression our first shipment from famed new york chocolatier jacques torres arrived without fanfare or even an explanation of the program and the initial package included a brownie mix instead of chocolate covered dried cherries as listed online the company notes that it reserves the right to make substitutions but wed rather not have to take out a baking pan to enjoy our chocolate as it is the mix is also part of the clubs regular december shipment then again we couldnt argue with the quality of the torres offerings the same couldnt be said of the frozen pizzas in clubs of americas three month pizza club each shipment included three pies two thin crust one chicago deep dish but with a couple of exceptions the monthly offerings werent stellar weve found comparable and less expensive pizzas in the frozen food section of our local supermarket still this club did know how to package things recipients get a nice welcome letter in advance of the first shipment and each package includes a "pizza expeditions" newsletter a communications glitch played havoc with our first shipment from murrays cheese shop we had requested that it be sent out at a different date than originally scheduled but it never made it to our doorstep in the promised time frame "i have no idea what happened " said an exasperated customer service rep still we were generally pleased with the cheeses themselves each month brought a selection of three often grouped by a geographic theme plus helpful notes with suggested wine pairings the delightful three month kringle program &# from wisconsinmade com offered high quality pastries with seasonal fillings octobers selection was pumpkin caramel and each kringle could serve eight to people making this club our pick for best value for best overall the four month olive oil club &# from michigan purveyor zingermans gets the nod it offered top grade

of bread perfect for dipping into the oil and first package includes a dipping plate the bad the site makes it seem as if some club shipments are on back order but a spokeswoman assured us that everything is available the shopping olive oil club comes in two and six month versions as well plus zingermans has other monthly "zing clubs " including ones for bacon and coffee cakes danish kringle
