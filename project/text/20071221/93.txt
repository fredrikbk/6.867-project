the leningrad enigma in putins past glimpses of russias hardline future for much of the s vladimir putin worked side by side with the liberals who were fighting to bring democracy to russia now the question arises did he ever believe in any of it this week mr putin confirmed he would become russias prime minister once the protege he handpicked to succeed him dmitry medvedev is elected president the swap expected in may would effectively cement mr putins one man control over a russian political system of his own creation the former kgb agent now commands a platform from which he can influence not only the course of his nations history but the worlds whether russia moves back toward democracy or deeper into autocracy will have much to do with a central riddle of mr putins biography during his rise in electoral politics was he a true believer in democracy who later became disillusioned or was he infiltrating a nascent democratic movement to undermine it mr putins hard fisted rule today bookends his earlier career with the soviet unions state security apparatus the kgb an agent from until he espoused a vision of russian greatness former colleagues say built on a kremlin that evokes fear and respect whats harder to explain is the period in between the fall of the soviet union and his rise to power in early with the u s s r crumbling mr putin was at a crossroads as he wrapped up a post recruiting spies in east germany he told a colleague he was thinking about returning to the soviet union but worried hed have to drive a taxi a few months later while still on the kgbs payroll mr putin took a job on the vanguard of the pro democracy movement then sweeping his homeland by the end of the soviet union had disintegrated leningrad was rechristened st petersburg there for the next five years mr putin built a career as a deputy mayor in one of russias most progressive city governments earning a reputation as an advocate for economic reforms and foreign investment he won over prominent liberal politicians when he moved to moscow in those connections helped propel a headlong rise to russias presidency four years later since taking office in mr putin has snuffed reforms that his st petersburg colleagues held dear rolling back press freedoms multiparty politics and open elections now years old and at the end of the two consecutive presidential terms allowed under russian law he has engineered a way to stay in power few who knew mr putin in the st petersburg years say they could divine his core motivations some say he remained guarded like the former spy he was others say he witnessed the messy business of building electoral politics in st petersburg and recoiled "like anyone who is not a crazy person he wanted good " said yuli rybakov a pro democracy lawmaker in st petersburg who later served in russias parliament "but his idea of good came from somewhere else he wasnt a person who could understand that the experience of freedom and discussion would bring democracy what we understand as democracy is to him anarchy " mr putin for his part insists that he is building democracy at a pace suitable to a country with a centuries old tradition of autocracy kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov says mr putin had looked "positively and sympathetically" on western led efforts to advise the st petersburg government in the s but later arriving in moscow mr putin saw that some initiatives to build civil society represented an effort to remake russia according to outside standards mr peskov said most inside russia welcome russias restoration under mr putin following a decade of upheavals of the s thanks in part to soaring oil revenues he has fostered a vibrant market economy that would have been anathema to central planners but mr putins russia bears little resemblance to the thriving democracy that reformers hoped prosperity would bring russians are freer than they were under the soviet union with its ever present secret police and strict travel limits but parliament which in the s regularly challenged the president is firmly in the grip of mr putins united russia party regional governors once a political force are now presidential appointees next years presidential election is considered a formality because the government has crowded out all viable candidates except mr medvedev this russia heady consumer capitalism in a one party state mirrors mr putins leanings say former and current colleagues accounts of mr putins pre kremlin years are sketchy during his kgb days he appeared unremarkable even in a service where officers are trained not to attract attention as a functionary during most of the s he was hardly considered a rising star recollections of the period are drawn from colleagues while mr putins account is drawn from a biography and a book of interviews he authorized vladimir vladimirovich putin was born in in the city then known as leningrad where his father worked in a factory making railway cars he grew up in a dilapidated fifth floor walk up apartment where he recalled rats living in the stairway as a boy he dreamed of joining the kgb he said in the book of interviews published in he studied law at leningrad state university after a kgb agent suggested that was the best route into the service he graduated in and underwent kgb training in russia in the agency sent him to dresden to recruit spies mr putins devotion wasnt to the soviet system whose decay he recognized but to the spy agency as the protector of russian greatness recalls vladimir usoltsev who shared a kgb office with him in dresden in the mid s "he always had a poetic touch the peculiar pride in belonging to the special corps of defenders of the motherland the chekists " mr usoltsev said in an interview referring to the soviet unions dreaded post revolutionary secret police klaus zuchold a former agent of the east german stasi secret police remembers the future president praising mikhail gorbachevs efforts to reform the soviet union but mr zuchold says mr putin reserved the highest respect for yuri andropov a former kgb chief during mr andropovs short tenure as soviet leader in the early s he had tried to liberalize the moribund soviet economy while cracking down on political dissent as mr gorbachevs economic restructuring and political openness took hold the eastern bloc sank the berlin wall fell in in early as his tour in dresden drew to a close mr putin told his agents to step up surveillance of dresden hotels which were filling up as westerners flowed into the country as east germany collapsed mr putin offered kgb jobs to one of his stasi contacts mr zuchold says mr putin recruited him as a spy in january and toasted the recruitment with a bottle of crimean champagne mr usoltsev the kgb colleague said the future president seemed worried as his exit from dresden neared the future president he recalled said he might go back home to practice law failing that he recalls mr putin saying "perhaps i will have to drive a taxi " instead mr putin returned to leningrad and became the chief kgb agent at leningrad state university according to the book of interviews he worked undercover as a deputy dean responsible for foreign students lawmaker mr rybakov remembers mr putin standing with the police who were monitoring a pro democracy rally at the time around the same time mr putin offered his services as a driver for an up and coming politician a feminist defender of ethnic minorities "he said he believed in her cause and so he wanted to help " said ruslan linkov an aide to the politician the late galina starovoitova on a trip to meet voters in the provinces near leningrad mr linkov said mr putin drove and spoke little mr peskov the kremlin spokesman says mr putin didnt volunteer for ms starovoitova saying mr linkovs recollection "does not conform with the facts " mr putin soon found permanent work with one of the leading politicians of russias nascent democracy movement anatoly sobchak mr putins former law professor had vaulted to prominence with stinging attacks on the communist elite mr sobchak had been elected a deputy of the leningrad council and then its chairman "i put the team together based on old acquaintances i needed people " mr sobchak who died in while campaigning for mr putin said in a newspaper interview shortly before his death mr putin spoke german and some english and had a good recommendation from the dean "i knew him as a good student " mr sobchak said in the book of interviews mr putin said he was looking for a backup in case his kgb career didnt pan out he watched mr sobchaks rise with interest but wasnt an enthusiastic supporter "i didnt like everything but he got my respect " mr putin said mr sobchak offered mr putin a position as an aide mr putin warned his former professor that he was a kgb agent mr sobchak hired him anyway around the same time mr sobchak hired another former law school student as a legal adviser mr medvedev the current presidential candidate western visitors to the office recall that mr medvedev then in his late s sat at a tiny desk in an anteroom and was sometimes mistaken for a secretary mr putin quickly distinguished himself as a quiet and efficient technocrat who kept his word and let his boss take the limelight former colleagues say he remained on the kgb payroll as an active reserve officer quitting only after the agencys top officers led an unsuccessful august coup against mr gorbachev back in dresden some of mr putins former agents were under the impression that he was still serving the spy service as late as mr zuchold says he and other ex agents received encrypted radio messages under his name bearing holiday greetings in may mr putin was promoted to become head of a new committee on foreign economic relations charged with drawing western trade and investment to the city the job landed mr putin in the middle of democrats chaotic efforts to govern the crumbling soviet union the legislators who swept into the city council in leningrads first free elections wanted to turn the council into a laboratory for reforms "we thought wed introduce the principles of parliamentary democracy right at the city level " mr putin recalled in a september meeting with foreign think tank analysts in russia but the predominantly amateur politicians in the legislature couldnt agree even on basic issues like appointing officials "it turned into horror without end " mr putin said as the soviet state fell to pieces the leningrad lawmakers tried to form a western style city government a referendum in june rechristened the city to its old name st petersburg mr sobchak was elected mayor soon the mayor and council fell to power struggles the st petersburg council continually challenged mr sobchaks decisions in court and accused him of hoarding power mr sobchak accused the council of muddling management of a city facing food shortages and economic collapse the soviet union dissolved at the end of westerners flooded st petersburg in early initiatives to build democratic institutions mr putin had little time for them american researcher michael mcfaul was then working with the national democratic institute a nonprofit partly funded by the u s government that brought politicians including walter mondale to speak about basics such as drawing up a budget mr mcfauls first point of contact was mr putin "he very quickly saw that this was all bull " and assigned a subordinate to organize the ndi seminars mr mcfaul recalls the aide assigned to run the conferences was igor sechin at dinner at one event mr mcfaul said he was surprised when mr sechin addressed him in portuguese the american spoke the language hed done research in the s in angola but didnt know how mr sechin could have known that then mr sechin explained that he too had been in africa "i worked for the kgb but now were all democrats some phrase like that " mr mcfaul recalls him saying the appointment of kgb veterans to mr sobchaks government drew howls particularly from ex dissidents whod been persecuted by the agency the uproar heightened with the appointment in of viktor cherkessov to head the st petersburg branch of the kgbs main successor then called the security ministry mr cherkessov had been the bane of dissidents some of whom now sat on the city council four years earlier mr cherkessov had spearheaded what would become the soviet unions last push against those who disseminated anti soviet propaganda filing charges against mr rybakov among others as relations between mr sobchak and the city council soured the mayor began pushing to have the body disbanded in late the council was dissolved by decree from moscow for all his skepticism about the councils parliamentary democracy mr putin embraced market economics it was necessary he has said to raise living standards and win re election for mr sobchak by mr putin was deputy mayor responsible for attracting foreign investment to the city western businessmen who worked with him say he was a quick learner and a no nonsense negotiator one foreign banker who hoped to develop some downtown real estate recalls that he went to mr putins office to appeal for exemptions from soviet era tax provisions that made investment impossible he started to explain his case mr putin interrupted "look he said to stay in power we need jobs in order to get jobs we need investment " the banker recalls "i understand all this so ill help you now get out of my office " in mr sobchak narrowly lost a bid for re election mr putin now jobless moved for the summer to his familys dacha outside st petersburg by then several former sobchak staffers were in prominent jobs in moscow by the fall of an official mr putin knew from his days in government set him up with a job as a functionary in the kremlin property department with rapid turnover in the waning days of boris yeltsins presidency mr putin advanced rapidly in july he was promoted to head the fsb the main successor to the kgb once in place at the agency mr putin called on colleagues from st petersburg he promoted mr cherkessov the security service officer loathed by old time dissidents there in august mr yeltsin surprised the country by naming mr putin prime minister and his heir apparent as president mr yeltsin stunned the world again with a new years address on dec in which he resigned and named mr putin acting president in one of his first appointments as acting president he named mr medvedev deputy chief of staff many russians weary from the devastated economy of the s a financial crisis in and an insurgency in the south welcomed a firm hand "putin has the same principles and goals that napoleon had in his time " mr sobchak still a liberal activist said in a newspaper interview in "restoration of state authority " after his election in march mr putin slashed taxes and overhauled legislation to improve the business climate he reappointed mr yeltsins prime minister free market champion mikhail kasyanov andrei illarionov an outspoken young economist also known for his free market views became mr putins economic adviser "it was attractive to work with him " mr illarionov recalled like many other economists at the time he says he believed rebuilding russias economy would inexorably lead to more democracy instead mr putin cracked down on rivals in part with the help of old security allies he gave mr cherkessov the kgb veteran command of a national antidrug agency another staff job went to mr sechin the portuguese speaking former spy the kremlin squeezed the politically connected russian tycoons who had consolidated former state industries and bought up media properties in the s the government wrested the main television station from an erstwhile putin ally boris berezovsky it gained control of another independent tv station vladimir gusinskys ntv engineering its sale to state owned gas giant gazprom the kremlin jailed mikhail khodorkovsky an oil banking and media baron who had supported opposition politics on fraud and tax evasion charges the mastermind of the arrest of mr khodorkovsky was mr sechin the kgb veteran from africa current and former officials say the kremlin says mr sechin was a student not an agent in africa mr sechin was later named chairman of the board of oao rosneft the state oil company that acquired most of yukoss assets to mr medvedev meanwhile mr putin entrusted state controlled gazprom the worlds no oil company behind exxon mobil those close to the company say mr putin keeps a close watch on its affairs foreign officials whove met mr putin have been shocked by the presidents detailed knowledge of prices and pipeline routes diplomats say mr rybakov the soviet era dissident on the leningrad city council mourns the tough fisted turn mr putin took "it will take a generation for us to make up for the lost ground " he said "we had all hoped for much better " kremlin officials argue that russian voters are still too tainted by decades of communist rule to be relied on to make responsible choices in the voting booth "were a very leftist country thats not the least bit concerned with obeying the law " said one "when our american colleagues talk about democracy freedom of the press and such they dont understand at all " at the meeting with foreign analysts in september mr putin said russia would need "strong presidential power" for years to come parliamentary democracy of the type tried in the early s would be "very dangerous" for russia he said for at least another decade "without internal discipline and without ideology to unite people it all leads to chaos " mr putin said
