democrats zero in on chinese toys presidential hopefuls question safety procedures obama takes tough line democratic presidential candidates are stepping up their attacks on chinese manufacturers of dangerous toys with sen barack obama vowing to ban all chinese toys unless government inspectors there and in the u s can ensure their safety in the wake of a series of recalls involving imports of toys and other childrens products for excessive lead levels or dangerous parts most of the democratic candidates have voiced get tough positions regarding toys from china they have taken aim at the bush administration for allowing the toys to be sold in the u s and at beijing for failing to do more to ensure products meet safety standards given that china supplies about of the toys in u s markets the ban mr obama advocates would be unlikely indeed an adviser to the illinois senator said the call for an outright ban was taken somewhat out of context and mr obama wasnt advocating a ban so much as he was pushing for a far better inspection regime but the statement isnt new during a dec radio debate in iowa mr obama also called for such a ban echoing the rhetoric of delaware sen joseph biden another presidential candidate they arent alone to one degree or another practically every democratic candidate has called for limits while republican candidates have said little on the issue sen christopher dodd and former sen john edwards vowed to boycott purchases of chinese made toys this holiday season sen hillary clinton of new york drew calls of slander from the chinese government when on "black friday " the shopping frenzy after thanksgiving she said the problem was widespread and troubling "as the holiday shopping season begins " mrs clinton said in late november "our government should be taking immediate decisive steps to ensure that the toys we are importing from china and other countries are safe " she said the chinese government itself has estimated that of its toy exports may be tainted congress just increased the budget for the consumer product safety commission but legislation to overhaul the agency has been stalled in the senate where a bipartisan agreement has been elusive in recent years the bush administration has slashed the budget and staff of the cpsc leaving roughly people half the number it had at inception in testing labs are antiquated and the cpsc has about field investigators to monitor more than ports as well as investigate incidents and injuries according to the agency none are stationed at any port full time manufacturers and consumers alike complain of delays in reporting and investigating defective and unsafe products the problem of tainted chinese toys evokes a visceral response among democratic voters who appear to blame a lax u s inspection regime as much as they do beijing this was clear in an economic roundtable discussion mr obama held this week after a young mother one of a half dozen new hampshire residents voiced fear about toys for this christmas season "what i would do right now is i would stop all imports of these toys from china " mr obama said "we have just a handful of people who are inspecting all the toys that are flooding into the country " carter keithley president of the toy industry association agrees that increased inspection at u s ports is needed and the trade group also supports increased funding for the cpsc but he said it is the industrys "responsibility to ensure toy safety the cpsc is a backup and an enforcement mechanism " on the other hand he said a ban on chinese toys could prove a disaster for the industry not only would it be "impossible to replace that productive capacity in any short period of time " but also an outright ban would be "utterly unjustified " he said of the roughly three billion toys imported from china this year only a relatively small number were subject to a recall mr keithley also pointed to the fact that many of recalls over the summer were the result of design flaws from american companies not the fault of chinese suppliers mr obama offers a further step he said he favors basing a u s inspection regime in china which he said is similar to what the japanese government does for food exports from there "they basically say to china you cannot send us your food unless you meet our safety inspectors we dont do that " mr obama said m p mcqueen contributed to this article
