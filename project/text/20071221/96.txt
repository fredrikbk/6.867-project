the numbers guy what topics filled clean minds in for one an asterisk internet time is faster than regular time on the internet for example ended three weeks ago at least five search companies including google and yahoo announced their top searches of the year based on the first months these annual compilations purporting to show the people places and things most sought after by web searchers are released in time for the news medias early december rush to wrap up the year when its barely over "its the traditional news cycle period for the look back " says vera chan senior editor at yahoo like other early december end of year announcements the search numbers risk missing late breaking news the tsunami struck the day after christmas saddam hussein was killed last dec too late to make the lists this year george mitchell released his report on performance enhancing drugs in baseball on dec after search lists were finalized thats scarcely the only problem with these numbers which are massaged beyond recognition and offered as accurate portrayals of americans favorite queries the raw numbers dont always reflect well on the search engines or their users for starters most lists excise adult terms such as "porn " that was no on aols list of the top searches from mobile devices such as cellphones according to a draft of a news release sent to me when i pointed out the surprising entry a spokeswoman said normally such terms are scrubbed from the list the final news release doesnt mention porn pushing "iphone" up to no from no on the list another secret you wont learn from the search companies lists the most common use of their sophisticated algorithms is to save web users time appending " com" to the names of popular web sites and entering them in browser address lines variations on "myspace " the name of the social networking site were three of the top four nonadult searches in the first months of according to the internet tracking firm hitwise which gets its data from logs of internet service providers with users names removed coming in at no was "ebay " the top of hitwises tracked searches were names or variations of names of web sites for three of those such as "yahoo com " users even typed in the " com " but still used the search engine rather than the address line after those "navigational searches " the top search queries according to hitwise were staid and not topical "lyrics" and "dictionary " most search companies including yahoo and lycos grapple with this reality by simply cutting out most company names and generic terms "neither pornographic terms nor the appearance of the same web sites year after year does much to provide a sense of what was unique or uniquely popular in " says aol spokeswoman molly mcmahon google hacks out the perennials by listing the fastest growing search terms rather than the most popular search companies filter their lists for two reasons says danny sullivan editor in chief of the industry site search engine land "first theyre not interesting because its the same searches every year second theyre embarrassing to the search engines" because of the potential presence of porn or worse competitors iac interactivecorps ask com gets credit for full disclosure here no on its real deal searches list is google so its third most common search is a request to navigate to a competitor but ask did excise the search for " " yes an asterisk that "bizarrely" made its raw top a spokesman says he says the symbol is linked to illicit activity the company blocks but declined to elaborate yahoo also credited a google site by placing youtube at the head of its list of top technology searches nonetheless yahoo did exercise editorial discretion in deciding what belonged in the technology "trend " though a popular search ebay wasnt included in the category to make way for newer terms such as "iphone" and "guitar hero " ms chan says editors also jigger with search data to aggregate related queries some make sense yahoo for example counts common misspellings and groups together searches for "hillary clinton" and "hillary rodham clinton " the presidential candidate ranked no on yahoos list for news other aggregation is more questionable in the year in which the final harry potter book was published any search on aol for the magicians name was counted toward the movie "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " including those searches the fifth potter books film version released by warner bros like aol a subsidiary of time warner was no in movie searches ms mcmahon says the corporate linkage wasnt a factor in determining the list dividing top searches into categories is another way to highlight seemingly more respectable information searches thus britney spears and mr hussein could each top categories celebrity and news respectively in lists from multiple search engines those search engines willing to share numbers beyond their news releases made clear that in search land the troubled pop singer trumped the late dictator searches for ms spears ran six times those for mr hussein on yahoo and nearly times on lycos email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily
