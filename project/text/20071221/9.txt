ahead of the tape todays market forecast financials the recession wild card thanks to turmoil in the housing and financial sectors recession talk has become all the fashion lately but a snapshot of corporate profits suggests a broad spillover hasnt happened yet standard &amp poors measure of fourth quarter operating earnings of companies in the s&amp p stock index which excludes certain one off events is expected to fall from a year ago but if you shave out the financial sector earnings of companies in the index are expected to rise according to s&amp p the strongest sectors are telecommunications health care and information technology forecast to post gains of and respectively that might help explain why stocks havent collapsed broadly despite the credit crunch the dow jones industrial average is up for the year though its off from its all time high set in october the surprising health of nonfinancial earnings raises a tantalizing question what if the financial sector sorts out this mess in the next few months and the economy avoids a much feared recession you could end up with respectable underlying earnings and a big post write off rebound in financial profits analysts seem to be counting on that they estimate that operating earnings for financials in the third quarter of will jump from this year of course it would be foolish to place too much weight on analyst profit forecasts in such a fluid environment academic studies show that the farther out analysts look the more upbeat they become the dark scenario a credit crunch and recession is still very much in play but the big surprise for investors might be if it never comes streets finger points at fed but perhaps its misdirected kvetching about the federal reserve has hit some sort of high water mark this year wall street is abound with complaints that the central bank didnt do enough to rein in risky lending practices during the run up to the housing bubble and that it isnt doing enough now to help clean up the mess "its the fed this the fed that " says tony richards managing principal at money manager stairway partners "its getting a little obnoxious " some of the criticism is understandable by the end of there was plenty of evidence that speculation had run amok in many housing markets media reports were regularly referring to a bubble when the housing market crested in the summer of the fed seemed slow on the uptake but seeing wall streeters point fingers at the fed gives pause was it the feds fault that brokerage firms marketed an alphabet soup of derivative products backed by subprime mortgages and that supposedly sophisticated investors bought them likewise its easy to argue that the economy is in worse shape than the fed thinks and that it should have cut rates more deeply than it did but dont forget the fed has had inflation to worry about too maybe wall street is downbeat on the fed for other reasons maybe its critics are just upset that they arent getting the rate cuts they think they need to bail them out of their own mistakes justin lahart comments to scott patterson wsj com or justin lahart wsj com
