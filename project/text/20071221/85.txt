the afternoon report bye bye recession online edition while the u s economy may have flirted with recession its marriage with the american consumer now appears less shaky than feared but how long can the mutual support continue today the commerce department reported that personal consumption advanced in november compared to the preceding month above consensus expectations of a climb the numbers

capital "what is often overlooked is the fact that as the dollar loses value the rising relative values of foreign currencies will increase consumer demand abroad as fewer foreign made products are imported and more domestic made products are exported the result will be far fewer products available for americans to consume " he said "shrinking supply will be a major factor in pushing consumer
