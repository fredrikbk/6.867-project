weekend journal hollywood report anatomy of a thriller publishers hollywood woo first time author will soviet tale sell next may grand central publishing will release a thriller by tom rob smith a little known year old british screenwriter whose credits include working on a cambodian soap opera the real cliffhanger though is whether mr smiths debut novel can live up to the hollywood and publishing industry promotional machine thats already cranking in high gear nine months ahead of its release the publisher sent several hundred copies of mr smiths "child " to key retailers and influential readers in the book community today there are more than in circulation ahead of its may print date and grand central owned by french company lagardere has laid plans to back the book with a big ad campaign "child " set in the soviet union in is about the hunt for a serial killer and a character forced to choose between saving his wife or sacrificing her to save his parents some compare its plot to that of "the lives of others " last years oscar winning german film the costly gamble on the untested mr smith he received a &# million u s advance for "child " and a second book while movie director ridley scott bought the film rights for an undisclosed sum says a lot about the state of the book industry like hollywood publishers have become addicted to blockbusters that can be turned into lucrative franchises grand central sees in mr smith the potential to be the next david baldacci james patterson or dan brown expensive first time authors can work out many questioned the decision of publisher little brown to pay &# million for world rights to elizabeth kostovas debut dracula novel "the historian " it turned out to be the beach read of and today there are almost million hardcovers in print but not all such bets are as successful harpercollins paid &# million for vikram chandras crime novel "sacred games " which it published in january the publisher estimates the hardcover sales at about so far which means it will need a strong paperback performance to earn back the advance harpercollins is part of news corp which also owns the wall street journal its especially difficult to crack the thriller genre the field is so crowded that retailers and publishers prefer to focus on brand name authors and seldom make big bets on first time efforts "there are too many good writers out there already " says stephen rubin president of doubleday broadway publishing group whose stable includes mr brown and john grisham yet even before his first sentence has been published mr smith has created an authors dream scenario in addition to his &# million u s book deal he has a similar two book agreement in the u k valued at about &# and the rights for "child " were sold widely overseas where it will be translated into languages hollywoods interest also was strong director scott battled other producers for the movie rights and won them for news corp s fox and mr scotts own scott free productions "its a page turner there is a level of sophistication in terms of its nonfiction history elements and you absolutely want to know what happens next "says mitch hoffman an executive editor at grand central publishing mr smith actually set out to write "child " as a movie after graduating from the university of cambridge in he found work in the entertainment business where he served as a script editor and writer for tv shows in he wangled a six month stay in cambodia as a story editor for a bbc world service trust soap aimed at the cambodian audience his ambition he says was to build a career as a film writer "my career was doing well in that i was doing interesting work but i was hungry and i wanted to break through " in the summer of mr smith showed a page treatment for a movie version of "child " to his film agent he said it would be difficult to sell because as a period piece set in the soviet union it would be expensive to make recalls mr smith his agents advice consider writing it as a book at that point mr smith didnt have a book contract and needed to remain at his tv job so he worked on the manuscript in fits and starts on feb he handed in a final draft to his literary agent james gill at pfd in london mr gill sent it to a number of british publishers russian settings in the vein of john le carre have been out of fashion since the end of the cold war and stalin era russia is even more distant nevertheless the book drew three bids with cbs corp s simon &amp schuster u k ltd shaking hands on a deal march "child " will come out in britain almost a year later march following the u k sale jim rutman an agent at sterling lord literistic in the u s sent the manuscript on march to a handful of new york publishers acting on behalf of pfd these included grand central publishing the former warner books acquired in by lagardere along with little brown from time warner inc there the book caught the eye of mr hoffman a veteran editor he took it to his bosses including jamie raab grand centrals publisher they werent immediately enthusiastic "there are so many thriller submissions " says ms raab "we just cant make most of them jump off the shelf " but after ms raab read "child " she gave mr hoffman the go ahead and the company bought it march to make back the advance grand central will need to sell close to hardcover copies a daunting figure at a time when most hardcover books sell fewer than grand centrals editors decided to hold off publication for more than a year to may this was the kind of book that needed time to build buzz they reasoned around labor day they sent out several hundred galley copies of the book to retailers and influential people an unusual move because it was so early more recently they sent more copies "weve got to win them over " ms raab says although grand central has identified "child " as the book it will push hardest next year to get on to best seller lists it faces obstacles costco and wal mart major book sellers whose support has been crucial for leading thriller writers including messrs patterson and baldacci generally buy only established authors not unknowns and most independent booksellers long ago stopped promoting thrillers in favor of upscale literary titles mr smiths book isnt as textured a literary read as mr le carres work but it is cleverly plotted packed with chilling psychological drama and densely researched it is about a police agent who is part of the state security apparatus later known as the kgb who begins to investigate a serial killer while gradually realizing that everything about his own life has been a lie michael costigan president of scott free productions mr scotts company is purposely vague as to how the book so quickly got onto the producers radar however in an era when manuscripts travel via email agents are even more adept at getting potentially hot properties to their clients says maria campbell a new york book scout mr scott used a personal touch to help secure the film rights "ridley scott gave me a ring on the phone and said he loved the book and wanted to direct it " says mr smith novelist richard price who wrote the screenplays for films including "freedomland" and "the color of money " has been hired to adapt the book for hollywood as for mr smith he says "i sat down to write a page turner and the larger themes would you in an impossible situation would you try to save your wife or sacrifice her to guarantee the lives of your parents were almost an accident but thats why the book has sold around the world "
