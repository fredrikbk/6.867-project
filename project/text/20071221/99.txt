the mortgage crisis fallout fed ecb moves have worked but worries remain weakness in housing concerns over economy continue to be threats the latest massive maneuvers by the federal reserve and european central bank have had the desired calming effect on money markets but as those central banks acknowledge the moves havent eliminated the threat from a cascade of bad news from financial firms worries about more bad news to come and the likely impact of falling u s housing prices the most visible indicator of persistent bank reluctance to lend to each other plus the reluctance of money market mutual funds to lend to banks for more than a few days has been that banks are paying unusually high rates for short term loans compared with the target the fed and ecb set for overnight loans the central banks have "alleviated a lot of the train wreck fears about year end " says lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap a new york bond research firm while the central banks actions are temporary extending only through january "it buys us more time which is the only thing thats going to resolve this " but money market conditions are far from normal and worries about markets and financial institutions extend well beyond the year end the biggest threat facing the u s economy and global financial institutions that have placed bets on it is that a widespread decline in housing prices continues weakening not only the financial health of consumers but the value of the collateral underlying trillions of dollars of securities that could lead to more defaults more losses and more reluctance of banks to lend billions of dollars in special short term fed and ecb loans targeted at year end tensions among banks wont alleviate that though cuts in the central banks target for short term interest rates might help the fed has cut its key overnight rates a full percentage point to and markets expect further cuts next year the bank of england has cut rates a quarter percentage point so far the ecb however is stubbornly holding its rate at expressing worries about inflation some analysts argue further rate cuts are needed others say rate cuts need to be supplemented by tax cuts or other fiscal stimulus "the issue is how to think about the headwinds in the financial sector " says douglas elmendorf a former fed economist now at the brookings institution think tank "on a bicycle the appropriate reaction to headwinds is to pedal harder not to assume that your pedals have become disconnected from your wheels " major u s and european investment banks most recently morgan stanley and bear stearns cos have reported king size mortgage related losses since the summer and more bad news is likely big bills continue to come due for bank affiliated funds that cant sell short term ious such as commercial paper in the fourth quarter for example these structured investment vehicles must pay &# billion in maturing notes the bill coming due in the first quarter is ten times as much &# billion according to dresdner kleinwort citigroup inc and merrill lynch &amp co two of the biggest issuers of securities known as collateralized debt obligations which have plummeted in value already have warned of major fourth quarter losses analysts predict each companys new chief executive is likely to absorb larger than expected losses in the hopes of starting clean in at citigroup where capital levels are already strained the expectation of further losses means the bank needs to be conservative when it comes issuing new loans but joshua rosner an analyst at the new york research firm graham fisher &amp co says "the issue is not a lack of capital the issue is each bank is unsure of which of their peers will not wake up in the morning nobody will feel comfortable until the losses that ultimately have to be taken are taken " in a report on european banks issued yesterday credit ratings agency dbrs said "if in six months time the market is still clogged many banks will be faced with more existential problems and a more drastic scaling down of their business models may ensue " because banks wont be able to pass on all the higher costs to borrowers the firm expects a profit squeeze in european banking and this time the banks wont be able to mitigate that with large amounts of new loans both the fed and the ecb have offset some but not all of the injections of credit into the banking system for loans that extend beyond year end by separate maneuvers that drain money at short term maturities both central banks have managed to bring the market rates for overnight bank loans close to their targets the fed has cut its target by one full percentage point since august and markets expect further cuts next year the ecb has been holding its rate steady at prompting some criticism that it has been putting one foot on the gas pedal offering large amounts of credit to banks while putting the other on the clutch refusing to lower its main interest rate target because it is worried about inflation in what appears to be the largest single intervention by any central bank ever the ecb lent billion euros &# billion in two week loans at an enticing rate "right now we can just lean back and be amazed at the amounts of liquidity " says holger schmieding chief european economist with bank of america in london "but if the money market seems to be consistently clogged you may have to finally think about reducing the overall level of interest rates " rising or merely elevated interbank rates in the new year could hurt prospects for european lending and borrowing and thus economic growth "the longer you have such elevated funding rates the bigger the risk that that spills over into the overall economy " he says a key measure of the stress in money markets is the gap or spread between the rate for three month loans and the expected overnight interest rate over the next three months in normal times that spread is tiny only about percentage point the gap widened to a full point in august a sign that banks were unusually reluctant to lend even to one another worries subsided in september but flared again in november as the spread widened to more than a full percentage point lately the spread has narrowed to percentage point better than it had been but worse than levels in early moments of stress in a development welcomed at the fed markets expect the spread to narrow to about percentage point in march and to about percentage point in april indicating that worries are subsiding in part because of fed moves the trend in europe is similar futures markets anticipate the spread between a three month loan and an overnight loan now about percentage point will be down to percentage point in march among the bids the fed received in tuesdays &# billion loan auction were from bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co which arent facing liquidity shortages not all banks participated suntrust banks inc of atlanta for instance didnt bid because it didnt need the money a spokesman said even as the bank warned yesterday of big fourth quarter losses while the fed shelled out &# billion and is offering another &# billion next week few u s banks will publicly acknowledge borrowing one reason the fed initiated the new lending program was that banks were proving reluctant to borrow directly through the feds discount window despite the feds encouragement and a move to lower the rate banks apparently feared that word might leak that a bank had borrowed and taint its reputation the fed reported yesterday that banks had borrowed &# billion at the discount window as of wednesday up slightly from &# billion in the prior week the calculated risk blog responded to the feds auction with a prayer for the times "grant me the capital to accept the things i cannot change the reserves to change the things that i can and the fed auction when all that blows up " mark whitehouse ann carrns and
