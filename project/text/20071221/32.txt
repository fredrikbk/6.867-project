election shenanigans push is coming to sucker punch at the federal election commission the regulatory agency tasked with enforcing campaign finance laws the senate has declined to confirm the nominations of three commissioners whose recess appointments will soon lapse so the fec will no longer be operational we sympathize with those who welcome such a prospect the fec has the all but impossible job of regulating political speech in accordance with the first amendment but even if the election police become temporarily paralyzed that doesnt mean our campaign laws however misguided are no longer in effect it merely creates uncertainty going into an election year and adds to a case backlog that will need to be cleared at a later date without a quorum of four commissioners the six member fec cant issue advisory opinions to candidates campaigns or anyone else looking for guidance nor can an fec without a quorum act on complaints that have been filed against individuals or campaigns accused of breaking the law this can have real political consequences earlier this month the fec ruled that the more than &# million raised by a group supporting democratic presidential candidate john edwards doesnt meet the "individual contributions" standards under federal regulations and thus isnt eligible for matching public funds the current standoff concerns hans von spakovsky one of three recess appointees whom senate democrats have refused to confirm to full six year terms democrats say they wont sign off on any of the nominees until president bush replaces mr von spakovsky if the senate doesnt act the recess appointments will expire when congress adjourns and the fec will be left with two members the issue isnt competence but political revenge democratic objections to mr von spakovsky have nothing to do with his performance at the fec where hes been serving for two years and everything to do with his previous job as a lawyer in the civil rights division of the justice department where he focused on voting rights liberals have owned the civil rights division for many years and the career staffers who work there are among the most ideological and partisan to be found anywhere inside the beltway while at justice mr von spakovsky helped to block the efforts by career lawyers to overturn a georgia state law requiring photo identification to vote he also kept them from nixing a texas congressional redistricting plan that they claimed was unconstitutional in both cases mr von spakovsky has been vindicated earlier this year a federal judge upheld the georgia law and ruled that arguments claiming voter id laws are discriminatory dont hold up to scrutiny as for texas redistricting the supreme court has since affirmed that of the redrawn districts met constitutional muster the one district that was struck down was found to violate a part of the voting rights act that mr spakovsky had no jurisdiction to enforce nevertheless former career staffers at justice including liberals like gerald hebert of the campaign legal center cant forgive mr von spakovsky for being right hence their efforts to paint him as some sort of bigot liberals talk endlessly about the importance of campaign finance reform so what does it say on the eve of a presidential election year that theyre willing to stymie the fecs policing powers in order to pursue a political vendetta
