equity firm warburg pincus in a statement last night mbia said its deal with warburg pincus is on track and that its insured cdos are diversified transactions that include corporate debt assets even if mbia is downgraded it wont be hurt as badly as aca financial guaranty corp which on wednesday saw its a credit rating slashed to ccc by s&amp p placing it at risk of default on billions of dollars
