individuals with big capital gain or dividend income are expected to be approved in one form or another the main opposition party also wants the current tax break ended many executives in the financial services industry were disappointed in the ruling coalitions plan as they want the current tax break extended to all investors including the wealthiest given the steep decline in japanese shares this year the executives say stocks could use every incentive to keep individual investors interested in buying shares "at a time when people arent even sure whether they can make money on japanese stocks the prospect of having to pay a tax is very unappealing " says tomoya asakura president of morningstar japan kk an investment data and analysis provider affiliated with morningstar inc
