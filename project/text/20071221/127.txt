weekend journal wine notes a partner for a present i need to pair a royal tokaji that was given to me as a present your comments are appreciated helmuth rueckert monterrey nuevo leon mexico tokaji aszu is the great sweet wine from hungary that has enjoyed a resurgence over the past few years dessert wine is served more often around this time of year when people are entertaining and we are often asked about food pairings truth is when it comes to something as special as tokaji we feel it deserves to be served on its own because its so rich luscious and complex the best pairing is simply with friends and loved ones in terms of food though when serving fine sweet wines such as tokaji and sauternes wed suggest ripe fleshy fruits such as peaches and pears or perhaps juicy and acidic baked apples sauternes and foie gras is a classic pairing and we once had a terrific match of tokaji and foie gras but personally we prefer these for dessert on their own or maybe just with some roasted nuts questioning a leak while browsing the close out bin at my local wine store looking for under priced gems a favorite activity of mine i found a magnum of clos des papes chateauneuf du pape marked down to a very nice price ive had this before and it was spectacular the prospect of bringing it to a party next weekend which will be attended by friends who enjoy wine as much as i do is very enticing the rub there is a leak a small ooze which has emanated from the cork and run down the side of the bottle slightly staining the label is this a good gamble tim callahan boston if the price were great and we were buying the wine for ourselves we might think about taking a chance but certainly not for company the problem is that the ooze could be an indication that the wine was abused causing the seal to be compromised that means the wine inside could have been cooked and or exposed to air if youre a gambler and you really really want to share it with friends wed strongly suggest you have a back up ready in case the first sip you take privately in the kitchen proves that its a goner still we wouldnt immediately pour it out it might pull itself together at least for a time opening up a controversy we have run into a persistent problem with byob establishments whose commonness is a reason to love much maligned new jersey we will bring an older bottle of wine from our own cellar to a restaurant and watch in horror as the well meaning waitstaff inserts a "waiter style" corkscrew into the bottle and either breaks the cork or drills a hole through it should we offer the use of a screwpull that we bring which we have found to be more appropriate for the more fragile corks in aged wines we have tried pointing out that the wine is older and almost always receive the assurance that they know just what to do it is frustrating for us and it seems embarrassing for them as well carol and david melvin chester n j we thought it was just us with older bottles it really is better to use a two prong corkscrew when we take an older bottle to a restaurant and we only do this at restaurants where weve dined before and know in advance that this is ok we bring our own prong corkscrew because we know that those "waiter" corkscrews could cause problems we offer to open the bottle ourselves and inevitably the waitstaff assures us that its no problem and then we too watch in horror as the cork falls apart we dont want to hurt anyones feelings or be rude or pushy these are restaurants where we already know the people after all so we just suffer through it and yes the waitstaff is embarrassed this is probably all more complicated than it seems we can understand restaurants reluctance to allow patrons to open their own bottles and there could even be legal issues in some places so were glad that you wrote because maybe restaurants will read this and figure out some way around the problem perhaps simply by teaching the waitstaff how to use that prong opener after we sent the melvins the response above they wrote back "you raise a separate issue we cannot get the hang of the prong or ah so as we have heard it referred to for reasons we do not fathom how do you use those correctly we have only managed to shove the cork into the bottle " first supposedly this is called an "ah so" because once people get the hang of this opener which grasps the cork from the sides they say "ah so this is how it works " we have no idea if thats true but thats what our assistant melanie grayce west was taught at a for credit wine course at cornell university and an ivy league explanation is good enough for us anyone who opens bottles of wine regularly especially older bottles should buy a prong corkscrew and learn how to use it john who opens the bottles in our house because dotties wrists have been surgically repaired is not mechanically adept and it took him some time to master this the first few corks are bound to go into the bottle so start practicing with simple everyday wines in time it really does become easy to use and works much better on older corks than a corkscrew one bit of advice wed offer work the prongs very very slowly and be patient melanie grayce west contributed to this column
