pricing probes on wall street gather steam sec led investigations focus on public notice in house discrepancies regulatory investigations into mortgage securities pricing are examining whether financial firms should have told the public earlier about the declining value of such securities and how they priced them on their books people close to the matter say the regulators led by the securities and exchange commission also are delving into whether wall street firms placed higher values on their own securities than those they placed on customer holdings the people say "as in most investigations the issue comes down to what did people know and when did they know it " said mark schonfeld director of the secs new york office during the past several months financial firms have announced more than &# billion in write downs on mortgage related assets this includes a &# billion write down by morgan stanley on wednesday stemming from bad bets on such securities last week ubs ag took a &# billion write down bringing its total for the year to &# billion merrill lynch &amp co has had write downs of &# billion and more are expected in all three cases the firms added to the write downs they initially announced the existence of the investigations has been known but few details previously had surfaced among the firms the sec is examining for their mortgage securities valuations and disclosures are ubs and morgan stanley in addition to previously reported investigations of merrill and bear stearns cos regarding their valuation methods people close to the situation say the probes are among the roughly three dozen investigations opened by the sec tied to the downturn of the subprime market which primarily is tied to low end borrowers the credit crunch that has hurt some homeowners and led to the wall street write downs has highlighted an unnerving reality in the financial world investors increasingly have no way of knowing with any certainty the value of many of the securities now traded these days far fewer than half of all securities trade on exchanges with readily available price information according to goldman sachs group inc while more securities than ever are priced by dealers who dont publish quotes the investigations will be complicated by the inherent difficulty in pricing such complicated securities particularly when markets dry up financial firms often use mathematical models with built in assumptions in determining value or "marks " which might differ if they had to sell the securities the sec has set up a working group that also is looking at whether firms adequately disclosed the risks of these investments and were timely in announcing stresses on the firms financial statements the probes are in early stages "the fact that were investigating does not mean that we have uncovered wrongdoing " said walter ricciardi deputy director of the secs enforcement division "we dont know now that we will be recommending any enforcement actions in the subprime area " to bring civil charges the sec likely would need specific evidence that a firm intended to make itself look better by misstating the value of its assets says david meister a former federal prosecutor who now is a partner in new york at the law firm clifford chance llp the sec is asking questions specifically about whether financial firms were valuing mortgage related securities differently on their own books compared to the valuations they applied to the holdings of customers such as hedge funds the sec also is asking why securities firms would price the same or similar mortgage securities at higher prices for their in house trading desks than for their asset management groups for instance or the repurchase desk where large slugs of securities are sold on a short term basis in one investigation the sec is examining a situation this year in which a trader at a now defunct hedge fund of ubss dillon read unit was confronted and then ousted after he valued mortgage securities at prices below the value assigned the same securities elsewhere at ubs in late october the sec interviewed the dillon read trader following a front page article in the wall street journal detailing the incident according to a person close the situation a ubs spokesman declined to comment the sec also contacted a trader from royal bank of canada in recent weeks following assertions by the trader in the journal that the bank had intentionally mis marked government agency and corporate bonds this week the trader sought protection as a whistleblower under the sarbanes oxley act according to his lawyer jeffrey liddle of liddle &amp robinson llp a spokesman for rbc declined to comment regulators also are looking at how wall street firms account for off balance sheet entities holding mortgage securities and whether some of those entities should have been required to be placed back on the books of banks and securities firms earlier people familiar with the situation say some observers have compared this sec investigation to an investigation of analyst research after the technology bubble burst in regulators sanctioned several financial firms after discovering incriminating emails showing that the analysts public pronouncements about stocks differed from what they said to colleagues in that investigation the issues came down to what was said publicly versus what they were saying internally regulators and lawyers say in the current environment investigators will be looking at whether a firm changed its valuation methodology to one that was more favorable in order to avoid or forestall taking big losses "it is likely that regulators will focus on whether people within the firms knew or had reason to be concerned about valuations while telling the marketplace something different " said richard grime a former sec enforcement attorney who now is at omelveny &amp myers in washington
