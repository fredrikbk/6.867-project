weekend journal review theater home is where the hate is the homecoming cort theatre w th st &# &# closes april the devils disciple irish repertory theatre w nd st &# &# closes jan new york what the hell was that all about " said the friend who went with me to "the homecoming" as we left the theater the last scene of harold pinters best known play hasnt lost its power to reduce audiences to head scratching confusion years after it was first seen on broadway but even if youre not sure what all of "the homecoming" is all about youll still get the message of the viciously comic revival now playing on broadway and youll revel in the work of six actors who definitely know whats what as usual with mr pinter what happens in "the homecoming" is easier to describe than explain the scene is a crumbling house in a working class quarter of london its occupants are an all male family consisting of a razor tongued ex butcher ian mcshane lately of hbos "deadwood" his mild mannered brother michael mckean and two of his three sons one of whom is a pimp raul esparza and the other a punch drunk boxer gareth saxe son no james frain a snooty professor of philosophy stops by for his first visit in six years accompanied by his sexy wife eve best the next day son no departs leaving behind his wife who has agreed to serve as the familys resident cook concubine curtain so what the hell was that all about mr pinter declines to answer save to acknowledge the more or less obvious fact that the men in "the homecoming" are misogynists of various sorts but until the arrival of the enigmatic climax theres nothing elusive or elliptical about this portrait of men without women in which the brutal intramural sniping of a hopelessly unhappy family is portrayed so precisely that you cant help but laugh at it nothing is so funny as plain truth and mr pinter dishes it up by the ladleful "plug it will you you stupid sod im trying to read the paper " "listen ill chop your spine off you talk to me like that you understand talking to your lousy filthy father like that " daniel sullivan is one of new yorks most uneven directors but when hes hot hes hot and his staging of "the homecoming" cuts like a hacksaw mr mcshane ms best who is a very great actress in the making and mr esparza have the flashiest parts and make the strongest impressions though no apologies need be made for their colleagues or for eugene lees seedy set which looks as though someone had worked it over with a wrecking ball all these things help to underline the enduring excellence of mr pinters play cheery it isnt but if youre feeling the need of a nice stiff drink of wormwood to cure that holiday hangover "the homecoming" is guaranteed to do the trick its never news when my favorite off broadway company gives a good show the irish repertory theatre after all has a near perfect track record of making resourceful use of its thumbnail sized stage and l shaped auditorium even so i was more than a little bit surprised to hear that theyd taken on george bernard shaws "the devils disciple " whose last full scale broadway production maurice evanss revival employed four sets one of them an exterior and a cast of to be sure the circle in the square version managed to make do with actors but thats still a pretty fair size crowd by off broadway standards so i was even more surprised to open my program and learn that i was about to see "the devils disciple" performed by a grand total of nine actors and two nonspeaking extras howd they do it by doubling the smaller parts and discreetly rewriting some of shaws dialogue to allow for the necessary compression not to worry you wont notice the changes unless you reread the play closely and the crackling verve of this miniaturized production renders such comparisons pointless the irish rep has always had a way with shaw but theyve outdone themselves with tony waltons production of his topsy turvy revolutionary war story about dick dudgeon lorenzo pisoni a new hampshire puritan turned shavian atheist who is willing to sacrifice his own life for the sake of a worldly presbyterian minister curzon dobell and the priggish woman who loves them both jenny fellner like so many of shaws plays "the devils disciple" is a sneaky piece of theatrical prestidigitation in which the shell of an old fashioned victorian melodrama is stuffed with decidedly un victorian notions about morality "he has been too well brought up by a pious mother to have any sense or manhood left in him" mr walton who also designed the production takes care to keep the pace brisk not even the preacher is preachy and the cast responds to his lightness of touch with acting to match john windsor cunningham comes close to stealing the show as the urbane general burgoyne but messrs pisoni and dobell steal it right back from him and cristin milioti catches the eye and ear in the supporting role of essie the bastard waif who loves dick in her own desperate way if theres a weak link anywhere i didnt notice it mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
