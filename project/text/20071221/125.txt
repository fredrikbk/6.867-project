weekend journal the home front step away from the clippers new laws to protect trees complicate homeowners lives saving the persimmon as the number of trees declines across the country new pruning and removal regulations are causing problems for homeowners efforts range from stringent new laws that define excessive trimming as "tree abuse " to tighter restrictions on what people can and cant do to the greenery in their own yards this month the bellevue wash city council began requiring homeowners with major renovation or teardown plans to preserve at least of the trees on their property in ringwood n j residents must now apply for a permit to remove even a single tree from their property and prove to a town inspector that theres a good reason to do it and in arroyo grande calif city officials passed an ordinance in september that makes severe pruning a misdemeanor most of the latest ordinances are meant to discourage housing developers from razing whole groves of trees but increasingly individual homeowners are also being targeted in part because trees on private property can account for a majority of a citys tree cover in some cases however conflicting requests from municipal agencies are turning residents with good intentions into tree trimming scofflaws analyses of three dozen american cities by american forests a washington d c based nonprofit have found that most had lost more than one quarter of their tree canopies since last year an estimated million acres of u s forest land were lost to wildfires alone according to the federal national interagency fire center the impact of extensive tree loss can be substantial experts say trees help prevent soil erosion and flooding filter pollutants from the air and help to cool densely developed areas the new rules are causing a backlash in some areas and forcing local governments to reconsider their policies and some well meaning homeowners are running afoul of city laws despite their desire to comply with them a couple in glendale calif faced a &# fine from the city this summer for pruning some of the towering oak trees and sycamores on their property even though they were ordered to do so by the fire department researchers say it makes sense that communities are becoming more tree conscious shoppers spend an average of more and linger longer on tree lined streets according to studies by kathleen wolf professor of urban forestry at the university of washington research also shows that where there are trees theres less crime she says "cities didnt care about trees for a long time now theyre high on the priority list " says victor merullo a tree law attorney based in columbus ohio in april as part of his planyc initiative to promote environmentally responsible growth new york city mayor michael bloomberg announced a plan to plant one million city tolerant trees by including ginkgos honey locusts and dawn redwoods and last month los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa reiterated a similar plan introduced last year to add one million new trees to the citys concrete laden landscape in june mike and ann collard hired a company to remove limbs from soaring oaks and two sycamores that surround their home in glendale calif a city fire inspector told them that some of the branches were fire hazards because they hung too close to the roof what the couple didnt know was that three months earlier the city council had revised its tree ordinance to include substantial penalties for pruning protected trees without a permit and doubled the fines for illegally cutting them down the city slapped the collards with a &# fine "it may as well have been &# million theres no way we could pay that " says mr collard a software designer whose wife gave birth to their third child in august they wont have to last week the collards met with scott howard the glendale city attorney who told them the city was dropping the fine altogether for the most part the ordinance was intended to dissuade developers from treating the fines as a cost of doing business mr howard says "there wasnt a lot of debate about how it will affect an average homeowner " the law is currently being reviewed by the city council last year tampa fla resident eric haura found himself in a similar bind the year old oncologist was told by his insurance company that he had a choice cut down an foot tall live oak on his property or lose his insurance policy the tree had a limb hanging over the roof of his three story house that could cause extensive damage if it came down in a storm the insurer said dr haura applied for a city permit to remove the tree and was denied live oaks over inches wide his measures inches are protected by tampas tree ordinance along with large pines elms and maples "we were about to start another hurricane season my insurance was lapsing and no one really wanted to help me out " recalls dr haura "it was not a fun position to be in " finally after three months of pleading with his city council representative and his insurance company dr haura convinced both parties to accept a compromise recommended by an independent certified arborist dr haura would fertilize the live oak regularly to keep it healthy and tether the limb in question to the main trunk with two steel cables although the entire endeavor ended up costing him a bundle arborist &# fertilizer &# cables &# dr haura says it was worth it "the tree is a great tree " he says "i didnt want to lose it " as in tampa some cities are giving blanket protection to virtually all trees over a certain minimum trunk width the bellevue wash regulation which covers trees that are more than inches wide was enacted in response to a rash of large scale remodeling projects and teardowns in the past five years "they were taking down every blade of green " says grant degginger the citys mayor "we wanted neighborhoods to be updated but we didnt want to lose the character of the neighborhood and lose all of that tree canopy " he says the new regulation which restricts for the first time the tree removal rights of individual homeowners citywide affects anyone who is redeveloping a property or expanding a home by more than homeowners must preserve of the existing trees and cover at least of the area in front of their homes with greenery such as shrubs or grass other cities are defending even smaller specimens for the past decade san antonio city officials have required permits to remove trees with trunks that are more than inches wide but in the city council amended their ordinance to include six species of small trees including the texas crabapple and persimmon whose trunks rarely grow wider than six inches "we have tree species that are very important to our urban forest for biodiversity but they dont ever get big " says debbie reid the citys arborist although there appears to be a growing consensus that trees are valuable community assets not everyone agrees on just how far to go to protect them in april john hickenlooper the mayor of denver tabled indefinitely a proposed ordinance that would have required homeowners to apply for a permit from the city forrester to chop down trees in their front yards the proposal prompted critical editorials in both the denver post and the rocky mountain news which called the ordinance a "misguided plan " in florida at least six communities have enacted ordinances defining extensive tree trimming as "tree abuse " coalition for property rights a nonprofit based in orlando says the local municipalities have gone too far "whats next " says carol saviak the groups executive director "if you cut your lawn too low will you be cited for grass abuse " complaints about atlantas rigorous tree removal regulations prompted community leaders in june to relax them homeowners can now cut down one healthy tree every five years without having to pay steep compensation fees provided the tree is within five feet of a dwelling that wont help ronnie abellera the year old attorney says he and his wife and their two small children sleep in the basement during windy storms because two foot poplars on their property lean dangerously over their bedrooms mr abellera says he asked for permission to remove the trees a year ago before the change in the ordinance but was flatly rejected by the city arborist "im a tree hugger ive done the sierra club thing " he says "but these trees are a safety concern for me " unfortunately for mr abellera the two poplars are and feet from his house "he has the option to appeal to the tree board " says ainsley caldwell arboriculture manager for the city of atlanta
