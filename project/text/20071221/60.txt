no you are not in control of your web data in a dec op ed "facebooks flop " randall rothenberg of the interactive advertising bureau iab tries to make the case against regulation of interactive advertising on the web he writes that "facebooks blunder illustrates one of the hoary maxims of the internet era the consumer is in control " would that this were true if it were consumers would be able to determine the owner of a web site before they were connected to it block any undesired connections and prevent undetectable spying by intermediaries the major commercial players in the internet world seem to be working very hard to make all of these tasks impossible i dont dispute the right of google or the iab or anyone else to place advertising interactive or otherwise on their web or search pages users can however legitimately object to being connected involuntarily and without warning to third party sites from elsewhere on the web and they should particularly object to deliberate attempts to obscure the nature of these connections or to bypass their firewall rules companies like akamai technologies have justified their dynamic ip assignment technology on the basis of speed reliability and security but they are using this technology to lie to users about web site identities and to subvert firewall rules designed to block undesired connections this forces the use of rules based on ip address ranges and dramatically complicates the already difficult process of home user firewall management security companies such as symantec are complicit their firewall logs now display akamai aliases rather than the underlying names and ip addresses and symantec uses the same tricks to try to hide its own use of third party sites users should also object that virtually all commercial web sites have privacy policies that disclaim responsibility for third party web sites and then force user connections to the very sites they disclaim users also can and should object when microsoft and internet browser and firewall companies use their privileged positions to force "phone home" data collection does anyone really think microsoft paid billions of dollars for aquantive so it can protect your user privacy why do i now need their permission from microsoft to upgrade my non microsoft applications do opera and symantec and california associates all really need to be notified whenever i connect to the web and critically users need to object when internet service providers are allowed to surreptitiously copy and record their internet activity and provide this information to third parties i believe this is already commonly done for denial of service prevention or other "security" reasons who knows what information a security company like prolexis collects how long they save it or who they give it to note that it is generally not possible for a user to even observe this let alone block it firewalls and anti spyware programs offer no defense tom nield concord mass
