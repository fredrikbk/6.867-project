weekend journal music crib sheets for guitar heroes musical tab sharing migrates to web sites that pay for rights when he was an undergrad at the university of pennsylvania and an aspiring guitarist bruce meyer now years old spent a great deal of the early s hunched over a record player learning songs for his rock n roll cover band "you sat there for hours with your ear pressed to the speaker pushing the needle back over and over to hear a passage " mr meyer recalls the internet changed all that for mr meyer and other guitarists yearning to learn jimmy pages thundering riff from led zeppelins "the immigrant song" or stevie ray vaughans solo on "pride and joy " guitar enthusiasts went online to sites like online guitar archive a k a "olga " and later mxtabs net where they would find and trade nearly ever big guitar solo imaginable notated in tablature the written musical notation system used primarily by people who dont read sheet music guitarists were happy but music publishers werent to them the guitar "tabs" were simply copyright violations after all no one was paying licensing fees or royalties on them last year olga shut down on what mr meyer recalls as a "black day " after the national music publishers association sent the web site a letter objecting to its posting songs without permission robert cathal woods a philosophy professor at virginia wesleyan college who ran olga from until last year didnt answer requests for comment dozens of other smaller tab sites stepped in to fill the void mr meyer recently used google to find a note for note transcription of the guitar solo from the jazzy steely dan tune "kid charlemagne " but despite its size the online trade in guitar tabs has generally been viewed as operating on thin legal ice now the music industry is looking to replicate the popularity of amateur tab sites and get paid two advertising supported web sites one from guitar world magazine another from the online sheet music seller musicnotes inc have secured permissions from some publishers and are in talks with others to post guitar tabs of copyrighted songs in exchange the sites are offering to pay publishers an undisclosed cut of ad revenue the sites set to launch in early plan to offer user generated tabs at no charge on guitar worlds site users submit tabs using a list of licensed artists and songs so the site can avoid unlicensed postings musicnotes plans to let users ask whether a given song is cleared for posting before they submit the sites also plan to sell professionally transcribed tabs musicnotes site mxtabs net a relaunch of the old site whose assets musicnotes bought after the site shut down plans to charge users about &# for a download of a professional tab guitar world plans to charge from cents to &# for downloads and will let users view some of these tabs at no charge offerings on guitar worlds site comprise classics creedence clearwater revival david bowie willie nelson and modern guitar bands good charlotte panic at the disco at the drive in artists confirmed for the mxtabs relaunch include coldplay the guess who and wilco absent from both sites at least for now are vast swaths of rock history including original beatles compositions and the entire oeuvre of led zeppelin with limited selections of licensed transcriptions it isnt clear that the sanctioned sites can put much of a dent in unlicensed sites despite the music industrys efforts bootleg tabs remain abundant and easy to find on the web an atlanta start up ivideosongs is working on plans to sell virtual music lessons featuring video downloads of guitar pros demonstrating their playing technique the company plans to offer a mix of instructors and brand name artists including alex lifeson of the canadian band rush and graham nash according to people familiar with ivideosongs plans the artists representatives declined to comment an ivideosongs spokesman said the company hasnt set a launch date and declined to address details tab sites hark back to the era before player pianos edison cylinders and vinyl records when sheet music was the music industrys primary product today sheet music generates just a trickle of revenue for publishers in the form of licensing fees from music magazines like guitar world owned by future plc and from the sale of song books mostly by enduring artists like the rolling stones and the beatles publishers who license their music to tab sites recognize a growth prospect in what was once a threat as they did last year in reaching agreements with a technology company created to search song lyrics the company gracenote inc in turn provides the lyrics to online music services like those of yahoo and aol "the guitar tabs started out as unlicensed and now theres an opportunity like with lyrics to enter deals and make money from something we never made money from except in limited instances " says peter brodsky executive vice president for business and legal affairs at sony corp s sony atv music publishing but the licensing of lyrics hasnt overcome the internets rogue offerings and mr brodsky says "im not thrilled with the way thats gone " brad tolinski guitar world editor in chief sees the tab sites as more than just a future source of revenue for the music industry tablature has been used for decades by musicians with no formal training and rose to prominence during the folk revival of the s and s the system "tells players where to put their fingers on the instrument rather than pitches to play " making it simpler and more mechanical than sheet music mr tolinski notes almost no banjo music is available in notation other than tablature he adds on guitar worlds web site which is currently operating in "beta" mode users can search professional and amateur tabs by recording artist and by song title as well as browse "most viewed" and "highest rated" tabs among the pro transcriptions on the guitar world site are the guitar gymnastics from judas priests metal classic "hell bent for leather" and the allman brothers bands southern rock anthem "melissa " user submitted tabs include david bowies "life on mars " classics from creedence clearwater revival eric clapton johnny cash and a number of r&amp b songs that the beatles covered early in their career getting a licensed site up and running has proved to be a challenge musicnotes chief executive kathleen marsh estimates her closely held madison wis company has secured licenses to only around of the songs in the mxtabs database "publishers are very fearful of a business model that gives their intellectual property away for free " she says
