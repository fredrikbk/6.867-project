eyes on the road one system two visions what to do with an electric drive system tokyos answer isnt the same as detroits online edition toyota scored a coup with its prius a futuristic midsize car that uses a sophisticated electric drive system to sip gas like a minicar now general motors is readying its response a hulking v powered sport utility vehicle with a sophisticated electric booster that gives it the gas mileage of a minivan gms "two mode" hybrid gas electric chevrolet tahoe and gmc yukon trucks wont hit the market until late this year or early next year but last week gm allowed journalists a sneak peek at prototypes of the vehicles including a small amount of time behind the wheel the contrasting approaches to hybrid technology represented by the tahoe and the prius illustrate quite dramatically the different world views of gm and toyota which as of the first quarter of this year surpassed gm as the worlds no seller of cars toyotas "hybrid synergy drive" system is designed primarily to reduce the petroleum consumption of relatively light vehicles operating in the city thats what youd expect from a company whose roots are in the small car dominated asian market toyotas efforts to use its hybrid technology as a power booster for large cars and suvs have produced so so results both in terms of fuel economy improvement and sales gm on the other hand is a creature of the american heartland where lots of people including lots of gm employees want vehicles that can comfortably haul up to seven people their gear and a trailer running a steady miles per hour on the four hour friday night run to the lakeside cottage this isnt just a michigan thing manhattanites with second homes upstate or angelenos who like a weekend in vegas now and then raise your hands the centerpiece of gms big suv hybrid system is what gm engineers call a "two mode" hybrid system boiling down some fairly complicated tech talk the system works like this two electric motors housed inside the transmission a volt battery pack and some sophisticated software combine to supplement the energy from a liter v motor from a standing start the hybrid suvs can accelerate to about miles per hour on electricity alone if you depress the accelerator gently when the big truck gets moving the gasoline engine kicks in to get it up to highway speed but once you settle into a fairly steady speed four of the eight cylinders will shut down a large suv only needs about horsepower to maintain its way at steady speeds says tim grewe chief engineer for the two mode hybrid system the hybrid system acts to expand the envelope within which the suv can operate in four cylinder mode thus improving highway fuel economy "we use a battery to make a six liter engine look like a three liter " says mr grewe the two mode hybrid system constantly monitors the vehicles performance and juggles whether to run the engine on four or eight pistons with or without electric boost the electric drive system regenerates juice in part by acting as the brakes and capturing energy as the vehicle decelerates fully appreciating the hybrid tahoe yukon will make you want to dust off your high school physics lessons about mass momentum and energy during a brief drive around a gm test track all this power management goes on almost undetectably the transition from eight to four cylinders and back is seamless as is the transition from strong electric boost to none that can make you forget you are in a hybrid vehicle which is one reason gm took a page from toyotas marketing notebook and equipped the tahoe yukon with hybrid badges and special displays to remind drivers and neighbors of the value received for the extra money spent on the hybrid technology for example a navigation screen display shows an animation of the power flows between engine and battery and a simple gauge in the instrument cluster tells the driver when the vehicle is running at peak efficiency while you shouldnt let playing the "boost your mileage" videogame distract you from watching the road the displays do encourage you to drive more sensibly whats notable about the hybrid tahoe and yukon based on the explanations of gm engineers involved in the project isnt just the "two mode" electric boost system its all the other things gms engineers did to make the tahoe and yukon more efficient to reduce weight the trucks will have aluminum hoods tailgates drive shafts and bumper structures the body has been made more aerodynamic through "thousands of hours" of work in wind tunnels to fine tune the placement of spoilers and air dams and so direct air around the body more efficiently the seats have been slimmed down to cut weight and the power steering system is electronic saving the weight of a hydraulic system the hybrid yukon tahoes body is about pounds lighter than a standard model a significant reduction but thats before you put in the hybrid drive battery pack and related hybrid hardware once thats done the weights about the same gm engineers say in many ways the hybrid tahoe and yukon represent a response to the challenge posed to gm by environmental groups such as the union of concerned scientists to sell vehicles that make use of fuel saving ideas sitting on the shelf the bottom line for all of this effort gm engineers say is that the two mode hybrid tahoe and yukon should consume about less gasoline on average than a conventional liter v two wheel drive tahoe that comes out to about miles per gallon in combined city highway mileage based on the governments current mileage ratings but "your mileage may vary" are the key words as owners of the toyota prius have reported a lot depends on how you drive just because a car is a hybrid doesnt mean you can flog it through jack rabbit starts and high speed freeway jaunts and expect to achieve the epa sticker mileage you wont the two mode hybrid tahoe and yukon by themselves wont change the energy equation for the u s using the federal mileage estimates youd save about &# worth of &# a gallon gas if you drove a hybrid tahoe instead of a conventional liter v model gary white the gm vice president in charge of the auto makers large truck program says gm is looking at other ways to boost large suv fuel efficiency including diesel engines which can cut petroleum consumption by about but marrying a diesel to the two mode hybrid transmission power management system might result in a truck thats quite expensive relative to its fuel savings gm plans to spread its two mode hybrid technology to other models including front wheel drive vehicles and smaller rear wheel drive vehicles gms partners in the two mode hybrid development daimlerchrysler and bmw will field vehicles of their own with the system gm hasnt disclosed the pricing for the hybrid suvs but gm executives hint that the prices will stay inside the current range for the models that is somewhere between &# and &# or so a hybrid tahoe will likely have the distinction of being the only seven passenger hybrid vehicle on the market but it might not be the most efficient way to carry seven passengers unless you have a trailer to tow a conventional minivan would likely provide equivalent fuel economy at a lower price the question of whether the hybrid tahoe will make a big difference in the broader context of the nations energy debate comes down to economics and lifestyle the nations oil bill wont go down if solo commuters who dumped suvs in favor of camrys trade back to a hybrid tahoe but if the reception for the hybrid tahoe and yukon encourages gm to take more risks to push fuel saving technology and designs into the market that could mark a turning point send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
