love &amp money when a kids game becomes your life my son is ready to make a major commitment im not sure if the rest of the family is this time last year the kids in my sons soccer league were invited to try out for a premier team unlike the recreational squads that try to practice weekly and play one game every saturday this premier team practices several times a week and travels regionally for games or tournaments driving home after last seasons final match i asked my son if he wanted to attend the tryouts he said no and we never mentioned it again well my son has changed his mind unprompted he recently announced his desire to play premier soccer it was great news and horrifying as well this will be terrific fun for my son and an opportunity to play a much higher level of soccer but my wife amy and i can only shudder at the effect it will have on our familys lifestyle and schedule this is the struggle that all parents face when a childs extracurricular activities move beyond the simple pleasures of recreation whether its a premier soccer team a select dance troupe or a regional orchestra not only are you on the hook for the added costs of tournament fees or lessons or travel but youre also devoting excessive family time to the activities of just one family member that can cause frustrations as you look toward yet another lost weekend and so as my son talked of the coming premier tryouts i found myself wondering how to balance a childs field of dreams against a familys field of reality i grew up playing and loving soccer and always wanted to play at a competitive tournament or professional level my one shot an invitation to try out for the national junior olympic team died when my mom and stepfather determined that a trip to canada to visit relatives was more important not that im still bitter i dont want to do the same thing to my son but as an adult my perspective has broadened i now see clearly the impact imposed on a family when a childs recreation becomes what is essentially a profession your weekends your life suddenly revolve around that activity often splitting the family apart always taxing your budget our baton rouge friends mike and melissa are living that with their year old son mitchell who won a spot last spring on the top premier team in his age group over the fall and spring seasons mitchells team played games in eight cities barely taking a weekend off melissa calculates the family spent more than &# on fees uniforms and travel "its incredibly hectic and expensive " melissa says "and its difficult to plan your life " one of the biggest challenges homework mitchell completes his homework in the car before practice or must finish it late into the evenings after practice "and every other interest is put on hold or it just goes away " melissa says ultimately she and mike like their sons sharp focus on soccer "because the kids spend so much time into this sport that they dont have time for the bad things that get you into trouble " melissa says "plus were closer as a family because were together so much we enjoy the road trips " drew and colleen my friends in new orleans have a slightly different take largely because they have two kids rather than one their son is involved with a premier soccer team their daughter plays three musical instruments and travels to band competitions the result drew says "is quite stressful on parents our week is maxed out with practices and we dont see each other on weekends " during the week colleen heads in one direction with their daughters band and youth orchestra demands while drew manages their sons soccer obligations friday afternoons drew and his son head out to soccer tournaments in memphis tenn birmingham ala jackson miss or elsewhere and if the team does well drew says he doesnt return home until late sunday night "just in time to say hi to my wife kiss her and go to sleep and then start the cycle again monday " drew figures the kids activities eat up about &# apiece each year more than he spends on their parochial school tuition on the good side drew says "your child learns excellent skills a love respect for the game at its highest level and many great life lessons such as how to successfully handle both winning and losing " is that worth though the price of admission a family must pay something in my son clicked earlier this season where he once griped about soccer practice he began showing excitement he started spending afternoons in the front yard teaching himself snazzy foot moves he began asking me to demonstrate skills we use in my mens league when i asked why he wants to play premier ball he said "because the competition will be better and ill get to play more games " part of me a big part is proud im certainly not assuming hell ever ascend to a rarefied level but id love to see him progress in soccer as far as he wants a smaller part sides with amy this premier dream could stretch the family too thin as a medical executive amy has job obligations that would preclude her from traveling to some games im busy with work as well and occasionally im on the road meaning amy alone would have to ferry our son to some tournaments or games as such i completely understand when she says "well be adding a lot of stress to our family i know this is something he wants to do but is it right for the family overall " she is willing to tolerate the stress if as a family we decide this is the right path she worries though that im coloring our sons view simply because i talk about the game so glowingly with him "does he realize " she asks "what hes giving up time with friends other sports he wants to play like basketball and track does he realize hell do homework in the car or in a hotel room on weekends " all legitimate concerns that we have to address but the bigger reality is this despite any inconveniences we as parents owe him a chance to pursue his passion if he never makes it past this level it should be because he called it quits on his own or his skills could take him no further it should not be because our schedules were too hectic to accommodate his dreams jeff opdyke covers personal
