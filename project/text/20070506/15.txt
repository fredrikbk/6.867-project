protecting your childrens inheritance if you have kids and youre getting ready to say "i do" for the second time its also time to rethink how your assets will be apportioned in the event of your death many married individuals provide in their wills for all their assets to pass to the spouse with the understanding that the survivor will help provide for the couples children in life and pass remaining assets to them at death but in a second marriage with possible uncertainty about the future relationship of your spouse and your children you may want to separately earmark money for your children and your spouse the situation gets more complicated if you both have children and you also contemplate more together to avoid family squabbles possible estate shrinking legal bills and to have your say regarding who gets what when you die "you will definitely need an estate plan " says steven tarta an estate planning attorney in ridgewood n j for some people a simple will will suffice

different than a guardian you want to raise the child but particularly if you have a fairly large sum of money in mind many estate professionals suggest that you pass assets to a minor child via a
