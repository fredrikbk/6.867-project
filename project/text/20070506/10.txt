getting going why aiming for average has its own genius settling for average is still the only sure way to win advocates of a new approach to indexing have launched a stinging attack against traditional index funds their chief criticism traditional index funds systematically overweight overvalued stocks and underweight undervalued shares lets face it this doesnt sound like a good thing to be doing and many investors in traditional index funds are understandably concerned time to revamp your portfolio not so fast this isnt a column criticizing the new "fundamental" indexing in fact i think it is a fairly clever idea the notion originated with pasadena calif money manager robert arnott and it has since been taken up by others notably jeremy siegel a finance professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school fundamental indexers believe that stock prices are noisy meaning they often trade above or below their true value if you follow the strategy favored by traditional index funds which is to invest in stocks according to their stock market value you will end up stashing more in those stocks that are trading above their true value while skimping on those that are below their true value to avoid this pitfall fundamental indexers look to weight stocks using other measures of their economic heft such as dividends earnings and sales the hope is that these measures are a better gauge of a companys true worth allowing fundamental index funds to sidestep the problem suffered by traditional index funds mr arnotts approach is the basis for mutual funds from pimco funds and charles schwab and exchange traded index funds from powershares meanwhile prof siegel is an adviser to wisdomtree investments which has launched etfs based on fundamental indexes intrigued fundamental indexing itself has come in for a fair amount of criticism the biggest complaint theres nothing new here fundamental indexers are claiming to profit from stock market noise but argue critics what theyre really capturing are two well known phenomena the historical outperformance of bargain priced value stocks and to a lesser extent smaller companies this seems like a valid criticism fundamental indexing does indeed appear to be value investing in disguise still i like fundamental indexings emphasis on stock market noise its an appealing way to explain the historical outperformance of value stocks generally and fundamental indexing in particular in fact the noise explanation strikes me as more convincing than the claim favored by some that value shares outperform because they are somehow riskier critics have also grumbled that fundamental indexing wouldnt have received nearly so much attention if the idea had been put forward in the late s when value stocks were suffering a long stretch of horrendous performance again this seems like a valid comment fundamental indexing is an easy sell right now because value shares have generated dazzling gains over the past seven years there will likely be a price paid for this stellar performance even if fundamental index funds generate healthy long run returns theres a decent chance todays buyers will be disappointed with their short term performance all that said i am not much bothered by the above criticisms instead what bugs me is fundamental indexings relentless bashing of traditional index funds fundamental indexers argue that traditional index funds are inherently flawed overweighting overvalued stocks and underweighting undervalued shares this makes it seem like traditional index funds have committed some terrible offense the reality yes traditional index funds almost certainly do underweight undervalued stocks but in doing so theyre simply mirroring the collective behavior of all active investors take a stock like verizon communications as of april it accounted for of the powershares ftse rafi us portfolio an exchange traded index fund that uses fundamental indexing meanwhile verizon was just of another etf ishares russell index fund which takes the traditional approach and weights stocks according to their stock market value i havent a clue whether verizon is undervalued but if it does indeed turn out to be bargain priced the ishares fund clearly owns a whole lot less than the powershares fund a stinging indictment hardly if you look at all money invested in larger u s stocks you find that of this money is invested in verizon which is precisely the amount that the ishares fund has invested this of course is not a huge surprise after all ishares russell is a traditional index fund that weights stocks according to their stock market value my point people can whine all they want about traditional index funds method for weighting stocks but all these funds are doing is reflecting the collective judgment of active stock pickers some of these active investors will underweight those stocks that fare best while others will get lucky and end up with big stakes in the big winners but traditional index funds arent in either camp their weighting of any given stock is unapologetically average no less no more and this is their genius before costs a traditional index fund will merely replicate the performance of the market sector it seeks to track after investment costs it will lag slightly behind the sectors performance that turns out to be a winning strategy the reason active investors will tend to lag even further behind the sectors performance thanks to their far higher investment costs in other words if you buy traditional index funds you are guaranteed to beat the collective performance of active investors who dabble in the same stocks fundamental indexing cant make that claim to be sure fundamental indexing may turn out to be a superior strategy only time will tell but even if it is a big winner traditional index funds wont be big losers they will remain what they have always been a surefire way to beat most active investors jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com corrections &amp amplifications the may "getting going" column incorrectly stated that the notion of fundamental indexing originated with pasadena calif money manager robert arnott while mr arnott has produced perhaps the best known research on the topic he wasnt the first to advocate the strategy
