seeking the markets takeover treasures mergers are coming fast and furious the tally of acquisitions during the first quarter was the highest on record adding up to &# trillion globally one development this past week a &# billion offer from news corp for dow jones which publishes the wall street journal and other publications its all sparking interest among individual investors in finding the next lucrative takeover deal "the takeover story is among the most interesting in the market right now " says jack ablin chief investment officer at harris private bank in chicago unfortunately its a fools game to try to bet on the next takeover target even experts find it difficult to predict these deals so its usually a mistake to buy a stock solely because it might be acquired one risk some who search for likely takeover targets seek out companies with disappointing management betting that a suitor will see ways to improve operations but if a deal doesnt materialize an investor will be stuck owning shares in a poorly managed company which can lead to losses "buying a stock because its a potential takeover target is tricky business " says peter andersen a portfolio manager at dreman value management in boston which manages about &# billion "you can win big if youre right " but there are a lot of stocks that seem like natural targets that never receive offers but investors may be able to profit by searching for attractive stocks that also have characteristics that appeal to private equity firms and other corporate buyers even if these companies dont attract suitors their shares may rise investment banks with strong businesses as deal advisers are another option for investors the following are some characteristics to look for in a stock as well as names of companies that fit the bill and might be attractive to a suitor as well as to investors strong cash flow when private equity firms buy a company they usually pay for the deal by adding debt to the target so firms with impressive "free cash flow " or money left after paying expenses sometimes become attractive takeover targets thats why mr ablin likes health care companies such as humana hum and mckesson mck and steelmaker u s steel x even if a deal doesnt materialize these kinds of companies could be winners indeed stocks in the standard &amp poors stock index with the highest free cash flow as a percentage of market value have been the biggest winners in the past month such companies can have a lot of cash available for dividends stock buybacks or other steps to improve a stocks return some hedge funds have been piling into shares of csk auto cao a car parts retailer with a dominant position in the western u s especially in california csk has strong cash flow though it has identified accounting errors and irregularities some of the investors are hoping csk sells itself cheap shares morgan stanley which is among the investment firms searching for stock picks among potential takeover targets cites ryland group ryl brunswick bc and computer sciences csc among the possibilities at first blush all three are unlikely takeover prizes ryland is a home builder under pressure from the housing slump brunswick which manufacturers indoor and outdoor recreation equipment has some investors worried about its exposure if consumer spending weakens computer sciences which provides consulting and information technology services is running into more competition despite these risks morgan stanley analysts cite low debt stable cash flows and inexpensive share prices as reasons the firms might become targets asset plays firms that own real estate or other assets that are not being fully utilized sometimes receive takeover offers thats because assets sometimes can be sold by an acquirer or better utilized mr andersen says that "in looking for targets i try to pick companies that are pretty obvious as to how they would trim debt by selling off assets for a premium " consider weyerhaeuser wy the timber wood and forest products company which swung to a first quarter profit and saw its shares move higher holds timberland assets that some say should be sold to unlock value the company could use the timberland sales to pay off as much as &# billion of acquisition related debt according to mr andersen on friday weyerhaeuser said its board is considering strategic alternatives for its containerboard packaging and recycling business which could include a possible sale of the assets keep in mind that weyerhaeuser is a big maker of building panels for residential construction if the housing market stays weak it could weigh on profits midcap maybe while several of the companies mentioned above are very large most of the deals that have been taking place lately involve midcap stocks often defined as those with between &# billion and &# billion in stock market value brunswick home builder toll brothers tol and timken tkr a maker of bearings and other components are among the midcap companies that morgan stanley cites as potential targets compared with the largest businesses midcap companies usually have fewer analysts following them increasing the chances that they are misunderstood and perhaps cheap james paulsen chief investment officer at wells capital management adds that midcap stocks are still sizable enough to attract private equity firms although he cautions that takeover potential should only be a "marginal consideration" in making an investment other plays one indirect way to play the merger trend buy shares of investment banks that make money putting the deals together such as goldman sachs group gs which is the leading adviser in merger deals if the acquisition pace continues goldman should do well and the stock trades at a reasonable price relative to its earnings but caution is needed because shares of goldman sachs already are up more than in the past year and the firm has been doing more trading for its own account adding potential risk there also are some publicly traded private equity firms such as fortress investment group fig which try to profit by making acquisitions but fortresss stock trades at an expensive price earnings ratio of suggesting that the shares first offered to the public just a few months ago are not cheap
