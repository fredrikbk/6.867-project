pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies im still here norbit variety says critics should take some time off our columnist tactfully declines my favorite columns by peter bart the editor in chief of variety are those he frames as avuncular memos to hollywoods heavy hitters "youre a guy who always likes to face the facts tom " he told tom cruise at a pivotal point in the stars career "so i imagine youre confounded by the mixed messages surrounding mi " the messages were essentially that "mission impossible " was a big hit but its star was being battered by unprecedented personal criticism the editors advice pipe down "you become tom terrific the man with all the answers you know all there is to know about religion parenting and childbirth youve surely solved the da vinci code youre a good guy in private tom but a pain in public " after chris rock hosted the oscars peter bart declared "ok you proved you could do it now do yourself a favor dont do it again the oscar show is a great gig but its not your gig watching you cope with network standards and practices is like forcing you to drive a ferrari with a volkswagen engine youre just not a pg kind of guy chris " in a memo to harrison ford the editor wrote "given your struggle to get to the top im all the more puzzled harrison why you seem determined to repeat yourself or indeed to parody yourself in vehicles like firewall or hollywood homicide " recently mr bart dispensed equally pointed advice to the nations movie critics "consider a sabbatical until september " the problem as he sees it is a seasonal one our opinions may my word not his have some relevance during the fall and winter when movies aimed at people like us are released for the rest of the year though were out of touch with popular taste as evidenced by our lack of enthusiasm for such megahits as " " "wild hogs " "ghost rider" and "norbit " among others "box office data this year " mr bart writes "suggests that filmgoers seem to be having a great time at the multiplexes the critics by contrast may be shopping for a new line of work " this particular column of his wasnt framed as a memo for obvious reasons too many addressees and none of us remotely resembling hitters in an industry that scorns us and also courts us from september through december still ill reply in the style to which varietys editor is accustomed memo to peter bart your suggestion about taking a sabbatical is a seductive one peter its been pretty ugly out there lately despite such welcome exceptions as fridays "blades of glory " you hit the nail on the head when you said that "battle fatigue has clearly overwhelmed the entire fraternity " a fraternity by the way that includes female critics but before i slouch off to take solace in the films of krzysztof kieslowski let me poke a few pins at the balloon of your populist exuberance everyones a critic and everyone is entitled to his or her own enjoyment the "popcorn crowd" your term not mine certainly does seem happy or at least satisfied with the stuff the studios are currently serving up as a former producer and studio executive you must take pleasure from that satisfaction and the revenue stream that reflects it but you and i peter are old enough to remember when hollywood was a unifying force in the nations culture rather than the divisive one its become and you like i surely hear the drumbeat of complaints from hollywoods harshest critics not those of us who are paid to ply this peculiar trade but longtime movie lovers and ticket buyers whove come to expect a certain level of intelligence and expertise in filmed entertainment they dont think of themselves as elitists and theyd rather not abandon the multiplexes until the level starts to rise come september week after week though they find themselves dismayed and alienated by the very productions that you point to as proof of hollywoods health im not an industry insider like you but ill bet dollars to popcorn peter that you also hear what i do from some of our most gifted filmmakers expressions of deep concern if not downright despair about hollywoods growing hostility to creative enterprises that dont fit the entertainment conglomerates increasingly rigid templates and about the precarious plight of the independent film movement if this is health then spare us all from too much more of it and spare us all as youll probably agree from the meddlings of the federal trade commission which will soon be putting public pressure on the studios for their ever more zealous marketing of violent entertainment to ever younger audiences im sure you abhor the idea of government regulation just as i do but its easy to see why the ftc has trained its sights on the seasons stupefying surfeit of killings torture abductions amputations impalements eviscerations and graphic beheadings i was going to call it the off season but this is the on season off begins in september if thats the popular taste im out of touch with so be it i take no pleasure in the spectacle of our kids pigging out on giant helpings of toxic slops your column chides professional critics with the observation that "the literature of disdain is always more fun to turn out " more fun than what though i enjoy turning out enthusiastic appreciation when theres something to enthuse about but that same column peter contains a couple of curious slips at one point you write in reference to the huge amounts of money taken in by "ghost rider" and "night at the museum " that "theres always a degree of culture shock when movies this inept produce numbers this ecstatic " inept thats a critical judgment if ever there was one at another point after noting the untapped marketing potential represented by the wastelands of february and march you say that "clearly a lot of filmgoers would like to be entertained in the post oscar period as well and they deserve better than they are getting " well yes they do and on that score we could simply agree to agree but i havent forgotten what you said about critics taking a sabbatical and im worried that you might follow your own advice vis a vis varietys chief film critic todd mccarthy ive been a fan of his work for many years and reviews like the ones he writes are more relevant than ever these days please know then peter that should you decide to furlough todd until september ill do what i can to get him a guest gig at the journal
