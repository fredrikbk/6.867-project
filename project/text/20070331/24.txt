encore a special report in the shadows despite progress a leading expert says older adults still face hurdles in dealing with depression in recent months the topic of depression among older americans has generated some prominent and worrisome headlines last september the senate special committee on aging in a hearing titled "generation at risk breaking the cycle of senior suicide " characterized the rate of late life suicide in the u s as nothing less than an "epidemic " in mid february gary moak the new president of the american association of geriatric psychiatry warned of a "crisis" in mental health care the rapidly growing imbalance between the millions of older adults with depression and related disorders and the number of physicians nurses and social workers needed to care for them against this backdrop we sat down with gary j kennedy director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at montefiore medical center in new york dr kennedy also is chairman of the geriatric mental health foundation an advocacy group in bethesda md that has started a national campaign to raise awareness about depression and mental illness in later life sitting in his office at montefiore dr kennedy age says older adults despite medical advances in recent years still face unique challenges when it comes to diagnosing and treating depression here are some excerpts from the discussion the wall street journal just how big a problem is depression among older americans dr kennedy its pretty clear that most older adults are not depressed these are people who have lived through the depression have lived through a number of wars theyre better off financially and better educated than their parents and certainly their grandparents were so the myth that aging means depression is nothing but a myth now the problem with that reassuring picture is if you look at older adults in the community with disabling medical conditions the rates of depression are four or five times that of the general population and theyre less likely to be treated for depression by their health care provider wsj why is that dr kennedy more likely the doctor will say "well youre old these symptoms that youre complaining about are old age " or "you have physical problems that explain it so no wonder you have some of these symptoms of depression " or "you just lost a spouse thats grief thats not depression " most primary care providers in practice now never had training in how to effectively use antidepressants very very few have had any training in even the briefest forms of psychotherapy wsj lets address some basics what is depression a mood a sadnesss an illness dr kennedy depression is all of the above which makes it difficult to know when the person is past the threshold of the sadness of everyday life the disappointments that are inevitable into a real disabling illness what most people dont realize is that for diagnosis of depression you dont have to have a depressed mood a major problem with apathy loss of interest in things that are most important to you could qualify if you have sufficient additional symptoms wsj so is there a formal diagnosis dr kennedy depression is defined typically as either a depressed mood or a loss of interest in most things that are important to you thats persisted for at least two weeks most of the time every day for two weeks with at least four other symptoms other symptoms include sleep disturbance too much or too little appetite disturbance eating too much or too little loss of energy and sexual side effects such as loss of interest in sexual expression difficulty concentrating or confusion is one of the symptoms that can go along with depression depression also amplifies aches and pains wsj what about older adults in particular are there symptoms that family members should watch for dr kennedy its an important question because about a third of the people in the work force today identify themselves as providing parent care again families need to be aware that depression is not just sadness in fact sometimes its apathy irritability difficulty concentrating without the depressed mood so when the person no longer enjoys being with family loses interest in their hobbies and its clear that its not because there are physical limitations that preclude it that should alert them that it could be depression wsj you mentioned that depression can be tied to health problems what are some of the other triggers dr kennedy its clear that there are genetic risks certain individuals who have a particular genetic profile or if they were abused or maltreated as a younger person theyre more likely to develop depression for older adults with established relationships losing that partner puts them at elevated risk of depression more so than a younger person so that longstanding partner that for women is a companion for men is their compass theyre at elevated risk for depression wsj and what can or does depression actually do to a person dr kennedy the effect of a major depression on your body is substantial first it tends to accelerate other illnesses for example if you have diabetes it makes your diabetes worse thats why depression adds to disability depression also impairs your behavior if youre apathetic and you cease to care youre not going to take your medications as well as you might you may overuse alcohol or not watch your diet because you just dont care depression also interferes with your sleep and if you cant sleep you cant regulate your physiology well either wsj what about family members and friends how does depression in a person affect them dr kennedy theres a major impact on others on children on grandchildren older adults should be enjoying the fruits of their labors but if theyre depressed and irritable theyre not going to want to see the grandchildren and have much fun with them thats one of the questions ill ask trying to assess a depression "so how did you respond last holiday when the grandkids came " and if the person says "i just wanted them to leave as soon as possible " that makes me think thats the apathy and the irritability of depression so its the "grandchildren test " as i call it wsj you noted that depression isnt always easy to identify are there particular mistakes that individuals or families make when it comes to spotting depression or getting help dr kennedy some people will say "ill get over this it will pass " and oftentimes depression after six months passes sometimes its a time limited disorder but look whats happened to you in those six months if youve stopped exercising if youre drinking too much if youve burned off your social supports if youre not taking your antihypertension medication properly because youve been apathetic then you have put yourself at risk wsj wheres the best place to turn for treatment you indicated earlier that many physicians dont have much experience with treating depression dr kennedy most of the depression treated in the u s is treated by primary care physicians now theyre not always equipped to do the best job but thats the place to start i think the family members should be informed enough to find out if the primary care physician feels confident treating this wsj what should a patient or family look for or expect medication therapy dr kennedy most often its going to be medication most physicians and most psychiatrists are not aware of the fact that if youve got the right medication even if the dose is not perfect somewhere within the first days or so the patient and family should notice that something is better the current practice is to prescribe an antidepressant and have the person come back in a month because the myth is that it takes a month for an antidepressant to work so we need to have a major change in prescribing behavior both by primary care physicians and psychiatrists alike that says "within the first days i want to see you again or at least talk with you by phone " wsj and what about therapy dr kennedy older persons may be more interested in psychotherapy than younger people first older people have the time and typically theyre not put off by a younger therapist in fact the younger therapist who listens spends time pays attention most older adults welcome and appreciate that wsj what can we expect to see in the future regarding treatment of depression is improved education for physicians the key dr kennedy if you just educate the physicians you dont change the impact of depression in the community the model thats emerging is that physicians and patients and families need a third party this could be a depression care manager or a depression care facilitator who assists the physician and the patient and sometimes the family to adhere to the medication to get the psychotherapy they need and deserve to make sure that the medication is effective in the right timeline and if not either switch or add another medication and to give feedback to the patient and physician this intermediary function much of which can be handled by phone looks like its the missing ingredient in depression care its also the missing ingredient in diabetes care congestive heart failure care severe hypertensive care and a number of organizations are recognizing that its not going to work just to put more and more burden on the physicians or just to simply educate the patients and make them more effective advocates for themselves we need someone else to help both parties achieve best outcomes for depression
