stock response volatile markets ruffle investors but havent spooked them yet the dow chart for the past month is a choppy picture the volatility on display has jolted professional investors from their tranquillity of the seven preceding months which saw the dow jones industrial average rise but they dont yet hear the bear growl reports this week of weakening consumer confidence declining orders for capital goods and continued housing woes together with uncertainty about the feds interest rate plans have sent the dow industrials down more than points since mondays close money managers were jittery after seeing the dow industrials plunge points in a single day in late february soon after stocks stabilized and many managers turned cautiously optimistic again with the accent on the caution many have concluded whatever the problems with risky investments abroad and the housing slump at home that the economy is still growing and that stocks will be fine but their confidence in stocks is based as much on hope as on certainty thats why many money managers are wracking their brains and the brains of others to figure out how solid are the markets underpinnings if there are going to be more gains they dont want to miss out but if warning signs start to crop up for the economy or the financial system they want to be ready to pull back that nervousness is a big reason for the markets recent volatility henry herrmann chief executive of &# billion mutual fund company waddell &amp reed in overland park kan has taken to grilling his analysts who follow the transportation and retailing industries not about the companies they follow but about the clues those companies may offer concerning the strength of the economy and consumer confidence transports are often viewed as economic bellwethers because a growing economy is constantly shipping goods on the ground reports from retailers show how well consumer spending is holding up in charlottesville va money manager david scott approaches the same problem but from the opposite direction rather than worry as mr herrmann does about trends in consumer spending interest rates or economic demand mr scott simply is scrutinizing individual stocks choosing which to buy based on their particular prices and outlooks but as he sorts through choices for his portfolio he is getting a message strikingly similar to the one mr herrmann is hearing economic growth is slowing but a recession in which the economy would stop growing and actually shrink isnt happening of course some investors believe a bear market a decline of or more is overdue after more than four years of market gains the average duration of bull markets as it happens is three to four years the pessimists are cutting back sharply on stocks building cash reserves and in some cases buying gold and bonds but most money managers nervous as they are believe the market will avoid severe pain the problems buffeting stocks lately they say arent the kinds that typically bring the market to its knees the worries that set off the past months gyrations however unruly foreign stock markets mortgage foreclosures for high risk subprime borrowers plus anxieties over the proliferation of arcane investment strategies at hedge funds and investment banks could translate into eventual trouble for the economy historically those kinds of concerns tend not by themselves to cause bear markets typically two things have created lasting market trouble rising interest rates and disappointing corporate profits it was the combination of those two that brought down the market in as long as the recent blowups dont push interest rates sharply higher or spill over into profit trouble at major companies many pros believe stocks will weather this bumpy ride perhaps more than is usual money managers are watching fed pronouncements and that too has been pushing stocks up and down in recent weeks the markets reacted strongly to hints from the federal reserve on march that it might lower interest rates if the economy showed unexpected weakness lower interest rates would stimulate the economy so the fed news soothed fears of a recession that would slash corporate profits this past wednesday however fed chairman ben bernanke crushed some of that hope when he said that the fed remains more likely to raise rates to combat inflation than to cut them even if the economy softens for months now analysts have been warning investors that average large company profit growth is going to fall into the single digits this year after more than three years of double digit growth those expectations are largely reflected in profit forecasts and to some extent in market expectations what would disrupt the market as economic growth slows would be a spate of unexpected profit disappointments that risk has turned professional investors such as waddells mr herrmann into detectives trying to figure out how much the recent market storms could affect interest rates and corrode profits they spend their time taking the economic and corporate pulse well before changes show up in economic data "i talk to my analysts every day " mr herrmann says "i am looking at the anecdotal reports to see whether i can decipher the economy weakening more than it had been we look at hiring we look at retail sales we talk to truckers and ask whats your tonnage we look at how the railroads are doing " the picture isnt perfect but it isnt bad enough to make mr herrmann pull back from stocks truckers tell him that they are staying busy but because they added drivers and trucks when the economy was booming the weaker economy has held down the prices they charge railroads are seeing less demand to haul cars coal and housing supplies but demand to carry imports is strong and the chemical business is "still going like crazy " mr herrmann says if he saw signs of trouble he would tell his fund managers to hold more money in cash and shift toward safer stocks those with strong dividends and low prices compared to their profits or stocks that his analysts suspect private investment funds might be tempted to buy he would cut back on stocks that depend on a boom such as makers of copper and steel already mr herrmann has pulled back from some financial stocks for fear that the mortgage defaults and foreclosures will hurt them and cut back on some retailers because of uncertainty about consumer spending he has moved toward consumer related companies whose sales depend less on buyers whims such as clorox co and anheuser busch cos even in a recession people will clean bathtubs and drink beer but before he makes any significant cutbacks in his overall stock exposure he is "looking for something more specific or significant" than he has seen so far "it would have to translate into more economic weakness than i have in the back of my head " in charlottesville mr scott chief investment officer at &# billion money management firm chase investment counsel looks at the economy as if through a magnifying glass he too worries that there is more volatility ahead "i am risk averse in here " he says "we havent had enough of a drop and not enough time has passed so that the riskier areas of the market can fully correct " riskier stocks that were bid up in recent years such as brokerage firms small stocks and some foreign stocks havent yet fallen as much as he suspects they will those one time market darlings havent been looking very appealing to him "in my bottoms up work " based on stock prices earnings prospects and the like "i dont see those stocks as attractive and if theyre not attractive theres a risk of more declines " mr scott says "we could go down further or we could just go sideways in a choppy pattern " he says the stocks that he thinks have the best outlooks have been those of bigger more stable companies such as lockheed martin corp mcdonalds corp and united technologies corp he likes some discount retailers such as target corp and j c penney co but he doesnt like wal mart stores inc because it "just isnt generating the profit growth " at the boston office of evergreen investments wachovia corp s money management arm the chief investment officer reacted immediately to the dows point plunge on feb calling a meeting for a m the very next day some evergreen money managers saw further declines coming they still do "i think were due for some sort of a correction a little bit worse than but less than " says evergreen portfolio manager walter mccormick he revised his portfolio more than a year ago moving toward bigger safer stocks in a decision that he acknowledges came much too early it hurt his performance over the past year as smaller stocks led the gains but has helped him lately among his current favorites procter &amp gamble co pepsico inc cigarette maker altria group inc as well as some companies that often arent viewed as steady producers but which he thinks will be such as cisco systems inc and amazon com inc "as long as the subprime lending issue can be contained and my guess is that it will be contained we should be ok " mr mccormick says to monitor credit markets he is keeping a close eye on the "spreads" between the rates charged to borrowers with weaker credit and to those with strong credit if the differences widen significantly he says it will be a sign of more trouble for now however he has actually raised his holdings of big brokerage firms such as goldman sachs group inc "what everyone wants to know is who has been left holding the bag in terms of trading" in risky vehicles such as mortgage bonds "firms like goldman will be just fine " he says kurt wolfgruber who oversees &# billion as chief investment officer at oppenheimerfunds in new york says he has found plenty to worry about in recent weeks economic growth profit growth politics fed interest rate policy inflation china europe the dollar the enormous influence of private investment funds but mr wolfgruber says that so far "we arent doing much differently at all " he too foresees short term volatility and expects some hot money investors to try to bet on that but he is urging his money managers to concentrate on the medium term and not take fright "we will have some scares" in the market this year mr wolfgruber says but "i think well finish the year with corporate profit gains up in the mid to high single digits and maybe a gain in the stock market " to help them weather the volatility many of his fund managers are leaning toward stocks in big well established companies in industrialized countries rather than in developing regions he is concerned about the growing influence of hedge funds and of brokerage firm traders who use short term trading strategies similar to those of hedge funds and that their trading will boost the volatility in the market to put his fears in perspective the value of all stock and bonds has been estimated by trade groups at around &# trillion while that of hybrid derivatives contracts has been estimated by the bank for international settlements at &# trillion edgar peters who helps oversee &# billion as head of asset allocation at bostons panagora asset management uses mathematical models that take into account such variables as interest rates economic growth inflation and stock valuations the models help him decide whether he should be buying stocks at all or instead leaning toward bonds mr peterss conclusion there is still too much inflation and he expects the fed to raise interest rates and squeeze inflation further he too foresees more stock volatility but a bear market in the past mr peters has had no trouble warning of stock market trouble he was one of the rare analysts who did so before the bear market of but this time "the risk of a really significant bear market is not really there " mr peters says "if you do get a significant decline it could be a buying opportunity " with interest rates low mr peters normally would favor stocks heavily over bonds but because he fears an interest rate increase he is more circumspect he is sticking to his standard balance of about stocks and bonds but if rates move significantly higher the return will attract big pension funds which will start substituting bonds for stocks "if long term interest rates go up to all bets are off " he says
