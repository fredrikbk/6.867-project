pursuits books the mughals jewel two books explore the story of a th century marble masterpiece taj mahal by diana and michael preston walker pages &# the complete taj mahal by ebba koch thames &amp hudson pages &# in a young turkish poet prince from central asia zahir ud din babur by name descended the khyber pass with a small army of hand picked followers he also brought with him the first cannon ever seen in northern india with these he defeated the delhi sultan at the battle of panipat and a year later he crushed the hindu rajputs he established his capital at agra and began to extend his rule southward and eastward in time baburs mughal empire grew to be the greatest and most populous of all muslim empires with million subjects five times the number ruled by the mughals rivals the ottomans indeed the mughals were partly responsible for shifting eastward the center of gravity of the islamic world today more muslims live to the east of afghanistan than to its west in miltons "paradise lost " the great mughal cities of agra and lahore are revealed to adam after the fall as future wonders of gods creation this was hardly an understatement by the th century lahore had grown larger than even constantinople and with its two million inhabitants dwarfed both london and paris from the ramparts of lahores fort the great mughal ruled over most of india all of pakistan and great chunks of afghanistan his army was all but invincible his palaces unparalleled the domes of his many mosques literally glittered with gold the mughals were really rivaled only by their ming counterparts in china for their contemporaries in distant europe they became potent symbols of power and wealth connotations with which the word mughal or moghul is still loaded if the mughals represented islamic rule at its most powerful and majestic they also defined islam at its most tolerant and eclectic their empire was effectively built in coalition with indias hindu majority and succeeded as much by tact and conciliation as by war this was particularly so of the emperor akbar who issued an edict of universal religious toleration forbade forcible conversion to islam and married a succession of hindu wives at a time when most of catholic europe was given over to the inquisition and in rome the philosopher giordano bruno was being burned at the stake for heresy in india akbar was declaring that "no man should be interfered with on account of religion and anyone is to be allowed to go over to a religion that pleases him " it was akbars favorite grandson shah jahan who was responsible for the mughals most celebrated creation the taj mahal the taj was built as the tomb of shah jahans beloved wife mumtaz mahal something that in itself defies stereotypes of the place of women in muslim society it is arguably the most admired building of the past years a marble masterpiece rising still above the river jumna as perfect beautiful and shimmeringly symmetrical as it was when its great marble dome was first completed in yet for all its fame remarkably little has been written on the taj and it is therefore surprising to see the publication of not one but two full length studies of the building the first "the taj mahal passion and genius at the heart of the moghul empire " by diana and michael preston is a readable popular history although it has no endnotes and only intermittently points toward its sources the prestons book avoids most of the usual myths retailed by this sort of production and only really stumbles into trouble when it tries too hard to be racy thus the prestons serve up some very dubious orientalist nonsense about shah jahans sexual prowess the emperor was the authors claim "barrel chested and athletically built at the height of his sexual powers and a deft experienced lover well tutored in a court where fleshly pleasures were unashamedly enjoyed " all this is entirely unhistorical in reality the only concrete evidence we have about shah jahans virility is the number of children seven he produced which was relatively modest by the standards of the time this strange urge to turn the builder of the taj into a mughal stud bull leads the prestons to commit several howlers apparently unaware that shah jahan was lovingly cared for in his old age by his second esteemed consort akbarabadi begum the prestons invent a sort of grief stricken priapism for the emperor after the death of his wife with shah jahan "seeking distraction by indulging in frenetic couplings in a fruitless attempt to find physical compensation for his emotional loss " the authors also have a marked weakness for shlock oriental splendor there is a bit much about "sparkling gems " "opulent majesty" and "everlasting love" for all but the most saccharine of palates the prestons real misfortune however is that their tale has hit the bookshops at about the same time as a truly outstanding book on the same subject ebba koch is generally acknowledged as the worlds leading expert on mughal architecture and in "the complete taj mahal" she provides a summation of her lifes work instead of speculating as the prestons do on the aphrodisiacs favored by the imperial couple ms koch has produced a spectacular and authoritative study of the origins influences methods of construction and symbolism of the taj the book is the result of both the first full architectural survey of the building since indias independence in and a careful combing through primary persian sources not only is "the complete taj mahal" an exemplary work of scholarship it is also beautifully produced superbly illustrated and written in a style that is both clear and free of jargon perhaps its most remarkable achievement is the way ms koch has reconstructed the entire architectural context of the taj in which she reveals agra to be a sort of mughal venice centered around the jumna riverbank with most movement taking place by boat between a succession of riverside gardens and palaces the last word should perhaps go to salman rushdie whose thoughts on the taj are given in the epilogue of the prestons book mr rushdie wrote how he had been dubious about the monument before he saw it "but the building itself left my scepticism in shreds insisting with absolute force on its sovereign authority it simply obliterated the millions of counterfeits of it and glowingly filled once and forever the place in the mind previously occupied by the simulacra this finally is why the taj must be seen to remind us that the world is real that the sound is truer than the echo and the original more forceful than its image in a mirror the beauty of beautiful things is still able in these image saturated times to transcend imitations and the taj mahal is beyond the power of words to say it a lovely thing perhaps the loveliest of things " mr dalrymples "the last mughal " winner of the duff cooper prize in britain has just been published by knopf he lives in new delhi
