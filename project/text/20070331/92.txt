next week as candidates publicize their first quarter campaign fund raising totals those numbers dont have to be reported until april but will start trickling out as early as this weekend and that has spin machines in washington already running in high gear one goal setting artificially low fund raising expectations for your candidate and then shattering those expectations another establishing impossibly high expectations for your opponents and then insisting that they have failed in reality the presidential candidates in both political parties are raising more money faster than ever in the last presidential election north carolina sen john edwards set an all time democratic record by raising &# million in the first three months of that total wowed political insiders and put the edwards campaign on the map this year any candidate who raises a mere &# million will be considered a loser mr edwards himself should double his take by all accounts new york sen hillary rodham clinton will lead the field with a total haul that could approach &# million illinois sen barack obama is expected to be in the &# million range on the republican side of the aisle arizona sen john mccain former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney should raise north of &# million apiece the clinton spin machine spent much of last week raising expectations for mr obama after the obama campaign put out notice that it has received donations clinton spokesman blake zeff predicted that mr obama would "easily surpass &# million for the quarter " thats an effort to make anything less than &# million look like a loss mrs clinton should easily beat mr obama and her other rivals but by how much lets ask her opponents "shes going to out raise everybody combined " says jen psaki a spokeswoman for mr obama that could be &# million according to the spinmeisters inside the obama and edwards camps who want to make an eye popping &# million look disappointing ms psaki says mr obama hopes to raise between &# million and &# million a spokeswoman for mr edwards says that the campaign is simply "hoping to beat our number from the first quarter of " &# million the republican spin machine is a little more uniform mr mccain got the game rolling last saturday when he damped expectations for his fund raising total "we started late and were going to pay a price for it " the senator told an audience in new hampshire funny a giuliani spokeswoman says he too "got a late start" on campaign fund raising a spokesman for mr romney says it would be "extraordinary" if his campaign raised &# million in the quarter mr romneys first fund raiser this year in january netted &# million economy searching for clues in jobs data by david wessel there are more storm clouds gathering on the economic horizon hopes that the housing market had touched bottom are fading so are expectations that businesses would pick up the slack by increasing their capital spending instead they seem to be cutting back the federal reserve has signaled it is less confident than it was a few weeks ago about its optimistic forecast for "moderate" growth the stock market is showing signs of worry too all this makes good fridays government snapshot of the march labor market particularly important to the economic weather forecast so far the job market has been surprisingly vigorous despite the slowdown in economic growth the current quarter is likely to be the fourth in a row with below growth unemployment in february was at a historically low defying expectations that it would be climbing by now and employers have added nearly jobs a month on average for each of the past six months hiring in health care hospitality and other services industries has more than offset job losses in manufacturing and home building "the question is will that continue " says nariman behravesh chief economist at forecaster global insight "thats the uncertainty if service employment is immune then this expansion will continue through this year if its not then were in trouble " as the latest report on the increase in consumer spending in february underscores american shoppers have so far been undeterred by the housing slump defying pessimists who predicted the housing bust would curb their profligacy a continuation of strength in the job market and of the recent long overdue upturn in wages would keep consumers spending a sharp falloff in hiring or in the length of the average workweek would give consumers less to spend it would be seen as an ominous sign that the economic expansion under way for more than five years since november according to the official scorekeepers may be nearing its end betting on credit card wielding american shoppers is usually wise but there is a new cloud looming lenders once eager to offer mortgages to the least creditworthy among us are now pulling back if that reticence to lend spreads to other consumer lending prime mortgages home equity lines credit cards auto loans americans would be forced to curtail their spending alan greenspan free to speak his mind for a price now that he is no longer chairman of the federal reserve recently put the odds of recession at one in three forecasters surveyed by wsj com put the odds at one in four those surveyed by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia see only a chance asked wednesday on capitol hill about mr greenspans recent market shaking odds chairman ben bernanke reiterated the feds expectation for "moderate growth " but emphasized "there are risks to the outlook in both directions so well have to watch to see if those risks materialize " one thing he insisted though the evidence refutes the notion that "expansions die of old age " autos with chrysler in flux private equity cash looks tempting by stephen power and joseph b white daimlerchrysler ag chief executive dieter zetsche heads to berlin next week for his companys annual shareholders meeting where he will face an audience angry about chryslers mounting losses and eager to see the u s business sold people close to mr zetsche are trying to temper expectations ahead of the meeting saying he isnt planning to discuss a possible chrysler deal in any detail but the surge in daimlerchryslers share price since mr zetsche said on feb that "all options" were open for chryslers future including a sale will make it difficult for him to scuttle a deal now among the many challenges mr zetsche faces is potential opposition to a chrysler sale from the labor representatives who make up half of daimlerchryslers supervisory board last month the board narrowly approved the framework of a deal with chinese auto maker chery automobile co under which chery would build subcompact cars for chrysler to sell in the u s labor representatives lined up against that deal in an unusual break with the german tradition of consensus now some daimlerchrysler labor representatives are speaking out against the idea of selling chrysler to a private equity buyer even as mr zetsches management team has continued to explore that possibility the three leading contenders are cerberus capital management lp a combination of the blackstone group and centerbridge partners lp and a group led by auto supplier magna international inc that may ultimately include a private equity investor union leaders including the heads of the canadian auto workers and the united auto workers in the u s worry in public that private equity buyers are interested only in "stripping and flipping" automotive companies leaving workers with lower wages and diminished benefits in fact the real relationship between private equity and labor unions particularly in the u s is more complicated and in certain cases more positive than such rhetoric suggests the private equity investors now looking at chrysler and other distressed detroit automotive properties know that there is little chance that they can quickly "flip" these companies through an initial public offering instead private equity investors will have to dig in restructure and rationalize chrysler and other old line u s auto sector companies to generate returns over the long haul most of the major actors in detroits auto industry recognize that the status quo cant hold detroits big three and their workers long ago lost their power to raise prices to cover rising labor and health care costs union leaders still will score points with the rank and file by blasting private equity in public but behind the scenes auto union leaders well aware of the toll bankruptcy has exacted of unions in airlines and steel recognize private equity money could be the best hope for salvaging something out of a broken industry longtime daimlerchrysler observers also expect the companys german labor representatives will come around to the idea of selling chrysler to private equity if that appears the only way to protect the companys cash cow mercedes benz from being dragged down as well
