the british retirees stepped back and surveyed the globe drawing upon the years of living abroad that mr richardss career in education had led to they considered overlooked spots such as croatia and bulgaria they even gave promising contenders a fighting chance first trying out south africa and then spain ultimately they picked phuket an island on thailands west coast blessed with sunshine tranquility and friendly people parts of the island were damaged in the tsunami but the richardss neighborhood was largely untouched the price of entry also worked in their favor for about &# they got a four bedroom luxury villa with a private pool courtyard and garden they figure thats less than half what it would have cost in similar spots in most european countries "this is a palace " mr richards says surveying his new home "what more could a man want " the richardses arent the only retirees from abroad happily settling into southeast asia more people from around the world are coming to the region drawn by word of mouth the easing of some requirements by regional governments and affordable living including cheap housing and relatively inexpensive medical care retirees everywhere "are taking a very close look at the relative quality and cost of living in deciding where to spend their retirement years " says su yen wong a managing director for mercer human resource consulting in singapore "much of the southeast asian region scores particularly favorably in the analysis " according to mercers cost of living study kuala lumpur ranked out of cities while bangkok was th and

ernesto m ordonez president of philippine retirement inc a nonprofit agency that helps foster cooperation between private companies and the governments philippine retirement authority which processes retirement visas with that ambitious goal and the competition in mind the philippines in january halved the size of the local bank deposit it requires retirees to make to prove their financial viability this after thailand stopped requiring any deposit from retirees as long as they can demonstrate a pension of about &# the philippines now requires &# per registered retiree including a spouse retirees also must show a monthly pension of &# for a single person or &# for a couple the good news for these countries is that the pool of potential retirees keeps expanding the retiree population defined as age and above from the u s europe japan south korea taiwan and mainland china totaled million in according to the healthcare coalition institute a santa fe springs calif industry research group and that figure should reach million by the institute says of course the concept of retirement means different things to different people some want to resettle permanently in a location others want to split their time between favored destinations take billy and marita thomson who recently purchased a retirement condo in the philippines subic bay area site of a former u s naval base northwest of manila they met there in the s when mr thomson now was a u s marine but having lived in alaska for the past years mr thomson isnt about to give up his salmon fishing so the couple plans to spend half the year in alaska and half the year in the philippines warmer climes where he enjoys swimming snorkeling and scuba diving and she visits her family others make a more permanent move jack simon a retired swimming coach from tampa fla chose to settle on penang an island off malaysias northwest coast the year old bachelor who is fluent in spanish considered settling somewhere closer to home such as mexico ecuador uruguay or chile but he had attended a work conference in the region a few years back and on a side trip to penang was impressed by the islands food friendliness climate and low costs mr simon describes life on penang as "unbelievably inexpensive " noting that he gets by mainly on his social security checks and that he rarely touches his savings he says he pays about &# a month for a two bedroom two bath condo that overlooks the andaman sea and is surrounded by tropical jungle he plays golf frequently with friends he has made there and dines out four or five times a week he says he buys all his food and local produce at a nearby mart and a maid cleans for him once a week all told mr simon says he lives on less than &# a month adding that he could never enjoy his current lifestyle on the florida coast spending the same amount mr simon says accessibility to good health care also influenced his decision to stay in penang not long after arriving he had major spinal surgery at island hospital a local private facility this was followed about a month later by minor prostate surgery "medical care here is first rate " he says "and i can speak firsthand " mr simon says he isnt insured so he paid cash and adds that the two procedures including hospital stays and hour home care totaled less than &# he figures the tab would have been at least times that in the u s the relatively low cost of living also drew takeshi yano and his wife junko to penang "its very very hard to live in japan with only a pension so retirees are moving here " says the former cosmetics importer from tokyo who used to travel to europe on business about four times a year mr yano who says the couple didnt know anyone in penang when they decided to move there receives a monthly government pension of about &# to &# depending on the exchange rate "i wanted to go to europe or the u s but the basic idea is can we live with the pension or not " on penang he says he manages by paying about &# a month in rent for a three bedroom sea view apartment mr yano says he plays golf once a week and enjoys socializing with other japanese retirees and expatriates as well as the locals who he says are very friendly such a lifestyle change however is not for everyone mr yano says some acquaintances on penang went back to japan after a few months because they couldnt adjust they didnt speak english almost everyone there does they also didnt own a car he says penang isnt pedestrian friendly and doesnt have a subway system or enough taxis and taxi drivers charge the japanese more he grouses other things some people have difficulty adjusting to are the lack of seasons and the sometimes oppressive heat and humidity and of course theres the distance from family and friends especially for retirees from europe and the u s then theres insurance medicare doesnt apply so medical expenses even though they may be much lower than in the u s or europe must be paid out of pocket if retirees arent covered by private local insurance which can be hard to obtain for anyone over back in thailand the richardses he is and she is are convinced they made the right decision married for years they spent all but five of those living outside britain they are still settling into phukets lifestyle having moved into their villa in late november but aside from minor annoyances like having to renew his thai retirement visa every months mr richards says he can find little to complain about "this seemed to be an ideal place to spend the rest of our lives " he says "we settled here and we have absolutely no regrets at all " mr mollman a writer in asia can be reached at encore wsj com ian gill a writer in manila the philippines contributed to this article
