u s attorneys debate continues with a fifth amendment twist in his editorial "the attorneys showdown " george terwilliger iii states that the current furor regarding attorney general gonzales revolves around "why the president fired some u s attorneys whom he had previously appointed " this analysis misses the point that has led to the controversy had the attorney general and his staff simply stated that the u s attorneys were asked to resign because they were not acting in philosophical accord with justice department or bush administration policy when it came to light that the eight attorneys were leaving their posts the matter may have attracted some negative attention and would have quickly faded instead in what has become an all too typical pattern the attorney general and staff followed by the white house decided that truth was optional and chose to characterize these as performance related removals when the highest law enforcement officer in the u s government chooses to dissemble rather than to tell the truth to cover a distasteful action he deserves to be placed under the harshest scrutiny and become a target for calls for his dismissal frank l reid farmington hills michigan the editorial wednesday supporting ms goodlings fifth amendment stand is misguided you may feel that the u s attorneys firing is a tempest in a teapot but a high government officials refusal to testify on grounds that the officials testimony will incriminate him or her criminally is a disaster for the republican party you can frame it however you want but her taking the fifth means that she believes she will be subject to criminal prosecution if she tells the truth the public can rightly ask what crimes is she hiding and it will drive an investigation that any republican would prefer not to see the fifth amendment does not protect her right to not testify because she would prefer not to only to not criminally implicate herself if she refuses to testify she should be fired if she knows of criminal activity it should be investigated and prosecuted vigorously chet brewer severna park md the investigation of possible misleading statements made to congress on the subject of the firing of u s attorneys is indeed a "perjury trap " as monica goodlings attorneys have suggested but what else could the investigation of a crime akin to perjury possibly be there are certainly enough contradictions and ambiguities on the subject to warrant further investigation heres hoping that the public officials entrusted with the stewardship of our system of justice have enough pride in their conduct to want to clarify and resolve any ambiguities in this matter if only to prove their competence and good intentions frank z riely jr new albany ind i dont understand why the bush administration is using the fifth amendment in further investigations by the senate if administrative aides cant get immunity then use the clinton defense "i dont remember " bob ziller new richmond wisc
