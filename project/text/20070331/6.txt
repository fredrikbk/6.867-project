beijings dilemma chinese premier wen jiabao stated last month that the communist party would "unswervingly adhere" to its present course for the next years he promised economic development but no democracy during the century supposedly belonging to beijing chinas current leaders have shown time and again that they are not committed to reform either economic or political but growth without reform will not be sustainable this goes against the conventional wisdom foreign observers whether "friends" or critics mostly agree that the party can maintain economic growth without democracy after all mr wens four years of rule have been marked by both galloping gdp growth last years official jump was the largest in more than a decade and increasingly repressive governance others believe that at the very least this repression will be offset by free market economic policies but while deng xiaoping was willing to introduce free market mechanisms it was only to help his socialism work better nor are todays leaders capitalists at heart in recent years they have sponsored technical reforms but have avoided structural change whenever possible yes china joined the world trade organization but beijing did so because it had to reverse a sharp fall in foreign investment because it did not want to be left out of then impending trade negotiations and because it feared the multifiber agreements expiration beijing did not sign on because officials wanted to reform state owned enterprises moreover there has been an inverse relationship between economic growth and reform in the post mao period especially in the last half decade this pattern shows that chinas leaders are not genuinely committed to free markets those countries that have more fully embraced them such as japan south korea and taiwan all grew faster in their initial development phases than china unfortunately for beijings leaders growth is causing serious imbalances in the economy and society corruption has never been so rife the thievery of officials costs an estimated to of gdp which last year totaled &# trillion the one party state has conducted anti corruption campaigns since but the country has only become more diseased over time the communist party has never been willing to clean house late party statesman chen yun once remarked "not fighting corruption would destroy the country fighting it would destroy the party " the countrys banking institutions have never been more debt ridden despite many "reform" initiatives since the central government asset management companies and the banks are carrying a total of approximately a trillion dollars in bad or questionable loans the amount only goes up over time because the party insists on using banks as a "secondary budget" to fund uneconomic projects moreover chinas environment is seriously degraded seven of the worlds dirtiest cities are located in the peoples republic there is unnatural flooding as well as unnatural drought the yellow river chinas second longest has dried up this year and most of the years since now the yangtze chinas longest is also dry in spots near chongqing a few years ago the science and technology ministry warned "the water resources crisis even threatens the future survival of the chinese nation " the party is not preventing industrys wasteful use of water and it is not protecting the environment because doing so would slow the economy and delivering prosperity is the primary basis of its legitimacy as a result of its fears beijings policies are leading the country to an ecological disaster for which there is no remedy in the meantime more than half of current gdp growth would be lost if the full costs of environmental damage were taken into account the communist party cannot solve such problems because the country has progressed about as far as it can within its existing political framework further reform would threaten the power of the party a market economy for example requires the rule of law which means institutional restraints on government yet the party insists on remaining above the law there has been little progress in institutionalizing legal norms during the last decade despite strenuous efforts by foreigners and chinese citizens alike without the rule of law the country will never halt the venality of officials or develop the institutions necessary for a modern economy the party cannot privatize many more enterprises for the simple reason that its name as literally translated is the party of public assets last month for example peoples daily reported that the government will take "absolute control" of seven "lifeline" industries cadres refuse to stop interfering in bank lending decisions because they personally profit from loans and state enterprises need free cash yet official meddling has resulted in the largest pile of bad loans in history the chinese want better lives in the past they pushed their leaders to sponsor change at the beginning of his tenure deng pursued reform in the countryside but his initial measures were half hearted and ineffective the peasants were the ones who started tending their own plots and pushed change far beyond what beijing then allowed deng also continued strict prohibitions against private industry but entrepreneurs flourished by running their businesses as "red hat" collectives and enterprises private companies operating under the guise of state ownership dengs reforms succeeded because the chinese people disobeyed his rules and created their own ways of doing things the same drive to get rid of socialist restrictions is evident today as the communist party races to keep up with the people it supposedly governs the property law just enacted by the rubber stamp national peoples congress merely ratifies existing practice forced upon the government by a people who have been determined to protect their possessions and their rights yesterday china progressed thanks to individual initiative today the party is restraining people rather than leading them the silver lining is that tomorrow the chinese people will use democratic institutions to solve problems that the one party state has demonstrated it cannot mr chang is the author of "nuclear showdown north korea takes on the world" random house
