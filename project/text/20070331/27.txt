encore a special report seaside struggles thinking about buying a retirement home at the beach read this first weather and water are the two perennials that have drawn millions of people to florida me among them i grew up in jacksonville in the northeast corner of florida while my family wasnt fortunate enough to own property on the ocean the intracoastal waterway or any of the numerous freshwater lakes that dot the state we were lucky enough to have friends who did its difficult now to remember which i preferred a week at the lake swimming and fishing for black bass or a week at the beach surf casting and riding the often piddling waves on my surf board no matter when i decided to return to florida in after some years away i had some definite ideas about where i wanted to live on the water salt water to be specific with easy access to the ocean for our foot sailboat had i not taken up sailing long after leaving florida an oceanfront condo would have been central to my plans but the lure of keeping my boat in the backyard was too strong weve never regretted our decision to buy first a house then a condo on the indian river in vero beach the sailboat is a few steps away and ive added a spiffy little flats boat to my fleet for scooting around the shallows of the river in pursuit of various tasty fish still for a long time whenever i rode my bicycle along state highway aia and caught a glimpse of the atlantic between the beautiful beachfront homes and high rise condominiums i grew a little wistful for the idea of watching the sun rise out of the ocean each morning unimpeded by intervening trees or buildings until i got to talking to some neighbors rennie and walter smith had been coming to florida for years during the winter sometimes staying on the beach other times on the indian river they eventually bought a riverfront condo but when a charming but rundown mediterranean style oceanfront house came up for sale one built in among the first in vero beach they decided to indulge two passions restoring the house to its original ornate condition and being on the ocean the enchantment didnt last long "we put stainless steel door handles on all the doors and in two months they were starting to rust " says mr smith "then all the light fixtures started corroding and falling apart and we didnt even keep the house open if the doors or windows had been open to get the sea breeze it would have been a lot worse as it was we had to wash the windows every day because of the spray " the corrosive salt air became even more problematic when powerful winter noreasters swept salt spray ashore in large amounts killing lawns and shrubbery even worse the smiths house was about feet behind the dune line that separated it from the ocean three times in five years noreasters scoured away the dunes each time the smiths had to have new sand trucked in at a cost of about &# and the strong winds blowing sand against the window panes scratched the glass florida is notorious as a landing zone for hurricanes while none came ashore in vero beach during the smiths time in their oceanfront house mrs smith says they worried constantly about the threat especially when they were at their home in illinois it didnt help that when a hurricane would blow up at sea tv news crews often would set up their cameras directly in front of the smiths oceanfront house for live reports by forecasters even the magnificent ocean views had a downside "we saw some absolutely gorgeous sunrises and moonrises " mr smith recalls "but for the most part at night theres nothing out there to look at " today the smiths spend their winters in vero beach in a tasteful house on a cove off the indian river their boat rocks gently at its slip in the backyard the lawn and shrubbery are immaculate and nothing is rusting oceanfront living wasnt for them says mrs smith "were water people but we would never go back to the ocean " she says "its just too brutal it was nothing but constant upkeep and maintenance " realtors and builders confirm that for some life on the beach isnt everything they expect it to be "people come down from the north and think they want to live on the ocean " says robert dewaters a real estate agent in vero beach "but after a few years a lot of them decide theyd rather live on the riverside " he says the smiths complaint about nothing to see at night is surprisingly common especially among people living in high rise condominiums "you look out and its pitch black " he says "there are no reference points it can be disorienting " another unanticipated problem he says is a lack of privacy most beaches in florida are open to the public and it seems that beachcombers dont hesitate to walk into the nearest backyard and use a hose to rinse off sand and salt water some are bold enough to walk up to windows and peer inside but the salt air is the real villain in oceanside living clifford ruff an electrical contractor who does a lot of work in beach and riverside homes contends that problems caused by salt air are even worse than most people suspect in oceanfront homes or condos that were built using metal conduits for electrical lines it becomes virtually impossible to replace or run new wires through the conduits after several years "the builders tried to keep the water out when the houses were under construction but all it takes is one rain shower to pick up any salt on the outside and carry it inside the conduit " says mr ruff "then it rusts and the rust swells up and clogs the conduit you cant get old wires out or get new wires in " pvc conduit has pretty much solved that problem in newer buildings he says but theres an even bigger problem afflicting structures built of concrete salt laden moisture can seep through the tiniest cracks in concrete and reach the steel reinforcing bar inside when the bar rusts it swells and eventually breaks the concrete that can cause huge problems a few years ago my bike rides took me past two big high rise condo buildings south of vero beach where construction crews labored for months to replace the concrete balconies after corrosion in the rebar began cracking the concrete we live about eight tenths of a mile from the beach now and salt isnt a big problem for the condo although after a strong noreaster i find the windshield of my car frosted over with a light salt spray "its a function of how many trees and buildings you have between you and the ocean " says mr ruff "theres a definite difference in the amount of salt corrosion you see as you move away from the ocean only people with deep pockets can afford to do the maintenance required for oceanfront property people who dont do it after two or three years the whole house needs to be redone " the biggest problem salt water causes in the moorings the development where we live is to the seven miles or so of seawall that define the coves and passes of the neighborhood salt water splashing up on the seawall during periods of high winds works it way through cracks and just like in the concrete condo balconies rusts the reinforcing bar resulting in cracked concrete many homeowners have replaced the cap on their portion of the seawall at a cost of thousands of dollars but judging by the big chunks of concrete that are missing and the rust streaks running down parts of the sea wall in front of other homes quite a few more face the prospect of repairs of course oceanfront homes and condos in florida arent the only ones affected by salt spray and high winds anyone living on the ocean anywhere has to contend with the same problems it just seems exacerbated here because so much new oceanfront construction has occurred in the past years and the problems are starting to become more apparent theres no question that a home on the beach has its delights the surf the crunch of sand underfoot the serenity people have always embraced oceanfront living and always will but anyone planning such a step should do it with eyes wide open in florida at least some people are discovering that the biggest threat to beach property isnt necessarily a hurricane sweeping ashore but rather the all but invisible salt mist that quietly blows in every day as part of the beautiful view and the ocean breeze mr sease is a retired reporter and editor of the wall street journal living in vero beach fla he can be reached at encore wsj com
