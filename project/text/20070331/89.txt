the conscience of the colonel lt col stuart couch volunteered to prosecute terrorists then he decided one had been tortured washington d c when the pentagon needed someone to prosecute a guantanamo bay prisoner linked to it turned to lt col v stuart couch a marine corps pilot and veteran prosecutor lt col couch brought a personal connection to the job his old marine buddy michael "rocks" horrocks was co pilot on united the second plane to strike the world trade center on sept the prisoner in question mohamedou ould slahi had already been suspected of terrorist activity after the attacks he was fingered by a senior al qaeda operative for helping assemble the so called hamburg cell which included the hijacker who piloted united into the south tower to col couch mr slahi seemed a likely candidate for the death penalty "of the cases i had seen he was the one with the most blood on his hands " col couch says but nine months later in what he calls the toughest decision of his military career col couch refused to proceed with the slahi prosecution the reason he concluded that mr slahis incriminating statements the core of the governments case had been taken through torture rendering them inadmissible under u s and international law the slahi case marks a rare instance of a military prosecutor refusing to bring charges because he thought evidence was tainted by torture for col couch it also represented a wrenching personal challenge laid out starkly before him was a collision between the governments objectives and his moral compass these kinds of concerns will likely become more prevalent as other high level al qaeda detainees come before military commissions set up by the bush administration guantanamo prosecutors estimate that at least of cases depend on statements taken from prisoners making the credibility of such evidence critical to any convictions in mr slahis case col couch would uncover evidence the prisoner had been beaten and exposed to psychological torture including death threats and intimations that his mother would be raped in custody unless he cooperated raised in asheboro n c col couch now years old was an eagle scout a graduate of duke and commander of his naval rotc battalion an anglican col couch says he counts among his heroes two men known for making a public commitment to their faith c s lewis the academic and book author and dietrich bonhoeffer the lutheran pastor hanged by the nazis in in col couch joined the marines to be a pilot before an assignment on the squadrons legal desk inspired him to enroll in law school after graduating from campbell university buies creek n c he was assigned to the team prosecuting a flight crew for a incident in aviano italy where a marine prowler clipped a ski gondola cable killing he still keeps in touch with relatives of the accidents victims col couch left active duty but found private practice boring after he asked to return to the military when president bush issued his nov order creating the first iteration of military commissions he volunteered "i did that to get a crack at the guys who attacked the united states " he says "i wanted to do what i could do with the skill set that i had " col couch began his assignment at the office of military commissions in august soon after arriving at the commissions offices in crystal city arlington va he was handed files on several guantanamo prisoners the slahi file stood out as the one directly connected to mr slahi now is the eighth of children born to a mauritanian camel herder according to his lawyers he studied electrical engineering in germany and later ran an internet cafe before u s authorities tried unsuccessfully to link him to the so called millennium plot to blow up los angeles international airport mauritanian authorities picked him up after sept and shipped him to jordan according to testimony he gave to a guantanamo detention board the u s got a break one year later when ramzi binalshibh a top al qaeda operative was captured in pakistan he told the cia that in mr slahi sent him and three future hijackers mohammed atta ziad jarrah and marwan al shehhi from germany to pakistan and then to al qaeda headquarters in afghanistan there according to the commission mr bin laden assigned them to the operation but beyond mr binalshibhs uncorroborated statements col couch had little additional evidence in crystal city morale was sinking several junior officers complained that in its rush to win convictions the office was proceeding with shaky cases overlooking allegations of abuse and failing to protect exculpatory evidence allegations of torture at places such as abu ghraib had not yet surfaced but some officers were starting to express their unease in private a handful of prosecutors would later quit rather than take part in trials they considered rigged subsequent internal reviews found no criminal wrongdoing but prompted a shake up in which the then chief military commissions prosecutor was ousted col couch had his own misgivings on his first visit to guantanamo in october he recalls preparing to watch an interrogation of a detainee when he was distracted by heavy metal music accompanied by an escort he saw a prisoner shackled to a cell floor rocking back and forth mumbling as strobe lights flashed two men in civilian dress shut the cell door and told col couch to move along "did you see that " he asked his escort the escort replied "yeah its approved " col couch says the treatment resembled the abuse he had been trained to resist if captured he never expected americans would be the ones employing it the incident "started keeping me up at night " he says "i couldnt stop thinking about it " col couch contacted a senior marine lawyer who had been an informal mentor the officer said "i know theres a lot of stuff going on and thats why we need people like yourself in this situation " col couch recalls "youre shirking your responsibility if youve got issues and youre not willing to do something about it " "he was looking for a sanity check asking am i crazy or does this smell bad to you " the marine lawyer now a retired brigadier general recalls "my response was yeah this is a problem and you need to work this problem " col couchs wife kim a nurse says her husband began to rue each coming week "i called it the sunday night blues " she says "it got worse and worse " under the pentagon structure col couch had no direct contact with his potential defendants but received instead summaries of their statements in late mr slahi suddenly started corroborating the binalshibh allegations "after a while i just couldnt keep up with him because things were coming out every day " col couch says "he was giving like a "whos who" of al qaeda in germany and all of europe " the sanitized reports reaching col couch made no mention of what spurred this cooperation intelligence agencies refused to share all the information they had on the prisoner a colleague let on that mr slahi had begun the "varsity program" an informal name for the special interrogation plan authorized by then defense secretary donald rumsfeld for the most recalcitrant guantanamo prisoners col couch says he and his case investigator an agent detailed from the naval criminal investigative service began an "under the table" effort to find out what made mr slahi break col couch says he was suspicious about the sudden change and felt he needed to know all the circumstances before bringing the case to trial "it was like hansel and gretel following bread crumbs " col couch says the agent spoke to intelligence officers and others with more direct knowledge pursued documents with details of the interrogations and passed his findings on to the prosecutor what emerged col couch believed was torture initially mr slahi said he was pleased to be taken to guantanamo "i thought this is america not jordan and they are not going to beat you " he told his detention hearing but after mr binalshibh named him as a top al qaeda member "my life changed dramatically " mr slahi said the account of mr slahis treatment has been pieced together from interviews with government officials official reports and testimony as well as mr slahis attorneys and col couch col couch wouldnt discuss classified information including aspects of the slahi interrogation involving the cia initially mr slahi denied having al qaeda connections frustrating his interrogators on may a federal bureau of investigation interrogator said "this was our last session he told me that i was not going to enjoy the time to come " in the following weeks mr slahi said he was placed in isolation subjected to extreme temperatures beaten and sexually humiliated the detention board transcript states that at this point "the recording equipment began to malfunction " it summarizes mr slahis missing testimony as discussing "how he was tortured while here at gtmo by several individuals " mr slahi was put under more intense interrogation on july a masked interrogator told mr slahi he had dreamed of watching detainees dig a grave according to a pentagon report into detainee abuse at guantanamo headed by air force lt gen randall schmidt and army brig gen john furlow gen furlow later testified that mr slahi was "the highest value detainee" at guantanamo "the key orchestrator of the al qaeda cell in europe " the interrogator said he saw "a plain pine casket with mr slahis identification number painted in orange lowered into the ground " three days later the interrogator told mr slahi "that his family was incarcerated " the report said on aug an interrogation chief visited the prisoner posing as a white house representative named "navy capt collins " the report said he gave the prisoner a forged memorandum indicating that mr slahis mother was being shipped to guantanamo and that officials had concerns about her safety as the only woman amid hundreds of male prisoners according a person familiar with the matter "capt collins" told mr slahi "that if he wanted to help his family he should tell them everything they wanted to know " the report continued the same day an interrogator made a "death threat" to mr slahi gen schmidt said in testimony to the senate armed services committee according to records cited by the report the interrogator advised mr slahi "to use his imagination to think of the worst possible scenario he could end up in " in his detention board testimony mr slahi provided further details as did other people familiar with the matter two men took a shackled blindfolded mr slahi to a boat for a journey into the waters of guantanamo bay the hour long trip apparently led mr slahi to think he was to be killed and in fear he urinated in his pants after making land "two arab guys" took him away beat him and turned him over to a "doctor who was not a regular doctor but part of the team " mr slahi said the doctor "was cursing me and telling me very bad things he gave me a lot of medication to make me sleep " mr slahi said after two or three weeks mr slahi said he broke "because they said to me either i am going to talk or they will continue to do this " on sept according to the pentagon report mr slahi asked to see "capt collins " mr slahi corroborated the account of mr binalshibh and provided an extensive list of other al qaeda names in later testimony to the army inspector general gen schmidt said he concluded that the interrogation chief "was a rogue guy " a "zealot" who "essentially was having a ball " a pentagon spokesman says the interrogation chief who invoked his right against self incrimination and didnt testify was not court martialed the spokesman declines to say what discipline he received military and law enforcement officials started warning the bush administration in that its unorthodox interrogation practices which the president has called "tough" and "necessary " were hurting the ability of prosecutors to bring cases to court officials expect the concern to arise in particular with "high value" al qaeda suspects transferred to guantanamo in september after years of secret cia interrogation they include khalid sheikh mohammed the man who claimed responsibility for planning some detainees including mr mohammed have alleged they were tortured pentagon reviews documented cruel and degrading treatment while declining to classify such abuse as torture "theres a serious question of whether they will ever be able to legitimately prosecute those individuals " if necessary evidence was produced through torture says retired maj gen thomas romig who served as the armys top uniformed lawyer the judge advocate general from to gen romig recently appointed dean at washburn university law school topeka kan says within the government "there was a view that we have got to get intelligence out of these guys and we dont care we if we prosecute them or not " the military commissions trying the cases of foreign terrorists dont hew to the rules that govern civilian courts or courts martial the military commissions act permits use of evidence obtained before dec through "cruel inhuman or degrading" methods although it bars any obtained by torture top u s government officials wont specify which practices cross the line beyond stating that prisoners should be treated "humanely " such ambiguity has forced decision making down the chain of command even guantanamos chief prosecutor air force col moe davis says hes still not sure how the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment applies to military commissions a report into abuses at guantanamo concluded that the "threats" made to mr slahi "do not rise to the level of torture as defined under u s law" but did violate the uniform code of military justice which governs the conduct of the armed forces the pentagon wont say how the report reached that conclusion by may col couch had most of the picture relating to mr slahis treatment and faced a painful dilemma could he seek a conviction based on statements he thought were taken through torture as permitted by president bushs november military commission order citing a "state of emergency " or was he nonetheless bound by the torture convention which bars using statements taken "as a result of torture as evidence in any proceedings " the convention says "no exceptional circumstances whatsoever" can be cited to justify torture which it defines broadly the federal statute implementing the treaty contains additional definitions including the "threat of imminent death" or "severe physical pain or suffering " as well as the actual or threatened use of "mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality " col couch was uneasy over interfering with plans to try mr slahi given the detainees history he turned to others with his dilemma including marine lawyers he knew and his wifes two brothers one a protestant theologian the other a retired marine infantry officer because of the classified nature of the information col couch didnt give them specifics about the case and spoke only in generalities their advice conflicted "he wanted to be a good solider and yet on the other hand felt his duty to his god to be the greatest duty that he had " recalls bill wilder director of educational ministries at the center for christian study charlottesville va "he said more than once to me that human beings are created in the image of god and as a result we owe them a certain amount of dignity " mr wilder says he agreed with col couchs concerns "stuart you need to pray about this " mr wilder says he advised briant wilder the other brother and a former maine lieutenant urged col couch to instead consider the context of the war on terrorism where obtaining intelligence could be crucial to protecting innocent lives "i have to also say that i dont agree with everybodys definition of torture " mr wilder says "if some of the things that people say are torture were torture then i was tortured at officer candidate school at quantico and so was he " in may attending a baptism at virginias falls church col couch joined the congregation in reciting the liturgy the reading concluded as is typical with the priest asking if congregants will "respect the dignity of every human being " "when i heard that i knew i gotta get off the fence " col couch says "here was somebody i felt was connected to but in our zeal to get information we had compromised our ability to prosecute him " he says in retrospect the tipping point came with the forged letter about mr slahis mother "for me that was just enough is enough i had seen enough i had heard enough i had read enough i said thats it " in may at a meeting with the then chief prosecutor army col bob swann col couch dropped his bombshell he told col swann that in addition to legal reasons he was "morally opposed" to the interrogation techniques "and for that reason alone refused to participate in the slahi prosecution in any manner " col swann was indignant col couch says replying "what makes you think youre so much better than the rest of us around here " col couch says he slammed his hand on col swanns desk and replied "thats not the issue at all thats not the point " an impassioned debate followed the prosecutor recalls col swann said the torture convention didnt apply to military commissions col couch asked his superior to cite legal precedent that would allow the president to disregard a treaty the meeting ended when col swann asked the prosecutor to turn over the slahi files so the case could be reassigned col couch recalls through a spokesman col swann declined to comment for this article col swann retired from the army in he continues as a civilian employee to serve as deputy chief prosecutor playing a major role in commission operations other trial prosecutors in the office say they respected col couchs decision "i thought his conduct was perfectly appropriate and i agreed with his approach " says retired navy cmdr scott lang now a state prosecutor in virginia a week later col couch put his position in writing and asked that his concerns be raised with the pentagons general counsel william j haynes ii the legal adviser to the military commissions office air force brig gen thomas hemingway says "mr haynes was not informed of the issues raised by lt col couch nor did he expect to be told about all internal operations within the office of military commissions " gen hemingway says col swann "was aware the interrogation techniques used were under investigation at the time lt col couch expressed misgivings about the information he had received col swann removed lt col couch from the case to assuage his concerns " in a written statement the defense department says it "cannot comment on mohamedou ould slahi because he is under investigation it would be inappropriate for us to discuss ongoing cases that are pending prosecution " in march col couch considered quitting frustrated by how the office was run lt col daniel daugherty one of col couchs best friends urged him in an email to reconsider "personally i would rather be fired than quit " col daugherty wrote "being fired for your ethics is in my view better than walking away " with the slahi prosecution on ice col couch continued work on other cases including another "varsity program" prisoner mohammmed al qahtani who according to army report overseen by gens schmidt and furlow had been made to wear womens underwear leashed forced to perform dog tricks and berated as a homosexual col couch refused to use statements obtained during these interrogations but he determined the prosecution could continue based on a separate source of evidence compiled by the fbi before mr qahtanis guantanamo interrogation he was also one of the prosecutors who worked on the case of salim hamdan mr bin ladens former driver mr hamdans case would eventually go to the supreme court which used the case to strike down the administrations first attempt to create a military commissions system col davis the guantanamo chief prosecutor says mr slahi remains among the or so prisoners potentially eligible for trial he says no one is assigned to the case and that its unclear when mr slahi will be charged due to col couchs concerns and a staff shortage today mr slahi is detained in private quarters at guantanamo bay with a television a computer and a tomato patch to tend according to people familiar with the matter "since i really have no complaints " mr slahi told a military detention board he has asked to be resettled in the u s an option pentagon officials have not ruled out col davis declines to comment on plea negotiations a lawyer representing mr slahi nancy hollander says that if charged with a crime mr slahi would plead not guilty in a september letter to his attorneys mr slahi joked about their request that he detail his discussions with interrogators "are you out of your mind how can i render uninterrupted interrogation that has been lasting the last years thats like asking charlie sheen how many women he dated " mr slahi writes he divided his time into pre and post torture eras in the latter he wrote "i yessed every accusation my interrogators made " col couch had been assigned to the prosecutors office for a three year stint when it came to an end col couch decided not to renew his assignment he says there was no attempt to remove him from office after he left defense secretary rumsfeld awarded col couch the defense meritorious service medal for his work on guantanamo prosecutions as is typical when officers move on to new assignments the citation describes him as "steady in faith possessed by moral courage and relentless in the pursuit of excellence " in august he took on a new assignment as a judge on the navy marine corps court of criminal appeals col couch says hes still frustrated that the actions of the u s government helped ruin the case against mr slahi "im hoping theres some non tainted evidence out there that can put the guy in the hole " he says
