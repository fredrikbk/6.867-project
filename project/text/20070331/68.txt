pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings the uses of second rate art you can learn a lot from not quite masterworks new york man cannot live by masterpieces alone most of us require a certain amount of candy in our cultural diets though some austere spirits manage to do without it artur schnabel the great austrian pianist was famous for playing only the most sublime of musical compositions his idea of a perfect program was five beethoven sonatas and he never gave encores to schnabels credit he was self deprecating about his high mindedness "in my concerts " he quipped "the second half is also boring " it wasnt of course but in lesser hands it might have been you can have too much of anything even perfection spending a month reading nothing but tolstoy is like spending a week eating nothing but steak not only does second rate art have its charms but it also has its uses as i was reminded when i paid a visit to "van gogh and expressionism " an exhibition on display at the neue galerie new york through july the plus paintings and drawings in the show include a number of pieces by other turn of the century artists who were influenced by vincent van goghs passionate boldly colored style one of them egon schiele painted a picture called "the artists bedroom in neulengbach" that is an obvious knockoff of van goghs "the bedroom" to see the two paintings together at the neue galerie is to learn something crucial about the meaning of greatness schiele was a master in his own right but his specialty was kinky sexual melodrama when he tried to assimilate van goghs very different style he lost his head as well as his individuality though his homage to "the bedroom" is fascinating its self consciously even awkwardly composed and you cant look at it for long without being pulled irresistibly back to the better painting that inspired it so why bother with "the artists bedroom in neulengbach" in the first place because among other things it shows you what makes "the bedroom" so great thats one of the uses of second rate art it helps you to appreciate greatness by putting it in perspective i saw "death of a salesman" on tv when i was and thought it a deathless masterpiece later i went off to college and shared this jejune opinion with one of my teachers instead of teasing me for my naivete he simply asked "how much shakespeare have you seen " i admitted that my hands on experience of the bard was limited to franco zeffirellis flashy film of "romeo and juliet " he gently suggested that i take a crack at "hamlet " i did so and was immediately enlightened in part because arthur miller had already given me a yardstick with which to measure shakespeares infinite superiority you can learn a similar lesson from forgeries i love the art of milton avery so much so that i bought one of his etchings a couple of years ago averys deceptively simple at times almost childlike style is easy to imitate as i discovered when i started looking him up on ebay a lot of phony "averys" have surfaced on ebay of late and some of them actually look halfway decent at first glance but all you have to do to know youre being fooled is go back to the real right thing as mark twain pointed out "the difference between the almost right word &amp the right word is really a large matter its the difference between the lightning bug &amp the lightning " another giant step in my artistic education came when i started systematically exploring the art museums of americas small and medium sized cities until then my experience of art had been limited to the star masterpieces that hang in such world class institutions as new yorks metropolitan museum of art and the art institute of chicago and it had never occurred to me that a truly great painter could ever be less than great but when i went to the indianapolis museum of art and looked at claude monets "charing cross bridge " i saw that even a master can have his off days you couldnt mistake it for the work of any other painter and id be more than happy to hang it over my fireplace yet my snap reaction was that it seemed more like a hasty sketch than a fully realized piece of work and when i returned to "charing cross bridge" a few years later i knew id been right is monet a lesser master because he didnt always hit the high c hardly t s eliot rightly called "titus andronicus" "one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written " but shakespeare is still a giant the barnes foundation in philadelphia is full of flabby soft centered renoir nudes but that doesnt make "luncheon of the boating party " the centerpiece of washingtons phillips collection any less spectacular a genius should be judged by his best work not his worst and its easier to appreciate the former once youve seen the latter mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
