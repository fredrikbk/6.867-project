pursuits sports baseball the real jackie robinson story his historic career has become an iconic american tale but some of the most oft repeated elements are actually myth as a new book reveals an excerpt jackie robinson and branch rickey met for the first time on aug in rickeys office on montague street in brooklyn on one wall hung portraits of abraham lincoln and leo durocher manager of the brooklyn dodgers goldfish swam in a lighted tank in a corner of the room robinson and rickey stared at each other in silence fifteen seconds a minute went by and still neither man said a word rickey gazed out from his wire rimmed glasses his doughy face offering no hint of his mood he was a potato shaped man in a rumpled jacket and custom made bowtie he twirled an unlit cigar in his hand a great judge of character rickey now peered at robinson as if he were looking through the young mans dark brown skin and into the depths of his soul robinson stared back it was rickey who finally broke the silence "do you have a girl " he asked yes robinson said he had a girlfriend rickey advised him to get married in job interviews rickey usually followed up the marital inquiry with questions about baseball asking pitchers how they gripped their curves and first basemen about the best way to hold runners near the bag in robinsons case though he didnt spend much time on the game he got down to business fast standing up and shouting a series of dagger like questions designed to test robinsons temper "what will you do what will you do when they call you a black son of a bitch when they not only turn you down for a hotel room but also curse you out " as he went on bellowing about supercilious waiters rude railroad conductors vicious base runners and beanball hurling pitchers he stepped closer and closer to robinson who sat by now with his hands clenched firmly behind his back finally rickey stepped up to robinson and pretended to throw a punch at the young black mans face "what would you do " he shouted robinson calmed himself he asked if rickey wanted a man who didnt have guts enough to fight back no the boss answered "i want a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back " and thats when robinson said he would do it he would curb his wrath the very force that he had always felt essential to his success he would do it for his girlfriend he said and for mr rickey and for black people across the country thus was born one of baseballs favorite legends the story of the meeting between rickey and robinson has been told in countless media passed down through the generations shined up and smoothed over so that it has become one of americas great fables but in one important way the accounts are misleading because they often suggest that rickey chose robinson for his ability to turn the other cheek had rickey wanted a pacifist he might have selected any one of half a dozen men with milder constitutions and better baseball credentials than jack roosevelt robinson the truth is that rickey wanted an angry black man he wanted someone big enough and strong enough to intimidate as well as someone intelligent enough to understand the historic nature of his role he wanted a man who would swallow his rage and turn it into energy perhaps he even wanted a dark skinned man whose presence would be more strongly felt more plainly obvious although on this point rickey was uncharacteristically silent the dodger boss wanted a man who would not just raise the issue of equal rights but would press it robinson succeeded in large part over the course of the season because he mastered his anger and of course because he hit the ball hard and terrorized opponents with his breathless base running but there were times when the lid came off the pot and his true emotions bubbled up when such moments did arise they often coincided with a game against the st louis cardinals and on at least two occasions they involved the cards feisty young catcher joe garagiola on may the dodgers played for the first time that season at sportsmans park in st louis where fans had been segregated by race until it was the first meeting of the dodgers and cardinals since rumors appeared in the press that the cards had threatened to go on strike rather than play ball with a black man in his first at bat robinson engaged in a seemingly harmless skirmish with garagiola but even seemingly harmless skirmishes were tricky business in when black and white ballplayers remained almost entirely unacquainted and when relationships between black and white americans were often built on mistrust and misunderstanding garagiola was years old tall and pudgy the son of italian immigrants and a native of the st louis neighborhood referred to as dago hill "watch this guy " the catcher shouted to the infield as robinson stepped up to bat "he gets all his hits bunting thats the only way he can get them " garagiola kept it up "this guy cant hit " "whats your batting average " robinson asked the catcher over his shoulder "oh about two points lower than yours " he answered "but if i could run as fast as you id have a real good average " in fact garagiola was hitting about a hundred points lower than robinson "no matter how fast you run joe " robinson shot back "you couldnt hit as much as you weigh " garagiola squatted behind home plate at about pounds robinson went hitless in the game but he walked and scored a run on a risky dash for the plate that surprised the cardinal infield he showed garagiola and the cardinals that he had found at least a couple of outlets for his anger all season long he would quietly answer his critics both with his mouth and with his aggressive play he would use everything but his fists on the train back to brooklyn after the game some of robinsons teammates began talking about the new man expressing admiration for his competitive spirit and knowledge of the game there was a growing sense among the dodgers if not among the rest of the teams in the national league that they would somehow survive their experiment in integration as the spring turned to summer the dodgers did more than survive defying the odds makers they grabbed hold of first place and never let go even as some of the most prejudiced southerners on the team admitted that robinson had made them winners racist resentment still rose up from time to time among opposing players in august there was an incident once again involving the cardinals in which enos "country" slaughter had driven his spikes through the back of robinsons foot on a close play at first base robinson believed it was intentional but he did not respond then three weeks later it happened again this time the spikes tearing through robinsons cleats belonged to joe garagiola in the bottom of the second inning during a game played on sept the cardinal catcher swung at the first pitch a fastball up and away producing a routine ground ball to short he ran hard to first trying to stay out of the double play and stepped on the foot of robinson who was playing first base the result was a torn shoe but no injury the next inning robinson came to the plate with two outs and two men on the cardinals leading before the first pitch he turned and said something to garagiola garagiola said something in return robinson claimed years later that garagiolas remark was racist garagiola a popular player who was never accused of prejudice in the course of his long career as an athlete and broadcaster has always insisted that it was not whatever was said both men became incensed garagiola rose from his crouch to more effectively tell robinson how he felt robinson stepped in garagiolas direction to offer a rebuttal quickly umpire beans reardon stepped between them while reardon and garagiola went at it robinson stepped back clapped his hands and appeared to laugh that only made garagiola angrier for a moment it looked like the men might fight but clyde sukeforth the brooklyn coach rushed from the dugout to pull robinson away when the game resumed robinson swung at a belt high fastball and popped out to end the inning the fracas with the cardinal catcher made an angry man of robinson never a good thing for dodger opponents in his next trip to the plate robinson said nothing to the catcher he stepped into the box worked the count to full and then swung at another belt high fastball this time he banged it deep into the left field seats to tie the score at that very moment back in new york fans were watching a negro league doubleheader at the polo grounds new york cubans versus newark eagles suddenly at a moment of no import in the game the crowd began to buzz and then roar men stood and danced in the aisles a minute later news of robinsons blast came across the wire service ticker robinsons fans at the polo grounds had heard it first on their portable radios the long term consequences of the garagiola robinson spat were less predictable and beyond the imagination of anyone involved in a chinese born american named bette bao lord published a slender book of fiction intended for young readers she called it "in the year of the boar and jackie robinson " the autobiographical story describes a young girls passage from china to america and her adjustment to life in brooklyn in the storys hero doesnt know english and makes few friends until she discovers jackie robinson and baseball and learns that america really is the land of opportunity a staple of elementary school classrooms "in the year of the boar and jackie robinson" has been read by countless thousands of children establishing garagiola as a bigot in the minds of a generation that never saw him play when garagiolas grandchildren read the book they were stunned asking him "was that you papa " why had he hated jackie robinson they wanted to know in recent interviews garagiola begged for his encounter with robinson to be forgotten he seemed pained and confused shocked at how a seemingly forgettable bit of ballpark bickering from ages ago continued to haunt him "look " he said his voice breaking "jackie was a firebrand even in he was a competitor youre fighting for the pennant and who cares what color he is he said something to me i said why dont you just hit and then here comes sukeforth ive lived with this thing unfairly it was a little bit of jockeying to break his concentration thats all it wasnt even an argument you just dont know the grief and aggravation this has caused " the dodgers went on to win the game and two of three in the series cementing their hold on the pennant robinson went six for with three walks and a stolen base in the three games again and again he made life miserable for the cards in the final game the cardinals were threatening with two out in the eighth inning robinson chased after a twisting foul pop when he reached the lip of the dodger dugout no more room to run he hurled his body down the steps and stabbed at the ball with his glove as robinson leapt so did his teammate ralph branca leaving his seat on the bench the ball plopped into robinsons glove just as branca reached robinson branca threw his arms around robinsons waist and tackled him on the infield grass preventing what might have been a nasty tumble onto the concrete floor of the dugout as the dodgers jogged off the field they rushed to congratulate robinson on one of the seasons great catches and to praise branca for another no one was more impressed with brancas grab than robinson when the season began six months earlier he wasnt sure anyone would have cared enough to break his fall adapted from "opening day the story of jackie robinsons first season " by jonathan eig copyright jonathan eig published by simon &amp schuster used by permission
