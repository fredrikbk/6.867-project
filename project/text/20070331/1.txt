arbitration is a tough climb some ask if system is stacked against investors when the supreme court allowed brokerage firms to make their customers sign arbitration agreements years ago and thereby relinquish the option to take their claim to the courts many hailed it as a faster cheaper and more efficient alternative but as the system has aged what looked like an attractive way to resolve disputes between investors and brokers has come under fire lawmakers such as rep barney frank d mass chairman of the house financial services committee and regulators like massachusetts secretary of state william galvin have said they think the system needs a fresh look "its important that the arbitration or remedy side of disputes be fair and i dont think it is " mr galvin says "that doesnt mean the investors always have to win " but the process "shouldnt be stacked against" them such concerns are taking on a new urgency with the looming consolidation of the industrys two major self regulators the national association of securities dealers and nyse group inc s new york stock exchange the deal is expected to be completed later this year investors will then have access to just one arbitration forum when arbitration first became required proponents argued the benefits of streamlining would easily outweigh some of the sacrifices investors would have to make in arbitration there is no broad right of appeal and cases are heard by a three person panel instead of a jury of ones peers for the most part parties can get through the arbitration system faster than they would in a court of law but as the volume of claims and the amounts of money requested have grown some are questioning whether its sacrifices should continue to be mandatory while few critics suggest scrapping the arbitration system altogether the consolidation has some legislators regulators and lawyers on both sides questioning whether the system is as efficient and fair as it was intended to be indeed arbitration has grown more like the court system it replaced with both sides hauling in expert witnesses making motions like those seen in court and arguing over discovery requests all of which lead to longer and more expensive hearings it isnt just the efficiency of arbitration that is under scrutiny some investor advocates are questioning its essential fairness pointing to the presence of an industry affiliated arbitrator on arbitration panels while brokers and firms view those arbitrators as useful purveyors of information about how the industry works those representing investors worry that arbitrators relying on brokerage houses for their salaries have too much influence and cant remain impartial another major concern the falling win rates for investors in investors in nasd arbitration won of cases decided by arbitrators down from a recent high of in a win is when a claimant receives monetary damages or nonmonetary relief whats more if their claim is against a large firm any winnings they receive are likely to be only a small fraction of what they claimed according to preliminary data from a new study historically investors have won about half of arbitration cases and when they win they receive on average about half of what they requested but researchers edward oneal an assistant professor of finance at wake forest universitys babcock graduate school of management and dan solin a lawyer and investment adviser discovered a surprising trend against three of the biggest brokerage firms merrill lynch &amp co morgan stanley and citigroup inc s smith barney clients recovery rates are about the study which hasnt yet been finalized looked at all nasd and new york stock exchange arbitration awards from to "generally as you move up the hierarchy the recovery percentages decline to a significant degree " says mr oneal who has served as an expert witness in arbitration cases usually on the claimants side he says he couldnt judge whether that recovery rate by itself indicates bias some arbitration observers and participants say other industry trends have led to the decreasing win and low recovery rates for investors most claims dont get to an arbitration panel in of customer claims were resolved by other means mostly via settlement or mediation over time the share of claims resolved before a hearing has grown substantially the remaining of claims that made it to a panel last year may represent the cases brokerage firms think they have the best shot of winning "when we receive client complaints we take each one seriously and where there is a legitimate issue we act on it and treat our client fairly " says mark herr a merrill lynch spokesman "this reduces the number of claims that are arbitrated and makes it more likely that in a litigated case someone has misjudged its merits or the size of the damages being sought " morgan stanley and smith barney declined to comment
