iberia gets &# billion takeover offer u s private equity group tpg capital llps offer for iberia lineas aereas de espana sa could mark the first of several buyout bids for european airlines in coming months but true cross border mergers will take awhile to get off the ground tpgs billion euro &# billion nonbinding offer announced friday could draw rival overtures from british airways plc and deutsche lufthansa ag say people familiar with the matter the closely held british midland airways ltd also could attract bidders according to airline officials and industry analysts the new signs of deal activity in the airline sector follow the european unions approval in march of a plan to start deregulating trans atlantic aviation a treaty that is expected to be signed in april by the u s and eu the deal which is aimed mainly at introducing more competition on flights between eu and u s cities also is expected to eventually encourage more consolidation in the european airline sector but hurdles to true cross border deals are still high one problem is that countries outside the u s and eu are likely to remain more tightly regulated for many years to come iberia friday said it received a takeover approach from tpg at euros a share below iberias closing price a day earlier iberias shares in madrid have soared recently amid speculation that it could become a takeover target iberia shares closed friday at euros off one european cent british airways which owns of iberia said late friday that it has appointed ubs ag to advise it on using its stake "in the best interest of british airways shareholders " british airways said it "will examine all options including a disposal" of its stake people familiar with the matter say another option for british airways is to bid for the rest of iberia outright in addition to its stake british airways which has a joint venture with iberia on routes between the united kingdom and spain holds the right of first refusal on of iberia held by large spanish investors tpg formerly known as texas pacific group and based in fort worth texas is known as one of the worlds savviest airline investors the firm made a big profit from turning around continental airlines inc in the s and was an early investor in ryanair holdings plc europes largest and most profitable budget carrier david bonderman a founder of tpg remains chairman of the irish airline other carriers that could be attracted to make rival takeover moves for iberia include lufthansa according to people close to the matter although lufthansa executives recently have said they wont bid for iberia other carriers that also might be takeover targets include british midland which has the second biggest operation at londons heathrow airport in terms of takeoff and landing slots after british airways british airways said friday that it bought such slots at heathrow from british midland for an undisclosed price prime heathrow slots can fetch &# million apiece in an unofficial gray market for space at the crowded airport irelands aer lingus group plc was the target last year of a hostile bid from irish rival ryanair the bid has since lapsed in italy alitalia spa is in the final stages of an auction of the states stake in the carrier tpg is also among the bidders for that stake iberia essentially put itself up for sale on feb when its board authorized managers to seek investors iberia is the largest european carrier in latin america by traffic volume and that network is its main attraction its u s network in contrast is much smaller than those of big european airline companies including british airways air france klm sa and lufthansa iberia faces rising competition from aggressive no frills carriers in european markets efforts to cut costs have met tough resistance from staff speculation about a takeover bid for iberia was heightened by the eus march approval of the open skies deal with the u s to remove most commercial restrictions on flights between the two markets one significant element of the deal which takes effect next march is that the u s will treat all eu carriers as if they were from a single country international aviation has been constricted since the s by a web of bilateral treaties specifying that a carrier from any country must be owned and controlled by citizens of that country the stipulation effectively has squelched cross border airline deals because foreign ownership could undermine an airlines ability to fly internationally under the open skies deal washington will allow a mix of eu nationalities to control eu carriers but in a continued snag for cross border deals most other countries around the world still focus on the nationality restriction many of the latin american countries where iberia flies might balk at accepting iberia as a spanish carrier if it is more than owned by citizens of other eu countries the eu is working to put national air agreements on the same multilateral footing as the u s eu deal in latin america alone however that could mean renegotiating more than treaties christopher bjork and rod stone contributed to this article
