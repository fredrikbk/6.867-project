cadbury plan attracts partners potential partners for both cadbury schweppes plcs candy and drinks businesses are lining up quickly just two weeks after the company said it plans to split in two later this year according to people familiar with the situation the door is open for its candy business to pursue a combination with u s rival hershey co in a surprise reversal from when the charitable trust that controls hershey blocked a sale of the company at the last minute leroy zimmerman chairman of the board of the trust that has of the voting rights for hershey said in an interview friday "we have a responsibility to listen to all potential possibilities that might come forward " he added "its important that the hershey trust stay focused on keeping the company competitive and profitable in this global economy " for his part cadbury chief executive officer todd stitzer speaking to analysts in london earlier this week said a merger with hershey would make sense because the two companies businesses are highly complementary hershey has a market capitalization of &# billion cadburys confectionery business is valued at about &# billion analysts estimate food companies are feeling pressure to consolidate to gain greater leverage when negotiating with retailers to stock their goods a combined hershey cadbury brand portfolio which would include cadburys trident and dentyne gum as well as hershey chocolates would make it easier to persuade supermarkets and convenience stores to provide prime shelf space such as next to the cash register for years there have been fits and starts but the big wave of deals that was expected by many hasnt happened yet meanwhile it is looking increasingly likely that cadbury will sell its drinks business which includes dr pepper up and snapple to a private equity buyer a number of private equity companies have discussed their interest in the business which is the no soft drinks maker in the u s by sales after coca cola co and pepsico inc people familiar with the matter say among others lion capital blackstone group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co are interested people familiar with the matter said blackstone declined to comment and lion couldnt be reached kkr declined to comment selling to a rival drinks company would slow down a deal as it would raise antitrust issues and cadbury isnt likely to break up the drinks business and sell off individual brands according to people familiar with the situation cadbury could also spin off the drinks business as a stand alone publicly traded company an option it laid out two weeks ago cadbury hasnt started a formal auction for its drinks business and any deal likely wont happen until after june when cadbury has said it will provide a public update on its breakup plans people familiar with the matter said if it goes with private equity a sale could take place as soon as the late summer they added on the candy side a combination of hershey the largest candy company in the u s and cadbury the worlds biggest candy company by market share would make sense analysts and bankers say the global candy market remains very fragmented with cadbury holding only hershey is weak in europe and in the developing markets both places where london based cadbury is strong also the companies management teams have a relationship because hershey distributes cadburys chocolate in the u s the hershey trust co trustee of the milton hershey school trust hasnt yet had contact with cadbury mr zimmerman said a spokesman for hershey declined to comment a spokeswoman for cadbury also declined to comment if he attempts to join with hershey it would be the second go around for mr stitzer a consummate deal maker who will be ceo of the candy company after the breakup in the trust put hershey on the block and cadbury teamed up with nestle sa to jointly bid &# billion before the trust called off the auction since then hershey has faced a slowing chocolate market as consumers opt for healthier items cadburys portfolio is heavier in such items as gum and less fatty hard candies hersheys stock is down from its peak when cadbury bought u s brands trident dentyne and halls in it became the only candy company with large shares in chocolate sugar confectionery and gum the move has reinvigorated the company given that sales of gum are rising about twice the rate of chocolate globally any takeover of hershey could encounter opposition from local communities and politicians in pennsylvania in the potential sale caused an outcry among residents of hershey pa who worried it would endanger the milton hershey school for disadvantaged children the primary beneficiary of the trust but thursday kevin harley press secretary for the pennsylvania attorney generals office said "we do not have the ability to intervene in the lawful business decisions of publicly traded companies such as hershey " any bid for hershey could also prompt a move from wm wrigley jr co which was poised to win the company in the auction a hershey cadbury combination would be bad news for wrigley the chicago company has been trying to expand beyond gum and become a broader confectionery company similar to the cadbury model wrigley declined to comment
