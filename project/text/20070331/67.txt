pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece berninis baroque miracle in his st teresa marble becomes anything he wishes anatomy of a classic romes high baroque churches are not for minimalists or the abstemious anyone convinced that restraint and austerity are cardinal virtues will have a much better time elsewhere i still remember a visiting english friends disapproval of the lapis lazuli ormolu stucco marble bronze and fresco decorations of a big jesuit church near my apartment in the historic center of the city many years ago on the other hand lovers of that great baroque multimedia invention the opera will be fascinated possibly overwhelmed but certainly exhilarated how this relates to the possibility of religious experience is another issue beyond the scope of this essay if i had to recommend a single monument to support my own enthusiasm for baroque excess it might be the church of santa maria della vittoria a small seemingly unexceptional building at the intersection of two busy streets not far from the railroad station ignore its rather bland if elegant marble facade step inside and discover a riot of marble gilding sculptures and stucco angels the walls of the narrow short nave dissolve under the patterns of the marble illusionistic clouds and swirling angels blur the structural logic of the building above the main altar a tiny icon is made monumental by a setting of golden clouds and rays there are good altarpieces by domenichino and guercino in two side chapels but the real reason for visiting santa maria della vittoria is the chapel of the coronaro family to the left of the main altar a masterwork by that th century giant gian lorenzo bernini dedicated to the spanish visionary st teresa of avila berninis extraordinary ensemble sums up the baroque in one brilliantly orchestrated work in the best counter reformation manner the chapel celebrates a fairly recently canonized ecstatic saint and manifests the piety of its wealthy donors as an extravagant display of opulent diverse materials and disciplines all handled with consummate skill to create a spectacular in every sense mixed media multicolored site specific over the top whole the sculpture over the coronaro chapel altar variously known as "the ecstasy of st teresa" or "st teresa pierced by the love of god " is one of those images that has entered the collective consciousness the larger than life saint swoons her exalted state conveyed by berninis disembodiment of both his materials and his subject enveloped in a massive robe saint teresa collapses on a convenient cloud her head falls backward and we are allowed to observe her apparently unaware her eyes half shut lips parted lost in private experience bernini deploys his virtuoso ability to turn marble into anything he wished and suggests the weight of heavy cloth deep agitated obliterating folds whose preternatural energy becomes a visible equivalent for st teresas rapture against this swirling sea of drapery only her transfigured face a delicate hand and a limp bare foot hint at a body beneath the exquisite dangling foot smooth and articulate below the roiling folds pulls our eyes downward and signals relaxation and abdication of will the cause of it all a smiling androgynous angel who stands beside the reclining saint one hand reaching for the front of her robe the other holding the burning golden arrow with which he has just pierced her breast recounting the incident in her account of her life st teresa wrote "so intense was the pain that i screamed aloud so great was the sweetness that i never wanted to lose it " bernini makes the ambiguity of the vision his real subject golden rays of "light " intensified by light from a hidden window and now on gray days by hidden electric bulbs illuminate this amazing spectacle heightening the sense of otherworldliness and implying that we are sharing the saints ecstasy privileged to witness a transient transcendent moment yet theres no denying the intensely physical overtones of both the incident and the image as apparent by all reports to pre freudian era audiences as to present day viewers which are underscored not only by the saints abandoned pose her rhapsodic expression and that miraculously carved foot as a reminder of hidden corporality but also by the luxury and tactility of the ensembles materials "spectacle" is the operative word the more time we spend with st teresa and her assailant the more theatrical the ensemble becomes the equivocal pair are isolated in a niche like a miniature stage framed by colored marble columns that provide the only note of stillness in the complex whole on the chapels side walls members of the coronaro family life size portraits sculpted by berninis best assistants watch the event from "boxes " leaning out to get a better view behind them deep architectural space as fictive as st teresas niche in shallow relief the suggestion that these dignified patricians are watching a performance is so potent that its impossible not to think that a figure with a book is holding a playbill rather than a religious text if indeed signor coronaro is reading st teresas writings it must be to follow the action the way one reads a libretto at the opera even the multicolor marble panels flanking the niche reinforce our awareness of the artifice involved in creating the paradoxically illusionistic re enactment of the unreal drama the patterns created by the veining echo the shapes of the saints billowing robe and the angels uplifted wing reminding us of choices deliberately made and conceptions illustrated even the color of the marble cream on taupe repeats the colors created by the diverse stone surfaces with which bernini evokes skin cloth and all the rest of it yet at the same time the sense of actuality evoked by the vividly characterized coronaro family members helps to intensify the unreal supercharged mood of the overscaled angel and his enthralled victim returning us once again to the realm of the supernatural when we leave santa maria della vittoria the traffic of via xx settembre is a shock a reminder of a quotidian world that bernini managed for the time we spent with him to make irrelevant ms wilkin writes about art for the journal
