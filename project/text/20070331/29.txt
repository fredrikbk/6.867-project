encore a special report this old house falling apart in retirement does that describe you or your home torn screens peeling wallpaper wood rot gurgling toilets our retirement home seems to be deteriorating as fast as its occupants no sooner do we say fix the clogged garbage disposal than a storm shears off some shingles from the roof the perpetual round of repairs is weirdly akin to the stepped up maintenance schedule demanded by our aging bodies get a root canal and before you know it your knee goes out patch up the knee and you develop cataracts ultimately staving off bodily decrepitude is a fools errand doomed to fail but allowing a home to sink into disrepair now youre talking property values failing to keep things shipshape is courting financial disaster while telegraphing slothfulness to the outside world so like most retired homeowners we fitfully try to keep up with household entropy even as it gets harder to summon the strength to do it yourself or the money to hire a contractor in a word were falling behind you know things are going to seed when houseguests unbidden take it upon themselves to make small repairs or weed and prune the garden or they give us house gifts of electric drills and then proceed to use them for little projects around our house other guests have mentioned flaws theyre concerned about such as the deep claw marks in the doorframe of our guest bathroom although these strongly suggest the markings of a large bear they actually were left by our daughters doberman puppy since the dog departed almost a year ago i havent gotten around to spackling and painting my husband don has many talents but painting isnt one of them in fact he is one of the few american males to have flunked the armys tool test dons brother who lives nearby inherited the handy gene and im sure he winces inwardly at the state of things around our house once while we were on a trip he rebuilt our sagging mailbox and aerated the lawn as a birthday present for his tool challenged brother i marvel at the do it yourself vigor so many of our friends exude and i wish we shared it recently we were whining about garden pests to friends a couple who are avid home renovators they launched into an account of how they had foiled voles and moles by building raised garden beds we listened as they told of spreading gravel sand mulch compost and manure into the wooden frames they had hammered together and of the bountiful garden that resulted when they finished i finally had to come clean "what you dont understand " i said "is that weve run out of gas " at the same time throwing money at problems isnt as easy now as when we got regular paychecks in our town you dont have to be retired to gasp at local contractors fees one of my doctors tells of a landscaper who quoted him a price for planting two bushes that surpassed what he charges for a tonsillectomy he wound up planting them himself then again you get what you pay for after one of our moves the lamps in our living room would not turn on so we hired a retired telephone lineman who advertised low cost electrical repairs and "no job too small " he started by gouging out a big chunk of the living room wall and when that yielded no clues he moved on to the basement hacking out more wallboard beneath the living room he worked most of an afternoon with no success thats when don found a light switch wed never before noticed behind a door it turned out the switch sent juice to the lamp outlets the electrician who had mentioned he had a heart condition was a trembling wreck as was our house when he finally left over the years ive noticed two truths about any repairman however trifling the job hell tell you its going to be as difficult a project as hes ever encountered "a real bear " was the epithet favored by one disgruntled renovator we hired our cue for lavishing him with profuse apologies for troubling him so the other truth is that once the work is under way hell unearth layer upon layer of slipshod workmanship inflicted in the past by others their blunders naturally make his job all the harder and by the way usually threaten the houses foundation those who build custom dream homes for retirement generally have a few years grace before getting bogged down in repairs but soon enough even they will feel pressure to update today home fashions can change overnight and who wants to be caught owning or trying to resell a dowdy white elephant our retirement home was years old when we moved in and right from the get go droves of details screamed for updating they are still screaming or at least whimpering since by now ive mostly turned a blind eye to the ghastly faucets and light fixtures in the bathrooms the formica kitchen countertops the dingy upstairs carpeting meanwhile improvements we did make like installing hardwood floors already need a redo our friends nancy and bill also bought an existing home now years old when they retired and they have spent the past two years trying to update their master bath nothing fancy mind you just three faucets two light fixtures wallpaper and a new tub surround to summarize a long unhappy chain of events new fixtures now on the market arent compatible with their existing plumbing and solving one problem merely spawned two new ones "it got so wed threaten to sell the house " nancy says just to get out from under the project without end she has persevered simply because "i wanted to make a few improvements while i can still enjoy them " that in a nutshell is my dilemma looking ahead most of us know we will eventually have to sell these places and move on to smaller quarters perhaps or assisted living so do i spend the rest of my days in renovation mode to give our house a fighting chance on the market against newer homes realtors and tv home improvement shows insist i must but im sure id never win that game take my ceiling fans they are one thing i actually like about our house yet on television the other night two perky young decorators who were redoing a home to make it more marketable ripped out the ceiling fans with dispatch scorning them as "your grandmothers ceiling fans " they looked just like mine i am trying to steel myself against such dictates for perspective it helps to remember my s childhood when like most middle class americans my parents counted themselves lucky indeed to have a house with one bathroom and a wringer washing machine a single car and a black and white tv as for decorating i can count on my fingers the rare purchases my parents made for our home one is particularly vivid in my mind an italian blown glass lamp that cost &# a sum my mother regarded as staggering i still have that lamp as well as the memories of the thrill its purchase generated no style guru will ever convince me its out of date ms graham is a writer in virginia she can be reached at encore wsj com
