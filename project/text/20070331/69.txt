pursuits leisure &amp arts a choreographer worth watching writing in the poet and dance critic edwin denby memorably described the process of observing the creation of a ballet having scrutinized the legendary george balanchine at work in denby noted "the minuteness of the workmanship" in dancemaking and poetically likened looking in on such activity to that of watching "exhausted champions attempting mount everest with the peak nowhere in sight " the internationally recognized and award winning filmmaker elliot caplan doesnt necessarily disagree about the tedium factor identified by denby but finds a kind of fascination all its own in the act of choreographing mr caplans catalog of film work notably includes radiant records of the dances of merce cunningham recently as artistic director of the center for the moving image at the university at buffalo mr caplan spearheaded the "buffalo project " which commissioned a new ballet from abt studio company so a film could be made of its creation speaking to the hardy souls who braved the blizzard conditions of buffalo n y on feb to see the finished ballets premiere at ubs center for the arts mr caplan enunciated his own poetic take on watching the making of a ballet through his camera plainly addressing the characteristic moments of "stillness silence and nothingness" encountered in a studio as a choreographer waited with his dancers to proceed with more music and movements the filmmaker expressed his admiration for the variously remarkable instincts at work he noted how without specifically being prodded nonactivity in a dance studio stirs into a mode of creation as the waiting dancers pick up on and enter into the least little moment as soon as "the maestro moves a muscle " the chosen "maestro" in this case was dancer turned choreographer brian reeder mr caplan stressed that his interest in creating a filmed documentation hinged in good measure on the choice of mr reeder by abt studio companys kirk peterson in consultation with american ballet theatres kevin mckenzie mr caplan had confidence in mr reeders "ability to make a beautiful and compelling work and be generous in communicating his ideas in a university setting " the ub project which had the eager cooperation of buffalos mayor byron brown also involved a weeklong residency that included a special performance for public school students tonight the studio company gives the second of two performances in new orleans presenting mr reeders new ballet as a special gift from the city of buffalo my own interest in following the project got similarly sparked by news of the participation of mr reeder abt studio company provided my first look at mr reeders choreography in this turned out to be an enchanting witty and original ballet called "the lost language of the flight attendant " similarly impressive ballets followed at abt studio company and at abts summer intensive training programs as well as elsewhere sometimes with university or high school students involved ive been able to see something of a cross section of these if only in some instances as video records each proved in one way or another that mr reeder has an imaginative gift for creating original dance theater and for making todays dancers be they polished or green look their best while also making ballet look fresh to todays audiences without compromising its inherent longstanding traditions in todays landscape of younger generation choreographers mr reeder has a too rare ability to make his ballet women look expert and feminine as befits the aristocratic values underlying much of their training the creation of mr reeders ballet took place at abts studios in new york city over a relatively short three week period with mr caplan and an assistant filmmaker documenting the process at regular intervals when i asked mr caplan what his cameras were looking at as they filmed the activity of mr reeder and the studio companys eight youthful and talented dancers he said simply "wide shot and detail " that distinction however important to a filmed record of a dance applies equally to the effectiveness and expressivity of the choreographers ballets all the time that a bigger picture stays in focus mr reeders careful attention to detail fortifies the broader aim making for a rich and engaging visual experience the easygoing choreographer handled the scrutiny with aplomb regarding the pressure of being in the goldfish bowl of a documentary film mr reeder quipped that it wasnt natural creating under the cameras eye "everyone knows theres no such thing as reality tv theres always an element of performance going on " but there were the odd days when mr caplan and his assistant werent there when reality could persist without any outside glare the finished work "ghost light " uses aaron coplands jazz tinged concert suite called "music for the theater " mr reeders title refers to the talismanic bare bulb standing light fixture traditionally left on in dark theaters when the show is over in mr reeders ballet the unprepossessing lamp becomes the prop around which a lone mop pushing stagehand played with delicate gravity by year old roddy doble appears to conjure up performing ghosts from the stages rich past the ghostly apparitions come in the form of three dancing couples whose series of duets indicate a world of flappers hobos and suave ballroom dancers in buffalos snow driven night the hardworking dancers got a little break from an extra long intermission so the mayor held up a bit by the storm could reach the event most of those who made it to the five part bill stayed for the premiere despite the delayed curtain and the raging bad weather once the dance proceeded one could sense that the audience was transported to a different place resonant bygone theatrical worlds were being relived and enlivened by todays ballet dancers in addition to the new orleans performances "ghost light" will be performed at new yorks skirball center on april and mr caplan intends to spend the summer "loading and logging" his film footage into a document that will serve in the directors words as an "education resource for dance history instruction and choreography " in the process an everest like peak might be seen coming within view mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal peggy noonan is on vacation
