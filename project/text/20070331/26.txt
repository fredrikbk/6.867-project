encore a special report profiles in retirement profiles in retirement a new encore feature will take a look each issue at a handful of intriguing people and how theyre starting over in later life glenn ruffenach running the numbers at age henry k "bud" hebeler is spending the bulk of his retirement as much as hours a day six days a week helping thousands of people with their retirement mr hebeler a former top executive at boeing co is the developer of analyzenow com widely regarded as one of the best web sites about retirement finances started in the mid s the site is intended in his words to "educate a wide range of people from laymen to professionals about the realities of retirement planning " to that end mr hebeler spends much of his day answering emails from users of the site and thinking up new ways to demystify money management in later life two of the latest and most helpful tools free programs titled "should you take social security early " and "evaluating immediate annuities " while mr hebeler preaches the necessity of planning for retirement long before the day arrives he acknowledges that his own preparations at boeing were a mixed bag he was president of boeing aerospace co a division of the parent company and like many people with busy lives he says "i didnt have time to think about things like retirement " at age though mr hebeler found himself reading a set of fuzzy financial projections those numbers would start him on his present course the projections focused on mr hebelers own retirement savings and came courtesy of a financial planner provided by boeing the problem "almost all the material was written in the best interests of the financial firms" that helped produce the projections mr hebeler recalls "if i had used that material to make presentations to our board i wouldnt have had a job " that shortcoming "got a fire burning in me " mr hebeler says leaving boeing he embarked on a campaign "idealist that i was" to educate america about retirement planning the early days were rocky an effort to publish a book met with closed doors in new york eventually he hit on a strategy anytime he read what he considered a good article about retirement finances in a magazine or newspaper he would write the author complimenting him or her on the material and offering his own services if the writer needed help in the future gradually mr hebelers name and expertise began showing up in financial planning circles after starting analyzenow com he was asked to write a book about retirement "j k lassers your winning retirement plan " which is still in print his second book "getting started in a financially secure retirement " comes out next month today mr hebeler and his wife mirriam divide their time between homes in seattle and park city utah at the latter the couple still ski five or six days each week despite a growing assortment of injuries a friend observes that the hebelers are "held together with kevlar titanium and velcro " his web site mr hebeler says typically gets "several thousand hits" each day money from sales of software and books is plowed back into analyzenow com when asked to compare his time at boeing with his new career mr hebeler talks about the personal nature of his work today "at boeing i was largely helping people very indirectly through the defense of our country for instance there were a lot of filters involved but here youre right on the forefront of helping people you can see the effect it can make " one park at a time most evenings in retirement jim and patricia raffin sit alone watching sunsets listening to the occasional coyote howl and waiting for the morning when they can return as mrs raffin describes it to "one of the greatest jobs you can think of" camp hosts in a national park the raffins are part of a small army of volunteers who travel across the country in recreational vehicles and set up home typically for several months at a time in destinations as large and prominent as yellowstone national park million acres primarily in wyoming or as small and remote as fort craig a th century army post in new mexico on about acres working for such agencies as the forest service the national park service and the bureau of land management the raffins and others serve as their title indicates as "hosts " welcoming visitors and campers answering their questions providing information about the site and enforcing local rules and regulations at the same time these volunteers in some cases small stipends are available get the chance to experience the nations natural wonders as few travelers do "there is no better way to see the country " says mrs raffin age the raffins are actually on their second retirement jim raffin left the navy in the early s the family moved from rhode island to texas where mr raffin ended up working in a nuclear power plant he retired from that job in at that point the couple "sold everything " bought a motor home and began touring the country full time at one early stop medicine bow national forest in wyoming a camp host asked the couple if they would be interested in filling in for some volunteers who hadnt yet arrived the raffins agreed and ended up staying almost six weeks in they began working as camp hosts virtually year round summers find them at higher elevations in parks in colorado or wyoming winters prompt them to head south volunteering at sites like fort craig a personal favorite "you havent seen anything until youve seen the sun go down on the mountains of new mexico " mr raffin age says volunteering isnt all work there are get togethers with other camp hosts pot luck dinners and of course the chance to meet travelers from around the u s and the world what many travelers dont realize the raffins say is how budget cuts are hurting and even forcing the closing of parks and campgrounds nationwide and how badly volunteers are needed "are these parks going to be available for future generations to enjoy as much as we have " mrs raffin asks "i think all retirees should give some of their time to causes like this " a passion for books jim strawn is the classic example of a person taking a passion in his case a penchant for collecting books and turning it into a business in retirement last october mr strawn age a former finance chief in the radio industry and his wife judy opened their own store smythe books in dunwoody ga of course starting a business whatever the spark is seldom easy mr strawns story involves many small steps over many years as well as one unexpected setback a loss of confidence a georgia native mr strawn graduated from college in and spent much of the next years in the broadcast business first with cox broadcasting corp and eventually as a senior executive with two closely held chains of radio stations midway through this career mr strawn found a new hobby the catalyst was a biography of c s lewis the english author best known for writing "the chronicles of narnia " "i never had been a big reader " mr strawn says but "this book hooked me i couldnt put it down " by chance a family trip to england was already in the works and mr strawn decided he would spend part of the vacation learning more about lewis the final day of the trip found him at a book fair in oxford where he bought several first editions of lewiss writings in the years that followed collecting books became a passion mr strawn began studying authors and why certain writings were important to them he attended book fairs in the u s and europe and developed relationships with dealers he enrolled in classes about finding and identifying rare titles and he bought books and more books amassing some titles in all in mr strawn walked away from the radio business financially successful but "tired and burned out " he turned briefly to golf and travel and considered "doing something" in the book industry as the months passed though "i began to lose confidence in myself " he recalls "my experience in radio had been so specialized my skills didnt seem to be a match for anything " a new direction came from a breakfast meeting with his pastor who steered mr strawn toward an accounting job with the cooperative baptist fellowship a nonprofit group based in atlanta what began as a part time position turned into a five year commitment with mr strawn ending up as the organizations chief financial officer perhaps more important his work and success at the fellowship restored his confidence and persuaded him to give the book business a try indeed when asked today what advice he would give others mr strawn urges would be retirees to "keep yourself in situations where you dont lose faith in your abilities with nonprofits and churches youll end up being a valuable asset and that could turn into something much bigger " smythe books only five months old is already expanding mr strawn was able to lease some additional space and will soon have about titles on his shelves up from about when the shop opened buying up the inventory of a bookstore that was closing in south carolina allowed him to augment his personal collection substantially mr strawn spends about hours a week at the store monday through saturday two retired librarians work with him part time he delights in particular in being able to satisfy customers requests for the obscure "i had a man walk in and ask if i had any books about checkers " mr strawn says "i told him yes i have two " and he continues to look ahead "i want to be a member of the antiquarian booksellers association of america " he explains "to be a book dealer of any substance thats a badge you need to wear "i still have some goals " an apostle for fitness anger and fear can do wonders for your retirement when carole carson retired at age she remembers feeling an "ineffable sadness " although she had enjoyed a successful career in business she had wanted at some point to work as a writer and to get herself in good physical shape "i reconciled myself to the fact that i would never write and always be fat " she recalls that sense of resignation she adds was the worst part of retiring "i didnt have my dreams anymore " fast forward six years this coming week mrs carsons first book will go on sale titled "from fat to fit " it chronicles how she lost pounds began a new career as a writer and fitness advocate and helped a california community dedicate itself to good health now years old mrs carson traces her transformation in retirement to a single event a july morning in when she stepped on her bathroom scale it showed that she was carrying pounds on her foot inch frame she describes the moment in her book "thats it i said more in desperation than conviction if you dont change youll die fat you have to do something before its too late " mrs carson had worked in several different jobs and careers before that summer she taught high school worked in college administration started her own consulting business and eventually owned a chain of hair salons in the midwest selling the chain marked the beginning of her retirement soon after the numbers on the bathroom scale sparked a search for help mrs carson who lives in nevada city calif first found a fitness coach "looking back i realized my problem i had tried to lose weight alone " she says "for the first time i admitted that i needed help " at the same time she emailed her local newspaper the union and asked if the editors might be interested in a free lance article for the "senior section" a first person account of one womans efforts to get fit the paper said yes and ended up running the story with a large photo of mrs carson and her inch waist on its front page mortified at first she began hearing from people who applauded her candor and wished to talk about their own struggles to lose weight the union meanwhile asked if mrs carson would be interested in writing a weekly column about her progress or lack thereof in shedding pounds in the months and years that followed a new career was born mrs carson ended up teaching classes about fitness and helped organize a community "meltdown" in nevada county calif one thousand residents in teams of about five to people joined forces to see how much weight they could lose in two months shored up by weekly pep rallies and progress reports the participants shed almost pounds that effort garnered national media attention and convinced mrs carson that her retirement could best be spent helping others lead healthier lives her new book is one part of that effort she continues to write for the union and is speaking with other communities about organizing their own "meltdowns " "its all about reinventing yourself " she says of retirement "im working harder now than i ever did when i had my jobs but now im doing things i really want to do " a hiring hand for the feds vicki novak retired less than two years is on a mission to help smooth the way for fellow retirees among others to find work with the federal government at the same time she has found what many americans appear to be searching for in later life an important and challenging job that makes use of her talents and experience and one that gives her the freedom to well play "im lucky " the year old virginia native says simply "im in good health im passionate about what im doing and im having a heck of a good time " ms novak works with the partnership for public service a nonprofit group based in washington that educates young and old alike about the value of public service and helps recruit workers for government jobs after spending years working for uncle sam ms novak is now trying to streamline the governments hiring process convincing government managers of the benefits of hiring from new "talent sources" including older adults and at the same time making it easier for applicants to get their foot in the door "in the next five years people will be eligible to retire from the federal government " ms novak says this from a full time work force of about million already "people are scrambling around looking for help " ms novak adds "i think i can make a difference " ms novak is the first to acknowledge that none of this her new job her lobbying efforts her commitment was planned "before i retired i wanted to do volunteer work maybe the elderly or hospice or children " she says "there was no strong focus rather her retirement to date is a lesson in the importance of remaining open to new interests in later life ms novak had what she calls a "light bulb moment" in early recently retired from a top position at the national aeronautics and space administration she was invited to speak at louisiana state university talking with students ms novak realized that most had little if any knowledge about government work "they thought that all jobs were in washington that there were no exciting jobs in government and they had no idea where to go to find out " hoping to change such misconceptions ms novak approached the partnership for public service and offered her services today she spends about three days a week working on two major programs call to serve and fed experience designed to help recruit young adults and baby boomers respectively for positions in the federal government ms novak says its the balance she has struck between doing "something thats meaningful" and still enjoying travel and hobbies her golf scores are in the low s that has made retirement rewarding after all "were telling government agencies to be more flexible to allow people to work part time or work from home " she says "the government hasnt done that in the past but people want that flexibility and employers need to be willing to meet them halfway " patching painting and sewing travel and volunteer work are near the top of most peoples to do lists as they approach retirement which is why bill and jackie conaway think they have found an ideal life the couple who live in lafayette ind are part of nomads a volunteer group associated with the united methodist church the letters stand for nomads on a mission active in divine service members travel throughout the country in recreational vehicles and spend several weeks at a time refurbishing churches youth centers and camps among other sites and facilities membership is open to anyone not methodists alone last year a thousand volunteers completed projects in states and mexico and donated an estimated hours of their time members spent weeks alone last spring helping rebuild homes in louisiana and mississippi damaged by hurricane katrina the conaways ascribe their introduction to nomads as "fate " both retired in bill from a career in banking and jackie from purdue university already rv veterans the couple embarked the following year on a three month trip to alaska on july the conaways stopped in the small city of wasilla to watch the local holiday parade and ended up parking next to a truck with a sign that read "nomads " catching up with the trucks owners who also were walking to the parade the conaways asked what the sign meant and the small group fell into conversation about the organization and its work the following year the conaways signed aboard in the time since they have focused primarily on projects in the southwest in winter months and in their home state of indiana in spring summer and fall typically the conaways will pull their rv into a spot provided by the project coordinators and begin work the jobs run the gamut patching floors painting walls installing cabinets sewing curtains just about anything involved in restoring and repairing aging churches and related sites that said the conaways draw the line at scaling large ladders especially outdoors "we try to keep off of roofs " mr conaway says most volunteers put in about to hours a week the work according to the couple fills two needs their desire to travel and their need to feel useful "were not very good at sitting around " says mrs conaway now "we want to be productive and thats the reason nomads is so good for us it really gives us a purpose like were contributing to society " in some ways the decision to join nomads was a logical fit with the pairs lives before retiring mr conaway in particular who is now had been deeply involved with the couples church in indiana at one point helping to oversee a multiyear building project "if it hadnt been nomads we would have found something else " says mr conaway who has spent four years on the organizations board of directors "we have the wherewithal to do these kinds of things were just trying to give back " what are you doing in retirement competing in
