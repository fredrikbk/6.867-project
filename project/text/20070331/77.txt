pursuits travel spring trips australian time travel we visit the countrys fast growing attraction its year old native culture cooktown australia i gave the wrong answer to the customs inspector in cairns when she asked why i was visiting the country "for aboriginal tourism " i told her "im going on treks led by indigenous people one through the rainforest and another to see ancient cave art " making no attempt to hide her skepticism she asked for proof of my itinerary i pulled out a couple of tour descriptions but that wasnt good enough she went through every item in my suitcase questioning me in detail about the contents of a bottle of vitamins before probing the lining with an instrument that detects chemical residue one of the fastest growing areas of australian travel is aboriginal tourism ranging from an hours visit to indigenous art galleries to day trips with guides through rugged deserts and rainforests yet many australians dont realize it foreign visitors participating in some kind of indigenous activity far outnumber local tourists compared with in according to the latest figures from tourism australia the governments tourism body for overseas visitors thats a jump over this gap between foreign and local interest in a native culture is a window onto broader issues in australia a country that has often struggled with its identity since being colonized more than years ago to many locals a vacation in nearby places like bali and thailand can often be cheaper than traveling around australia trips to europe and the u s are also attractive to a population that is still largely of european origin some australians arent that eager to spend a vacation hearing about the history of the indigenous culture which is punctuated with stories of discrimination and violence but for this particular foreigner aboriginal tourism proved more fascinating than any of my previous australian trips which included visits to sydney melbourne and tasmania many of these tours take just a day or two so they can be added as side trips to a regular itinerary if you explore the areas north of cairns in queensland as i did you get a bonus the great barrier reef is offshore and the upscale coastal town of port douglas is also nearby the tours range all over the map both geographically and in content you can fly to communities in the northern territory to visit art galleries and commission paintings from local artists travelers can accompany a turtle conservation project run by an aboriginal community on the cape york peninsula an isolated area of tropical rainforest north of cooktown or fish and swim from a houseboat hearing stories about the owners lives some tour guides conduct boat trips on sydney harbor recounting the days before the white settlers arrived in the process visitors are helping to create a new industry one that provides employment and self respect for survivors of one of the worlds longest lived cultures thought to be more than years old "were talking about a culture that precedes the greek and roman civilizations " says aden ridgeway who heads the government agency indigenous tourism australia which helps promote tourism around the world "you have to offer visitors something unique that you cant get anywhere else in the world " this tourism has been spurred by financial help from the australian government as well as mentoring from the broader travel industry aboriginal tourism australia a trade association of indigenous tourism operators has seen its membership grow to now from in "tourism is making us more independent " says irene hammett who with her husband gerry runs maaramaka tours a mom and pop business near cooktown that takes visitors through the rainforest to show them how locals once found food shelter and medicine from the products of the forest "we dont want to be part of the system where you depend on the government for everything " she says ms hammett says her father was part of the "stolen generation" children taken from indigenous families by the government and often sent to live in institutions ms hammetts father was sent to a lutheran mission at the age of ms hammett now years old says she had to drop out of school at to work as domestic help in a caucasian home i spent a day looking at ancient rock art with willie gordon who has become something of a legend among aficionados the year old mr gordon a rotund aborigine with a white goatee and an easy smile was a fountain of knowledge that belies his past until three years ago he had never written a check but now he has become so immersed in his business that he recently showed the owner of a campground how to use powerpoint to do marketing but above all mr gordon is a storyteller creation stories are the essence of aboriginal culture a way to pass on from generation to generation the connection to the land where many mountains rivers and unusual rock formations have a story and are considered sacred often called "dreamings " these stories are reflected in art by the wavy lines and dots that relate to the wanderings of the aborigines who were nomadic hunter gatherers led by mr gordon i explored a series of shallow caves in the wilderness near hopevale a small community about miles from cooktown painted onto the walls and ceilings of the cave in red ochre are stylized figures of people animals and fish all reflecting stories mr gordon had eagerly soaked up from his relatives as a child "when i was growing up i was lucky because there wasnt any television " he laughs my trip through the rainforest with gerry hammett was no less fascinating for the two hour tour followed by lunch at his house mr hammett a year old retired forest ranger used a trail he bushwhacked on government owned wilderness land with practically every step he found something to explain that illustrated survival in the rainforest a certain vine could be strung together as a trap for wild turkeys the leaf of a particular tree when rubbed hard turns into a foam that can be used as soap a poisonous berry when soaked in water releases its toxin and can be boiled as porridge or ground into flour for a tourist theres a double incentive for hearing these stories foreigners coming to learn about the aboriginal past not only provide financial rewards for indigenous people but also instill a sense of pride and self respect but for all its success last year mr gordon escorted about tourists up from the year before one of the biggest stumbling blocks for this tourism is the fact that money traditionally plays no role in native culture income that comes in is freely shared with friends and relatives gallery owners who specialize in aboriginal art tell stories of artists being paid thousands of dollars for a painting only to be penniless the next day the concept of a business involving profits savings and capital expenditures can be an alien concept i asked mr gordon how he resolved the two very different views of money in the aboriginal and white cultures "you have to put your business in a box " he replied "you put your culture in a different box and you cannot mix the two aboriginal society is based on sharing business is about making it survive " write to stan sesser at stan sesser awsj com trip planner queensland getting there cooktown the gateway to the cape york peninsula in northern
