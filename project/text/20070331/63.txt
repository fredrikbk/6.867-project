pursuits cover story one tough table is it worth it for a year old in town on spring break from boston dinner at the waverly inn in greenwich village was just dinner my granddaughter tili loved the clam chowder ate so much of it indeed that she couldnt finish her short ribs although that didnt prevent her from polishing off some cheesecake she was happily oblivious to the nearby presence of diane von furstenberg tv host charlie rose and the multibillionaire ronald perelman certainly the revlon tycoon looked happy despite having lost the latest round in a &# billion lawsuit but everybody at the waverly inn was looking happy even jubilant we had all scored the most impossible reservation in a real restaurant in town raos the mobbed up place uptown seats only regulars and is essentially a club without dues the waverly inn has no phone no web site and is certainly not listed at opentable com but since it opened last fall under the aegis of vanity fair editor graydon carter in the rehabbed quarters of a funky old village tavern called ye waverly inn since the dining room and bar have been filled with movers shakers and fakers the fakers hang out in the bar perhaps hoping they will be admitted to a table if they show their loyalty as standup guys willing to pay their dues by buying many rounds of martinis the movers and shakers get their tables because they are known to the house and because they know how to reach the all powerful emil everyone refers to manager emil warda by his first name or his minions by email or cellphone tili and i and grandma johanna got in because we know an insider but when we asked emil if he could tell us how to make a reservation for another time he dodged the question oh yes the food it was as tili opined "pretty good " if straightforward an artichoke was overcooked beet salad was terrific a berkshire pork chop was moist and tasty for the same money around &# per person with wine and tip you can get far more interesting food in the neighborhood at august or annisa where they have listed phones but if you still want to try for a table at the waverly inn we suggest either of two tactics one hire a supermodel to present herself or himself at the restaurant before p m to plead your case two in a pinch you can always track down mr carter at his vanity fair office
