pursuits books writers block a french misconnection henry james goes to paris by peter brooks princeton pages &# in at the age of henry james shook the dust of cambridge mass from his boots and settled in paris permanently he believed through ivan turgenev about whom he had earlier written james gained entry to the parisian literary cenacle that met on sunday afternoons at the apartment of gustave flaubert the talk there as james would later recall was of "extreme intensity and variety" the brothers goncourt guy de maupassant alphonse daudet and emile zola were among those who attended james found the company less than congenial the atmosphere not at all to his liking after his year in paris james betook himself to england where he resided for the remainder of his days with frequent foreign travel most of it to italy the setting for much of his fiction in time james became as t s eliot remarked a european though of no known country the perfect definition of the cosmopolitan yet it is the argument of peter brooks in "henry james goes to paris" that james learned lessons most vital to his art during his single rather disappointing year in france what makes this argument tricky is mr brookss claim that "jamess year in paris seems to be about missing things on the spot but somehow storing them away for later retrieval and reinterpretation " james missed for example the import of the impressionists in visual art as the critic roger fry recounted james did no better in when he expressed "the disturbed hesitation which matisse and picasso aroused in him " as for flaubert james found him wanting both as writer and man "so much talent and so much naivete and honesty and yet so much dryness and coldness " mr brooks attempts to show the delayed connection between jamess fiction and his year in france through a subtle and rich analysis of four of jamess novels "the american" "the tragic muse" "what maisie knew" and "the golden bowl" and through a lengthy critical discussion of flauberts writings mr brooks gives most attention to "bouvard and pecuchet " flauberts final and uncompleted novel the book is as mr brooks maintains a clear precursor of postmodernism postmodern in the sense that it mocks all attempts to understand the world in any sort of rational way in this respect "bouvard and pecuchet" is a great success flaubert called it "a kind of encyclopaedia of modern stupidity" but with one proviso like so many extended fictional works in the postmodern mode it is very nearly unreadable james thought "bouvard and pecuchet" a dismal mistake writing as late as in an introduction to an english translation of "madame bovary " he in fact had little good to say about any of flauberts five novels only grudgingly calling "madame bovary" a masterpiece though clearly not one he would have wished to write he referred to flaubert as "a novelists novelist " which is another way of saying that flaubert doesnt quite qualify for that more splendid thing a great novelist the gravamen of jamess charge against flaubert is that he created no characters of sufficiently deep consciousness "never approached the complicated character in a man or woman or the really finished the finely civilized " because it was not in him to do so flaubert was "condemned to irony " james wrote imprisoned by the struggle for perfection of style above all flaubert did not come by his contemporary subjects as in "madame bovary" and "a sentimental education" through love but through contempt if not hatred for the bourgeoisie about whom he wrote those of us outside the cult of flaubert will never quite grasp its attraction the cults members include the english novelist julian barnes the czech novelist milan kundera and most american professors of french literature mr brooks who is a professor of comparative literature at yale calls flaubert "a hero of our postmodernism" and contends that flaubert belongs "to a long line of disillusioners and dissenters and he becomes the inspiration of those disabused ironists of the next century joyce beckett kafka svevo " which may well be so but was he however unconsciously also an inspiration for henry james "unconsciously" is the key word because james never suggested that he felt the least influence from flaubert this doesnt stop mr brooks who is freudian in the tendency of his thinking and who is a great devotee of the notion of repression from confidently asserting this influence he also holds the currently fashionable view that henry james was a repressed homosexual a view based by those who hold it on the flimsy evidence of some effusive letters james wrote to young men late in his life as for jamess postmodernism his fiction as mr brooks rightly emphasizes became more and more about bafflement bafflement leading to recognition and it was increasingly played out against the great epistemological theme of how we know what we know in his late novels and short stories james cut deeper and deeper into the recesses of consciousness so that in a favorite passage of mine from "what maisie knew" and quoted by mr brooks james wrote "while they sat together there was an extraordinary mute passage between her vision of this vision of his his vision of her vision and her vision of his vision of her vision " the most expensive smoked salmon has never been cut any finer than that mr brooks acknowledges that his major claim that the impetus for jamess forays deeper into his characters minds came from his french connection "cannot be denoted with any certainty to us in retrospect this seems a natural evolution of his art " nonetheless this is the argument he makes in his book in an essay on turgenev james remarked that one finally wants to know what a writer thinks of the world flaubert for james thought much too little of it flaubert had as matthew arnold once said of him "petrified feeling" and a want of compassion and tenderness toward his characters that was as far from jamess ideal of the novelist as could be for james fiction begins in love as he said in his lecture "the lesson of balzac" "it was by loving them his characters as the terms of his subject and the nuggets of his mine that he knew them it was not by knowing them that he loved them " according to another brooks a now nearly forgotten critic named van wyck brooks literature is "a great man writing " gustave flaubert far from a great was an incomplete and deeply flawed man and artist henry james aspired to be and in the end was great as man and artist both how he achieved his greatness is a long and complex story and it is difficult to believe despite peter brookss elaborate suasions that gustave flaubert had much to do with it mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" harpercollins
