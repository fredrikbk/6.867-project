encore a special report conversion convergence the year offers a unique way to fund a roth ira but is unique better last may uncle sam created an important and unusual planning opportunity for retirement a way for anyone regardless of income to fund a roth individual retirement account widely regarded as one of the best ways to save for later life the twist came in the timing people could begin taking steps in to benefit from the new rules even though the rules themselves arent scheduled to take effect until in the months since growing numbers of investors and advisers have jumped on the bandwagon "its a nice way to get money into a roth for people who normally cant contribute " says robert armstrong an account vice president in louisville ky with ubs financial services inc "a lot of my clients are looking at this " still as with any gift from the government some wrinkles and warnings have emerged the technique for getting your money into a roth isnt as simple as some early reports indicated and financial planners arent unanimous in their praise for the strategy which involves making nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira perhaps most important no one knows whether uncle sam will decide that he was too generous and end up changing the rules before with the first deadline for capitalizing on the new roth strategy just over two weeks away heres a look at the landscape the original legislation the strategy for taking advantage of the new rules some important caveats and some alternative destinations for your retirement dollars the basics roth iras which first became available in have several significant advantages over traditional iras all earnings after an investor meets certain requirements can be withdrawn tax free there are no required withdrawals as there are after age with a traditional ira and your heirs for the most part can enjoy tax free withdrawals as well of course there are some catches first you cant deduct contributions to a roth on your income taxes second high income families arent eligible individuals whose adjusted gross income in exceeds &# and couples whose income exceeds &# cant contribute to a roth theres also an income limit for people who wish to convert a traditional ira to a roth at the moment only people with modified adjusted gross income of &# or less can convert conversions of course are taxed but once the money is sitting inside a roth earnings as noted can be withdrawn tax free in recent years more families have found themselves bumping up against or exceeding the income limits tied to roths and asking financial advisers about alternative investment strategies last spring congress and president bush offered an answer the strategy in may the president signed into law the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act or tipra among other provisions the legislation eliminates as of jan the income limit for converting a traditional ira to a roth whats more anyone who converts to a roth in can spread the resulting tax bill over the next two years and financial planners quickly applauded here finally was a way albeit a back door route for high income individuals to fund a roth the strategy that emerged goes like this first contribute the maximum amount allowable to a traditional ira thats &# or &# for individuals age or older for high income individuals who dont qualify for deductions for contributions to a traditional ira this money will be considered a nondeductible contribution second continue to make these contributions annually until by that time an individual could have as much as &# in contributions third in the year when the income limit for people wishing to convert to a roth disappears convert the money in the traditional ira to a roth fourth pay the taxes on the conversion in and finally each year after make a traditional ira contribution and in the same year convert that money to a roth the reasoning here while the income limits for converting to a roth ira are eliminated in the limits for contributing to a roth remain in effect more about this apparent loophole in a moment with these steps individuals regardless of their income can eventually open and keep funding a roth ira note heres where the approaching deadline comes into play remember the strategy calls for making the maximum allowable contribution each year to a traditional ira if you havent made a contribution for you have until april to do so thats because the internal revenue service gives taxpayers until the annual deadline for filing federal tax returns which is april this year to contribute to an ira for the previous year the caveats clearly tipra offers some advantages investors who once tied themselves in knots trying to get their incomes below &# in a single year to qualify for a roth conversion will no longer have to go through such contortions investors also will have plenty of time because the changes dont take effect until to determine whether a conversion suits their financial needs still the conversion strategy has a few wrinkles that some investors arent aware of according to financial planners the most important is the irss "pro rata rule " in short some investors think their nondeductible or after tax ira contributions can be converted tax free to a roth the pro rata rule says otherwise when arrives and if you wish to convert your nondeductible ira to a roth the irs says you must first add the balance in all your iras including iras with deductible and nondeductible contributions as well as seps and simple iras tools primarily for the self employed and small businesses then you divide your nondeductible contributions by that sum the resulting figure gives you the percentage of any conversion thats tax free when it comes time to convert "its not just your lonely little nondeductible ira" that goes into the calculation says barry kaplan a certified financial planner in atlanta "some people are going to be in for a rude shock " there is a way potentially to sidestep this problem if your k plan at work allows such transfers when rolls around you can shift your ira assets except for the nondeductible contributions to the k then you take whats left in your ira and convert it to a roth because the amount youre converting now equals your nondeductible contributions youve eliminated any pro rata calculations that tactic though has its own significant drawbacks first says ed slott a rockville centre n y accountant who specializes in iras is the fact that you would be moving assets from an account with thousands of investment options an ira to one with typically a few dozen options the k moreover he says when an investor converts to a roth "ideally you want to get as much money into that roth as possible " where eventual withdrawals will be tax free "why leave some of it in a k " other caveats to be aware of with the strategy as with any roth conversion you should be able to pay the taxes with money from outside the ira if you need to tap your ira for the tax money youre defeating in part the purpose of the conversion to maximize the long term value of the roth the timing of future withdrawals also should be a consideration when rolls around ideally the longer you can wait to withdraw funds tax free the more time your assets have to grow and the greater the benefit of the roth the big unknown of course is whether congress will change some or all of the rules before and make all these maneuvers meaningless or seemingly so here the experts are divided rande spiegelman vice president of financial planning at the schwab center for investment research thinks congress may decide that it went too far as noted above under the new rules any investor from onward in what appears to be a loophole will be able to open a traditional ira on jan for instance and convert it the next day to a roth its "more likely than not that congress will amend this rule to prevent abuse or gaming of the system " mr spiegelman says but mr armstrong in kentucky thinks investors should err on the side of pursuing the strategy or at least considering it "if the rules change you still have a bucket of money sitting in a traditional ira and growing tax deferred youre no worse off for trying " the alternatives is the strategy for everyone some financial advisers argue for taking a deep breath the core of the strategy making nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira has always been an also ran in retirement planning circles by definition theres no upfront tax deduction with such contributions and any money withdrawn from a traditional ira is taxed at ordinary rates the only benefit involved in making nondeductible contributions to an ira as mr armstrong notes is that assets can grow tax deferred yes tipra changes things opening a path for funding a roth ira but that fact alone doesnt necessarily move nondeductible contributions to the head of the retirement planning line "you could invest those dollars in individual stocks and pay long term capital gains " says mr spiegelman at schwab "the nondeductible ira contribution is not the most compelling strategy in the world " another option a roth k more companies are starting to offer these vehicles as part of their retirement plans with a roth k there are no income limits as with a roth ira on who can contribute and annual contributions can be as large as those to a traditional k &# in for people age or older of course earnings in a roth k as with a roth ira will be tax free before taking any steps most investors would do well to review all these options including the strategy with a financial planner says jack brod who heads asset management services at vanguard group inc "for affluent investors already maxing out their k the strategy seems like a good opportunity for many of them " he says "but look closely at your personal situation and consult a good tax adviser " mr ruffenach is a reporter and editor for
