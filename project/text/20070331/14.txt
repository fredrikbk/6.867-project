cross country a day late late wednesday night south carolina state rep james smith a democrat flew into columbia the state capital the captain in the army national guard was training with his unit out of fort riley kan for ultimate deployment in afghanistan but his trip home was no social visit before heading off to war mr smith had returned "solely " he told the associated press to vote against a school voucher bill coming up in the house according to both sides of the debate his surprise appearance shifted the momentum decidedly against school choice on thursday the house voted against giving &# vouchers to low income kids in failing public schools and a companion bill to create more educational options for the middle class failed the bill that seemed to scare lawmakers the most would have provided choice to the middle class by offering all residents a &# educational tax credit and a &# tax credit to home schoolers it would have allowed parents to pool their tax credits with grandparents aunts uncles etc and thereby vest the middle class in school choice reforms thus the tax credit was a much bigger deal than it might appear at first glance it would mean that any person or interest group who wanted to crush school choice down the road would have to face down parents with the wherewithal to fight back while the tax credit bill always faced long odds school choice advocates had every reason to believe they would win the other earlier in the week they had won several procedural votes with as wide as a seven vote margin and speaker of the house bobby harrell was promising to help line up votes state rep bob walker a republican and the chairman of the education committee was also supporting some school choice provisions opponents of school choice often claim that it will hurt public schools several opponents in south carolina made that argument this time as well even as they attempted to derail "opportunity scholarships" by attaching restrictions that no private school could live with requirements for teacher accreditation submission to onerous state testing and limits on tuition nonetheless on wednesday evening school choice advocates appeared to have the votes in their pocket when republicans adjourned the house with the promise of debating the issue on thursday but throughout the early evening lobbyists went to work buttonholing lawmakers who supported choice the bars in columbia became venues for applying political pressure then rep smith arrived he held a press conference thursday flanked by his year old son at which he declared that by electing voucher opponent democrat jim rex as state education superintendent last year the voters had rejected school choice mr rex won his election by just votes out of more than a million cast but before long the house was voting down giving poor parents the same choice mr smith exercises in sending his son to the expensive private heathwood hall episcopal school in columbia in the end the house did pass a bill allowing for open enrollment which would allow for some choice within the public system assuming there are any seats to be found in well performing public schools for low income students left on the table by the republican controlled house is another reform gop gov mark sanford sees as essential to dismantling part of the public school system he calls a "throwback to the era of segregation" school district lines that consign african american communities to poorly performing schools the governor wants to consolidate some school districts the legislature hasnt yet moved on the issue if there is a silver lining here it is that choice advocates didnt have to swallow compromise legislation that would have created just the appearance of educational opportunities reforms that would have dangled scholarships in front of parents with so many strings attached to them that it would have been impossible to use them there is still a chance that the state senate could pick up the reforms that the house voted down but it is hard to escape the fact that house speaker harrell let down those who believe in school choice at precisely the moment his leadership was most critical to keep in place the last few votes i placed a call to him late last week but despite assurances from his receptionist never received a call back from mr harrell or a spokesman by thursday it was clear why when republican leaders didnt press this fight all the way to the end instead they adjourned to give opponents of choice an additional night to bring in reinforcements in the form of capt smith who had told his battalion commander lt col john nagl that he had to return to south carolina for an important vote mr smith said at his press conference that lt col nagl granted the one day leave saying he "didnt want to stand in the way of democracy " in the end however school choice was defeated by democrats who came out to defend the public education status quo and republicans representing districts stocked with parents who have already exercised their choice by moving to neighborhoods with good public schools who joined with them there are an estimated students trapped in failing public schools in south carolina about of them are minorities are we too believe that the defeat of a voucher bill that would have given many of these kids the ability to opt out of the system was completely for principled reasons in a state with south carolinas history its a question some choice supporters ask themselves as they walk past a monument flying a confederate flag on the capitol grounds mr miniter is assistant editor of opinionjournal com see related letter "letters to the editor public schools lack a competitive spirit" wsj april
