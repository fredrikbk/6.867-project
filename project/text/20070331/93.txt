the weekend interview with joschka fischer strange trip princeton n j you have to try this " says the frederick h schultz class of professor of international economic policy at princeton pushing his cup my way with an impish grin mexican hot chocolate with anchovy peppers cinnamon cayenne and whipped cream its not bad you dont find such curiosities in europe admits the charming and relaxed german seated before me wearing brown boots a black turtleneck and black north face coat he looks like a faculty regular gray haired vintage at small world coffee a hip spot right near campus but little more than a year ago joschka the professor was joschka the powerful abrasive two term foreign minister of germany in three piece suits before that came joschka the green party leader in casual dress and before that was joschka the neo marxist headbanger active in s radical circles in a famous series of photographs that surfaced a few years ago a young fischer in a black motorcycle helmet beats up a german police officer it all began with joschka the demonstrator from that epic year of in jeans and a t shirt in between mr fischer lost a few front teeth drove a taxi at night and led germany into its first war since the nazi days five marriages later this high school dropout who spent the bulk of his adult life fighting american foreign policy sometimes with brute force is a retired politician "done " yes "out of politics" in a cozy ivy league post ever imagine that "no " he responds in a not unpleasant german accent "but here you can see how funny life is " his life is both unusual and yet representative of his generations journey or more precisely that of the european left born right after world war ii raised amid peace and rapid economic recovery west of the iron curtain mr fischer rebelled before becoming the establishment of the leaders none won higher government office his most dramatic conversion came with his endorsement of military force led by once abhorred america no less to stop genocide in the balkans the intellectual left discovered "good wars" in the s only to bicker and split in the post world in iraq in the new left historian and fellow er paul berman wrote in "power and the idealists " "the airy concept known as our generation finally ceased to exist " without sounding defensive mr fischer tries to make sense of his own contradictions as for many europeans over world war ii is the defining event "i grew up with the two lessons which had to be learned based on german history th century history especially the nazi period " he says "no more war because war means in modern german history that we were attacking our neighbors committing terrible crimes and no more holocaust no more genocide " for some in the era left the soviet gulags pol pot the boat people from vietnam all brought home that military means are sometimes needed to stop human suffering for mr fischer the turn came two decades later when the nationalist fires spread in the balkans "suddenly these two principles" an end to war and genocide "were in confrontation in sarajevo in bosnia this was very painful and started within myself it was something very serious and after srebrenica the decision for me was quite clear " mr fischers first big decision at the foreign ministry was to sign off on natos war against serbia over kosovo he was in a small minority inside his pacifist green movement but prevailed showing "great courage and lucidity " in the words of fellow traveller and founder of doctors without borders the frenchman bernard kouchner tony blair may have been the most eloquent champion of kosovo style interventionism but joschka fischer took the continental left to places it never dreamed of going he plays it down with a sort of joke "you saw the pictures of my past " he says "i was never a pacifist " after advocating action in bosnia and leading it in kosovo the popular foreign minister helped bring slavs and albanians back from the brink of war in macedonia the last time i saw him in person he was barking orders to a half dozen aides over breakfast in skopje the macedonian capital a small nato force and international diplomacy secured the peace deal "we avoided another tragedy " he says "when that took place i thought so joschka thats it now relax all the pain is behind you you can now prepare for elections " he was at his political peak a few days later when the second plane hit the world trade center his first thought was "this will change the world " it did not change his world certainly for the better though he and his government supported the u s led war against the taliban strengthening his newly minted credentials as a pro american he says paul wolfowitz and other so called neoconservatives in the administration reminded him of his friends from the barricades which made him uneasy before iraq really came up "they are strongly ideological " he says "i had my ideological decade " around the same time his coalition partner chancellor gerhard schroeder used a last minute appeal to anti americanism to swing the close election to their red green coalition iraq brought more trouble for mr fischer and within his intellectual camp saddam hussein was far more brutal than slobodan milosevic and led a totalitarian regime inspired by none other than nazi germany for the idealists a small but hugely influential minority on the left in europe and though thats now an inconvenient truth a far bigger one in the u s iraq was at least as compelling a case for intervention as bosnia sierra leone kosovo and macedonia only the man doing the intervening was the distrusted george w bush whether hemmed in by chancellor schroeders early preemptive opposition to the iraq war or personal conviction mr fischer turned out to be one of the most prominent european opposition voices one scene from february stands out "excuse me im not convinced " a visibly irritated mr fischer told donald rumsfeld whod presented the u s case for war at the annual munich security conference his loss of diplomatic cool was noted by allies as well as enemies and his break with political and ideological soulmates like messrs blair or kouchner caused a lot of reflection "i thought a lot about that " he says "it seemed to be that they believe in principles " then he changes topics before offering a self justification one informed by hindsight of the difficulties in iraq since the invasion "saddams was really a terrible regime but there are some other terrible regimes around i was never convinced the u s will control the effects of such intervention " with irans nuclear rattling against israel where mr fischer has many friends would military means be justified to stop "another holocaust" now "the use of force will lead us into hell " he says before softening his tone "it makes no sense to have illusions about the iranians ive negotiated with them but on the other hand the final decisions about the nuclear program have not been made " after a pause "but of course the option of a second holocaust is unacceptable and this wont take place ever ever " some thinkers on the left soured on "humanitarian interventionism" before iraq and the notion now seems fully discredited on his side of the political aisle bosnia a distant memory on the other side interventionism never caught on as a thing in itself "its not a dogma and its not dead " responds mr fischer "if there is a need if there is a pressure if there is no other way out it will come back but unfortunately people will be much more hesitant at least in the united states " mr fischer is self avowedly no longer an idealist like mr kouchner "i will tell you what changed me into a realist " mr fischer says "first of all my experience with ideologies and the way it can end " he means i presume the fringe lefts embrace of terrorism in the s he was acquainted with members of the revolutionary cells and the red army faction aka the baader meinhof gang that killed dozens although he denies ever taking part himself the revolutionary cells helped carry out the murder of israeli olympians in munich "and secondly " mr fischer continues "i drove five years in the night in frankfurt in a cab i had a deep insight into the human character the catholic world view that there is the good and there is the evil is not the reality usually in a human being you have the good and the evil " he doesnt say but implies that experience in government changed him too having taken office proclaiming high ideals in foreign policy he saw mr schroeder who led the dominant social democrats elbow his way into foreign affairs his terrain in the second term the chancellor set the tone on iraq europe and russia calling vladimir putin famously a "flawless democrat " "it was never my position " mr fischer retorts adding suddenly the diplomat again that he and mr schroeder had "a very realistic view of each other " though "we were never personal friends " after the elections produced a split result both men left politics mr schroeder for a job at russias giant gas company gazprom and mr fischer to consulting and teaching the current "grand coalition" between the main right and left parties is like "sex between a hippopotamus and an elephant always very awkward " he says so mr fischer adds hes relieved to be an ocean away back in the former french maoist philosopher andre glucksmann who is "the looniness of repentant" in paul bermans phrase told mr fischer in a german newspaper debate that one of the lefts gravest sins is the "refusal to acknowledge the possibility of evil " mr fischer doesnt apologize for his past and the glucksmann jibe coming from a friend still rankles "as a good catholic grown up in a deep catholic environment i couldnt understand what hes talking about that i dont believe in evil " in realist mode he says "its not in our hands to defeat the evil its in our hands to limit it " mr fischer was born to a hungarian german family of butchers in bavaria but realized "very early" that he wanted a different life "maybe i kept my butcher style in politics " he jokes "some of my enemies said that " as foreign minister he was criticized for arrogance by the media and in turn once called reporters "nothing but five mark whores" he tells me he only had one specific journalist in mind in his most radical days mr fischer says he was never anti american "in a cultural sense " "jimi hendrix janis joplin " he eyes light up "i cant deny that " for him broke up "the old authoritarian germany" and brought a new whiff of "freedom " with womens lib for example asked what the years true legacy is he throws up his hands like many others "i still try to figure it out " he says " will never end everybody always says blame for this or that but its still going on " at a recent rolling stones concert in berlin he noticed three generations were in the audience enjoying the show to him the scene showed how that year changed the world "it was impossible that i would have gone with my father and grandfather to a concert " he says after this academic year mr fischer will go home to berlin and europe which "is in a very messy situation " we talk about the new generation of street protestors on the continent who proclaim their sympathy for hezbollah and disgust for america sometimes it looks like its gone full circle back to simple slogans and a flirtation with terrorism "to see america as the country of the evil thats terribly wrong " he says so is todays left repeating old mistakes "every generation has to make its own experience " he says without wanting to continue down this path lunch at the university club awaits and mr fischer s rabblerouser green idealist foreign minister realist walks out the cafe and back toward the princeton campus mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
