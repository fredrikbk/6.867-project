productivity lull might signal growth is easing ripples could confuse interest rate outlook fed remains optimistic the u s productivity boom that began in the mid s is showing signs of running out of steam if it proves more than a temporary lull slower growth in productivity that is output per hour worked could lead to slower growth in living standards more difficultly paying for the baby boomers retirements and a greater risk of inflation inflation fears would make the federal reserve more reluctant to lower interest rates official measures have slowed since the late s when an acceleration in productivity growth made possible faster growth lower unemployment lower inflation and lower interest rates it fueled a boom in business investment and stock prices today in contrast productivity growth has slowed business investment has turned down and inflation is proving stubborn "all the elements of the good years of the s have now turned around " said robert gordon an economist at northwestern university who has been studying productivity trends for years as a result he said current federal reserve chairman ben bernanke faces "tougher decisions" than his predecessor alan greenspan productivity and labor force growth establish how fast the economy can grow without fueling inflation if spending grows faster than that speed limit price pressures grow so the outlook for productivity growth is crucial to the fed which is already unhappy with the inflation rate slower productivity growth would offer one more reason not to cut interest rates the fed itself is optimistic "underlying productivity trends appear generally favorable despite the recent slowing " mr bernanke told congress this past week three fed staff economists recently released a study that concluded productivity would grow more slowly than it has for the past decade but still faster than the two disappointing decades before that turning points in productivity are notoriously difficult to spot and todays trends are subject to fierce debate among economists an argument fueled by the difficulty of predicting technological innovation and the ways business harnesses them productivity grew a year for the quarter century following world war ii then slowed to an average of year from to for reasons that are still debated by scholars productivity growth then accelerated to from to the precise cause of the spurt remains in dispute but it is widely believed to have been triggered by changes in technology and businesses embrace of them then to the surprise of most economists who had expected it to slow productivity growth further accelerated even as the economy sank into recession and then struggled to resume growing by early productivity was growing at better than a but productivity growth has slowed steadily since falling to just in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a year earlier the most recent data available one possibility is that this sort of slowdown is normal at this stage of the expansion now in its sixth year when the economy first emerges from recession businesses expand production with the same number of workers so productivity surges as the expansion matures firms often hire in anticipation of future sales slowing productivity growth but ken matheny an economist at macroeconomic advisers a st louis forecasting firm says the recent slowdown is "not primarily cyclical " even as economic growth has slowed he said hiring has remained fairly solid with the surprising result that unemployment has actually declined that suggests firms are having trouble boosting output with their existing work forces the definition of a slowdown in productivity mr matheny blames this slowing in part on the capital spending drought that followed the technology investment bust that left the growing work force with less equipment to work with hindering productivity growth a more controversial debate is whether technology is losing its productivity impact the new fed staff study offers some evidence that it has the research by productivity specialists stephen oliner and daniel sichel of the federal reserve board and kevin stiroh of the federal reserve bank of new york was presented at a brookings institution meeting thursday it attributes most of the productivity acceleration to investments in technology and management know how needed to exploit it productivity growth was fastest in industries that added the most technology but those industries productivity growth rate slowed from to while the rest of the economys accelerated the researchers attribute that acceleration to cost cutting and restructuring by companies facing severe profit pressure indeed they note that investment in information technology hardware and know how have been sluggish since this could undermine future productivity they say by denying the economy the "seed corn for future productivity gains " they estimate productivity growth should continue at about a respectable that rate adjusted for farm and government productivity and a labor force growing more slowly as aging baby boomers take early retirement could by some estimates pull the u s s "potential" growth rate what it can expect over the long term down to in the coming decade from the annual average of through while such estimates are fraught with uncertainty they are important to the fed lower productivity growth means an increase in wages is more likely to translate into narrower profit margins or higher prices which could prompt the fed to tighten monetary policy because higher interest rates curb demand by making borrowing more costly they also make it harder for firms to raise prices and wages indeed one reason the fed isnt contemplating rate cuts despite recent slowing growth is that unemployment is so low and wage pressures have begun to build fed officials believe their predecessors erred by not recognizing the inflationary implications of the s productivity slowdown sooner in a speech when he was a fed governor mr bernanke said "the principal effect of an unexpected slowdown in productivity growth during the next few years would likely be higher inflation " which all else being equal would call for tighter monetary policy but that wouldnt be automatic since the fed would expect slower potential growth to damp spending as companies and workers adjust to lower expected profits and wages and thus neutralize the inflationary impact indeed for now fed officials dont believe the potential for growth is reduced by much and it is only a matter of time before unemployment starts to rise which should damp wage and price pressures last week mr bernanke noted business investment has weakened in part in response to slowing economic growth though he expects it to pick up again thanks to strong profits and low interest rates but mr gordon the northwestern economist argues that business investment has turned down because businesses see less incremental benefit in new technology "people by now have gotten the low hanging fruit from the web and the internet " he says one example of this dynamic might be airlines installation of self serve ticketing kiosks in airports henry harteveldt travel analyst at tech consulting firm forrester research says checking in a passenger at such a kiosk costs an airline just cents on average compared with &# using an agent from to the share of passengers using such a kiosk at least once leapt from close to zero to but in that figure merely crept up to mr harteveldt says the big benefits have been achieved and the airlines have moved on to "fine tuning " such as using kiosks to price excess baggage or scan passports
