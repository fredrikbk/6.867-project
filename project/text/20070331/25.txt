encore a special report on the road again and again a new generation of retirees are moving not just once but two three or four times in later life heres what these retirement nomads are finding when joe dineen and ginny cooney retired to marthas vineyard from the boston suburbs in they expected to live out their days along the shore but after a few years they got tired of having to elbow their way onto the overcrowded ferry seeking a change of pace they moved across the country to sun city ariz in after that they lived on vancouver island british columbia in balmy boynton beach fla and as of last fall in a lakeside retirement community in southeastern michigan "we wanted to come back to a place with four seasons " says mr dineen while taking a break from shoveling his driveway last month "the snow is beautiful im looking out the window at the lake and there are all these pines that look just like christmas trees " there used to be two kinds of people in retirement those who stayed home and those who didnt now theres a third category nomads who relocate when they retire then pick up stakes a few years later and move again and maybe even a few times after that this wanderlust is the result of a combination of factors the growing prevalence of decades long retirements a higher comfort level with moving among corporate employees who spent their careers being transferred from city to city an increasing number of retirees with the financial resources to move around and one other thing the ever present lure of a better place to live with time money health and flexibility why not keep looking for the perfect retirement spot there arent many statistics available yet but the phenomenon has become so noticeable that academics are already coming up with labels for it scott wright a gerontologist at the university of utah in salt lake city refers to the trend of retirees with itchy feet as "fanby " for find a new backyard moving around has its advantages the possibility of trading a more expensive address for a cheaper one a built in change of scenery day trips to undiscovered places and the chance to tailor your abode to your current lifestyle and needs plus some retirees simply enjoy the adventure of moving to a new area and learning how to live there retirement is no longer a single "blob" that lasts years says ciji ware a year old author in marin county calif rather its a series of transitions that retirees are starting to think of in increments of five to years ms ware should know while pursuing later life careers she and her husband have moved several times in search of a home thats the right fit she recently used their experience as the basis of a book "rightsizing your life " "the s are the empty nest years " she says "in the s many people are slowing down an old career and maybe starting a new one in the s there may be grandchildren coming along and in the s you may have health needs to think about you may not ever find the perfect retirement nest but youll find what suits your age and stage currently " there are downsides of course "a lot of people are really impulsive " ms ware says "they see a golf course thats really great and they dont realize there are terrible politics in the homeowners association " when you move every few years its also much tougher to tap into a community and develop a support system of friends you could rely on in an emergency the act of moving is almost always expensive labor intensive and fraught with emotion theres the house hunting and selling negotiating closing costs packing loading and unloading unpacking and decorating now with the real estate slowdown some retirees including mr dineen also are finding themselves for the first time with an extra home to unload and the prospect of a real estate loss "does anyone want a house in boynton beach " mr dineen asks talking with retirement nomads its clear theyve reaped rewards but also suffered some disappointments in their years of serial relocations weve tried to distill the highlights and the caveats in the lessons that follow homework is still important theres much to be said for spontaneity setting out for a new destination and home without spending months or years weighing every last pro and con that said many of the serial movers we interviewed said a bit of sleuthing remains an essential part of the process after all retirement havens sometimes have problems no one likes to talk about or think about while theyre healthy mr dineen and ms cooney made two of their moves because of unpleasant surprises in phoenix mr dineen was infected with a fungal condition called "valley fever " or coccidioidomycosis caused by inhaling spores from a fungus in the soil in the southwest two thirds of those infected have no symptoms according to arizona health officials but others like mr dineen develop flu like symptoms that can last a month the condition typically is not chronic but can be severe in about of patients it can lead to pneumonia meningitis or even death there are local newspaper articles in arizona about valley fever and public health alerts are occasionally issued reading up on a place youre thinking of moving to could alert you to similar potential dangers but as mr dineen says "its something none of the real estate developers tell you about "we loved it in arizona " mr dineen says "but my doctor said if i stayed there i probably wouldnt live as long as if i left " the couple started over on vancouver island where they enjoyed the pacific northwest views and favorable exchange rate but when ms cooney went to the emergency room four years ago to get help with a stomach ailment they discovered a big downside the hospital demanded payment upfront because medicare generally doesnt cover treatment in canada the couple had researched the issue ahead of time they knew they would have to pay for medical treatment they got in canada and have to come back to the u s for medicare but just how that would affect them in the case of an emergency didnt hit home until it actually happened "we were relatively healthy but were only getting older " mr dineen says "we thought how would we pay the bill if one of us needed emergency bypass surgery " shortly thereafter they sold their canadian home and headed to florida you can start over theres one thing about nomads they arent afraid to admit they made a mistake in linda little moved with her husband henry van gieson from seattle to a waterfront home along the potomac river in heathsville va there were no stoplights or atms in heathsville the town was quaint too quaint as it turned out "i had lived in new york san francisco and washington d c and suddenly the highlight of my day was a minute drive to wally world " ms little says referring to the nearest wal mart the couple loved their home and mr van gieson found enough entertainment with "a little golf course boats and fishing stuff " he says "but it was not so great for my cosmopolitan wife who never could figure out what to do out there in the sticks " they tried to scratch the itch for shops and restaurants by borrowing a recreational vehicle and spending the winter months on the road but in the end they surveyed other retirees about their favorite places to live and moved to a development in new bern n c before doing so ms little closely read the yellow pages to make sure the community "had enough amenities" a strategy she has employed before subsequent moves as well "we were the first of our group to retire " says ms little "we kind of had to do it on our own and there was a lot of trial and error " ed and kathy burton who now live in south carolina encountered a similar problem when they moved from las vegas to tellico village tenn there were no nearby hangouts or necessities they knew that the acre lakefront golf community was somewhat isolated but after driving minutes to the nearest hospital to have a splinter removed mr burton says he realized that he didnt want to make that drive during an emergency with that the couple took to the road again if you build it they wont necessarily come one of the biggest surprises for some people who move in retirement is that friends and family dont visit as often as anticipated moving a second or third time doesnt necessarily help even if youre trying to make it easier or more attractive for would be guests tom lennox a year old retired developer of government publications spent six years in his first retirement destination santa fe n m then he moved in to sarasota fla to be closer to family along the east coast he expected a stream of winter visitors to his villa just a few minutes drive from a white quartz beach "that hasnt happened ive been very disappointed " he says "my more immediate family live in pennsylvania but they all work or have responsibilities " the same goes for grandchildren mr van gieson and ms little found they expected to entertain so many kids and grandchildren at their first retirement home along an acre on the potomac that they bought a place with a guesthouse despite the fact that they were only minutes from family they discovered that "the kids dont go to grandmothers house anymore " mr van gieson says "you have to go to the kids house they have all their activities and friends and soccer and whatever we learned it didnt matter where we lived as far as the kids were concerned " look out behind you the serial movers we spoke with like to think of themselves as being in control of their periodic relocations retirees along the eastern florida coast for example have cashed out during the recent real estate frenzy and moved to the states northwest coast or to alabama says mark fagan a professor of social work at jacksonville state university in alabama who studies retirement migration then again some retirees end up as serial movers because circumstances overtake them and they find themselves living someplace they no longer recognize the most common situation is the retirement "hot spot" that becomes a victim of its own popularity and leaves retirees with more traffic and less elbow room than they bargained for thats what happened to neil and shirley mclaughlin after they moved to st george utah in from south bend ind where mr mclaughlin coached high school football and mrs mclaughlin was a social worker they bought one of the first homes in the sunriver st george development which now has nearly homes st george was named one of the five fastest growing retirement communities in a ranking "i felt that st george was growing too quickly " mr mclaughlin says "real estate boomed and im assuming it still is but the traffic congestion is terrible in the wintertime " the original draw for them heading west was "wide open spaces " not traffic congestion he says so last may the couple picked up stakes and moved to a fledgling active adult community in broomfield colo miles from boulder they won a lottery and got to pick the first lot this time around they checked for protections in place to slow future growth "our backyard looks out on an open area with ponds and a big open park from our den we can see the flatiron mountains " mr mclaughlin says "the city zoning is very very strict there are acres of open space miles of trails and unbelievable ponds everywhere " different isnt always better some nomads say the spark for their first move and the next and the next is the desire simply for a change in scenery ideally something exotic and stimulating a couple for instance might move from the suburbs to the city and then from the city to a rural setting not infrequently these moves become a search for the "perfect" destination but the retirees we interviewed counseled that perfection can be tough to find and that the best move for some is the one that finally delivers you to a place that reminds you of home thats what the burtons have discovered in their years of retirement although their first move kept them close to home a house on a marina not far from their former jobs in boca raton fla they headed west in search of something completely different when they decided to exit the south florida boating scene they found what they were looking for in las vegas first in a master planned community with three golf courses they used las vegas as home base for exploring nevada northern california and colorado a few years later they heard about a mountaintop development under construction that overlooked las vegas and moved there struck by the panoramic valley views three years later they had had enough "you get tired of the desert " says mr burton "you hardly see any birds its coyotes and you occasionally see a mouse our front and back yards were rocks you get tired of that if you were in florida where its all green " and so the couple began searching again this time for a locale similar to their original home in florida but without the extreme heat and hurricanes after considering spots in colorado and living briefly in eastern tennessee they landed last summer at an "active adult" community in fort mill s c their home surrounded by lush fields is a few miles south of a development in suburban charlotte n c full of restaurants and shops that remind the burtons of what boca raton was like years ago "were home " mr burton says ms greene is a staff reporter in the wall street journals atlanta bureau she can be reached at encore wsj com
