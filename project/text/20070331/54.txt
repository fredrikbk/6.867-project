pursuits books builders gone wild animal architects by james r gould and carol grant gould basic books pages &# decisions decisions perhaps ill stop adding wax to this honeycomb and join the girls making a new layer of hive wall they look as if they need help " an anthropomorphic fantasy about the busyness of bees perhaps if expressed in words but "animal architects" makes the case that the underlying sentiments should not be dismissed out of hand bees exercise what looks suspiciously like judgment even with their pinhead brains nor are bees the only impressive structure making group outside the world of homo sapiens working cooperatively tropical termites build complex edifices up to feet high tunneling as deep as feet for access to the water table they adjust their structures over a range of local climates to get the proper exchange of heat and gas and they respond with startling creativity when vandalism forces them to rebuild similarly birds not famously big brained show great ingenuity when they decide on a site for their nests and when they construct them using whatever material is available male bowerbirds even seem to make aesthetic judgments ornamenting their bowers and maypoles periodically adjusting their decorations all these accomplishments pale beside the civil engineering of beavers they make maintain and refine not just lodges but big dams with spillways and log transport canals that are themselves fed by smaller dams and they do this work while carrying on constant guerrilla warfare with farmers and highway departments perhaps these creatures are merely selecting a course of action among an array of pre programmed behavioral patterns a more plausible view is that they are doing something closely analogous to our own kind of reasoning although without our language and why not the notion that animals think no longer shocks biologists donald r griffin best known for showing that bats navigate with sonar has written fine books on the subject what is special and admirable about james and carol goulds "animal architects" is their focus on built constructions think of our fascination with the artifacts of pre literate humans how much we infer about their lives from what they made and left behind it is sensible to do the same with animals intelligence the goulds argue is context specific to understand the animal mind then one needs to enter into the animal world observing its practical life and structure making habits to see an animal vary the materials with which it builds adapt to site dependent differences and compensate for wear and tear tells us more about its mind than having it run in a maze or choose among signals for a bite of dessert the goulds maintain that given a long life a complex habitat a wide range of food and material handling dexterity animals "learn" that is their judgmental ability grows upon itself becoming part of a feedback loop that may seem to us very like our own "animal architects" covers a lot of ground with a minimum of jargon and a temperate nondidactic tone there are some omissions the octopus for one really deserves a few words eerily like us the octopus learns what not to eat with just one test and seems to amuse itself by rebuilding its stone lair what may be most attractive about "animal architects" is the way it takes a series of examples and makes them work as elements of a general story showing how natural selection manifests itself in the real world not least in the form of nonverbal intelligence something we cant easily envision then there are those beavers what do they think about mr vogel a biologist is the author of several books including "cats paws and catapults mechanical worlds of nature and people" norton
