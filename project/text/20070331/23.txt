encore a special report health matters if sex drugs fail men still have plenty of options for many men with erectile function problems viagra and similar pills are nothing short of wonder drugs but the untold story of the sex drug business is that the treatments simply dont work for a large percentage of men how to help men who arent helped by sex drugs is an area of growing concern in the medical community clearly the drugs viagra cialis and levitra a class of drugs called pde inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction but consider this fewer than of the men who try them ever bother to get a refill part of the problem is that while the drugs can be highly effective for some men they dont work nearly as well in men with diabetes or severe cardiovascular disease or those who have been treated for prostate cancer studies show that the pills dont work at all in about of men who try them up to of men stop using the pills because they cant tolerate side effects which can include runny nose headache and backache depending on the brand of pill they use "when they work theyre great " says drogo k montague head of prosthetic surgery at the cleveland clinics urologic institute "but they dont always work a lot of men dont know they have other options " indeed men have far more options than they think the first step for a man who isnt helped by a sex drug is to go back and talk to his doctor sometimes the problem is that he isnt using it correctly expecting it to work too soon or without sexual stimulation although viagra levitra and cialis are similar in the way they work in the body they can have different effects in different men so some patients benefit from switching brands "theres not one best drug for everybody " says andrew mccullough director of male sexual health and fertility at new york university school of medicine "but there is probably a better drug for each individual you just have to find out what it is " men who arent helped by oral treatments for erectile dysfunction need to be open to the alternatives none of them are as easy as taking a pill and the descriptions may make some men queasy but men who use them say they arent nearly as unpleasant as they sound and the benefit consistently successful erections and a rejuvenated sex life makes them well worth the effort insurance coverage for the different erectile dysfunction treatments varies but if a mans policy covers the pills its likely to cover the other options as well one common treatment is called muse which stands for medicated urethral suppository for erection to use it a man inserts a small applicator into his urethra at the tip of the penis releasing a small pellet that contains the drug alprostadil which is similar to a naturally occurring chemical produced by the prostate an erection develops in five to minutes and generally lasts for minutes to an hour some men get even better results when they take both an oral drug like viagra at the same time they use the muse suppository about one third of men might experience a burning sensation from the drug but the problem typically isnt bad enough to cause men to stop using it the downside inserting the device requires basic hand eye coordination and men with poor vision or who are severely overweight often find it difficult to administer muse costs about &# a dose a more effective option is to inject alprostadil or similar acting drugs directly into the base of the penis although the thought of an injection makes many men squirm the base of the penis is the least sensitive area and men typically dont feel pain when they use this option penile injections are especially effective for men who have been treated for prostate cancer the downside is that many men tire of the injections over time as many as stop using them the injections can cost &# to &# a dose depending on whether a branded drug or generic is used one surprising option is a vacuum constriction device it uses a cylinder and pump device that causes the penis to engorge with blood creating an erection studies show the pump is between and effective some men dont find it comfortable and the device poses obvious limits to spontaneity but for men who dont mind those limitations the device has a high satisfaction rate particularly among men in stable relationships the vacuum device doesnt require a prescription and costs &# to &# for men who arent helped by any of the less invasive treatments a penile implant might be an option implants can be semi rigid rods or a saline filled device that can be pumped up the surgery has success rates of to and unlike other treatments is highly effective regardless of the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction like all surgery the implant procedure carries a risk of infection or other complications the cost of the device surgery and hospitalization totals around &# doctors say the biggest problem with pill alternatives is a general lack of awareness as well as a perception by some physicians that men wont accept treatments like injections or a pump "its all in how its presented " says dr mccullough "my approach is not to say you have an option of sticking a tube in your penis or using a needle or vacuum device or implant my approach is to say today youre going to have your first erection in what may be months or years its not about the process its about the end goal " ms parker pope is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau and writes the papers health journal column she can be reached at encore wsj
