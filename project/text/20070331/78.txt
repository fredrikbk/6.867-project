remembrances amelia s haygood american classical music label founder took early risk on digital recording for her third career amelia s haygood decided american classical musicians needed a record label so they could be heard amid the bachs and beethovens starting at age in her garage she not only accomplished that but made her miniscule delos international inc a technological pioneer recording digitally before compact discs had even been settled on as the medium of choice for digital music above all delos was an artist friendly label with decades of commitments to musicians ranging from baritone dmitri hvorostovsky to seattle symphony conductor gerard schwarz in a recording ms haygood wanted to document one of the last times mr schwarz played trumpet with the new york chamber ensemble before he gave up the instrument for conducting as usual ms haygood was in charge "we must have had music writers at this session " recalls mr schwarz "i was oblivious to them all thats how it felt with amelia nothing else mattered except the music " constantine orbelian who was raised in the u s has recorded nearly cds for delos most of them in russia where he was conductor of the moscow chamber orchestra "the first thing she would ask an artist is what would you like to start with " says mr orbelian rather than the more common record company practice of approaching artists with a specific commercial project in mind "when arleen auger recorded love songs for her she didnt like the way it sounded so amelia let her re record it thats unheard of " ms haygood who died march at age justified spending three times the cost of conventional recording to introduce digital technology as the price of striving for perfection "moving to digital sound is like cleaning bakery windows " she said in a interview "you see the pies more clearly but you will also see any flies " when delos became one of the first independent labels in the u s to sell cds in its sales took off "cds tripled or quadrupled our market " ms haygood told the los angeles times in "we ship by the truckloads now instead of little trips to the post office " the office moved from her garage into a los angeles industrial park although its catalog of about titles is heavily weighted toward classical there are a few outliers "heigh ho mozart " a collection of the composers themes from disney movies was a hit in others included a popular set of recordings for infants including "baby needs brahms " and joe williamss "nothin but the blues " which won a grammy in ms haygoods eclectic music tastes were not surprising given her circuitous route into the record business after studying languages at the sorbonne and american university she worked as editor of u s state department publications and then became a psychologist in a beverly hills calif practice with her husband j douglas haygood when he died in she worked for the los angeles country probation department where she designed programs for juvenile offenders until she became fed up with the "touchy touchy types" in psychology she told forbes magazine in in she cashed in about &# in investments and founded delos "american classical music making on record was fast disappearing " she told britains music magazine in "that became my mission " to badger music store owners to start carrying her label "i shamed them into it " she told pianist carol rosenberger an early delos artist and now the labels vice president for artists and repertoire by delos had annual sales of more than &# million and about of the classical music market according to forbes while tiny annual sales have shrunk to &# million today delos retains a loyal following of classical fans into her mid s ms haygood attended most recording sessions wielding
