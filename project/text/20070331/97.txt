the price of buying chrysler overhaul plans may equally sway daimler the battle to own detroit auto maker chrysler could come down to more than just price parent daimlerchrysler ag is equally interested in what a new owner would do with the no car company in the american market at least three potential buyers were expected to submit bids for chrysler by friday cerberus capital management lp the tandem of blackstone group and centerbridge partners and canadian auto parts supplier magna international inc some people familiar with the situation have speculated that other bidders could emerge analysts have estimated chrysler could be worth from &# billion to &# billion but the offers by each bidder are likely to vary significantly because each has different ideas about how best to overhaul chrysler people familiar with the matter say that will influence how daimlerchryslers board of management and supervisory board will view the offers daimlerchryslers chairman and chief executive officer dieter zetsche cares what would happen to chrysler after a sale because the german auto makers luxury mercedes benz brand could still share certain technology with chrysler long term the better to spread costs over a larger volume of cars daimler could even retain a stake in chrysler depending on the structure of a deal moreover mr zetsche as the architect of chryslers turnaround from a bad stumble in has a personal stake in chryslers success for cerberus chrysler could become the centerpiece of a vertically integrated automotive conglomerate which would also include big parts makers and a finance arm in the past year cerberus has assembled some pieces of this conglomerate it purchased a controlling stake in general motors corp s financial lending arm gmac financial services invested in supplier delphi corp and just this past week reached an agreement to buy another supplier tower automotive inc in a &# billion deal both delphi and tower are under bankruptcy court protection to help its chrysler bid cerberus has put together a team of former auto industry executives most notably former chrysler chief operating officer wolfgang bernhard who left volkswagen ag earlier this year david thursfield a former ford motor co executive has been directing cerberuss overall push into the auto industry joe phillippi an auto analyst and principal of autotrends consulting said he gives cerberus the edge because of the team of talent it has assembled with mr bernhard and others on board daimlerchryslers management would know that chrysler would be in good hands he said "from a talent perspective cerberus is the leader " mr phillippi said like cerberus blackstone is already a player in the auto industry investing in suppliers trw automotive holdings corp and american axle &amp manufacturing holdings inc one of centerbridges directors is steve girsky a former adviser to gm ceo rick wagoner these two private equity firms appear to be taking a conciliatory approach to chrysler according to people familiar with the matter in talks with chrysler they have indicated they are interested in keeping intact the bulk of the current management team of chrysler ceo tom lasorda these people said they have also contacted senior united auto workers officials to ease the unions concerns about job cuts they said blackstone and centerbridge dont have the all star team of former auto industry executives in place as cerberus does but kevin tynan an auto analyst with argus research thinks that may be an advantage "recycling the same old executives is not necessarily the cure all " mr tynan said "the private equity firm needs to be tough with the union and not care about burning bridges so having the same song and dance isnt going to get you that " magna is the only industrial bidder in the running so far something that could help its bid union officials on both sides of the atlantic have said they would fight a sale to a private equity buyer fearing that a financial investor would slash jobs and benefits magna is looking to use chrysler to expand from its sprawling parts businesses into brand name vehicle production the company makes a myriad of parts from seats to mirrors and operates an assembly plant in austria that assembles vehicles for chrysler saab bmw and other nameplates on a contract basis "magna already has a great business making cars so it has the potential to run chrysler quite well " said erich merkle an auto analyst with irn inc while magna is the only automotive company in the running its chances depend on whether it can find a private equity partner to help fund its bid ripplewood holdings llc is among the firms discussing a chrysler bid with magna people familiar with the matter said several people involved in the sales process have also expressed skepticism at how magna could be involved in a chrysler deal without losing at least some of its business with gm and ford which make up about of magnas business chrysler executives also have good relations with magna which is a major supplier to the auto maker and its president mark hogan a former gm executive mr hogan is a "real car guy" and already knows mr lasorda which helps magnas case mr merkle said but he said magna would probably have to sell its interior unit to appease gm and ford gm has also looked into chrysler but isnt seen as a likely buyer a tie up with chrysler would allow gm to gain instant market share while cutting jobs but product redundancies and a bloated dealer body are just some of the challenges that gm would face in a chrysler bid at p m friday daimlerchrysler shares were at &# apiece up cents in new york stock exchange composite trading
