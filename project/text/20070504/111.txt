weekend journal tastings uncorking a natural wonder to find top beaujolais it takes villages evaluating the king the idea of the tasting was this the king against all comers would it turn out that he had no clothes or would he continue to reign dressed to the nines beaujolais is one of the natural wonders of the wine world widely available inexpensive good at many temperatures and a fine match with a wide variety of food while beaujolais nouveau gets a great deal of attention when it is released in november its a simple celebratory wine designed to be enjoyed immediately upon release the rest of the year nouveau should be shunned in favor of real beaujolais some beaujolais is simply called beaujolais while beaujolais villages is supposed to be a small step up in quality better still are the cru wines of beaujolais from different villages each with its own special characteristics brouilly chenas chiroubles cote de brouilly fleurie julienas morgon moulin a vent regnie and saint amour these generally tend to be real bargains because many people have no idea what they are and while some other french wines are marketing themselves by proclaiming their grape type on the label this wont help beaujolais much because few americans go to the store looking for a gamay georges duboeuf is the undisputed king of beaujolais he is one of those important figures in wine like robert mondavi in the u s and angelo gaja in italy who has done a great deal to popularize the wines of his region mr duboeuf not only makes his own wine but also acts as a negociant for other beaujolais producers the result about cases of beaujolais imported into the u s in were duboeuf about of all beaujolais in the u s according to the importer white plains n y based w j deutsch &amp sons in many stores throughout the u s its hard to find any beaujolais from anyone else but in fact beaujolais produces a river of wine and many other producers some large and many small continue to ship beaujolais to the u s and that made us wonder if we tasted wines from all villages wines of each village against those of the same village and made sure to include a duboeuf in each flight how would the king stand up has the very bulk of the duboeuf operation resulted in dumbed down wines are the artisanal producers doing a better job when people in most areas of the country go to the store for a beaujolais and are forced to buy duboeuf because its the only thing on the shelf is that a wholly bad thing for this tasting we looked far and wide for wines from producers of all sizes in this case we even shopped at specialty stores that offered wines from very small producers because we wanted to make sure the little guys got a chance in the long run we tasted nearly wines though even so we didnt find enough examples of chiroubles regnie or saint amour for a flight of each of them we only bought the vintage in each flight we included a duboeuf wine beaujolais at its best has a lively fruity nicely dry cranberry raspberry taste that dances in the mouth the interesting thing about more complex beaujolais is that it still has that core of delightful fruit but its surrounded by darker richer and somewhat harder fruit sometimes giving the wine some structure and weight its a little like a dignified grown up who still has retained his inner child morgon and moulin a vent are usually the most serious beaujolais wines and can age a while as part of our tasting we also tried two flights of beaujolais villages we were quite disappointed in them they generally lacked charm and tasted on the whole like they were made in giant industrial vats with all sorts of flavorings added in fact wed urge you to skip beaujolais villages and focus on the crus which cost about the same or just a little more so on to the main event the tasting was as wed expect a pleasure beaujolais is such a happy wine whether light and grapey or in the case of morgon and moulin a vent more structured and appropriate to steak we found the fleurie wines we tasted especially consistent and would recommend searching for them and how did the king fare darn well as it turns out actually better than we would have guessed of the seven villages whose wines we tasted a duboeuf wine was our favorite in three of our dozen favorites overall four were duboeuf and the duboeuf wines that werent among our favorites were still consistently pleasant what this means to us is that if you go into a store and only see a duboeuf beaujolais youll be fine more important though is that as the weather warms and your meals call for a wine thats a bit more informal you really should make a special effort to find one of the village wines of beaujolais which cant be beat for the price be sure to buy or even if you see it except of course nouveau which good wine shops should no longer be selling get a fleurie for instance and have it with salmon then get a morgon and have it with hamburgers or steak and discover for yourself how versatile beaujolais can be melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones villages of beaujolais index in a tasting of beaujolais from the special villages of the region these were our favorites listed by commune there are cru villages but we didnt find enough from st amour regnie or chiroubles for a flight of each so they arent included in this list in each case we tasted wines from each villageagainst others from the same place we generally prefer these at cool room temperature but in summer they are also good chilled and in winter we prefer them warmer beaujolais is a fine sipping wine but also pairs nicely with all kinds of food from salmon to hamburgers most beaujolais is made to drink young but some especially morgon and moulin a vent can improve for at least a couple of years the villages are listed alphabetically some of the producers listed below are small but they represent many little known beaujolais
