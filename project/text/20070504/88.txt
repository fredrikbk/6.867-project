the numbers guy figuring the impact of allowing felons in florida to vote florida gov charlie crists move to restore civil rights to state residents with certain felony convictions is a clear victory for the people who will get the right to vote serve on juries and hold occupational licenses whats less clear is the implication for the political balance of power in the crucial state many news reports have repeated these compelling numbers of nearly one million disenfranchised floridians about will now automatically get the right to vote theyre expected to vote overwhelmingly democratic because theyre disproportionately poor and african american in a state where the presidential election was decided by a hotly contested razor thin vote a republican governor appears to have given an advantage to democrats but all of these numbers the counts of people affected the percentage likely to vote and their projected party breakdown are fraught with uncertainty muddying political predictions start with the number of people affected most advocacy groups say at least released felons in florida have lost their voting rights out of about two million such people nationwide christopher uggen a university of minnesota sociologist arrived at those counts by compiling historical data on the release of felony convicts then adjusting based on estimates of how many have died moved out of state or are back in prison for another crime "my estimate " said prof uggen "is based on modeling and assumptions rather than a head count " florida announced a much lower count of based on what seems at first glance to be a more direct approach the states department of law enforcement has records back to of all arrests in which the police took fingerprints last month the department took a "snapshot" of the fingerprint database counting every convicted felon under the age of who hadnt been arrested for a felony in the past year spokeswoman heather smith calls the count a cap because "some may be incarcerated and some may be deceased " but she couldnt say what proportion of arrests involve getting fingerprints other state agencies arent sure about the correct number "there could be as many as a million " says jo ellyn rackleff spokeswoman for floridas department of corrections which maintains its own list of released prisoners "were still scrubbing the list removing people who have died or are ineligible " floridas new law makes kentucky and virginia the only states left that take voting rights away from all felons as opposed to certain violent felony offenders neither state knows the size of this population none of floridas counts include felons convicted when living in other states floridas population gained more than million from interstate migration in the six years ended last july whatever its size florida says of this group will be getting its rights back quickly because of the rule change that estimate is based on an analysis of people last year who committed felonies four out of five committed crimes that make them eligible for reinstatement while one of five committed murder sexual assault or other violent crimes and would have to wait or appeal for clemency extrapolating from last years felon rolls to all ex offenders in florida is dicey in recent years certain nonviolent misdemeanors have been upgraded to felonies and new felonies have been created before these changes a greater proportion of felonies were likely more violent crimes that would keep the convicts from getting their voting rights back in any event seems an overestimate it was calculated only on crimes committed if any offenders have committed crimes since then or havent paid restitution to the victims or to the state they arent eligible for the immediate restoration of rights its unclear how many who otherwise are eligible fail to meet one of those criteria says a spokeswoman for gov crist a check of the states arrests database this week found fewer than of cases about are eligible newly released felons will automatically enter the clemency process but the majority of those released leave the states system with little more than a "last known address " the department of corrections computerized records go back to earlier files are in microfiche the department has processed files for people so far and found about half are eligible for restoration of rights "i think public awareness is going to have to be raised considerably" to get people to submit applications for reinstatement ms rackleff says the state has budgeted just &# for outreach "it could be years before the backlog is cleared " says aubrey jewett a university of central florida political scientist the biggest unknown in these political calculations how many newly eligible voters will exercise their right and for which party its an open question whether a group of people denied the vote for decades will embrace the democratic process says curtis gans of american university "it tends to be a more alienated class than anyone else in our society " in the latest statewide florida election only of the unalienated populace voted email me at numbersguy
