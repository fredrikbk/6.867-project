gagging shaha riza since the misnamed "wolfowitz scandal" broke last month enemies of the world bank president have engaged in selective press leaks and calculated smears intended to oust him most of these leaks have come from within the bank itself not that weve seen any effort by the institution to stop them meanwhile the bank bureaucracy has systematically sought to prevent mr wolfowitz and his girlfriend shaha riza from telling their side of the story exhibit a is the banks refusal to allow ms riza whose raise and promotion are the central issue to defend herself even in a newspaper op ed that was the order she received this week from one w paatii ofosu amaah a longtime bank bureaucrat from ghana who serves as its vice president and corporate secretary both ms riza and her lawyer declined to comment and were not our sources but others whove seen the letter tell us that mr ofosu amaah cited the banks disclosure policies regarding board proceedings to forbid ms riza from taking her case to the public thats more than odd given that ms riza currently works at a state department affiliate her salary continues to be paid by the bank as part of an agreement to avoid a "conflict of interest" claimed by the banks own ethics committee bank sources also tell us that mr ofosu amaah was among those who opposed letting mr wolfowitz and ms riza testify on monday to the "ad hoc committee" investigating the case one source adds that "like several other vice presidents paatii took the position that a verdict could be reached through the documentary evidence alone " maybe that explains why this kangaroo court was prepared last week to reach a guilty verdict against mr wolfowitz before either he or ms riza had been given a chance to appear according to "three senior bank officials" cited on saturday by the washington post mr ofosu amaahs office didnt return our calls naturally
