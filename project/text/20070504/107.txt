weekend journal review theater smells like tween spirit legally blonde palace theatre  broadway &# &# lovemusik biltmore theatre  w th st &# &# coram boy imperial theatre  w th st &# &# new york sure things are rare on broadway but absolutely everyone in the business is predicting an endless run for "legally blonde the musical " the stage version of reese witherspoons screen comedy about a pink clad puppy toting malibu sorority girl who follows mr wrong to harvard law school where she finds true love and becomes a successful criminal lawyer who am i to disagree i know a megahit when i see one and "legally blonde" has cash written all over it whats more its fairly inoffensive as commercial commodities go so if your tweenage daughter begs you to take her and she will give in gracefully you wont be bored i wish i could be more enthusiastic especially since so much of "legally blonde" is so very well done for openers laura bell bundy brings off the near impossible trick of filling ms witherspoons strappy shoes ms bundys performance is energetic charming and unexpectedly personal and i look forward to seeing her in something more challenging next time around as for jerry mitchell lately of "dirty rotten scoundrels " hes staged "legally blonde" with zowie galore and his dances though choreographically unmemorable push the plot vigorously laurence okeefe and nell benjamin share joint credit for the music and lyrics in the latter capacity theyre just about bulletproof especially in the comic numbers that are the highlight of the show funniest of all is "blood in the water " in which a fearsomely snooty law professor michael rupert explains to his terrified students what it takes to get ahead in the profession "read your thomas hobbes only spineless snobs will quarrel with the morally dubious jobs " the music alas is the usual bland undemanding middle of the road pop pap that has come to dominate broadway and thats whats wrong with "legally blonde " absurd though the premise of the movie was ms witherspoon somehow made you care about the fate of elle woods creating that kind of emotional identification is the key to making a good film comedy in a stage musical by contrast the score must do most if not all of the emotional heavy lifting and mr okeefe and ms benjamin have nothing to offer in that department but nondescript semi tunes if the music of "legally blonde the musical" had been as good as the lyrics the show would have been as good as the movie indeed its good enough but no better tunes you want tunes go see "lovemusik " a jukebox musical about the open marriage of kurt weill michael cerveris and lotte lenya donna murphy weill was one of the greatest theater composers of the th century and "lovemusik" contains two dozen of his best songs some familiar "speak low" and some not "i dont love you" you wont hear better music on broadway or anywhere else for that matter the show itself is somewhat uneven mostly because of alfred uhrys book in which the sad story of the lenya weill menage is boiled down into a docudrama full of the kind of creaky scene setting dialogue that went out with old time radio "i am a serious composer " "you cannot be serious and popular " "you wouldnt understand " but mr cerveris ms murphy and david pittu who plays bertolt brecht weills famously arrogant collaborator speak their lines with fiery conviction and sing their songs so poignantly that the books weaknesses recede into the distance as for ms murphys eerily exact impersonation of lenya its a tour de force comparable in quality to philip seymour hoffmans truman capote not only does she get all the surface details right but she inhabits them so completely that you forget shes pretending to be someone else and not even lenya herself sang "surabaya johnny" so well if youre not careful you wont notice that mr cerveris is just as good at playing her long suffering husband to see the two of them acting up a storm in the intimate setting of the manhattan theatre clubs seat biltmore theatre is a priceless privilege harold prince has returned to broadway after an unconscionably long absence to direct "lovemusik " his classy touch is omnipresent not least in ms murphys acting which undoubtedly benefits from the fact that mr prince directed lenya on broadway years ago in "cabaret " i wish hed tightened up the second act but otherwise this production is an impeccable piece of work the sets are perfect the ensemble glitters and patricia birchs stagings of the musical numbers are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the show im not going to try to tell you that "lovemusik" is flawless it took me a good half hour to buy into the idea of a jukebox musical for eggheads whose stars deliver their lines and sing their songs in german agkzents reminiscent of dr strangelove and lili von shtupp truth to tell "lovemusik" really shouldnt work yet it does its anybodys guess whether so recherche a show can stay afloat on broadway for more than a month or two so see it now even if it isnt quite your cup of tea youll hate yourself if you miss donna murphy if youve been hungering for a three hour long dose of pretentious silliness i give you "coram boy " a creepily mawkish tale of two th century orphans that plays like a cross between "oliver twist" and "pride and prejudice" rewritten by thomas harris and accompanied by the music of handel i told you it was pretentious i cant imagine why anybody at the national theatre of great britain thought it would travel this kind of ultra elaborate melodrama is peculiarly british in its appeal and while melly stills staging is faultlessly executed my guess is that american audiences will find themselves laughing in all the wrong places mr teachout the journals drama
