use of derivatives is hard on funds accounting taxes as mutual fund companies increasingly use complex financial instruments called derivatives in their portfolios its causing them some serious headaches mutual funds use derivatives either to boost returns or hedge their bets some of the exotic types of derivatives are widely used by funds that invest in bonds or commodities within the past year derivatives related tax or accounting implications have caused some funds to restate their financial statements and some others to change the instruments they are using derivatives are also making it harder for fund companies to comply with a new accounting rule that takes effect in june the problems shed light on a key challenge that mutual funds face as they use these instruments how to account for them properly every day unlike plain vanilla investments like stocks and bonds whose price is easily obtainable in the market complex derivatives can be harder to price because they arent heavily traded an error in the calculation of their price can potentially lower or raise the funds net asset value changing the value of an investors account while there havent been any major issues of incorrect valuations so far the issue is serious enough that last month andrew donohue chief of the securities and exchange commissions investment management division said that many fund companies accounting legal and rules compliance systems may not be "sophisticated enough to effectively handle" derivatives in many cases someone in fund accounting has to manually make calculations to value these instruments "the more human intervention the more chance for error " says kevin oconnell a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers llp the other key issue lies around taxation "some of these instruments arent as clear cut in terms of the tax treatment and so the issue for the mutual fund industry is how do they deal with that " says garry moody a partner at deloitte &amp touche llp the current hurdle before the industry is a new interpretation of a tax related accounting rule called fin that would require funds to estimate and account for potential tax liabilities for all of their portfolio holdings irrespective of whether they will eventually pay the tax or not with some credit default swaps for example it isnt clear how they will be taxed fin is applicable to corporations as well following a letter in december by three large fund companies fidelity investments massachusetts financial services co and oppenheimerfunds inc the sec gave mutual funds an extension to implement this rule no later than june in another instance earlier this year many municipal bond focused funds had to restate their results for several years because of a change in the accounting treatment for a type of derivative called an inverse floater this security has an inverse relationship to short term interest rates meaning the yield rises when interest rates fall these instruments have been used by fixed income mutual funds for nearly a decade but were set up a little differently in recent years last year accountants decided that because of these modifications their accounting treatment should be revised while the restatements didnt affect the net asset value or yield of the funds it caused a flurry among the fund companies as it could potentially confuse shareholders the situation amounted to "a serious headache " says donald boteler vice president of operations at fund trade group investment company institute "it didnt change the economics for shareholders but we went through a lot of very very tense moments to try to get things re presented " says mr boteler the ici recently met with representatives of the major accounting firms to increase its influence over new accounting rules that may affect funds in a separate issue last year some mutual funds that aim to invest in commodities had to stop using certain commodity index derivative contracts because the internal revenue service objected to them saying they didnt qualify for certain tax benefits that mutual funds can claim the ruling caused a few funds like pimco commodityrealreturn strategy fund and rydex commodity securities fund to change the securities they were investing in
