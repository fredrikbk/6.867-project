the morning brief a consensus prescription for treating climate change online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the two previous reports on climate change from the international band of scientists deployed to examine it looked at how greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures and assessed how the phenomenon is affecting human lives the third and final report wrapped up today in bangkok recommends the nuts and bolts of how as a cnn correspondent put it "we can avert catastrophe here on planet earth " the report whose final draft had yet to be published as the u s east coast was waking up suggests governments can rein in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions at a reasonable cost the bbc reports "boosting renewable energy reducing deforestation and improving energy efficiency can all help " the bbc adds "the sharpest cuts keeping greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to levels equivalent to between parts and parts per million of carbon dioxide might cost anything up to of global gdp by while milder curbs could even enhance growth " the worlds current concentration is about parts per million of carbon dioxide many researchers think carbon dioxide concentrations mustnt exceed parts per million if average global temperature increases are to be kept under degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and the report suggests to avoid major climate impact on the planet the currently fast growing emissions of greenhouse gases must peak and start declining in the coming one or two decades at the moment nature notes emissions look set to keep increasing for at least the next years in other words massive policy change is required across the worlds economies and yet todays report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change didnt provoke the kind of backroom fights over the final wording that previous ipcc studies did delegates tell the associated press the final version largely resembles the draft put together by scientists and presented to member governments for comment and that the authors resisted pressure from china to tone down the language "everything we wanted to see was there and more the message is we have to do something now " said peter lukey a member of the south africa delegation china is the no emitter of greenhouse gases after the u s and its cause found support from india and other developing nations that worry curbs on emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases mostly through limits on the use of fossil fuels could hurt their economic growth beijing also wanted the report to put more blame for global warming on the u s and major industrialized countries in europe and more responsibility for solving the problem the ap says but it ended up compromising stephan singer a spokesman for the world wildlife fund tells the bbc he was surprised by the end result "it is a victory of sound science over junk science " mr singer says "it shows that no government can hide away from cutting global emissions " the reason for less resistance this time might be found in the negative publicity such opposition garnered in the past as well as in the fact that governments dont have to follow the ipccs suggestions but it might also be because at least some governments are more willing to look at doing so john howard australias conservative prime minister and generally a close international ally of president bush tells new york times columnist thomas friedman that he has evolved from being a climate skeptic to what he calls a "climate realist " and one who adopted programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions just as his political opponents have "what was considered left a year ago is now center and in six months it will be conservative that is how quickly the debate about climate change is moving here " michael roux chairman of melbourne investment firm ri capital tells mr friedman "it is being led by young people around the dinner table with their parents and the ceos and politicians are all playing catch up " someones interested in reuters reuters group has become the latest big media company in play days after dow jones acknowledged rupert murdoch was gunning for the owner of the wall street journal reuters today confirmed "it has received a preliminary approach from a third party which may or may not lead to an offer " it adds "there is no certainty an offer will be made or necessary approvals including those required under reuters

buildings are being completed the buyers are filing lawsuit against the builders "claiming they were duped into purchases they couldnt afford or victimized through fraudulent investment schemes " the journal says "some are scrutinizing their contracts looking for loopholes or searching out tiny flaws in finished homes that might allow them to back out without losing their deposits " ruling sets

advantage of the favorable judgment to launch an immediate bid for abn and or lasalle " the times of london reports adding that sir fred goodwin the rbs chief executive may meet abn chairman arthur martinez as early as today but these developments look likely to provoke more legal action from bank of america which has threatened to file huge damage claims against abn for breaching the sale contract and the financial times notes that too could "extend uncertainty about the dutch banks future " also of note los angeles times secretary of state condoleezza rice met with syrias foreign
