prized lots for &# but it wasnt a painting a sculpture or a chippendale chest it was a cast iron doorstop made in the s "it was very rare " says jeanne bertoia the auction houses co owner who also happens to be a prominent doorstop collector "also it was very whimsical and cute so lots of collectors wanted to get their hands on it " the boom in collectibles is reaching unprecedented and some say ridiculous heights and its not just bottles of cheval blanc that are shattering price records with a growing number of rich people looking for rare objects that few others can own prices are surging for everything from stamps to toy banks duck decoys and chinese snuff bottles some of the buyers are longtime collectors who have been pursuing their quirky pastimes for years yet auctioneers and sellers say the real change in these markets is being driven by a new breed of buyer young newly rich financial traders and entrepreneurs who are using their massive cash piles and sophisticated business savvy to stake big claims in obscure markets to some of these buyers collectibles arent just accessories for the mantelpiece theyre tradable assets just like stocks bonds or derivatives

on some of the same sophisticated financial strategies he uses to make billions in the bond market studying patterns in the stamp market over the past years mr gross found that certain sales tracked closely the growth in u s nominal gross domestic product by projecting future gdp growth he could also plot the future prices for certain stamps "i looked at the history of the stamps and correlated the prices to the growth rate of the u s economy to make sure i wasnt getting my hat handed to me " he says "i dont think most of the people in the stamp collecting world understood what i was doing " hes also a clever trader having swapped some "inverted jenny" stamps for an benjamin franklin "z grill" to give him every stamp the u s has ever produced yet mr gross says that rich collectors like him have pushed up prices in the stamp market so fast that hes worried it could be near a peak that was one reason he decided to sell part of his collection and take some profits off the table to benefit doctors without borders "whenever you buy something you always wonder am i the fish at the table at a certain point you want to test the profits " then theres paul tudor jones ii the hedge

rosenberg says duck decoy collectors used to be backwoods hunter types the hunters still buy but todays buyers also include urban financiers and entrepreneurs who are buying the ducks for their
