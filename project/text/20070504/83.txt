that long green fuel efficient road leads to unexpected problems so the eco friendly oregonians have come up with a complex high tech scheme to change the basis of the gasoline tax from quantity of fuel used to mileage traveled "fuel efficient cars dent states road budgets " marketplace april mileage charges by themselves dont improve tax revenue though they do have an utterly counterproductive effect on greenhouse gas reduction gas guzzling pollution spewing vehicles would be in effect given a subsidy while energy efficient low emission vehicles would be penalized with much higher increases in equivalent tax per gallon rates this is preposterous if tax revenues dont support the essential highway program then raise the tax rates yes gasoline taxes are reputedly the third rail of american politics but we pay tribute far greater than gas taxes to opec and the prospect of ever increasing gas taxes would motivate owners of gas guzzlers to replace them with fuel efficient vehicles forget schemes to obfuscate the tax hike they fool no one and worsen greenhouse gases john b walsh mclean va the federal highway administrations estimates of budget shortfalls in only two years speaks more to a lack of appropriate levels of investment in the past than increased fuel efficiency of autos drivers have demonstrated inelastic demand for fuel over the past year as prices have risen this may explain why the average mileage of u s autos has been flat for years and it suggests that a shift in consumers appetite for greater gas mileage wouldnt happen overnight and certainly not to the point of driving the woes of the federal highway administration rather than fess up to past mistakes in investment levels and bureaucratic waste the federal highway administration would have us believe that more efficient cars are to blame for budget shortfalls its a rather clever hoax to justify increased taxes a trend of rising average gas efficiency of vehicles will be a gradual one when eventually needed a more efficient and honest way of compensating for reduced tax revenues would be to simply adjust the per gallon tax rate glenn leyrer walnut creek calif equally as important as the revenue side of the road building equation is the expense portion significant reductions in cost could be achieved by reducing political and union interference in road projects common sense steps such as streamlining the permit process eliminating byzantine regulations and following rational environmental and safety guidelines would be a good start layer in fair wage rates and soon the need for additional taxes and fees is minimized the citizenry is increasingly demanding road projects that are managed with the efficiency of the private sector raising taxes should be the last alternative not the first patrick ennis seattle
