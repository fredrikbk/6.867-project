from one of the nations largest loan consolidators to recommend that graduates refinance college debts through the nebraska company prosecutors began sending subpoenas and letters to college alumni associations yesterday to try to determine if the associations that steered graduates to nelnet inc disclosed any financial benefits they may have received and whether the groups compared the rates of other consolidators before choosing to recommend nelnet the attorney generals office wants to know whether graduates received less favorable loan terms from nelnet than they would have from other loan consolidators "our investigation seeks to put an end to kickback schemes and payoffs that benefit lenders and their partners be they schools or alumni associations at the expense of students trying to control their debt " new york attorney general andrew cuomo said in a statement at least one association that has acknowledged a business tie with nelnet said it was paid for every loan application completed by a graduate prosecutors also subpoenaed nelnet in a statement the lincoln neb company said it has "affinity agreements" and license arrangements with alumni associations the agreements

incorporated from a university it has paid alumni groups a fee per application nelnet spokesman eric solomon wouldnt comment on the arrangements with individual associations saying it will cooperate with mr cuomo nelnet said it believes all of its agreements are appropriate and legal the company also said however that to eliminate any "perceived conflict of interest" it will in the future tell graduates about any deals with alumni groups related to consolidation loans during their college years many students borrow money from different lenders at varying interest rates with consolidation they are able to repackage such debt into one loan mr cuomos office said nelnet gave undisclosed sums to some alumni groups in exchange for being the preferred and only company that the associations would recommend for those consolidations alumni especially recent graduates are likely to trust the recommendations of their alumni groups when making such decisions observers say "wouldnt you give
