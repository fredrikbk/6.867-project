weekend journal giving back irs revamps a key oversight tool a crucial tool for donors hoping to see how a charity handles gifts is about to get a long overdue makeover but the move has stirred a debate over the best way to hold charities accountable to the public unlike individuals charities must make their yearly tax returns available to the public an estimated nonprofits filed in its part of their pact with the government which allows them to raise and spend money without paying taxes in an electronic database called guidestar began posting online the form that charities file with the internal revenue service overnight researchers donors media watchdogs and others began poring over the s technical tax documents that many accountants say are difficult even for them to understand now the irs is getting set to redesign the after a planned three month public comment period starting in june the agency will tweak it further the irs hasnt said when the new form will become official theres a lot to fix the form at least pages long has over line items of information in haphazard order the result of decades of additions by the tax agency without a complete revamp a reader finds a charitys revenue listed pages before learning what the group does questions about officers directors and other key employees are often scattered many pages apart "things like that are confusing to both the reader and the tax preparer " says tax exempt expert julie floch a partner with new york accounting firm eisner llp based on interviews with irs officials and charity and tax experts consulted by the irs during the redesign process some changes seem all but certain the irs is proposing the new form contain a "core" section including questions about revenue liabilities and programs plus additional schedules with information on certain charitable activities such as lobbying the agency plans to eliminate repetitive queries and clarify definitions and instructions but the new likely will stop well short of providing the kind of detailed performance measures that publicly traded companies have to make public the irs now asks charities to report what theyve accomplished "discuss achievements that are not measurable " for example but doesnt require common measurements of charities effectiveness compared to their peers and thats not expected to change nor will the redesign affect private foundations that dont raise money from the public they file a different form the pf brian gallagher chief executive of the united way of america has argued that more information about a charitys actual progress in achieving its goals be required upfront for example charities could list yearly goals and whether theyve fulfilled them or provide detailed reports on per person spending and what it achieved "we know how to measure outcomes " says mr gallagher "the question is whether we are willing to do it and put it out there for the public " but lois lerner director of the irs tax exempt organizations unit says "im pretty sure the public doesnt want the government deciding whos effective and who isnt " contact us at givingback wsj com returns from a shipper who gave it raymond a eckstein retired shipping entrepreneur and his wife kay how much &# million who got it marquette university milwaukee by request the gift will be used for a new law school building how it happened mr eckstein graduated from the law school of marquette one of the countrys largest jesuit universities in and that same year his wife received her bachelor of arts degree there mr eckstein became interested in maritime commerce and in the late s founded wisconsin barge lines serving ports along the mississippi in he founded another company marquette transportation which he named after his alma mater mr eckstein credits his "excellent" jesuit training in particular the law school classes with helping his business career the couple recently became aware of the need for a better law school facility and found that they could donate the &# million "without any problem " its the largest private donation the university has received the building and the library within will be named after the ecksteins who live in cassville wis and boca raton fla robert j hughes
