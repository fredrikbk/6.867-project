weekend journal review books inside the inside story at the center of the storm by george tenet with bill harlow harpercollins pages &# echoes of "slam dunk" so vex former central intelligence agency director george tenet that he has written a book had he never blurted those words to the president mr tenet tells us he might not have written it he wants to explain what the words meant and how they had so little importance on that december day in the oval office along the way he wants to explain the intelligence communitys role in the lead up to the iraq war his book does so mainly through revelations he did not intend anyone can make an honest mistake but the problem with george tenet is that he doesnt seem to care to get his facts straight he is not meticulous he is willing to make up stories that suit his purposes and to suppress information that does not on the very first page he constructs an elaborate anecdote to show the pervasive and bad influence of the neoconservatives the story is that richard perle chairman of a defense department advisory board was at the white house for an early morning meeting on sept even before mr tenet arrived to brief the president as mr tenet was entering the west wing mr perle exiting tells him "iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday they bear responsibility " note that mr tenet puts the word "yesterday" within the quotation marks he also describes where the two of them were standing as he thought "who has richard perle been meeting with in the white house so early in the morning on today of all days " note "today of all days " mr perle has recently reported however that he was not at the white house that day he was in france mr tenet was asked on television this week about mr perles refutation he said that he must have gotten his dates mixed up but the date is essential to the story in any event mr perle says that nothing like that exchange ever occurred the date the physical descriptions the quotation marks are all in the words of gilbert and sullivans "mikado " "merely corroborative detail intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative " another example mr tenet resents that the cia was criticized for its work on saddam husseins support for terrorism in particular iraqs relationship with al qaeda on this score he is especially angry at vice president dick cheney at mr cheneys chief of staff scooter libby at deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz and at me i was the head of the defense departments policy organization mr tenet devotes a chapter to the matter of iraq and al qaeda giving it the title "no authority direction or control " the phrase implies that we argued that saddam exercised such powers authority direction and control over al qaeda we made no such argument rather we said that the cias analysts were not giving serious professional attention to information about ties between iraq and al qaeda the cias assessments were incomplete nonrigorous and shaped around the dubious assumption that secular iraqi baathists would be unwilling to cooperate with al qaeda religious fanatics even when they shared strategic interests this assumption was disproved when baathists and jihadists became allies against us in the post saddam insurgency but before the war it was the foundation of much cia analysis mr tenets account of all this gives the reader no idea of the substance of our critique which was that the cias analysts were suppressing information they were not showing policy makers reports that justified concern about ties between iraq and al qaeda mr tenet does tell us that the cia briefed mr cheney on iraq and al qaeda in september and that the "briefing was a disaster" because "libby and the vice president arrived with such detailed knowledge on people sources and timelines that the senior cia analytic manager doing the briefing that day simply could not compete " he implies that there was improper bullying but then adds "we werent ready for this discussion " this is an abject admission he is talking about september a year after this was the month that the president brought the iraq threat before the united nations general assembly this was several weeks after i took my staff to meet with mr tenet and two dozen or so cia analysts to challenge the quality of the agencys work on iraq and al qaeda mr tenet savages the staffer from my office who presented that critique although elsewhere he sanctimoniously derides "despicable" political attacks on hard working professionals he misstates her credentials which include years of experience as a professional intelligence analyst he calls her a "naval reservist " which she was not he garbles the title of her briefing it was not "iraq and al qaida making the case" but the perfectly neutral "assessing the relationship between iraq and al qaida " mr tenet puts in her mouth the haughty and foolish assertion that the al qaeda iraq issue was "open and shut" and "no further analysis is required " i was there and she didnt say anything even close to that the whole point of her presentation was to urge further analysis mr tenet hosted our briefing because my boss donald rumsfeld personally suggested he do so mr tenet knew that the agencys dismissive view of iraqs relationship with al qaeda was controversial and of importance to the nation so there was no excuse weeks later for senior cia officials to be so thoroughly un ready to brief mr cheney on the subject the september meeting was not a surprise bed check after all it was a scheduled visit by the vice president mr tenet writes that two months later his team was "ready for another visit by the vice president " but he fails to mention that in the meantime on oct he sent the senate intelligence committee a letter about iraq and al qaeda that became the administrations most important public statement on the subject why is this key statement omitted from mr tenets book well it vindicated the earlier criticism of the cias analysts mr tenets oct letter made clear that the analysts had been understating the problem the letter set out concerns about the al qaeda iraq relationship more clearly than anything the cia had published before the senate intelligence committee reviewed the entire arc of this controversy the agencys first analyses the sequence of meetings the input from the white house and pentagon and concluded in its unanimous june report "the committee found that this process the policymakers probing questions actually improved the central intelligence agencys cia products " mr tenet does not mention this senate finding either i stress these omissions because mr tenet is doing in his book just what my office had criticized the cia for doing in its prewar analysis omitting information that contradicts preconceived arguments its a form of cherry picking a charge that mr tenet throws at others on several occasions eventually in a have it both ways concession mr tenet explains that there actually was a "solid basis" for "concern" about the relationship between iraq and al qaeda with respect to "safe haven contacts and training " he winds up confirming the essence of what the cias critics had said that there was worrisome information about iraqs ties to al qaeda that deserved to be presented to policy makers but he never admits that those critics were correct he doesnt even acknowledge that they acted in good faith fairness evidently was not mr tenets motivating impulse as an author his book is defensive it aims low to settle scores the prose is humdrum mr tenet includes no citations that would let the reader check the accuracy of his account he offers no explanation of why we went to war in iraq so is the book useless no what it does offer is insight into mr tenet it allows you to hear the way he talked fast loose blustery emotional imprecise from the "gut " mr tenet proudly refers to the guidance of his "gut" several times in the book a strange boast from someone whose stock in trade should be accuracy and precision "at the center of the storm" also allows you to see the way he reasoned unimaginatively and inconsistently and it gives a glimpse of how he operated he picked sides he played favorites the people he liked got his attention and understanding their judgments his approval the people he disliked he treated harshly and smeared his loyalty is to tribe rather than truth mr tenet makes a peculiar claim of detachment as if he had not been a top official in the bush administration he wants readers not to blame him for the presidents decision to invade iraq he implies that he never supported it and never even heard it debated mr tenet writes "in many cases we were not aware of what our own government was trying to do the one thing we were certain of was that our warnings were falling on deaf ears " mr tenets point here builds on the books much publicized statements that the author never heard the president and his national security team debate "the imminence of the iraqi threat " whether or not it was "wise to go to war" or when the war should start he paints a distorted picture here but even if it were true that he never heard any such debate and was seriously dissatisfied with the dialogue in the white house situation room he had hundreds of opportunities to improve the discussion by asking questions or making comments i sat with him in many of the meetings and no one prevented him from talking it is noteworthy that mr tenet met with the president for an intelligence briefing six days every week for years why didnt he speak up if he thought that the president was dangerously wrong or inadequately informed one of mr tenets main arguments is that he was somehow disconnected from the decision to go to war under the circumstances it seems odd that he would call his book "at the center of the storm " he should have called it "at the periphery of the storm" or maybe "was that a storm that just went by " mr feith was undersecretary of defense for policy from july to august he is a professor at georgetown university and the author of the forthcoming memoir "war and decision" harpercollins
