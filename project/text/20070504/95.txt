utility regulation is a form of tyranny in regard to john a bohns april letter to the editor "if greens persist that incandescent glow may flicker and dim" i hope your readers realize what mr bohn of the california public utilities commission is really saying that we consumers cannot make informed decisions because the regulatory environment in which mr bohn participates withholds key market information from us utility regulation is the primary reason electric rates are so high more than years ago the governments of the several states carved out market franchises that correspond to political boundaries we take all this for granted as the natural order of things but it need not be so and should not be so mr bohns commission and all others like it should be abolished so that consumers can enjoy a truly free market in power as we do in other consumable goods but that is unlikely to happen so the nagging class of politicians government bureaucrats and environmental busybodies will continue to interfere in our daily lives with petty regulations like the incandescent vs florescent light bulb controversy showerhead flow restrictions etc etc this needless intrusion into our lives chips away at our freedom just as surely as would the impositions of any would be tyrant patrick barron west chester pa
