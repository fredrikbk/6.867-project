shut a key in house hedge fund the latest in a string of setbacks for its u s division the problems at the hedge fund come a month after several big name bankers including investment banking president ken moelis who was hired with fanfare in early said they will leave ubs several top traders who moved to the hedge fund unit from the investment bank also have departed in recent weeks the hedge fund dillon read capital management was shut late tuesday after a &# million loss contributing to a drop in earnings yesterday at the bank which dented its otherwise robust stock price john costas a well known figure on wall street who launched the fund in the summer of has given up his chief executive title at the hedge fund unit and will remain as chairman until the end of june to wind things down ubs chief executive peter wuffli said the bank expects to book costs of as much as &# million to shut the fund about two thirds of which involves severance and related costs to fulfill contractual obligations to mr costas and his team these announcements raise questions about the direction of ubss u s securities unit although huw jenkins who runs the investment bank said "i dont see us losing any momentum" in ubss strategy of cross selling investment banking asset management and private banking products to clients ubs is the first major wall street broker to disclose substantial losses from sour bets in the market for home loans to risky borrowers known as subprime loans raising the specter of similar problems at rival firms european banks like ubs historically have made little headway invading u s banking but ubs was trying to break the mold expanding its trading and investment banking among other things top ubs officials joke that after years of winning top assignments big u s corporations no longer mistake them as employees of ups the courier service and just a few years ago ubs appeared to be at the top of its game in the u s mr moelis established himself as a linchpin of ubss advisory business the internal hedge fund which managed &# billion in an outside fixed income fund and more than &# billion of the banks own money was a key step in the banks drive of several years to bulk up in the u s when ubs announced in june that it was establishing the hedge fund and calling it dillon read after a venerated wall street firm subsumed years earlier by a ubs predecessor it was coming off one of its biggest investment banking victories advising on procter &amp gamble co s &# billion acquisition of gillette co currently ubs ranks ninth in announced u s merger deals so far in and seventh in underwriting stocks and equity related securities compared with eighth and seventh respectively last year according to thomson financial it won a coveted role advising sallie mae parent slm corp on its &# billion leveraged buyout last month and ranks fourth in world wide mergers this year according to thomson still ubs hasnt lived up to all its initial ambitions the banker advising on the p&amp g gillette deal blair effron quit to form centerview partners and is now advising altria group inc on its spinoff of kraft foods inc and news corp in its bid for dow jones &amp co parent of the wall street journal ubs built market share raising capital for corporations and advising them on mergers and acquisitions but the parent bank balked at financing the fastest growing and most lucrative phenomenon of recent years leveraged buyouts and when it did take risk making bets on the direction of the subprime mortgage market things didnt go well some bankers inside the firm complain that an unwillingness to lend as freely as many of its rivals has caused ubs to lose m&amp a clients amid the biggest lbo boom in history while the loss at the internal hedge fund wont change ubss overall strategy it raises questions about oversight said j p morgan analyst kian abouhossein "to lose &# million in an internal hedge fund that has a day to day evaluation of its positions is surprising " said mr abouhossein who has an "underweight" rating on ubs stock rather than take stakes in other already established hedge funds as firms like morgan stanley have done ubs chose a riskier path handing over more than &# billion of the firms money to the newly created unit and shifting about of the firms top traders there according to people familiar with the matter the firm gave mr costass team a large balance sheet a costly infrastructure as well as the ability to do things that often are confined to investment banking such as real estate lending according to people at the firm most important the hedge fund charged no management fee but reserved the right to of the units trading profits according to mr costas by comparison most hedge funds get to keep about of their trading gains known as the "carry " which can give traders huge potential upside but can also encourage them to embrace risky trades mr costas said that fee structure was "reflective of the quality of the product " a big culprit behind the losses according to people familiar with the matter was the hedge funds holdings of speculative second mortgages which had been originated by troubled home lenders like new century financial corp and fremont general corp the mortgages known as second liens are particularly risky because when a borrower defaults on his or her mortgage the second lien holder receives no compensation until the first lien is paid off the dillon read capital news followed lackluster results at the bank yesterday ubs based in zurich reported a decline in overall net profit for the first quarter driven largely by dillon reads losses its stock fell nearly both in zurich and new york but its new york stock exchange traded american depositary shares remain near their week high of &# after finishing at &# apiece down &# on the nyse ubs isnt expected to change its overall approach which it calls "integrated banking "our strategy is very clear " ubs chief financial officer clive standish said "we strongly believe in the integrated business model we have no change in policy in that regard " dana cimilluca gregory zuckerman and alistair
