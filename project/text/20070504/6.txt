ahead of the tape boom times for productivity lose steam the job market has remained strong even as the economy has weakened put the two trends together and one conclusion is that companies cant squeeze as much blood sweat and tears from workers as before so they keep hiring additional ones that might be good news for workers but it isnt necessarily good news for the economy the labor department reports april jobs figures today and economists think it was another month of good news on the employment front even though economic growth seems weak economists estimate businesses added nonfarm jobs to u s payrolls the th month in a row of job growth in excess of the unemployment rate is expected to rise to from marchs thats still low its all happening while the economy is slowing in the first quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just its slowest pace in four years that suggests productivity worker output per hour worked has slowed dramatically and its a problem because lower productivity goes hand in hand with reduced slack in the economy which can be a precursor to inflation productivity gains arent booming like they were a couple of years ago yesterday the labor department reported that productivity grew at an annual rate of in the first quarter that was down a bit from the fourth quarters growth rate and it was a long stretch from rates of more than that prevailed a few years ago productivity might be even weaker than yesterdays headlines suggest the latest quarterly productivity numbers were based on an estimate by the labor department that the total number of hours logged by workers in the first quarter declined which bolstered the calculation of output per hour worked yet monthly jobs reports have been showing that worker hours have been increasing which implies a weaker productivity reading thus far there has been plenty of evidence that the job market remains healthy the labor department reported yesterday that the number of u s workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to their lowest level in more than three months the weakness in housing so far hasnt hit construction jobs as hard as many economists had expected though of course april may have been the month it started to happen lehman brothers economist ethan harris says firms were so slow to add jobs coming out of the last recession that theyre still catching up with their employment needs even as the economy slows they also might be paying a price for holding back on investments on productivity improving equipment he figures slow productivity growth will put upward pressure on prices making it harder for the federal reserve to cut interest rates even as the economy slows that will be the downside of strong jobs numbers today it will reinforce productivity worries and keep the fed on guard "the fed has to keep its eye on inflation " he says "its not getting the slack it wanted "
