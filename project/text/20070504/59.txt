political convictions lawless legislators thwart social progress in india malnutrition polio a superior jail cell for mukhtar ansari ghazipur india since late mukhtar ansari has been confined to this ramshackle towns jailhouse accused of conspiracy to murder that charge and other criminal cases lodged against him over years have done little to derail a long political career in months after being charged with firing an ak at the local police commissioner mr ansari was voted a member of his states legislative assembly the equivalent of an american state senate in while facing a charge of illegal arms possession he won re election by a wide margin now the year old mr ansari is running again for re election in uttar pradesh indias most populous state hes expected to sail back into office in elections next tuesday thanks to a potent mix of divisive politics and political largess his brother afzal locked up with him in the ghazipur district jail is a member of indias national parliament in new delhi police accuse the brothers of masterminding the assassination of a political rival and five associates both deny all charges against them neither has ever been convicted of a crime the ansari brothers represent an extraordinary phenomenon in indias democracy even as the country strives to become a global economic force its legislatures are crowded with alleged criminals in office they are frequently accused of enriching themselves or their backers often through construction projects as well as settling scores with rivals sometimes violently in many parts of india such politics has produced a development paradox politicians continue to lavish attention on new buildings and roads but neglect less lucrative public services as a result critics say those with the greatest power to carry out much needed health and school programs have proved major obstacles to their implementation the costs of these failures are stark despite the economy growing at or more a year for the past three years india is falling behind in several basic measures of human progress the latest family health survey conducted by indias ministry of health showed child malnutrition levels even higher than in sub saharan africa according to the survey of children under in india are underweight unicef figures show that of sub saharan children under are underweight anemia linked to poor nutrition is prevalent in of indias children aged months up from seven years ago poor immunization coverage meanwhile has contributed to a comeback in uttar pradesh of polio a once rare disease the state accounted for about of indias polio cases last year only nigeria has more cases according to rotary international a volunteer organization that is part of a global campaign against the disease many countries including the u s have lawmakers who run afoul of the law and its not uncommon in developing countries for those fleeing the law to find sanctuary in political office brazilian legislators for example have been accused of entering politics to take advantage of a law that grants them immunity from criminal prosecution in office few countries however can match indias numbers following the election almost a quarter of the elected members of indias national parliament have criminal charges registered against them or pending in court according to the public affairs center an indian elections watchdog half of those with charges pending against them face prison terms of at least five years if convicted for some insular communities in india criminal charges carry much less of a stigma than in other countries or even more mainstream parts of india such charges may even be an asset since tough characters can help bond together people of the same faith or caste especially if that person is seen as one who will help resist bullying by other groups says rashid alvi a congress party member of parliament from uttar pradesh "they will elect the hardcore criminals if they think it will teach a lesson to the other castes " says mr alvi "its the idea of who cares if hes a rogue hes our rogue " for alleged criminals political office is alluring if they havent been convicted they can remain in office even while in jail and if convicted politicians often manage to hold onto their jobs while an appeal is lodged indias justice system grinds so slowly that cases may not be heard for years meanwhile police escorts deter their foes often other legislators from trying to kill them since candidates have been required to disclose criminal charges against them only since comparative figures with previous elections arent available but observers say the situation is worsening "its demoralizing to the police that you not only have to protect these people you have to salute them too " says prakash singh a retired police chief for uttar pradesh indias political ranks include well regarded leaders such as oxford educated prime minister manmohan singh since coming to power in his government has drafted programs to boost health services education infrastructure and employment its also increased foreign investment by lowering barriers to indias market supporting the technology industry and maintaining easy credit policies those steps have generated a young urban and free spending middle class but implementation of government development programs especially at the local level in poor areas where state politicians have broad influence remains a problem the world bank which has approved about &# billion in loans for indian projects is among the increasingly anxious foreign backers "it is easy to be optimistic about indias economic prospects " the bank stated in a india development policy review "but there is growing concern that the basic institutions organization and structure for public sector action are failing especially for those at the bottom " even mr singhs government has had to seek the cooperation of politicians with criminal records because his congress party can only stay in power with the support of a coalition last year the congress party lost a key ally coal minister shibu soren from the regional jharkhand mukti morcha party who was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of his former personal secretary nowhere has the political system attracted more unsavory characters than in uttar pradesh with a population three times that of california and new york combined it is also one of the poorest in the nation the state has played a seminal role in indias history an uprising against the british which spurred indias drive for independence drew support from rebellious local soldiers and residents uttar pradesh is the political base for the gandhi nehru family dynasty which has contributed three of indias prime ministers since independence in today as the state votes in seven phases over one month for representatives in the state legislature the ballots are full of politicians with less distinguished pedigrees prior to the elections slightly more than half of its legislative assembly members including mukhtar ansari faced criminal charges in the first six phases of the elections there were constituencies offering four or more candidates with criminal cases pending against them the criminal justice system remains vulnerable to political pressure political rivals often direct charges against each other and work to withdraw cases against supporters still many of indias legislators in legal trouble faced criminal charges well before their political careers began according to i c dwivedi former director of police for uttar pradesh and now the states head of election watch an ngo "they were criminals first and politicians later " he says mulayam singh yadav the current chief minister roughly equivalent to a state governor in the u s and his predecessor mayawati who goes by a single name both face criminal probes over improper accumulation of assets the charges havent stopped them from vying for the chief ministers post in the current election many of the states politicians are elected by tapping deep social divisions voters favor candidates of their own caste and will often turn their backs on candidates of other castes since those belonging to lower castes often outnumber the middle rungs and the elites politically savvy criminals can scare up votes with talk of caste and communal persecution according to arun shourie a former government minister and author of a new book on indias parliamentary system "the whole incentive is to fragment the electorate " he said in an interview there are powerful payoffs for mobilizing blocks of voters indias elections are won with a plurality of votes from each constituency not a majority the political party with the most legislators typically forms the government once in office lawmakers help determine where funds are spent as chief development officer for the state capital anurag yadav said he traced about two dozen cases of funds misappropriated by politicians some money wound up in personal villas but much of it went into constructing private schools which offer scope for graft cronies can build and run these schools says mr yadav and cuts from construction fees and tuition are kicked back to the politician in one scam a member of the national parliament provided million rupees or about &# through an ngo to help construct the villa of an uttar pradesh state legislator facing criminal cases including murder in another a politician used public funds to build a nursing home only to rent it out for weddings collecting the fees according to mr yadav these two cases were referred to the state ministry in charge of program implementation but mr yadav was transferred a few months later mukhtar ansari the jailed legislator rose to power doling out political favors to his supporters and defending his fellow muslims and the low caste poor against hindu upper castes his grandfather was a president of the indian national congress the party that spearheaded indias independence movement and his father was a communist leader in college mr ansari did little to distinguish himself beyond winning a gold medal in a javelin competition "not brilliant but an obedient boy " says b b singh a retired professor of political science who knew him in mr ansari was charged with murder after a bullet riddled body was found in the street according to a ghazipur police report mr ansari one of several suspects was acquitted six months later the first of five acquittals for murder prosecutors have produced few witnesses during the criminal cases to support the charges his supporters point to the lack of convictions as proof the charges are baseless in the year he was accused of shooting at the police commissioner mr ansari launched his political career from the nearby constituency of mau whose many muslims have a history of tension with hindus although members of the legislative assembly in uttar pradesh typically receive about &# million to spend on their constituencies in their five year terms mr ansari obtained times that amount according to his spokesman m s mujahid when asked how he had managed that mr mujahid said that his boss had used his "influence " he said the money went toward building roads bridges hospitals and a sports stadium and that of the funds were spent on schools and colleges both private and public mr ansari wasnt involved in the construction and denies all charges of corruption mr mujahid said at the ansari family home in ghazipur where employment has shrunk with the closure of sugar and weaving factories supporters attest to mr ansaris generosity gopal rai a self described writer recalled how mr ansari personally paid for the education of his son a software engineer another man said he was given money for his wifes heart operation mr ansaris eldest brother sibghatullah says his youngest sibling often pays marriage dowries for daughters of the poor for the past months however mr ansaris political career has been consumed by legal turmoil after hindu muslim riots erupted in mau in october police accused him of inciting the violence he surrendered to ghazipur police who later dropped the charge before he went free mr ansari became embroiled in another case the murder of krishnanand rai a member of the state legislature for the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party on nov a gang fired assault rifles into mr rais motorcade killing him and five others according to a police report the killers then fled to the ansari household the report said mukhtar already in jail and his brother afzal were arrested for plotting the murder a ghazipur court has rejected a request for bail officials in ghazipur suspect the politicians clashed over road projects or coal transport in neighboring states but no corruption charges have been leveled against mr ansari his spokesman says the family is wealthy enough from farming activities in ghazipur not to require income beyond his government salary alka rai the murdered politicians widow says that the conflict was tied to mr ansaris practice of stirring up communal strife to mobilize votes she is running for re election to the state assembly after stepping into her dead husbands seat in another election twist mr ansaris brother sibghatullah is contesting the same constituency in ghazipur jail the ansari brothers are accommodated in a "superior cell" reserved for inmates who hold political office the amenities include a fan tv and good food although mr ansari is only permitted
