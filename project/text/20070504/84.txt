the afternoon report hirings puny build online edition hiring slowed to a trickle during april suggesting that the economic funk that visited the first quarter was still hanging around at the start of the second and that the federal reserve is likely to keep its hands off rates last month employers added just jobs to nonfarm payrolls the weakest showing since workers were heading off to the polls in november and a clear sign that the economy is still struggling to cope with the massive drag that has come from the weakening housing market meanwhile the unemployment rate climbed to from in march gross domestic product in the first quarter expanded at a pace of just but the job market had appeared resilient posting moderate gains but todays jobs numbers according to nomura securities economists are the sort "one would expect in a slow growth economy " notably hiring for both march and february was revised lower the first time in a long time that the government has taken a hatchet to older data revisions to earlier data lately have been in the upward direction the report may signal that deterioration in the housing market is carving deeper and deeper into hiring it showed an job swoon in construction and economists said that given the downward trend in housing starts more declines are likely on the way global insight also noted job losses in credit intermediation which it said are linked to the unraveling of the subprime mortgage market at the same time wage growth is beginning to slow average hourly earnings were higher than a year ago but that compares with the and annual earnings growth that workers saw in march and february respectively further underlining weakening trends aggregate hours worked and the work week also shrank in a picture that brian fabbri of bnp paribas thinks undermines the impression given off recently by stronger factory reports that the manufacturing sector is recovering from a long slump still earnings would have to fall quite a bit more to knock the wind out of consumers wrote steven wood of insight economics and there were those who believed that all of the grim tidings in the report were merely transitory and that better days most surely lie ahead for example morgan stanley economists wrote that april showers had played a role in keeping hiring at a low level noting that the number of people who told the government that they werent at work because of poor weather last month was much higher than is typical for april that may suggest that the job market will flower once again during may for the federal reserve the numbers would seem to add up to another meeting in which policy makers will leave interest rates unchanged given the weakness in both hiring and the recent growth figures raising interest rates would appear to be out of the question next week lest the central bank snuff out whatever life remains in the expansion all the same wages will have to cool off considerably more and the unemployment rate would have to creep rather higher for the fed to believe that inflation is under control joseph brusuelas of ideaglobal wrote that "we still need to see the level of unemployment rate climb towards five percent to be consistent with inflation easing " he maintains that for policy makers to get comfortable with the notion of cutting rates the payroll numbers would need to come in weak for several more months the fed meets on wednesday and it is expected to leave its key federal funds rate parked at microsoft yahoo reconsider a deal microsoft and yahoo explored the idea of ganging up on search rival google in a merger a year ago but deal talks went nowhere now it appears that the tech giants are talking again the discussions seem to be at a very preliminary stage and could result in a number of possible permutations or once again in nothing at all but whatever the outcome the fact that microsoft and yahoo find themselves back at the bargaining table is a clear indication of googles power microsoft has been struggling to attract online advertising dollars on its own and uniting the companies under one roof would create a credible challenge to google dominance but a number of factors would weigh against a deal microsoft has traditionally steered clear of making large acquisitions and spinning off its online business in return for a stake in a bigger yahoo may also not be appealing also top yahoo executives are reputed to dislike microsoft yahoo co founder jerry yang is said to avoid even using microsoft products folding the two companies together could also prove
