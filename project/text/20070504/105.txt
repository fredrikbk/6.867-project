weekend journal review film spider man ups the villains flubs the drama heros dark side drags julie christie glows in away from her in "spider man " an upstanding franchise gets its comedownance after two epic successes that deserved their success the latest installment swings between intense action sequences and unaccountably flat dramatic interludes theyre truly unaccountable in a production that by another accounting may have cost more than any other in movie history the film also suffers from a surfeit of villains poor spidey must contend with three bad guys though one of them has amnesia related mood swings between nasty and nice plus the uber villain of a script fixated on the settling of old accounts and the recycling of old themes while its too harsh to suggest that what was fresh has gone completely stale the truth lies in between as with day old bread saying this brings no pleasure of all the recent comic book transplants to the big screen tobey maguires peter parker has been the most likable quirky and reliably human even when hes squirting web juice from his hands as the semi superhuman spider man and the series has gained in grace from peters fraught love for kirsten dunsts winsome and endearing mary jane watson yet the third go round conventionalizes its hero by throwing him into repetitive struggles with his dark side clothes and the man make each other here since the black symbiotic substance thats responsible for his darkness and alarming arrogance turns his costume from red and blue to jet black and the script traps him and m j in a domestic struggle thats straight out of "a star is born " the borrowing is not the problem "disturbia" borrowed an entire plot from "rear window " but added value that young audiences responded to the problem is that this particular borrowing in its comic book context casts an emotional pall audiences will of course turn out in staggering numbers for "spider man " which like its two predecessors was directed by sam raimi and find plenty of special effects to keep them pop eyed but theyll find that mary jane who realized spideys identity by the end of the last film has become a killjoy unpleasantly envious of his celebrity and sexually jealous in the bargain m j s singing career on broadway is going badly which shouldnt be a surprise because she doesnt sing very well she and peter go back and forth she rejects him he rejects her and that symbiotic substance briefly turns him into a not so funny stud who might have strayed from the set of "saturday night fever " but the whole movie keeps going back and forth between his domestic distress and his troika of adversaries none of whom musters a scintilla of the evil allure exuded by alfred molinas doc ock the tentacled cyborg who enlivened "spider man " one of them the veteran marvel comics villain sandman is an impressive digital creation who looks like a cross between a beige "hulk" and the silicon swirler in "the mummy " his solid state incarnation flint marko is played flintily by thomas haden church a second marvel staple the toothsome fearsome venom is another ritualized manifestation of the bad black stuff hes played in human form by topher grace who has some fun with the role of a sleazy photographer as if those two werent enough spidey must further contend with the on again off again rage of his erstwhile friend harry osborn james franco who holds our hero responsible for the death of harrys father the extravagantly crazed green goblin and seeks revenge by transforming himself into the much less extravagant new goblin will the extremely extravagant special effects prove sufficient to sustain the picture surely they will this time still theres a sense of fatigue in the scenes that dont involve high tensile webs and high tension suspense at one point peters landlord noting his tenants erratic behavior says "hes a good boy he must be in some kind of trouble " he is away from her instead of the frying pan and the fire "away from her " a beautiful debut feature written and directed by the young canadian actress sarah polley gives us the frying pan and the freezer thats where julie christies fiona puts her trusty skillet after washing it in the kitchen sink its a first sign that something is wrong in fact something is terribly wrong this vivid handsome woman in the fullness of her life has already been beset by the early symptoms of alzheimers disease worse still she knows it or at least suspects it with a chilling combination of clarity and detachment she tells her husband grant "i think i may be beginning to disappear " youth has trouble imagining age in the best of circumstances when it comes to connecting with alzheimers the imaginative leap becomes a huge one and not just for young people who can really fathom what it must be like when the core of your being comes undone memory by memory to judge from whats on screen the twenty something ms polley can she has turned alice munros lapidary short story "the bear went over the mountain " into a feature film thats often astringent on the surface yet deeply and memorably stirring part of its appeal is inevitably generational movie lovers who delighted in the young julie christies airy spirit and physical beauty will be moved by what she does here not because she looks old in fionas circumstances she looks poignantly fine but because shes such a fluent actress that she plays the flow of her characters moment to moment mental state rather than the stages of her disease its the sort of quicksilver quality that was captured on stage by "wings " arthur kopits play about a stroke victim fiona does say when she realizes her husband can no longer care for her at home "we are at that stage grant we are at that stage " as things progress however or regress she remains capable of disarming self irony eerie coquettishness and flashes of perspicacity in a flash of black humor thats wickedly pointed if less than plausible the script has her glancing at televised images of combat in iraq and saying "how could they forget vietnam " age shouldnt be the only measure of this movies appeal "away from her" is leavened by plenty of humor and set in a slightly surreal landscape where the damnedest things take place keep an eye out for an alzheimers patient who used to be a play by play announcer as is often the case with short stories expanded to feature film length ms polleys adaptation is most successful when it stays close to its source material the tone changes and the style broadens in scenes that extend grants encounters with a woman marian olympia dukakis whose husband has been a patient in fionas care facility but thats a minor matter in a powerful drama and far from being a solo turn by julie christie sarah polleys film is a duet that includes indeed depends equally on gordon pinsents superb performance as a loving grieving husband who gives new meaning to the notion of letting go dvd tip julie christie burst upon the scene playing liz the so called "free girl" free as in uninhibited in "billy liar" she wasnt the star though she attracted much of the attention tom courtenay played billy an english walter mitty living in his own world of complicated fantasies john schlesinger directed from a screenplay by keith waterhouse and willis hall the netflix web site says "billy liar" isnt available on dvd but thats a well untruth the title is part of the criterion collection in an excellent transfer and can be found in some video stores as a rental
