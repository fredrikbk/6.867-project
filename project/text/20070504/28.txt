economists react economists see possible signal of jobs slump in revisions online edition nonfarm payrolls grew by jobs in april the slowest pace in more than two years holding wage growth in check and easing inflation worries the jobless rate edged up to average hourly earnings increased &# or to &# that was up just from a year earlier its slowest annual pace since march here are what economists and others had to say about the data and what they mean for the economy and interest rates the april employment report offset most of the large gains reported in march perhaps most noticeable was the moderation in payroll job growth but the most salient part of that reduction wasnt a massive loss in construction workers that is still forecast to come in future months but the significant slowing in private sector job creation a second important feature of this employment report was the large decline in aggregate hours worked and in average weekly hours bnp paribas labor market loosened a bit in april but some of this was due to unseasonable weather during the month the federal reserve would like to see a gradual upward drift in the unemployment rate to about this would reduce some of the resource utilization in the economy and ease the pressure on inflation however labor market tightness is at best a coincident indicator and more generally a lagging indicator of economic strength so changes in the jobless rate will not drive fed policy insight economics perhaps the most important aspect of the april data is the downward revisions to the past two months this ends a long stretch of upward revisions and could be a signal of a downshift in hiring trends frequent revisions persistently in the same direction are a sign of greater underlying weakness or strength when revisions are upwards these tend to cluster of revisions around turning points so the job market could be getting weaker the decline in construction jobs is part of a downtrend that is likely to continue indefinitely as layoffs of finish carpenters electricians plumbers etc lag the declines in housing starts which really intensified after mid nomura economics research despite the drop in construction theres a lot more to go in this sector the decline pales in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of layoffs that would be needed to bring payrolls in this sector in line with reduced levels of output rise in unemployment occurs despite a drop of in the labor force as the number of people reporting themselves as employed falls had this drop in labor force participation not occurred the unemployment rate would have been a couple of tenths higher though some drop in participation is to be expected in a softening labor market goldman sachs u s economics research compiled by tim hanrahan
