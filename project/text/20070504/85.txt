so much an upset as it was some sappy novel from a childrens sports library stephen jackson barely made it into a uniform having lived through the threat of suspension for two days he didnt just keep his cool he dominated hitting those three pointers with the calm self assurance of a maitre d and then there was baron davis ejected once himself in game and to hear some tell it a bit too emotional

team the more he has disappointed i wonder if that trophy will make him feel anything but worse that little trophy assuming he gets it will be in a perverse way the precise reason someone somewhere is
