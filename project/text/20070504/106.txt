weekend journal review television life sentences early on in "when kids get life" the ham handed title of an impressively subtle film were shown a comfortable house elegantly designed nestled in suburban colorado there was it turns out nothing comfortable in this house of secrets for the year old living there the first of the subjects portrayed in this penetrating frontline documentary by ofra bikel tuesday pm pbs check local listings it is clearly not for nothing that year old jacob inds is the case history chosen to lead off this work about five juveniles sentenced to life terms by colorado courts a result assured in two of those cases by the remarkable ineptitude of the defense lawyers but in jacobs case it was the crime itself the shooting death of his stepfather and his mother which doomed him to life without parole notwithstanding powerful evidence about the tortured existence he had known prior to pulling the trigger it would be hard to find much to doubt in the court testimony given by jacobs brother charles four years older who provided a detailed account of a boyhood in which every day brought apprehensions mornings lying awake wondering what was to come at the hands of his stepfather some of the films most striking details striking because of their unmistakable aura of authenticity come from this witness who escaped the house as soon as he turned but not its memories among these was the daily dread that he experienced on hearing the garage door slam in the evenings a sound signaling the arrival of that stepfather home from work one of his pleasures evenings was to chase the boys into the bathroom smack them around and then satisfy himself with sadistic sexual games their mother was no help according to a family friend her second pregnancy which produced jacob had been intended only to save her marriage instead he ended up an object of her bitter resentment this witness told of overhearing jacobs raging mother telling him when he was a mere nine months old how much she hated him and wished hed never been born none of these background considerations prevented the prosecutor from seeking a first degree murder charge or the jury from convicting a decision under state law which forced the judge to deliver a sentence of life without parole to jacob age by the time of his trial bearing in mind doubtless the notorious sentences amounting to virtually no punishment handed down in recent years to mothers who have drowned or otherwise murdered their offspring one legal observer tells the filmmaker "we treat most leniently those parents who kill their children and we treat most harshly the teenagers who kill their parents " not all the subjects of this film have killed their parents but all are where they now are thanks to colorados justice system once considered advanced when it came to juveniles all that ended thanks to an upsurge in violent crimes by youthful offenders in the late s and s events that brought public demands for change and the political will to oblige the mass murders by two columbine high school students did nothing to diminish that will there is indeed something hauntingly familiar about the idyllic suburban houses that are home to so much family agony in this narrative one parent the venture capitalist father of erik another teenager sentenced to life without parole notes that his family address too is littleton colo the town adjacent to columbine high how this well loved loving and stable youth came to be in this pass is the whole point of this story a point like that of every other portrait here made with perfect and terrifying clarity if youre looking for sunshine during the may sweeps or this portion thereof give up now here comes "the bridge" monday p m to a m on the independent film channel a film about suicide and the golden gate bridge a mecca of the bleakest kind for many whove decided to take their lives twenty four people killed themselves at the bridge in roughly do so annually inspired by a new yorker article filmmaker eric steel undertook an ambitious project filming the bridge during daylight hours every day for a year with cameras fixed in place to capture everything and everyone the result is a film of remarkable intensity it dawns slowly on a viewer as the cameras sweep across different sections of the span that the man with the backpack hiking himself over the short protective rail the woman shown standing on the ledge below are planning to kill themselves after that realization theres no casual viewing the film has recorded the would be jumpers caught at the last minute by determined police and some who were never caught mainly its clear because they moved without hesitation to end their lives post mortems by the friends and survivors of suicides tend to be both inevitable and nonilluminating and the kind heard here are no exception the wish to die had been in most cases expressed often sometimes repeatedly to those never possessed by that urge the deed is unfathomable the suicide essentially a stranger who had once been among them the film is telling on the other hand in its detailed picture provided by the surviving friends and relatives of the mental illness that afflicted all of those driven to take their lives not everyone who jumped succeeded in killing himself as one quite literally breathtaking portion of the film shows apparently even after a leap from the golden gate bridge its possible occasionally to change your mind and live the films great counter to its darkness is the bridge itself stunningly photographed an endless source of color and varying light caught in the cameras eyes all hours of the day along of course with those other gut churning images
