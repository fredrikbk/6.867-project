finkelsteins bigotry in her best seller "the groves of academe " mary mccarthy fictionalized a failed academic who realizing he wouldnt get tenure became a communist so that he could he could claim that he was being denied tenure because he was a red rather than a lousy scholar a version of that ploy is being used today norman finkelstein brags that "never has one of his articles been published in a scientific magazine " by his own account he has been fired by "every school in new york " including brooklyn college hunter and nyu his chairman at one of these colleges said that mr finkelstein was fired for "incompetence " "mental instability" and "abuse" of students with politics different from his own his prospects seemed bleak so when radical islamist aminah mccloud a follower of louis farrakhan helped him land a job at depaul a school that mr finkelstein describes as "a third rate catholic university " he accepted "exile " his prospects did not improve when he wrote a screed against holocaust survivors called "the holocaust industry " the scholar whose work on the holocaust was the "stimulus" for this volume university of chicago professor peter novick warned that "no facts alleged by finkelstein should be assumed to be really facts no quotation in his book should be assumed to be accurate without taking the time to carefully compare his claims with the sources he cites such an examination reveals that many of those assertions are pure invention " nor was he helped when new york times reviewer prof omer bartov an authority on genocide characterized his book as "a novel variation on the anti semitic forgery the protocols of the elders of zion brimming with indifference to historical facts inner contradictions strident politics indecent juvenile self righteous arrogant and stupid " on the other hand mr finkelstein is supported by hard leftists like noam chomsky and alexander cockburn they regard him as a scholar in a class with ward churchill the colorado professor who called the victims "little eichmanns" a characterization with which i would not quarrel facing tenure denial mr finkelstein opted for a tactic that fit the times he expressed views so ad hominem unscholarly and extreme that he could claim the decision was being made not on the basis of his scholarship but rather on his politics mr finkelstein does not do "scholarship" in any meaningful sense although his writings center on israel which he compares to nazi germany and the holocaust he has never visited israel and cannot read or speak german precluding the possibility of original scholarship prof bartov characterized his work as an irrational jewish "conspiracy theory " the conspirators include steven spielberg nbc and leon uris the film "schindlers list " mr finkelstein argues was designed to divert attention from our mideast policy "give me a better reason who profits basically there are two beneficiaries from the dogmas of schindlers list american jews and american administration " nbc he says broadcast "holocaust" to strengthen israels position "in nbc produced the series holocaust do you believe it was a coincidence just at this time when peace negotiations between israel and egypt took place in camp david " he argues that leon uris the author of "exodus " named his character "ari" in order to promote israels "nazi" ideology "because ari is the diminutive for aryan it is the whole admiration for this blond haired blue eyed type " ari is a traditional name dating back to the bible he has blamed sept on the u s claiming that we "deserve the problem on our hands because some things bin laden says are true " he says that most alleged holocaust survivors including elie wiesel have fabricated their past like other anti semites mr finkelstein generalizes about "the jews" for example "just as israelis courageously put unruly palestinians in their place so american jews courageously put unruly blacks in their place " he says "the main fomenters of anti semitism "are american jewish elites who need to be stopped " normally no one would take such claims seriously but he boasts that he "can get away with things which nobody else can" because his parents were holocaust survivors and then of course there is me in a recent article "should alan dershowitz target himself for assassination " mr finkelstein commissioned a cartoon by a man who placed second in the iranian holocaust denial cartoon contest the hustler type cartoon portrayed me as masturbating in joy while viewing images of dead lebanese on a tv set labeled "israel peep show " with a star of david prominently featured mr finkelstein has accused me of not having written "the case for israel" but when i sent his publisher my handwritten draft they made him remove that claim he has accused virtually every pro israel writer including me of "plagiarism " i asked harvard to conduct an investigation of this absurd charge harvard rejected it yet he persists the final part of mr finkelsteins quest for tenure is to blame his tenure problems on "outsiders " he claims that i intruded myself into the depaul review process neglecting to mention that i was specifically asked by the former chairman of depauls political science department to "point him to the clearest and most egregious instances of dishonesty on finkelsteins part " i responded by providing hard evidence of made up quotes and facts a pattern that should alone disqualify him from tenure nevertheless mr finkelsteins radical colleagues voted for tenure having cooked the books by seeking outside evaluations from two of his ideological soulmates the dean however recommended against tenure mr finkelstein then used my letter to stimulate a "solidarity with finkelstein" campaign like the character in the "groves of academe " mr finkelstein generated protests by students and outsiders he has encouraged radical goons to email threatening messages "look forward to a visit from me " reads one "nazis like you need to be confronted directly " he has threatened to sue if he loses while complaining about outside interference no university should be afraid of truth regardless of its source especially when truth consists of mr finkelsteins own words whether or not he receives tenure mr finkelstein will persist in his unscholarly ad hominems against supporters of israel holocaust survivors and the u s but for the time being the question remains will his bigotry receive the imprimatur of the largest catholic university in the america mr dershowitz professor of law at harvard is the author most recently of "preemption a knife that cuts both ways" norton see related letter "letters to the editor what i said to dershowitz" wsj may
