weekend journal taste de gustibus take me out to the ballgame not again parenthood comes with its share of rude shocks one of the least expected to this parent is the annual slog that is little league season sisyphus i sometimes think got off easy pushing a rock up a hill for all time if he had lived in america the gods might have punished him by requiring him to spend an eternity pushing children from one baseball diamond to another dont get me wrong im a baseball fan im delighted that my two sons ages and want to play i believe all the hype about character building physical development and so on go team the trouble is that little league looks very different from the parents perspective instead of teamwork and sportsmanship it is all scheduling and transportation picture it two children on two different teams in two different leagues with competing and occasionally conflicting schedules of games every weekend between the middle of april and the middle of june sure its great to see their smiling faces when they hit a homer or get out the runner at second the shock is how little of the fun rubs off on the designated driver er parent last year my better half had another commitment every saturday afternoon for the duration of the season a brilliant ploy in retrospect so i had to play single parent for nearly every game and practice i dragged both boys as well as our month old daughter to two and sometimes three games every saturday in addition to practices at some ungodly hour on sunday mornings i dont blame the coaches i admire them they work hard with little in the way of compensation aside from whatever psychological rewards come with trying to get first graders to understand which base is first and why beaning the runner with the ball is a no no it might be argued too that having two sons months apart makes my familys little league schedule unusually onerous but ive tested my hypothesis and i have yet to find a fellow baseball parent whose eyes dont light up in recognition when i start on a tirade about the tyranny of the baseball season some parents even find themselves praying for rain in the hope that the weather might offer a respite from kiddie baseballs relentless demands a disclosure is in order i never played little league myself by the time my parents moved to the suburbs i was too old my youngest brother did play starting in fourth grade and he points out that by that age he was old enough to get himself to the nearby games and practices so my parents didnt have to play chauffeur this gave me hope only three years to go but it did nothing to relieve the present slog this weekend as on most weekends during the season my kids will have three games and one practice between them in hours squeezed in somewhere alongside a classmates birthday party a sleepover a family party and im sure theres something im leaving out as others before me have noted this kind of schedule leaves little time for "unstructured" play with ones children but here i must make a confession too often we squander that unstructured time either by dragging the kids on grown up errands or by simply failing to do many of those "fun" things that we imagine we could be doing if we werent always at a baseball diamond and perhaps the truth of the matter lies there we schedule our kids up to their eyeballs even though we may sometimes resent the rat race that results because we fear the alternative more being at loose ends with them sometimes the hardest thing of all is to leave enough space in everyones life for spontaneous unplanned fun and to take advantage of those opportunities when they arise childhood ought to be fun but chiefly we should note for the children the parent of today who remembers fondly carefree days playing stickball in the street does so in ignorance of the long afternoons his mother spent with one eye out the window making sure the kids outside were safe this sort of quiet care taking assumes many forms from cleaning up after our kids even when we shouldnt to the financial sacrifices parents make to allow their children to do the things they want to do such as play baseball as children we probably did not appreciate the little things most of our parents did to keep our childhoods childlike that leaves us then ill prepared to anticipate all the little things we will have to do on behalf of our own children to be frustrated that little league baseball is not all fun for the grown ups is to miss the point that our job as parents is to do the work so that our children can do the playing this is only true however to the extent that we are in fact doing right by our kids no doubt many kids today are overcommitted by parents who in their determination to ensure that little johnny doesnt miss any opportunities leave him no time to pursue his own interests the sacrifices of time energy and freedom are only worth it if they help our children pursue their own dreams instead of acting out ours so to figure out whether all these trips to the ballfields are worth it i decided to go to the source my first grader james at first he was evasive "i dont really have anything to say about that " he insisted but i pressed the point why do you play baseball "i just do it because i like to do it you can write that we won by one point against the yankees " another little league team in town my year old corroborated his brothers account adding "its exciting " exciting for him anyway but maybe thats good enough and just maybe one can imagine sisyphus happy after all mr carney is a member of the
