weekend journal the chateau mouton lockdown wine theft fears turn cellars into fortresses home retina scanners when the wine bandits come david dorman will be ready for them the former chairman and chief executive of at&amp t has equipped the three room wine cellar in his home outside san francisco with video surveillance infrared alarms and motion sensors he keeps his most valuable bottles in a separate vault with its own five number combination door "i wanted to be able to both ward off the professional whos looking for some kind of a score as well as the amateur whos trying to make a quick buck " he says a little paranoia is seeping into the wine world at a time when a single bottle of new french bordeaux can cost as much as &# and some rare vintages sell at auction for more than &# serious oenophiles arent taking any chances while insurers say thefts are still very rare and are most often committed by opportunistic housekeepers or even the resident teenagers some wealthy collectors are spending as much as &# to install locks that open only at the sound of the owners voice and affix radio tags that trigger silent alarms when a bottle is removed one cellar maker now offers a &# door thats disguised as a fireplace the gadgetry is getting so advanced that some collectors say the security bubble around the cellar provides just as much ego gratification as the wine during tours of his bottle wine collection in briarcliff manor n y gregg marks a year old executive for jones apparel group says he always makes a point to show off the biometric fingerprint scanner he had installed on the cellar door "you could have a million dollars worth of wine in there " mr marks says "but the lock is what guests remember " security peddlers are doing a brisk business los angeles based cellar masters which builds about new cellars a year average cost &# says a quarter of its recent projects include video surveillance alarmed doors or motion sensors manhattan based cellar designer lee zinser says more than half of his new clients now ask for alarm systems compared with almost none three years ago wine enthusiast an online retailer says sales of its esommelier product an inventory system that allows collectors to place bar codes on their wines and link them to their home alarm systems rose last year these measures are a reflection of the booming wine market and the growing number of serious collectors many of whom view wine more as an investment than a comestible according to an estimate by firemans fund an insurer as many as of the nations most affluent households have wine collections worth at least &# chubb group an insurer that focuses on wealthy clients says the number of new policies covering wine collections doubled last year according to laura clark a vice president most collectors "think of wine as an asset on par with their homes art collections jewelry and cars " she says veteran collector gil shapiro started his collection about years ago when he began buying "cult" california cabernets from vineyards such as abreu and dunn after years of steady buying mr shapiro the owner of urban archaeology a new york architectural salvage and reproduction company had amassed some bottles of rare california wines many of them in the basement of his weekend home in sagaponack n y when he built his first cellar in the mid s for &# he invested in the best security he could find a wrought iron door with a motion sensitive alarm and reinforced concrete walls with sensors that would trip an alarm if someone hit them with a sledgehammer but as his collection grew in size and value in recent years and as more delivery people set eyes on it mr shapiro says he started to get "more and more paranoid " he added a body heat sensor to the basement entrance and a hidden camera inside the wine room that sends a live feed to a monitor in his new york apartment "im from brooklyn " mr shapiro says "im always looking over my shoulder " w taylor franklins bottle collection is only four years old and at about &# in value not quite large enough to put him in collectings big leagues but the year old real estate developer isnt taking security lightly the bottle cellar hes building at his new home in norfolk va will have a keypad lock for his wine tasting room and a fingerprint scanner for his cellar which will be encased in shatterproof glass when its finished the &# cellar will be worth nearly as much as the wine inside "we looked into doing a retina scanner but that got a little pricey " mr franklin says there is some evidence that wine collections are becoming a more popular burglary target in california the napa county sheriffs department says it has investigated about seven wine thefts from private homes in the past year crimes that capt john robertson says were "pretty rare" five years ago earlier this year in atherton calif police arrested a house cleaner and her boyfriend and charged them with stealing &# in wine from a collector police say the growing popularity of collecting has made it easier for crooks to operate free wine valuation sites like winesearcher and winezap allow thieves to check labels or bone up on the going rate for a pichon lalande for instance and sites like ebay and craigslist make it easier for them to unload bottles anonymously but by most accounts the security measures collectors are using are more intense than the threat according to firemans fund only about of all insurance claims involving wine are related to theft a number thats remained flat over the last decade the biggest threats to wine collections insurers say are fires floods improper handling and any power failure or cooling system glitch that causes cellar temperatures to fluctuate stephen bachmann chief executive of vinfolio a collector services firm says "the best thing anyone can do to protect their wine is store it at the right temperature " many collectors spend thousands of dollars on anti mold insulation alarms that ring if a cellar door is left open too long and underground "wine caves" that dont require electricity to stay cool when wine is stolen experts say the thefts usually take place outside the owners home while the wine is being moved or delivered or are perpetrated by insiders rather than organized professional thieves two of the recent heists in napa like the recent atherton job were pulled off by household workers chris mcgoey a los angeles based security consultant who works for celebrities and corporations says the average home invader wouldnt know a rare burgundy from a bottle of mouthwash "theyre not sophisticated enough to know what a good label is " he says all of the security in the world might not have helped susanna kelham when the vintner from oakville calif discovered that cases of george de latour private reserve now worth about &# had been removed from her cellar more than years earlier there wasnt much she could do the culprits were her two teenage sons ronald now and hamilton now who confessed to smuggling bottles out of the house throughout high school "my father almost disinherited me " says ronald who claims it was only cases as values soar wine merchants and police are setting up informal networks to recover stolen bottles collectors are not only keeping better track of their inventory they will notify auction houses and major sellers when unique wine goes missing some wineries are exploring the idea of embedding microtransmitters in corks and police in napa have organized a vintner email alert system to notify vineyards of burglaries and to catalogue the pilfered goods capt robertson says despite all this commotion some collectors say theyre not ready to turn their homes into the imperial fortress of leipzig three years ago burglars broke into the home of adam belsky a year old san francisco lawyer and stole his &# collection bottles of mainly french bordeaux and italian tuscan he later installed a house alarm and a better lock but hasnt bothered to take it any further "its a little bit silly to get attached to expensive wine " mr belsky says "especially when you think about the fact that you drink it and its gone "
