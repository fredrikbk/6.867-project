news corp plans strategy to woo family journalists news corp launching a two pronged offensive will take its case for buying dow jones &amp co to the media companys controlling shareholders the bancroft family and to the newsroom of the companys flagship wall street journal the media conglomerate run by rupert murdoch is preparing presentations detailing the companys plans for capital investment people close to news corp say news corp is expected to address a number of issues in its discussion such as beefing up staffing levels in international news bureaus and putting more capital behind the companys electronic properties said one person close to news corp the campaign will be structured to win over both the bancroft family and the companys front line reporters and editors some of whom have begun agitating against the &# a share takeover bid from news corp and its chief mr murdoch the bancroft family which controls of dow joness voting power is opposing news corp s &# billion bid the family has said that members accounting for more than of the overall voting shares oppose the deal one person close to news corp said that it was highly important for mr murdoch to win the confidence of dow joness rank and file and that the company hoped to do so in communications aimed squarely at the journal newsroom news corp s strategic efforts came as a group of journal reporters yesterday urged the newspapers journalists to write individual letters opposing mr murdochs offer to the three bancroft family members on the dow jones board paul e steiger the journals managing editor said that journalists who wrote letters advocating opposition to the offer wouldnt be involved in the coverage of news corp s bid news corp plans to take a lower key approach toward the family letting some time pass before it begins any serious outreach according to two people with knowledge of the companys plans its hope is to let the family sort out its own viewpoints before any discussions begin these people said merrill lynch &amp co the big brokerage firm that represents the bancrofts recently made a presentation to the family on all of its options but offered no recommendation a number of people associated with the family emphasized how complicated the deliberations have become one reason is that the older bancrofts have been more engaged over the years with the company and its management yet even members of the younger generation are reluctant to relinquish the familys stewardship of a newspaper they consider a pillar of american democracy and they have voiced concern about the bancroft clans legacy if they do so "but if the number gets too high up there what can you do " said one person familiar with the deliberations michael elefante the trustee representing the bancroft familys interests and a dow jones director didnt return calls seeking comment turning members of the bancroft family in favor of the news corp proposal will be especially crucial for mr murdoch given the opposition of another group of significant shareholders the ottaway family according to dow joness most recent proxy statement the ottaways own of the companys class b supervoting stock ottaway newspapers has been an important profit center and financial anchor for dow jones for decades it was built by james h ottaway sr a charismatic newspaperman who turned a stable of small town papers throughout the northeast into a national chain the papers were sold to dow jones in to help offset cyclical declines in national advertising at the wall street journal and barrons the strategy worked well even in the last recession in ottaway contributed much of dow joness operating profit james h ottaway jr who later ran ottaway and served as an officer and board member of dow jones has also been a key source of support for dow jones management a former newspaper reporter mr ottaway is famed for his rumpled suits and fierce commitment to independent journalism he endows fellowships at the american press institute to promote independent journalism in emerging democracies and he has been a longtime champion of the journals independence saying that the companys future depends first and foremost on the quality and integrity of its journalism yet in recent years as the newspaper business has fallen out of favor with shareholders the ottaway chain has become less prominent within dow jones last year dow jones sold off six of its ottaway papers mr ottaway was opposed to the move say some executives arguing that the ottaway papers added important earnings stability to the company while retired from the company since last year mr ottaway remains an important force through his shareholdings though large and far flung the family has stayed connected through its association with the journal unlike other big newspaper families such as the sulzbergers and the grahams the bancrofts dont have an unofficial leader for the most part the members get along well says one person close to the family there are no factions that dont speak with one another for instance in addition to their gatherings at dow jones meetings they meet regularly in boston where their law firm is based in dow jones threw them a dinner party at the st regis to mark the th anniversary of clarence barrons acquisition of the company the bancrofts reside everywhere from hawaii to rome one martha robes spends much of the year on a boat but many of them seem most at home in new england that new england bent has favored modesty above all else jeff stevenson a racer of powerboats and grandson of former dow jones board member jane bancroft cook says the family never paraded its association "obviously my grandma was big into it and my parents were but it was sort of secretive we didnt know about it until we were older " he said in an interview wednesday theres a major difference between the pressure on dow jones now and a decade ago when at least two dissident family members raised questions about how they could improve the return on dow joness laggard shares now at least one of those dissidents elisabeth chelberg formerly elisabeth goth is no longer leading the charge to sell the company she sold her dow jones shares in recent years say people close to the situation the alliances within the bancroft family have shifted in the years since ms chelbergs quest for changes william c cox jr a longtime dow jones board member has stepped down meanwhile christopher bancroft who lives in texas has assumed the role of trustee for of the familys class b shares
