weekend journal taste houses of worship interrupting the intellectuals "whats he doing here jesus in jewish culture " an unusual conference title to be sure for what proved to be an unusual event on a beautiful spring sunday in new york writers critics filmmakers and scholars gathered at the center for jewish history to discuss the man whom leon wieseltier termed "the worlds most famous ex jew " the gathering was an intellectually illustrious one harvard professor stephen greenblatt and poet robert pinsky were speakers on a panel coyly titled "why i think about jesus " and why not think about jesus it is rather hard to avoid contemplating jesus it was pointed out since the rest of the western world does so often and often beautifully in its literature art and music but for jews mr greenblatt stated it can be liberating to view certain religiously inspired works from the vantage point of the outsider he emphasized the intense intellectual pleasure to be drawn from the dichotomy between the jewish critic and the christian inflected text the inherent appeal of knowing how to interpret the symbology and yet remaining apart invulnerable to its pull the very existence of the conference with its contemplating jesus theme implied such invulnerability clearly american jews feel secure in their own beliefs and at home in a culture with such strong christian origins if they can ask only slightly tongue in cheek and on a sunday no less "whats he doing here " the comfortable atmosphere at the center for jewish history was a far cry from say the climate surrounding the disputation of barcelona in which a dominican friar debated rabbi nachmanides over whether judaism or christianity was the "true" faith for what its worth the king of aragon for whom the debate was conducted gave nachmanides a prize when the event was over saying that he had never heard "an unjust cause so nobly defended " as if to offer a contrast messrs pinsky and greenblatt both celebrated jewish intellectual empowerment in the climate of christianity reveling in what mr greenblatt termed a "post colonial relationship to the culture that is ours " the panel generally had a tone of intellectual broad mindedness and genial accommodation that is until the question and answer period began "here you are you jewish intellectuals with a small j " an elderly man stated from the front of the auditorium when he received the microphone "i want you to know that i am not a cheder boy i grew up among catholics who called me a filthy christ killer i envy you that your generation can be so calm i live in fear and i grew up in montreal not in poland my grandfather was murdered in jesus name " there was a tense pause when a second hand went up holding out hope that a new questioner might change the subject you could almost hear the audience members breathe a sigh of relief the situation after all was awkward something akin to a dinner guest loudly noting a chunk of lobster in a kosher whitefish salad but upon the passing of the microphone things only took a turn for the worse "im a new york jew " a second older gentleman said "whose entire life has been programmed by stories of my family who died in europe because of jesus hiding in cellars from pogroms at easter and christmas i dont see beauty in ezra pound or louis ferdinand celine or the great anti semites of the world i dont see any great influence that theyve had on the good of the world with their vituperative pronouncements about jews i dont get it i really dont get it " mr greenblatt wasnt having any of it he rejoined "if you start walking down that street itd be interesting to know where you stop bach shakespeare what do you do with a legacy thats complicated which has aspects to which we are sensitive " mr pinsky added "i decline to define myself jews or jesus in terms of anti semitism to say that jesus perpetrated the holocaust is to say that jesus belongs to nazis " the first gentleman jumped back into the fray "you american jewish intellectuals who find it so easy to not be involved " he said loudly sounding for all the world as though he were pronouncing a vile curse "perhaps you should read yiddish literature instead to learn about fear " one of the conference facilitators seeing a woman waiting to ask a question said to her in an undertone and with a sense of urgency "i think youll have to interrupt him " and she did but by then it was too late everyone was already looking at what had been laid bare the big crucified elephant in the middle of the room ms horn is a lawyer and a writer at work on her first novel
