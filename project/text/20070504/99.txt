weekend journal bookmarks the friend of women and other stories by louis auchincloss houghton mifflin pages &# it is fitting that the three female leads in "lami des femmes " the first story in louis auchinclosss latest collection are enamored of the great works of victorian england their world in its semi formality and deliberate sense of things resembles that of george eliot or the bronte sisters far more than anything we know from modern american fiction the tales within "the friend of women and other stories" offer snapshots of new yorks upper crust in the first half of the th century politeness proper manners and a fitting sense of ones role in society are among the imperatives that govern mr auchinclosss characters not that they are incapable of straying from propriety far from it the wasps of mr auchinclosss new york are notably unconstrained by the demands of conventional sexual morality indeed mr auchincloss devotes his considerable literary gifts to showing the extent of their ungoverned passions and wayward habits hardly a story goes by without an extramarital affair and the unmarried are not exempt from mr auchinclosss scrutiny either the elite boarding schools in "the devil and rufus lockwood" and "the conversion of fred coates" are scenes of same sex experimentation and lingering guilt the title story chronicles the tribulations of three grown friends who attended the same private all girls school the narrator the girls favorite teacher discovers that one of their husbands is engaging in a shocking infidelity the plot turns on the narrators unsettled feelings of duty whether to interfere or not and the divided loyalty of each of the women involved what is at stake ultimately is the nature of friendship and the sacrifices it demands faithlessness is a common thread among these stories perhaps mr auchincloss wants us to perceive a deeper moral failing in new york society itself even its most decorous members it would seem may be lured to some betrayal or bedroom chicanery one lawyer informs his client in "the call of the wild" "a one night stand when your wifes away and youve reached a dangerous age is no reason to wreck a marriage " mr auchincloss does not judge his characters for these failings he considers them not so much failings as a natural part of life his view is neatly summed up by a matriarchal crone in "the country cousin " the one act play that closes "the friend of women" "you may think me an immoral old woman caroline because i dont go around calling everything i see disgusting theres nothing disgusting under the sky there are only things that are beautiful and things that are not beautiful "
