sticky issue for studios the boom in movie sequels gives ensembles more power spider mans tangled web after moviegoers see "spider man " this weekend they may wonder whats next for spidey but just how the web spinner swings into action a fourth time will depend on the outcome of a complicated dance between sony corp s sony pictures and the hollywood talent behind the spider man movies even before the latest film arrived in theaters director sam raimi and stars tobey maguire and kirsten dunst began talking publicly about what it would take to bring them back for no ms dunst has said that if mr raimi or mr maguire dont return she wont either mr maguire has said he cant imagine a spider man without mr raimis involvement mr raimi has made it clear an enticing script would be a make or break for him the overall message for now theyre sticking together and setting up a potential showdown with sony execs who may want to rein in costs on the next film by casting cheaper talent the situation highlights new challenges studios face as long running movie franchises have become an important and extremely lucrative part of their business model its an issue for almost every big movie franchise these days from "spider man" and dreamworks animations "shrek" to walt disney co s "pirates of the caribbean" and warner bros s "harry potter " all have ensemble casts that must be kept largely intact to keep the franchise alive and directors and producers often see themselves as part of a unified team of course studios have long made sequels that required bringing back stars for repeat engagements but in the past decade movie budgets have soared and the time invested in franchise projects has stretched to a decade or more and more film series are extending into fourth and fifth installments with the same set of actors who increasingly recognize that they have a lot of leverage in the equation the drama is moving front and center for the "spider man" cast the third installment which opened this week will likely cost more than &# million when marketing costs are included making a fourth movie could mean an even larger investment for their part sony executives say they hope the entire cast and writer director mr raimi will return for another movie "i hope it will continue with the people it started with because thats what i want and thats what the studio wants " says amy pascal co chairman of sony pictures entertainment "but in the end i run a business and while i hope it will continue with the family it started with it will continue " ms dunst declined to comment messrs raimi and maguire couldnt be reached for comment meanwhile a host of other blockbuster sequels "shrek the third " "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end " warner bros s "oceans thirteen" and "harry potter and the order of the phoenix" open within a few weeks of "spider man " though there has been little public discord between the talent and the studios each of those franchises has taken different steps to keep things moving smoothly in the case of "pirates " the second and third installments were filmed at the same time reducing costs and keeping the cast banded together and the teenage cast of the "harry potter" series announced in march they have already committed to finishing out the final two films in the franchise contract negotiation issues have plagued sony before when mr maguires complaint of back pain before shooting the second film in was widely seen as a money ruse however the prospect of an all for one one for all mentality would be worrisome for big movie makers these tactics are more commonly seen in tv on shows like "friends" and "the simpsons " where some of the talent bargained as a team and was enriched because of it the cast of long running sitcom "friends" perfected the group approach by effectively negotiating for raises and other perks as a single entity eventually scoring &# million each per episode in at least three contract negotiations they bargained as a single unit each making the same demands something that is hard to do in movies in the tv business such tactics can get messy however in the two stars of televisions "the dukes of hazzard" walked off the show and engaged in a legal battle with warner bros who replaced them for episodes before the duo returned movie industry executives say its unlikely that model will ever take firm hold in their corner of hollywood because actors and other talents individual interests will always override a collective desire to appear in a particular film or series theres also the issue of parity among well known stars rarely are pay scales the same across an entire film of course money is the best way to keep casts and crews intact but sonys ms pascal says finding the script is also key to retaining talent "when you get a good script it becomes a stand alone movie that matters and people will want to be in it " she says dreamworks animations "shrek " which employs the voices of actors including mike meyers eddie murphy cameron diaz and antonio banderas plans at least two additional films for a total of five in this case money was a lure people familiar with the "shrek" deal say the actors were paid relatively low salaries for the first movie with the promise of greater compensation down the line indeed after the first movie dreamworks animation ceo jeffrey katzenberg personally delivered million dollar profit sharing checks to mr murphy ms diaz and company as a way of keeping them psyched for the later films "its hard to think of the shrek characters that we know and love today without realizing how much each actor helped define them " says mr katzenberg other recent superhero franchises most notably "batman " have seen high cast and crew turnover though british actor christian bale the most recent caped crusader will return for another turn as the superhero in "the dark knight" set for next year the "james bond" franchise has also been able to turn in new directions with new stars while still bringing in big money at the box office mr katzenberg says that actors providing voices for animated films are in a potentially better situation over a franchises long run than a live action character like a spider man or other superheroes "its a career management challenge " he says "many actors end up having a love hate relationship with these iconic characters they portray as much as they love creating them and the rewards that come with it they hate getting typecast by them "
