turkeys discord sows fears of wider rifts ankara turkey turkeys parliament appears to have defused the countrys weeklong political crisis by bringing general elections forward to july four months earlier than planned but the controversy over the nomination of a new president inflamed a rift at the heart of turkish politics and society that could widen dangerously as polling day approaches the upheaval which at one point raised fears of a military coup has exposed deep divisions between two groups locked in a battle for turkeys soul a fiercely secularist establishment and an urban class with rural traditional roots that is laying down its claim to power now that fissure looks set to dominate the election campaign potentially endangering turkeys hard won economic stability "we would have preferred the campaign to be about structural reforms the turkish lira and turkeys relations with the eu " said atilla yesilada a political analyst with global source turkey "now the main focus will be the secular religious clash and the role of the army " the political turmoil marked the biggest confrontation yet between an old guard elite that controls turkeys security services courts and bureaucracy and the ak party a group with roots in political islam that has governed the country since sweeping to power in elections in how the conflict plays out will have huge implications for turkeys economic performance its prospects for joining the european union and the larger clash between islamists and secular forces across the middle east and asia the crisis began last week when prime minister recep tayyip erdogan named his foreign minister abdullah gul as the governments candidate for president who is elected by parliament the choice of an observant muslim whose wife wears the muslim headscarf and who has in the past been active in islamist politics angered the army which sees itself as the custodian of turkeys secular tradition while mr erdogan was also once an islamist a gul presidency would mean that the countrys government parliament and presidency would all be controlled by a pro islamic party for the first time in its modern history when parliament voted last week on mr guls candidacy the opposition boycotted the session mr gul was elected but the opposition challenged the vote in the countrys top court in addition the military which has ousted four governments over the past years issued a thinly veiled threat to intervene in the election prompting fears of a coup on sunday hundreds of thousands demonstrated in istanbul against mr guls candidacy the next day the turkish lira tumbled and the stock market dropped turkeys constitutional court on tuesday declared mr guls election invalid and parliament scheduled a general election for parliament for july moving forward a vote that had been expected in november the lira has since firmed against the dollar and istanbuls stock market risen mr erdogan vows to press ahead with mr guls candidacy seeking another vote in parliament this sunday but he is unlikely to get the necessary quorum of lawmakers into the chamber analysts said turkeys new president would probably be chosen only after the parliamentary elections in july but commentators now fear an acrimonious campaign that could harm the economic gains of the past four years under ak party rule turkey has seen lower inflation higher foreign investment and a more stable currency than under other previous administrations which were often racked by financial crises and political infighting turkey is now a candidate for eu membership and is much more tightly integrated into the european economy than it was four years ago observers worry electoral pressures could prompt the government to push back its privatization program while foreign companies may postpone major investments and consumers delay big ticket purchases enhancing the risk of a slowdown on the one side of last weeks clash are the ak party and its supporters a new class of second generation migrants to turkeys big cities who have grown increasingly affluent and sophisticated in recent years and are claiming their place in the sun they face an entrenched establishment wedded to the secular values of mustafa kemal ataturk the former army officer who founded the turkish republic in on the ruins of the ottoman empire some fear the chasm between the two groups may be widening "this last crisis shows turkish society is more polarized than its ever been " says umit cizre professor of political science at bilkent university ankara the ak party may now be going into the election in a stronger position some observers say it could win votes from those who were alarmed by the armys demarche last week and want to reduce its role in turkish politics the party may also garner support from modernizers eager to bring turkey closer to europe if it wins the ak party has vowed to pursue a plan to harmonize turkeys laws with those of europe whether it joins the eu or not "that will mean strengthening civil society promoting human rights and increasing competition " says hugh pope turkey project director of the international crisis group the partys pro european stance contrasts with the policies of secularist opposition parties which are suspicious of the eu they have tended to question mr erdogans human rights overhauls and his efforts to liberalize the economy but there are also dangers facing the ak party smaller parties on the left and right are in the process of uniting ahead of the election increasing their representation in the new parliament after failing to overcome the threshold last time round that means that even if the ak party wins again it may be forced to govern in a coalition
