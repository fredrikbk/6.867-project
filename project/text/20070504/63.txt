politics &amp economics fresh fuel for iraq debate democrats probe initial white house case for invasion washington democrats have begun to use their control of congress to investigate the bush administrations case for invading iraq adding fuel to the intensifying political battle over the war democratic leaders are using subpoenas hearings and other legislative measures to look into the white houses use of faulty intelligence in and including its claim that iraq sought uranium from niger for a nuclear program the democrats are also examining how administration officials prewar comments compared with the information they actually had at the time the investigations are part of the partys attempt to capitalize on the growing public opposition to the iraq war and further weaken president bushs hand in his current showdown with congress mr bush this week vetoed a democratic bill setting a timetable for a u s military withdrawal from iraq even though a recent wall street journal nbc news poll showed that a majority of americans support the idea with the political fight over the war intensifying democrats hope their probes will further isolate the white house and its republican allies on capitol hill "the country needs to finally have an accounting of how we ended up in iraq " said rep henry waxman d calif whose house oversight and government reform committee issued a subpoena to secretary of state condoleezza rice "its a broader question than one speech or one issue alone why was it that we went to war over false pretenses " still the probes could prove politically perilous for the democrats in january a poll found of the country opposed congressional hearings into whether mr bush had deliberately misled the public to build public support for the invasion with supporting the idea democratic pollsters say public support could slip further if people were to view the inquiries as partisan fishing expeditions or attempts to simply embarrass white house officials "if the investigations come across as sticking a finger into the bush administrations eye for no broader purpose there could be dangers for the democrats " said peter hart the democratic pollster who helps lead the journal nbc survey democrats want to question ms rice about how the unfounded uranium allegation made it into mr bushs state of the union address the panel has also asked former central intelligence agency director george tenet to testify voluntarily about the claim in his new memoir that the administration took the nation to war without "serious debate " the publication of mr tenets book "at the center of the storm " has bolstered the democrats by questioning several aspects of the white houses case for war in the senate democrats are wrapping up two reports on the administrations use of prewar intelligence concerning iraq with the first to be released within weeks democratic leaders say the party is trying to resolve longstanding questions about whether the bush administration knowingly exaggerated the threat posed by late iraqi president saddam hussein in order to build public support for the invasion that toppled him the new push is infuriating many republicans who say democrats should focus instead on finding a constructive solution to the crisis gripping iraq where sectarian violence and terrorist killings are causing mass dislocations and stifling development in much of the country "congressional investigations the commission secretary rices testimony and a series of responsive letters have all addressed the very prewar intelligence issues mr waxman says he wants to address yet again " white house spokesman tony fratto said in an interview this week "this is an old story in washington if you cant legislate investigate " in then senate intelligence committee chairman pat roberts r kan agreed to open a five part study of prewar intelligence about iraq two sections of the ensuing report were made public in september including a section that criticized bush administration efforts to link mr hussein to al qaeda but the most politically sensitive investigations looking into how the white house used flawed intelligence to build its case for war were never completed the new democratic chairman of the senate panel jay rockefeller of west virginia has promised to finish those remaining two investigations into the administrations use of iraq intelligence aides say the first report about the intelligence communitys faulty predictions about post invasion iraq will be released this month the second report which looks at senior officials public comments in the run up to the war is expected to be released this summer said people familiar with the matter both reports are likely to be highly critical of the administration these people said the white house has acknowledged that its dire prewar assessments of mr husseins programs to make weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded but blamed u s intelligence agencies for providing the flawed information administration officials deny charges of intentionally misleading the country into war mr waxman is leading the probes in the house a fierce critic of the war mr waxman has spent years pressing the administration to explain how the faulty uranium claim wound up in the state of the union address in the speech mr bush wrongly told the nation that "saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa " mr waxman began questioning the white house about the speech in june mr waxman now has sweeping powers and he has placed ms rice the presidents national security adviser at the time of the speech in his crosshairs in an interview mr waxman said he wants to question her about why the administration made the claim even though the cia had earlier told white house officials it was unfounded "if the administration knew it was false at the time of the speech they misled the country into war " he said last week his panel voted along party lines to subpoena ms rice the committees ranking republican rep tom davis of virginia accused mr waxman of "bundling a number of old issues and grievances in an effort to get high profile administration figures under oath before the cameras for the sake of political theatrics " ms rice has so far refused to appear before the panel she has argued that her interactions with the president as national security adviser are off limits to congress because of the doctrine of executive privilege she has offered to answer the questions in writing which mr waxman dismissed as insufficient democratic aides said they will seek a full house vote to find ms rice in contempt of congress if she fails to testify "i dont want a confrontation with her but a subpoena is not a request " mr waxman said "it is an insistence "
