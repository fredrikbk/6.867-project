victoria follow her advice she says and you can be "the star of the party " philips is looking to repeat the success of a "viral" campaign one that aims to embed a message in a market or culture often

the wired market in china where the number of internet users is estimated at more than million second only to the u s web population the trios tips are the product of market research that included scouring chinese magazines blogs and online forums to distill local likes and dislikes into a series of strong recommendations from the secret agents says adam good asia pacific president of tribal ddb worldwide during the research tribal ddb determined that women rather than a towel snapping frat boy were the way to win these young mens hearts minds and jaws mr good says chinas gender imbalance favoring males together with swelling ranks of college graduates means young chinese men face fierce competition for the affections of both women and employers in addition chinese parents are famous for spoiling their children born under chinas one child policy a problem when the real world calls mr good says "being an only child in china youre quite well pampered by mom and dad but mom and dad dont really teach you about grooming " he says neither are there brothers or sisters to help out to the rescue jennifer angelina and victoria steering young men around the shoals of life after college "people realize its part of a marketing plan but these agents are giving you useful hints about these important tasks " mr good says internet traffic for the campaign is lukewarm now with an average of visitors a day mr good says but he is optimistic traffic will "rise dramatically " blog entries typically start off with an anecdote about a friend at a party or out on a first date and unfailingly end with the campaigns central theme for instance angelina the romance secret agent advises chinese men to keep first dates short sweet and interesting just enough to keep the woman looking forward to the next one "oh and one more thing " angelina writes "never forget that women never go for men with facial hair so make sure youre clean shaven before you step out the door on that first date " ad
