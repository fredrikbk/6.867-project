predatory lending in the flap over paul wolfowitzs "sweetheart deal" for shaha riza world bank staffers are demanding his resignation to protect the "credibility" of the bank this is rich the banks credibility was in tatters well before mr wolfowitz arrived in indeed mr wolfowitzs anti corruption campaign was intended to restore its credibility a campaign seen as a threat by bank staffers long accustomed to advancing their careers by shoveling money out the door but it resonated with newly elected african ministers back in august the african union estimated that corruption cost africa &# billion a year a figure times more than what the bank gives africa annually in loans in its year involvement in africa the bank scandalously wasted tens of billions in failed programs to spur economic growth promote democracy and good governance in the s and s bank lending was project specific roads dams for generating electrical power telecommunications and other public goods with large externalities in agriculture health care education and industry by the mid s more than projects had been undertaken but nearly all were seriously undermined by poor bank supervision lack of domestic maintenance or neglect in the bank itself admitted to numerous examples of badly chosen and poorly designed public investments it had funded half of its development projects in africa failed according to its own evaluation report the bank then shifted from project financing to policy reform but that brought little redemption between and it loaned more than &# billion to sponsor "structural adjustment programs" saps in african countries the object was to dismantle statist interventionist behemoths and establish market based economies it was the bank that funded these statist structures in the s and s in the first place but in the bank found only six of the adjusting countries gambia burkina faso ghana nigeria tanzania and zimbabwe to have performed marginally well even worse this tiny list of "success stories" mysteriously started turning into "black holes " by gambia nigeria tanzania and zimbabwe had vanished from the list and in the outgoing bank resident director in ghana flatly admitted that the bank erred in tagging ghana an "economic success story " the spectacular failure of saps was noted in by the united nations conference on trade and development which wrote "despite many years of policy reform barely any country in the region africa has successfully completed its adjustment program with a return to sustained growth " yet the bank kept trotting out a phantom list of african "success stories " the four new countries guinea lesotho eritrea and uganda hailed by the bank in have also vanished in the bank again admitted failure unveiling a new approach in a page report it noted that even after a decade in which socialist economies were dismantled and trade and global investment reached record levels of the worlds population still lived on incomes of less than &# a day but the report the result of a two year effort by the banks research economists and field interviews generated heated debate within the bank over why past policies failed when the reasons should have been obvious the bank knew that up to of its loans were embezzled for personal use it also knew that nearly of the aggregate wealth created in africa fled to foreign shores even funds earmarked to fight hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria were not spared yet no public official was held accountable or prosecuted until september when victor selormey ghanas former finance minister was jailed for eight years for embezzling &# million of a bank loan granted for the computerization of ghanas court system in police found zambias former finance minister katele kalumba hiding in a tree and charged him with theft of some &# million and last june ugandan top officials were indicted for siphoning off tens of millions in grants from the geneva based global fund for aids stultifying bureaucratic incompetence and theft also doomed the banks ambitious campaign launched in to halve malaria deaths by malaria cases have risen in recent years to help carry out its wasteful and ineffective programs the bank employs a huge staff of bureaucrats plus a fleet of some more consultants in a feeble attempt at reform the bank quietly eliminated positions at its washington d c headquarters in july to save &# million over two years but even this miniscule "adjustment" was fiercely resisted by bank staff in the staff howled when an internal investigation uncovered "alarming information" about kickbacks and embezzlement indeed in a nigerian probe panel indicted six bank officials for allegedly conniving with agricultural ministry officials to defraud the government of project funds to the tune of &# million the real scandal at the bank is that the brouhaha over mr wolfowitzs so called sweetheart deal detracts from the housecleaning the bank itself so desperately
