corruption and waste at world bank projects in regard to bret stephenss may global view column "notes on a scandal" i wish to express my strong support for paul wolfowitz to remain at the world bank the bank and all its affiliated institutions as well as the u n system of distributing aid are rampant with abuse and corruption there are a small number of dedicated staff members within these institutions who are fighting for not only delivery of mission but delivery that is efficient fair and without abuse by the those in the field if mr wolfowitz leaves it will be a victory for those who believe corruption is necessary to get aid out it will reduce the effectiveness of the existing oversight and investigation departments that are trying to stop horrible abuses at refugee camps hold political appointees and their families accountable during the procurement process and ensure that not only do funds go out but that they are actually used for good over the past decade i have either been involved in or known people involved in investigations into loan sharks that were funded by micro loan projects aid workers who swapped life saving drugs or passports for underage sex schools built without a roof as the materials were stolen infrastructure projects where the officer awarding the project has received kickbacks massive waste of public money through imprudent lending to government cronies and numerous educated staffers from these institutions telling me that corruption is required in order for development to take place what i have seen in the past is simply wrong mr wolfowitz is trying to reform this system and is now the target of the vested interests who would to retain the status quo alex duperouzel managing director hong kong complianceasia consulting hong kong
