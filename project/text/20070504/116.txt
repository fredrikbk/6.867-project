to an appearance on the music industrys newest taste maker shopping channel qvc in the last several months qvc has emerged as a force in the music world using its marketing power to push artists it believes will resonate with its customers or draw in new ones the channels success is the latest demonstration of how retailers from big box stores like wal mart to specialized outlets like starbucks and cracker barrel are reshaping an ailing music business by offering marketing muscle in return for exclusive contracts exclusive songs and in some cases a bigger cut of profits during mr sedakas

void to fill with the disappearance of music retailers for example tower records last summer mr yoegel a fan of groups like train and journey began aggressively approaching labels looking for compatible artists that would offer exclusive bonus material and competitive prices since the fall qvc has broadcasted live appearances by musicians such as elton john barry manilow chaka khan and carly simon "there is a business for selling plastic" as opposed to music downloads he says other retailers have been moving into the marketplace too paul mccartney recently signed to starbuckss record label wal mart has signed deals for exclusive albums with garth brooks beyonce and the eagles hallmark has released exclusive albums from such musicians as josh groban and james taylor cliff chenfeld co owner of razor &amp tie mr sedakas label has worked with qvc before and consulted with mr yoegel before signing mr sedaka "im less amazed at how well starbucks and qvc are doing " mr
