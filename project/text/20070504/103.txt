weekend journal hollywood report betty whites sitcom solution veteran actresss sharp words on dull shows the golden girls cult television isnt very fond of its own history in their never ending quest to attract younger viewers broadcasters typically balk at looking to the past for guidance yet the broadcast networks could use some help they are suffering one of their worst audience declines ever down this season among viewers aged according to nielsen media research as tv executives sift through more than pilot programs to decide what they will show this fall and with everybody urgently searching for a smash sitcom we sought advice from a person whose career embodies the mediums history our oracle year old betty white televisions longest working actor ms white landed her first long term tv job in with a comedy show called "life with elizabeth " "i was making &# a week and absolutely thrilled to death " she says but her career actually began in two decades before the oldest of the current network presidents was born an early tv investor spotted her in a high school play and asked her to participate in a test he was conducting at a packard car dealership in los angeles she says "we did a performance of the merry widow on the top floor " she says "the test was to see if the picture would make it to the lobby " it did these days ms white has recurring parts in two successful network shows as a criminal on abcs quirky prime time drama "boston legal" and as a manipulative matriarch on the cbs soap opera "the bold and the beautiful " both of which are returning this fall ms white is primarily known for her portrayals of two strikingly different women in two blockbuster comedies as the devious sexpot and tv cooking expert sue ann nivens in "the mary tyler moore show " she helped invent televisions seminal workplace sitcom in the early s and her turn as ditzy rose nylund in "the golden girls" helped breathe new life into tv comedy in the s below ms white talks about how the networks could end their sitcom losing streak what makes modern game shows boring and why "the golden girls" has a cult following among many gay men "for starters " she says "the gays know funny " wsj youve been working in tv for six decades how has the process of putting together a series changed ms white the biggest change is the industrys drastic expansion there are now so many channels trying to put on original programs that there arent enough gifted writers to go around anytime something gets so big the product gets watered down the other big change is the audience when i started in television it was brand new it was the miracle over in the corner of your room now the audience has seen every story line people have heard every joke they can predict the plot almost before a show starts thats a hard sophisticated audience to reach wsj the networks have struggled to launch new comedy hits in particular what advice would you give them ms white so much of the humor on new sitcoms plays to the lowest common denominator wit isnt nearly given as much attention as slipping on a banana peel so much of the writing is so coarse so obvious that it doesnt provide a shock never mind a laugh what makes something funny is alluding to it without laying it out explicitly you let the audiences fill in the gaps and thats where the laughs come wsj networks in recent seasons have tried to reinvigorate the sitcom genre by doing away with the live audience and the laugh tracks which often are made by recording the live audience now theyre going in the opposite direction which way is smarter ms white having a live audience makes a world of difference to the acting it keeps your timing sharp when something doesnt work the actor can sense the reaction from the audience and quickly move on on the other hand if you get a laugh you pause a second and dont walk into it its very subtle but i think it comes through the camera wsj are there any modern sitcoms that you like ms white i love "the office" on nbc i want every season of it on dvd thats a show that risks getting too artsy i hope they avoid that trap but right now i think the writing is very witty wsj you helped popularize game shows by regularly appearing on classics such as "password " "the &# pyramid" and "match game " recently networks have reintroduced game shows to prime time with mixed success whats the trick to making a successful one ms white todays game shows are too scripted the great game shows were true games and the celebrity guests were responsible for making up their answers on the fly that created a sense of excitement and unpredictability now on the commercial breaks they tell you whats coming up they hold up cue cards with things youre supposed to say thats not a game wsj reruns of "the golden girls" continue to attract strong ratings on cable why do you think the series still resonates ms white one reason people still love the show may have to do with the age of the ladies in the cast it was unusual at the time to see a whole cast of older people and its still unusual most of the time older actors just walk through and say something outrageous and then they disappear what "golden girls" tells us is that older casts dont turn off younger viewers the networks forget that they think young people only want to see young people on the screen wsj a network executive recently remarked that "the golden girls" has become a cult phenomenon among gay men why do you think that is ms white there has always been a huge cult following for the show in the gay community when the show was originally airing the gay bars on saturday night would all shut off their music at nine oclock put on the show and then start up the music and start dancing again afterwards we always got such a kick out of that wsj what interested you about working on a soap opera like "the bold and the beautiful" it seems like a very different type of acting ms white that came out of left field they called and asked i had never done a soap opera in my life but they wrote a nice story line and once in awhile i go back its always lovely to get invited to the party wsj do you have any other projects in the pipeline ms white my optimism runs eternal you just cant get rid of me you know
