the daily fix is nascars crackdown on cheaters going too far or not far enough online edition among a flurry of nascar rules violations six teams caught cheating in daytona qualifying michael waltrips stands out as the most egregious the two time winner at daytona nascars first and most prestigious race each season was found with an unnamed illegal substance in the gas line of his gbp toyota car his crew chief was suspended and fined &# mr waltrip was docked championship points he apologized and later qualified for the race then yesterday three time champ jeff gordon after winning a qualifying race was penalized when his car was found sitting too low to the ground hell start the race in the nd position columnists reaching for analogies with other sports differ on the severity of mr waltrips rule breaking "tampering with the gasoline isnt like trying to steal signs from the third base coach its like doing steroids in the clubhouse between at bats " sam borden writes in the florida times union but ed hinton writes in the orlando sentinel "nascar wouldnt have to worry if it made clear that these offenses are more analagous to holding and grabbing face masks than say to using steroids " washington post columnist sally jenkins points out that exploiting loopholes in the rules is part of the fun of auto racing "drivers play a constant game of cat and mouse with officials " ms jenkins writes "the rule makers place inhibitions on the cars and the competitors toy with them the sport is all about delicate balances between speed and control commercialism and populism technology and athleticism " charlotte observer columnist tom sorensen says mr waltrip should have made that argument instead of apologizing yesterday "he should have said yes we cheated of course we cheated everybody in the sport cheats we want to go faster and if we find a trick well use it no matter what the rules say " but ms jenkins says mr waltrips team lacked imagination "when you cheat in car racing its supposed to be inventive this was just cheap lousy four flushing chicanery " suspending and fining crew chiefs is misdirected punishment mike bianchi argues in the orlando sentinel suspending the drivers themselves is the right response "this is why nascar should come down even harder on the blatant cheaters because mainstream fortune companies are pouring more and more sponsorship dollars into the sport and dont want to be tainted by such corruption and chicanery " mr bianchi writes that would be a shame mr hinton writes "if the outlaw blood ever is completely drained then nascar will be as colorless as the white flag that signals one lap to go and its popularity could be just as fleeting " another columnist is criticizing a sport for being ashamed of its rough roots "cam janssen couldve been somebody " steve politi writes in the newark star ledger but it was mr janssens misfortune to be a tough guy in an nhl age when fighting has been de emphasized and now he rides the new jersey devils bench "the nhl thought limiting fighting will make the sport more mainstream " mr politi writes "it would be hilarious if it werent so sad the nerds who run this sport figured without the brawls some little old lady in peoria would find versus on her cable system and declare im going to give this beautiful sport a try the result like much of what gary bettman has done is the opposite attendance is down in several markets and theyll need a breakthrough in nanomathematics to compute recent tv ratings the lack of fighting is not the main reason but the farther this sport gets from its roots the closer it gets to irrelevancy " for the second time the philadelphia flyers have traded peter forsberg for young talent the first time in he was years old a no draft pick who hadnt played a second in the nhl before being dealt for the no pick in the same draft eric lindros fifteen years and nhl points later mr forsberg was dealt by philly essentially eliminated from playoff contention to the nashville predators who have more than twice as many points as the flyers nashville parted with year old defensive prospect ryan parent and year old winger scottie upshall plus first and third round picks in this years draft an injury marred mr forsbergs second go around with the flyers organization "forsberg was a great player yes but he may well omit his captaincy of the flyers from his hall of fame plaque " phil sheridan writes in the philadelphia inquirer "he began his tenure this season by declining to take a shot in a shoot out then followed that up with a mealy mouthed reaction to the scapegoating of coach ken hitchcock with hitchcock fired forsberg began his quixotic pursuit of a skate that would fit his right foot it would be wrong to suggest that forsbergs foot problem was anything but legitimate but we can all agree that his inability to find a skate or orthotic that allowed him to skate properly was pretty darn strange " in praising the predators general manager the tennesseans david climer digs up a reference to the former "tennessee three" frontman "on monday night david poile attended the predators foundation ball dressed as johnny cash " mr climer writes "on friday poile walked the line " mr climer says the gutsy move makes nashville favorites to win the stanley cup the future of the nhl in nashville could be on the line "if the forsberg move and a subsequent long playoff run dont motivate investors from the local community to step forward and buoy fan support in general then it is safe to say the predators days in the music city are numbered " scott burnside writes on espn com "a pudgy little kid from the suburbs wanting to play in the nba " that was the reaction of neil olshey then a los angeles high school assistant when he first met jason kapono a decade ago mr kapono shot up to " and worked tirelessly on his game with mr olshey now director of pro personnel for the los angeles clippers hes now shooting a ridiculous on three pointers on pace to set a league record and on free throws for the defending champion miami heat ranking him fourth in the nba in john hollingers true shooting percentage stat and will be featured this weekend in all star weekends three point shooting contest yet it hasnt always been easy for mr kapono "his name has been misplaced by opponents mispronounced over arena loudspeakers and misspelled on official scoring sheets " dave hyde writes in the south florida sun sentinel "hes on his third team in four years he wore a suit to every playoff game last spring because he was buried so deep on the heat bench " mr hyde celebrates mr kapono for tirelessly honing his outside shooting the oklahomans berry tramel would like to see a current player work equally hard from close range to develop a sky hook akin to kareem abdul jabbars special shot "its a lost art a hidden gem baseballs screwball footballs crossbuck " mr tramel writes "master the sky hook and the skys the limit " longtime university of oregon donor pat kilkenny funded the majority of the &# million buyout of former athletic director bill moos now mr kilkenny is the new a d his first job in a college athletic department hes the former chairman and ceo of the arrowhead general insurance agency the oregonians john canzano is acerbically skeptical "i suppose the upside here is that the university has finally abandoned any pretense about who is running the institution and whether a public place of learning was for sale transparency is healthy " but oregon daily emerald columnist luke andrews says mr kilkenny could be a boon to the ducks and not only because he wont collect his salary times of london columnist simon barnes is tired of hearing english soccer managers blame losses on the whistleblowers and then reading uncritical reports of their complaints what if mr barnes tried the same trick "imagine i have written pushing the imaginative facilities of my readers a bit i know but try a crap column " mr barnes writes "i then come into a room full of people with notebooks and tape recorders what went wrong simon bloody subs i tell you the bloke who handled my copy today is the worst subeditor in fleet street and absolutely no one says but simon you gave him crap to start with you should have checked your facts verified the quotes worked up a coherent argument no they just write down the latest antisub whinge and put it in the paper " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix
