senate consternation process the house spent this week debating an iraq resolution that will damage u s efforts to fight terror overseas never to be outdone the senate got busy undercutting the war on terror here at home thats one way to view the fight senate liberals are picking with president george w bush over the issue of justice department nominations a battle that bubbled to the surface this week with regard to u s attorney appointments california ringleader dianne feinstein is hoping to score a few political shots as well as give the white house a taste of whats to come in future senate confirmation brawls if a little thing like national security gets in the way so be it ms feinstein and senate majority leader harry reid picked up the u s attorneys football in january after the news leaked that the white house was dismissing seven federal prosecutors the administration says its unhappy with these lawyers performance and at least it is firing its own appointees one of bill clintons first acts was to cashier pretty much every sitting u s attorney all of whom had been appointed by mr clintons predecessors nothing in the record suggests either mr reid or ms feinstein were all that cut up over the clinton dismissals this time however mr reid is labeling the firings "cronygate " and accusing the administration of ousting capable u s attorneys in order to award political allies with plum posts ms feinstein went further suggesting the administrations real goal was to circumvent the senate confirmation process she noted that a patriot act amendment gives the attorney general rather than federal courts the right to appoint interim u s attorneys and to keep those interims in place until the senate confirms a permanent replacement clearly said ms feinstein the white house intended to pack the justice department with shady prosecutors and avoid the senate altogether what we have here then is ms feinstein the serial filibusterer the woman who rarely saw a bush judge who deserved an up or down vote accusing the administration of abusing the confirmation process it might be fall down hilarious if everyone werent taking the californian so seriously instead ms feinstein recently convinced a majority of her fellows on the judiciary committee including republicans arlen specter orrin hatch and chuck grassley that the senate was getting slapped about and to vote to revoke the patriot act amendment thus is the senate lurching back to a pre mentality putting politics and turf ahead of key security issues if ms feinstein wins this battle the appointment procedure reverts to the status quo ante under that old process the attorney general can appoint an interim u s attorney for days but if the senate doesnt get around to confirming a full time replacement by then the federal courts get to name a new interim that old system was primarily a constitutional oddity but it also posed a threat to terror investigations history shows that it is a rare event for a white house to get a permanent attorney through the confirmation process in days it usually takes closer to a year yet after the first days the federal courts officially get to staff the justice department some courts understandably see the concept of the judiciary making executive appointments as constitutionally suspect thats one reason why in the past six years courts in florida oklahoma and virginia have outright refused to make appointments courts also have little insight into the justice departments ongoing investigations or who best can step in to fill an attorney vacancy while many courts will as a result re appoint the ags interim selection they arent required to do so that can lead to very bad selections in a south dakota judge attempted to appoint a buddy of former senate majority leader tom daschle the court pick came from outside the justice department and lacked security clearances this led to a standoff between the attorney general and the court and a crisis over who was really in charge hardly the best way to go about breaking up terrorist cells or prosecuting zacarias moussaoui as it happens nothing suggests the administration is trying to subvert confirmations since the patriot act amendment in march the white house has nominated individuals to serve as u s attorneys and all have gone or are going through the senate confirmation process theres zero reason to believe the next seven wont as well but try telling that to mr reid who yesterday unsuccessfully tried to push the feinstein proposal through the full senate meanwhile ms feinstein is only the latest to play politics with key national security nominees carl levin spent six months blocking the confirmation of ken wainstein who was tapped as assistant attorney general for national security that position was designed to further break down the infamous "wall" between intelligence and law enforcement a goal that even mr levin claims is important yet the michigan democrat was in a strop about documents he wanted from the bush administration and was only too happy to hold mr wainstein hostage mr levin waged a similar war against alice fisher nominated to head the criminal division of justice for more than a year the latest victim is steven bradbury who was nominated in the distant past of june to head up the justice departments office of legal counsel as acting head of that office mr bradbury offered legal advice on the administrations domestic wiretapping program this proved too much for ted kennedy dick durbin and russ feingold the last was so incensed over the wiretapping program he proposed censuring president bush that didnt fly so he and fellow critics settled for blocking mr bradbury from even getting a vote one big question after democrats won the election was how theyd handle the all important question of national security the publics been getting a taste of that management via the iraq debate but the nominations flaps are equally revealing democrats like to say that having a robust criminal justice system is key to fighting terror and thats true many democrats while they wont admit it even still believe the courts are the only place to fight al qaeda the least they can do is show they mean it and ensure the justice department has the people it needs write to kim wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor
