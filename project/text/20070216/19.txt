bird flu vaccine is a fact need for it is questionable a vaccine for avian influenza is at hand now regulators and companies are weighing whether to make it widely available before any outbreak occurs to date the hn virus that causes the flu has passed only occasionally from birds to humans the possibility of a mutation of the virus causing a large scale highly lethal outbreak among humans motivated big pharmaceutical companies such as glaxosmithkline plc and sanofi aventis sa to develop vaccines the food and drug administration hasnt approved any of them yet indeed the vaccine has yet to get an endorsement from any regulatory agency for use before a pandemic but some governments already are stockpiling supplies the existence of a bird flu vaccine raises a number of questions will it be effective against a mutation of hn if so should it be administered only after a pandemic is indicated the unknowns havent deterred pharmaceutical companies who saw the potential demand for a vaccine last year when fears of a bird flu pandemic sent people around the world rushing to buy up supplies of roche holding ags antiviral drug tamiflu to treat the disease an effective vaccine could be just as important as tamiflu if not more important in saving a person from avian influenza sanofi has been besieged by requests for its vaccine "we have calls from people saying can i buy it can i buy it " says alain bernal a spokesman for sanofi pasteur the vaccine unit of sanofi aventis of france given that the threat of a pandemic is hypothetical at this stage experts say it wouldnt make sense to cut corners on a normal regulatory process they also point out that production capacity is needed to make vaccines for seasonal influenza which poses a more immediate threat at sanofi mr bernal says making bird flu vaccine for a potential threat would cut into the companys production capacity for vaccines for seasonal flu which kills about people annually in the u s alone by contrast the hn strain of bird flu the one that worries health authorities most has infected at least people world wide killing of them mostly in asia since the virus re emerged in late according to the who mr bernal says global vaccine production capacity for seasonal influenza already is limited to an estimated million doses a year of which sanofi pasteur produces about half "the real public health need today is for seasonal flu " he says "you either produce vaccines for seasonal flu or hn " as a result the hn vaccine "is not a vaccine that we want to sell to the public " mr bernal says "we dont have a marketing strategy for this product " a committee of outside advisers to the fda is scheduled to meet feb to make recommendations on the safety and effectiveness of sanofis hn vaccine in addition the current hn vaccines seem to require a high dose to offer protection making production issues worse says anthony fauci director of the u s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which has been working with vaccine makers on an antidote for a government stockpile "its not going to be something youre going to see on the shelf for sure " dr fauci says "it will likely be strictly controlled " the current vaccines are based on strains of the hn bird flu virus from recent years should the virus mutate as it would need to do to spread among humans it isnt clear that it would fully protect people still some experts think the current vaccine probably would protect against severe illness and death even if the victim still got sick governments are proceeding on that assumption and millions of doses have been produced the u s has purchased from sanofi enough vaccine for at least three million to four million people according to dr fauci the u s government is currently negotiating to purchase more vaccine he says with the ultimate goal of securing enough to protect million people still dr fauci adds the u s isnt considering vaccinating people pre emptively with the product currently available glaxosmithkline received approval from european drug regulators in december for one of its hn vaccines but only for use in the event of a pandemic according to alice hunt a spokeswoman in london for the company last month the british drug company submitted another application for an hn vaccine that could be used in advance of a pandemic jean pierre garnier glaxos chief executive said recently that the vaccine could prove effective against mutations of hn he also said switzerland has bought one vaccine dose per capita csl ltd an australian pharmaceutical company announced last month that it had produced a safe effective vaccine against hn australias drug watchdog will soon review the companys application csl has no plans to market a version of the vaccine for general use according to rachel david the companys spokeswoman medical products maker baxter international inc of deerfield ill is testing its hn vaccine and has signed a deal with the british government to produce two million doses for a stockpile the company hasnt yet submitted it for approval to the fda in the u s whether baxter will ever market the vaccine directly to consumers is an open question according to deborah spak a spokeswoman for the company "we are still under clinical evaluation and years away from receiving the approvals needed for commercialization " ms spak says adding that the company hasnt built sales of a bird flu vaccine to consumers into any of its financial projections some companies do say they see commercial potential in the vaccine in november the swiss drug giant novartis ag submitted its hn vaccine to the european medicines agency in london for approval according to eric althoff a spokesman for the vaccine unit of the swiss company mr althoff says he expects a response on that application this year mr althoff says further that if that response is positive novartis believes there is a potential commercial market for a vaccine that would be sold to individuals and not just governments to ward off a pandemic
