okeeffe painting is at the center of a modern fight fisk university could use the money but tennessee delays a deal to sell nashville tenn two modernist masterpieces from the early th century sit in a storage chamber here at a downtown museum they have been in this city for most of the last half century but theyve been out of view long enough that many residents may have forgotten about them their owner tiny fisk university has decided its too expensive to continue insuring and caring for the paintings by georgia okeeffe and marsden hartley fisk wants to sell them both to help solve a financial crisis but a legal battle erupted over whether fisk has the right to do that ms okeeffe who died in at the age of gave the two paintings and many other artworks to fisk in on the condition that they never be sold this week tennessee attorney general robert e cooper jr stepped in to try to keep the paintings in nashville state law authorizes him to weigh in on the sale of charitable donations intended for public use the okeeffe painting "radiator building night new york " and mr hartleys "painting no " each were appraised at &# million two years ago the whole collection was valued at &# million thats more than the total endowment of fisk a historically black school and the alma mater of such luminaries as w e b dubois booker t washington and historian john hope franklin "it was a very very bitter decision" to sell them says fisk president hazel oleary former secretary of energy in the clinton administration and a fisk graduate "on the other hand you ask yourself do you want two pictures or do you want fisk university for the next years " many of the nations predominantly black colleges and universities including fisk have struggled financially in the wake of the racial integration of higher education they have lost prospective students and tuition revenue to better funded predominantly white universities contributions from their early benefactors many of them white philanthropists have diminished and donations from alumni and foundations have not made up the difference fisk decided in to sell several of the paintings and to use other artworks as collateral for a loan then settled on selling only the okeeffe and the hartley the two most valuable under state law applying to the sale of certain charitable gifts it sought approval from davidson county chancery court in nashville the georgia okeeffe foundation filed a motion to block the sale arguing it would violate the directives of ms okeeffe last november fisk struck a deal with the georgia okeeffe museum which had taken charge of the painters estate from the foundation the museum located in santa fe n m would pay &# million for her famous oil painting a depiction of new yorks american radiator co skyscraper fisk could sell the hartley painting a abstract to a tennessee buyer so long as the buyer permanently lent it back to fisk for display then mr cooper stepped in exercising his statutory power he has taken the position that both paintings should stay in nashville the city best known for country music and the grand ole opry he contends should rally to help fisk and to recognize the artworks as treasures worth keeping mr cooper told the school and the museum that he would approve their settlement only if both paintings were first offered for sale to any buyer who agrees to lend both back to fisk if no such buyer surfaced within days he proposed the okeeffe museum would get its namesakes painting for &# million and the hartley would go on the block both fisk and the museum agreed to the terms and the day period begins today under the agreement &# from any sale will fund renovations to the gallery where the collection is housed ms oleary says the rest will be used to restore the endowment and cover the annual operating deficit the collection "has been taken for granted " says mr cooper "there is nothing like a deadline to focus attention " and to "prod and gauge what the publics interests are here " the plan mirrors a deal brokered in december in philadelphia that stopped thomas jefferson university from selling thomas eakinss painting "the gross clinic " to the national gallery of art and a museum in arkansas for &# million that deal allowed days for local museums and foundations to raise money to purchase it last year atlantas mayor rallied business leaders to drum up &# million to buy the writings and personal papers of the late martin luther king jr the civil rights leaders children had planned to auction the documents which now are held at his alma mater atlantas morehouse college fisk which was founded in was long one of the nations most important african american schools but it was virtually unknown to most whites when ms okeeffes husband famed photographer alfred stieglitz died in ms okeeffe donated the bulk of his valuable collection of photographs and art to well known institutions such as the metropolitan museum of art and the national gallery of art but at the suggestion of a friend new york photographer and writer carl van vechten she gave pieces to fisk mr vechten who was white collaborated with and was a patron to black artists and writers during the harlem renaissance and was a friend of fisks president at that time the bequest included works by many modernist painters championed by mr stieglitz at his famed "" gallery in new york photographs by mr stieglitz were also included as were prints by picasso and lithographs by toulouse lautrec and cezanne the okeeffe painting is said to be her only work bearing a reference to her husband whose name appears in red neon lights to the left of the subject building from the beginning there were questions about whether fisk would have sufficient resources and expertise to safeguard and display the collection according to ms okeeffes published correspondence the campus gym was converted into a gallery for the exhibitions debut in when ms okeeffe arrived several days before the opening she angrily made wholesale changes repainting every wall white and ripping out ceiling lights her letters say by the paintings needed to be taken down and sent to new york for restoration ms okeeffe gave the school &# to help but fisk couldnt afford the whole job and the art wound up in storage in new york by fisk was nearly &# million in debt its buildings were crumbling and at one point the gas company shut off heat in its dormitories civil rights leaders and affluent blacks and whites rallied to help bill cosby donated &# million president reagan gave &# and appointed a committee to examine the plight of black schools fisk raised &# million over seven years and in the stieglitz collection returned to a renovated gallery by the mid s however fisk was once again in financial trouble the departures of four presidents in less than a decade had interfered with fund raising efforts some trustees who had been instrumental in raising money rotated off the board and others resigned after disagreements over financial matters fisk had no resources to promote its art and gallery attendance slumped at its main gallery named for mr van vechten the roof leaked and climate controls failed in ms oleary took over as president raising hopes for a turnaround to spark donations she publicized fisks dire condition five straight years of &# million budget deficits she said had consumed half of its endowment leaving just &# million she said she had little choice but to sell part of the stieglitz collection the georgia okeeffe foundation argued that the plan would violate the artists sale prohibition and would void the donation and necessitate the collections return to the okeeffe museum fisk maintained it had the right under state law to sell the paintings and that in a later letter ms okeeffe had withdrawn her prohibition of a sale saul cohen president of the museums board of directors says the attorney generals plan to solicit other bidders for days would help fisk while still leaving the okeeffe museum a chance to get the painting says the attorney general "we will let the stieglitz collection go if it means maintaining the survival of
