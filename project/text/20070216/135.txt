weekend journal the finicky traveler unplugged in the keys at resort we discover the perils of an e fast a night on the couch im wandering the sandy footpaths of little palm island looking for someone who works here the only creatures i see are three of the pint sized key deer that inhabit the lush five acre isle cute but they cant help me my problem im at this luxury florida keys resort with my parents and our suite while lovely doesnt have the promised sleeping accommodations for three the bellman who dropped us off in a golf cart has disappeared the concierge who promised to return and show us the rooms features never did and the "shore station" where we checked in is minutes away by boat making matters more complicated is that little palm island promises to let guests unplug from civilization charging upwards of &# a night for rooms with no clocks tvs outside phone lines or internet connections so how am i supposed to reach the concierge so much for tuning out i plug myself back in to the outside world using my mobile phone to call the reservation office at the shore station on little torch key i can still remember what it was like to spend a week on a tropical island before cellphones and email but nowadays you can stay connected in places where not long ago you were lucky to get an at&amp t overseas operator on a land line the notion of an unplugged vacation let alone an unplugged vacation day seems to be an ever fading fantasy my heart sank last year when i turned on my blackberry on the island of st barts expecting the device not to work a flood of emails rushed in at me sure there are still places where you can really be out of signal range and theres always the option of voluntarily leaving it all behind little palm which is three miles offshore gets good cell and blackberry signals and has a public room with wi fi access but it offers a whimsical lobster trap on the island where guests can deposit mobile devices and a "wi try" package to keep the gear back at the shore station so guests can head for the resort device free still no one has taken the hotel up on it yet understandable perhaps in light of our own snafu in paradise i chose to unplug at little palm as part of a sightseeing drive through the keys to celebrate my dads birthday when i made a phone reservation the nice lady on the other end estimated it would take us no more than three or four hours to drive from west palm beach and assured me the three of us would be comfortable in the large "island grand" suite with a bedroom two bathrooms and a living room with a pull out sofa the price tag was hefty &# a night plus a &# service charge but it was still less expensive than two smaller "bungalow suites" at &# each depending on the season rooms range from &# to &# nightly and meals arent included unless you book a higher all inclusive rate after a nearly six hour drive from west palm beach including a brief lunch stop we arrived at little torch key just in time to miss the boat that meant cooling our heels at the shore station for nearly an hour before catching the launch with a couple of other guests to the islands main dock we were dropped off at our suite on the top floor of a two story bungalow near the resorts restaurant by the young man in the golf cart and the female concierge who promised to be right back we checked out the beautiful wraparound porch big wooden hot tub on the deck and great view of the water but the bed in the bedroom was so high that there were stepladders on either side and we discovered that the living room couch wasnt a sofa bed but a rattan settee with a thin cushion sheets a blanket and extra pillows sat on a chair perhaps because wed been advised in our confirmation letter that there were no phones in the rooms and the concierge never returned for her briefing we didnt see the decorative house phone in a corner which had we known to pick it up would have connected us inside the resort instead i found the dockmasters office on my meanderings around the island and the fellow on duty promised to call the main office about our room issue after returning to the room and waiting minutes i took matters into my own hands and called reservations as it turned out no other large suites were available so the hotel suggested moving my parents to a second room for a discounted price of &# two staffers arrived to show me the rooms but one was on the opposite end of the island the other had a bed frame even higher than the one in our suite which i couldnt envision myself let alone my parents climbing into the point of the trip had been to spend time together so i bit the bullet and said id be fine on the couch the hotel says the promise of a sofa bed was a mistake there are none or any extra beds at the resort we settled in chuckling at the personalized stationery the resort prints up for guests they had my dads name as fyl its syl our suite was one of several decorated in formal british colonial style with heavy fabrics dark wood and wrought iron chandeliers other rooms and suites have a lighter airier look that the hotel is adopting in an ongoing redecoration there are rooms in individual thatched roof bungalows with living rooms and private porches in a lush low key setting with white sandy beaches and many kinds of palm trees including some planted years ago by the islands first inhabitant newton munson the island later owned by a local sheriff was regularly visited by harry and bess truman and was used in filming "pt " the movie of john f kennedys wartime adventures in the south pacific a resort since little palm was acquired in by noble house hotels i just had time to have an hour long massage at the resorts funky but pleasant spa while my parents read their books then came back to get ready for dinner using the big stone lined shower with window slats open at the restaurant we were offered a primo table at the edge of the water under a tiki torch but we chose a more sheltered spot on a broad veranda overlooking the beach and a roaring fire pit we were touched that the hotel had made note of my dads birthday printing menus especially for fyl we didnt have the heart to correct them we enjoyed buttery rosemary rolls and jalapeno cornbread a corn salad with tortilla strips cauliflower and bacon soup grilled mahi mahi and a hearty rib eye finished off with key lime pie after dinner we wandered past the great room library near the hotel pool where a glow emanated from behind the curtained windows inside in front of the resorts only television set three women huddled with their laptops using the rooms wi fi network to download email and surf the web two of them a mother and daughter on a five day vacation at the resort said they werent able to stand being so unplugged at least i wasnt the only one susan howarth director of sales and marketing says the resort understands that between demanding jobs and family obligations "people need to be reachable" it just asks that people not use cellphones in restaurants and public areas she apologized for the communication breakdown on our room and said that generally the resorts rooms are best suited to two people clearly little palm is designed primarily as a romantic haven for couples offering rose petals scattered on the sheets at night and bedside champagne for an extra fee my nights sleep on the couch was pretty fitful and no amount of rose petals would have made it any more comfortable the next morning we took an early stroll along the islands network of paths and boardwalks admiring the colorful tropical birds miniature fountains a giant chessboard and asian zen garden with footbridge we were delighted by the key deer who trailed us as fearless and inquisitive as puppies given our late arrival and sleeping conditions we felt pretty shortchanged by the a m checkout time but we still enjoyed a leisurely breakfast at the same table where wed dined the night before this time with a bright morning view of the azure waters and the white sand i was so relaxed i almost jumped out of my seat when my cellphone rang in keeping with the island rules i ducked out of earshot just long enough to answer it and say id call back later the e free stay many hotels are offering guests the option of disconnecting at least for part the trip prices are current for the least expensive double
