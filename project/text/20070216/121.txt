weekend journal bleakness over broadway for spring theaters shift to serious plays from spamalot to war orphans and nixon child slavery life on the front a writer coping with her husbands death the downfall of a combative radio host hardly the uplifting toe tapping themes that attract tourists to broadway yet thats what theaters will serve up this spring as producers place a big bet on serious even somber "straight" plays instead of the lighthearted musicals that helped propel the industry to record revenue in nine commercially produced plays as opposed to those from nonprofit theaters will open this season compared with just three commercial musicals new plays include joan didions "the year of magical thinking " about her husbands sudden demise "radio golf " august wilsons work about a black politician and "frost nixon " in which the former president talks about his misdeeds the weighty fare goes against the conventional wisdom that broadways future lies in musicals and it risks scaring off crowds "im terrified " says producer jeffrey richards citing both the tone and the number of plays set to open mr richards is putting on "talk radio " eric bogosians play about the controversial radio host and "radio golf " producers are shifting toward plays in part because last fall wasnt auspicious for new musicals the &# million production of "high fidelity" garnered nasty reviews and closed after a week while the critically acclaimed "spring awakening" and "grey gardens" are only modest hits theater insiders also say the industry has just about run out of well regarded musicals to revive "people are starting to look at old plays now the way they were looking at old musicals eight or years ago " says jack viertel artistic director of manhattans jujamcyn theaters

sarcastic ones like "spamalot " the country seems to be more reflective says producer daryl roth who is working on ms didions play among others musicals of course havent disappeared some of the biggest success stories on broadway are longer running shows such as "jersey boys " based on the lives of the four seasons pop group and "the drowsy chaperone " a spoof of old time musicals such shows

roundabout theatre company more commercial musicals are in the broadway pipeline for this fall including "young frankenstein" and "the little mermaid " to limit the financial drain of a dud most of this seasons plays will be performed for just a few months thats a change plays used to have open ended runs with the hope they would become long running hits like the broadway performances of "doubt " a drama in which a nun accuses a priest of child molestation short runs also can be a marketing tool that drives ticket sales before the reviews are out despite the trend toward cheaper shorter runs
