years of double digit increases spending on remodeling was sluggish last year in response manufacturers of countertops appliances and other remodeling products are introducing cheaper alternatives as homeowners trim their makeover budgets scaling back the size of their projects doing their own handiwork or acting as their own contractors sometimes with disastrous results at the international builders show last week in orlando fla acoustic ceiling products came out with a plastic backsplash that resembles tin but costs half as much viking range corp rolled out inch tall stainless steel refrigerators priced at &# scaled down from their inch &# behemoths and lutron electronics introduced do it yourself options at about half the price of some of its professionally installed lighting systems the new products are a departure from many of the luxury lines introduced during the housing run up when giddy homeowners thought nothing of putting in &# hand blown glass sinks rock crystal chandeliers and tricked out spas with built in flat screen tvs as real estate prices rose such improvements often paid off handsomely when the house was sold but as home prices have fallen so too have the financial rewards of renovating the median price of new and existing homes dropped to &# in the fourth quarter of over the same period a year before according to the national association of home builders the value of remodeling has been shrinking too a homeowner who finished a basement a &# job on average nationally got back at resale in in the same job returned according to the th annual hanley woods cost versus value survey published last fall remodeling a bathroom with upscale products like stone countertops and a bidet cost &# and returned in down from in the diminishing returns have dampened spending on remodeling which grew by to &# billion in the fourth quarter of over according to a report released in january by harvards joint center for housing studies in and quarterly increases were as high as many homeowners are choosing to "postpone or pass on major home improvements " says nicholas retsinas the director of the center and that is likely to continue until the housing market picks up at the builders show formica corp launched laminate countertops that mimic wood river rocks and even algae with names like planked deluxe pear walnut quarstone and tangle seaweed and priced from &# to &# per square foot installed meanwhile the company offered only four new versions of its more expensive solid surface counters which cost &# to &# installed therma tru

version of some of the giant six burner commercial ranges that have been popular for a decade and at &# to &# about one third the price even one of the so called idea homes at the show reflected a chastened post boom mindset in the renewed american home a renovated bungalow in downtown orlando many of the houses original wood finishes and trims were replaced with realistic but cheaper fakes including laminate cabinets and wood composite interior doors "its like the car industry bringing out cheaper versions of luxury cars " says stephen gidus the winter park fla builder who remodeled the house when stu fause a retired hospital executive decided to create a media room in the basement of his new tripoli pa home last year he scaled down the project in part because home prices in his area while not falling arent appreciating at the double digit rates that they were two years ago instead of finishing the entire space he had two thirds of it done and placed his big screen television on a &# stand from target rather than spending ten times as much to have it built into the wall he also opted for inexpensive materials like sheet vinyl flooring and a fiberglass tub and surround in the bathroom the entire job cost him &# about a third less than if hed finished the whole basement and used premium materials mr fause who has no immediate plans to move but is remodeling with an eye to resale figures he can get away with downscaling downstairs because the rest of his four bedroom home which he bought last year for &# already has pricey features such as marble baths and a whirlpool spa in a declining market he says owners have to be judicious about where they spend their remodeling dollars "its whats upstairs that counts " he says some manufacturers are more actively courting the do it yourself market which exploded during the housing run up and has continued apace during the slowdown in cost cutting homeowners spent &# billion on diy projects up from &# billion in according to the harvard housing center lutron electronics introduced its first diy system at the builders show a preprogrammed wireless "smart" lighting control package called aurora it includes a control panel remote control antennae and five dimmer switches that the company says can be installed by anyone handy enough to replace a light switch total cost &# about half the price of a professionally installed system dupont meanwhile brought out simplicity a countertop thats built to the homeowners specs and arrives ready to install at &# a square foot installed its cheaper than averaged priced site built countertops the company says of course doing it yourself doesnt always save money over the past year craig margulis owner of a phoenix handyman service has seen a spike in calls from people who want him to repair their mistakes and these days many of the callers live in million dollar homes mr margulis thinks thats because theyre tapped out after stretching to buy their houses at the height of the market "theyll try to do everything themselves to save a few dimes and then we have to rip everything theyve done out " he says megan bittle a st louis kitchen designer is seeing more of what she calls "buy it yourself" clients affluent homeowners who wont get their hands dirty but try to save a little money by acting as designers and general contractors for their projects the strategy often backfires she says because home products are becoming increasingly complicated and theres a shortage of skilled labor she recently got a frantic call from a homeowner whod hired an inexperienced plumber to put in a sophisticated shower system the plumber installed a valve upside down reversing the hot and cold taps and the newly tiled bathroom wall had to be torn down to fix the problem kim hanson brown and her husband don had their share of problems last fall when they renovated their th century home in unionville va recently appraised at &# million they decided to transform the dated farmhouse into a french country style manor with arched doorways wrought iron chandeliers and red and yellow toile wallpaper they chose high quality materials to stay competitive with other horsey estates nearby but since they couldnt be sure that home values would continue to appreciate as much as during the boom the couple tried to shave costs by doing the plans themselves and hiring local subcontractors to do the work though they thought they were up to the task the couple made plenty of mistakes first they had their ceilings finished with fresh drywall only to realize theyd forgotten to plan for light fixtures the ceilings had to be taken down so wiring and junction boxes could be installed in one room that was wallpapered before a leaky upstairs shower was fixed a wall got moldy and the pricey paper had to be stripped and replaced another room was painted before demolition work was begun on an adjacent bathroom when a sledgehammer broke through a wall it had to be patched and redone oops "i made some bad decisions " says ms hanson brown a specialty magazine publisher the couple figures theyll wind up spending at least &# on the project still in progress more than three times their original budget they recently hired an interior designer and are planning to hire an architect as well to guide them through the rest of the process although she doubts they will recoup their costs ms hanson brown thinks the upgrades will help sell the house more quickly some homeowners are hiring a pro to do the planning and then doing most of the labor themselves thats what michelle wandres and her husband tom did when they decided to upgrade the yard around their five bedroom victorian in germantown md last summer they had a landscape designer do the plans and then went to work installing lighting planting bushes and trees and laying walkways doing the work was a "real headache " says ms wandres a graphics designer but it cut costs in half a sensible approach in a market where prices of similar homes have fallen from about &# million to &# she hopes to sell when her son goes off to college next year and wants her house to be in top condition so it will be competitive in her price range she says "buyers expect certain things " renovation deflation homeowners may assume theyll recoup what they paid for costly remodeling projects
