house call our political imagination of evil is impoverished and nowhere is it more impoverished than in iraq even today when the blood of innocents flows so richly and regularly we do not seem to grasp its origins or its power that is we do not seem to grasp the centrality and the perdurability of culture and in this regard the president and his party as well as the democratic party are equally blinded by their respective orthodoxies when the administration took us into iraq it was in transports of universalism as all democratizers must be all that it wished to know is that people all people people everywhere yearn for liberty and for a fair state this was not the traditional republican view of these matters and it took some courage for george w bush to buck the cynical and cynically elitist view of his father and james baker that arrangements can always be made with dictators and satisfactory arrangements at that it was actually refreshing to hear this four freedoms trace of franklin roosevelt from the smug grand old party although we had already heard it once before from its slightly dopey but truth seeing president ronald reagan all men and women want to be free mr bush said and iraqis too the problem is that this belief which is probably true is not all we need to know whatever people want they want in their particularity general aspirations are always locally inflected sometimes to the vanishing point the people we set out to liberate were not just human beings they were also arabs and muslims and more particularly they were shia muslims and sunni muslims and kurdish muslims as well we did not invade only an enslaved country we invaded also an ethnos a religion a culture none of which have been historically and frankly philosophically receptive to the great blessing that we wished to confer the presidents belief in the omnipotence of the american military that it can outsmart and outfight militias that butcher indiscriminately only confirmed him in his sense that the persistence of cultural and sectarian hatreds would be no problem that a year old fact of culture and religion could be effectively overcome by a new doctrine of counterinsurgency the democratic opposition went through a similar process but in the reverse it is true that liberals are keenly aware of difference and lovingly celebrate difference that is what multiculturalism is about and moving towards open borders too but they do not like to see the virulence of diversity the historical persistence of the enmity of one element of the crazy quilt for the other even one seemingly quite akin to the other the liberal appreciation of the hateful dimensions of tribal and clannish identity generally extended no further than the blood rituals of "the sopranos " now they are so much wiser and sagely lecture everyone within earshot about the permanent hatreds between sunni and shia although their house chairman of intelligence oversight had not the foggiest notion of who was in discord and what the discord was about in any case they counsel smugness since none of these inter and intra sectarian hostilities will ever come to our shores where then are we in the war no one knows exactly what to do about it everybody knows that we are in trouble even those of us who are skeptical about the ideological inclinations of many democrats cannot but dignify the national anxiety that they represent the house is now debating a nonbinding resolution supporting our troops already in iraq and disapproving the dispatch of more the debate is strategically speaking pointless the new troops are already on their way the senate will figure out how to make its own sense of the politically fraught perplexity now both houses of congress are perfectly entitled to debate anything of this magnitude indeed they have a responsibility to do so a war should not shut down free opinion or worse yet informed opinion so the attempt of the house minority leader john boehner to scare them away from a serious debate with demagogic references to the american revolution is unseemly this is a weighty war very weighty the absence of a serious debate about its ends and its means would rightly earn the national legislature the contempt of all americans but the formula that the house democratic leadership has fixed on is a charade it allows each of the representatives five minutes at the podium enough for them to posture for local television but not so much that anybody can say anything serious let alone deep or even brave and the resolutions text itself is rather cowardly for since it purports to be a declaration of support for american soldiers actually fighting in iraq whatever "support" actually means why does it criticize the only help that can possibly enable the military in the war more soldiers and more weapons and if the democrats do not want the war to be continued then they should bring forth legislation either cutting funds or setting a date for withdrawal in the manner of george mcgovern there is no rationale for troops in terrible danger to be held hostage to the political expediency of nervous democrats who are not prepared to do what they really mean to do and to say what they really mean to say only one resolution is being debated on the house floor and no amendments will be permitted not quite a debate is it one sees in nancy pelosis iron fisted eagerness to get everyone into line a measure of her years in the wilderness she will have her way and the political hothouse is even more torrid in the senate there after all sit the candidates for president one would think that given the threat to her nomination posed by barack obama hillary clinton would be more flexible in her views on the war her insistence on not saying that she had made a "mistake" in voting for the deployment of troops to iraq puts her out of the center of gravity of her party mr obama has set the tone and the pace for the democrats and he has the advantage of having been clearly antiwar from the beginning i suspect that almost all democrat aspirants will end up imitating him why wont mrs clinton capitulate to democratic orthodoxy that the war was always a "mistake" out of pride of course hillary clinton doesnt make mistakes only other people do and especially george bush senate democrats are also making sure that no real debate will be held in that body but in a certain material sense the senate has already approved the administrations enhanced strategy in the war by confirming gen david petraeuss appointment as the u s commander in iraq whose strategy do the democrats imagine our soldiers will be following if they didnt want this strategy and they didnt want to continue the war they should have turned him down that would have been a real message and a true one but the democrats want it both ways one of the tropes of many democratic critics of the war is that in going to war in iraq we squandered our near victory in afghanistan the defeat of the taliban was actually exhilarating what with women out in the streets with normal clothes they wanted to wear and children even playing musical instruments but the enthusiasm of the democrat party for afghanistan is rooted in the fact that afghanistan is not a strategic asset for the west it is only a moral triumph the democrats prefer to look away from the colder long term calculations of american and western interests in the middle east we need more than moral triumphs there we need strategic triumphs if iraq turns out not to be the latter sort of triumph it will be remembered as one of the most momentous blunders in our history i think the odds against us are huge one reason is that iraq is neither a state that coheres nor a society that coheres its civil society if that is what it is is not quite a civilized society the carnage between shia and sunni and the carnage among other religious and ethnic communions since the end of ottoman rule have left deep and bloodied breaches in iraq if these cannot be repaired it will be a huge defeat for george bush and whatever many liberals think of it for liberalism as well mr peretz is editor in chief of the new republic
