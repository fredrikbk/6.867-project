weekend journal review television confused state in many ways "the state within " a new miniseries on bbc america is like a very long episode of the "x files" seething with conspiracy and corruption in high places and revolving around a plot that doesnt begin to make sense to anyone but the intrepid heroes who alone are determined to penetrate the veil of evil the six hour series begins saturday continues sunday and concludes on feb each time from p m et although most of "the state within" takes place in washington in the aftermath of an apparent terrorist attack this series was filmed in canada which explains why few of the actors cast as americans actually have american accents another "x files" touch the basic story revolves around sir mark brydon jason isaacs who is the british ambassador in washington when a jet literally explodes in the sky above his head raining debris and bodies onto the streets of americas capital city like everyone else he assumes it was the work of terrorists and evidence soon suggests that the blast was detonated by a british muslim aboard the plane but the suspects birthplace may have been the fictional central asian country of tyrgyztan its ruler is a dictator who kills and oppresses his people democrats and islamists alike without comment from washington because his nation allows american military bases there as part of the war on terror and also because it could become the site of a gushing oil pipeline i cant say too much more without giving away the "twist" here although its basic thrust will be obvious immediately to those who live in fear of the military industrial complex and was even grasped by me very early on that said theres plenty to keep the viewer engaged since the story is packed with characters who may or may not be up to no good and substories that probably have a connection to the main theme but to which the viewer must pay close attention or lose any hope of understanding what this connection may be for instance there are some soldiers with british accents running around in west virginia and shooting members of their own squad theres also another brit a black falklands war hero on death row for killing some white girls in a crack house he turns out to hold a key to the plot puzzle yet hes obviously there also to call attention to various alleged horrors of the american legal system and to allow some disparaging words about the ugliness of its landscape as well and of some of its people when a rabid republican governor of virginia tries to round up and incarcerate all the states british muslims in one of the films more extreme efforts to depict american concerns about islamic terrorism as a vile pathology the inhumanity of this abuse is illustrated by a frantic muslim man and his pregnant wife who are killed at a roadblock while national guardsman are glimpsed laughing as if nothing had happened but nothing in the america of "the state within" is quite so evil as secretary of defense lynne wagner played in full battle ax and dirty mouth mode by sharon gless the blonde of "cagney and lacey " lynne wagner dresses like a frumpy version of madeleine albright although ms cagney has told interviewers that she modeled her character admiringly on hillary clinton her role however is most like that of a female donald rumsfeld as the fringe blogosphere sees him merciless machiavellian and for that cheney touch the greedy former head of a huge and sinister halliburton like company called armitage it is quite possible to enjoy a thriller even if you dont buy its political message although the strident malice toward the u s here might have been better camouflaged and thus more effective in defter hands at any rate what usually matters is whether the thing feels real while you watch "the state within" has so many inauthentic touches that would never happen moments and is so often off in the details that its difficult to take seriously the little goofs hardly count e g washingtons hay adams hotel being referred to as the hays adams what does get in the way of the drama is the writers apparent unfamiliarity with their larger territory in the hours after a terrorist attack in washington the city would be frozen in alert mode and the british ambassador probably would not be hosting a party and certainly would not be wandering around talking to his staff and pretty women in a daze of concern and compassion hed be in constant contact with u s officials and totally absorbed with coordinating efforts to investigate the attack everyone assuming as they would in real life that another one could come at any minute the u s government would not go on an anti british rampage because an alleged terrorist had a u k passport theyd need and get total cooperation because everyone in washington london and beyond would know that where islamic radicals are concerned its a truly international bunch the british ambassador if he needed to confer with a senior u s senator would not have to loiter forlornly in the halls of congress and when he snagged her for a chat endure her insults because as such a senator says here shes busy and doesnt like being accosted by people who dont have appointments and so on then theres the basic premise of the series which is that world events can be and are determined by one evil official a lackey a slush fund and a couple of hit men its the foundation of many thrillers from the cold war era on in this case however when the underlying subject is the very real threat of islamic terrorism it comes across as denial for escapism of another sort try "star trek beyond the final frontier " a history channel documentary hosted by leonard nimoy monday p m you dont have to be a trekkie to enjoy in particular the scenes from octobers auction at christies of st memorabilia
