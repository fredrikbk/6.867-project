boeing to retry commercial satellites boeing co after largely abandoning pursuit of commercial satellite manufacturing orders over the past few years is looking to revive that business partly by introducing a smaller more flexible line of spacecraft howard chambers head of boeings space &amp intelligence systems unit said engineering on the new satellite a modified version of the companys family is expected to be completed this year the move sets the stage for a broader shift by the chicago aerospace company to more aggressively bid on mainstream commercial orders "we need a product line for the future " mr chambers said adding that boeing "is committed to the technology we need to have to be competitive" in both the commercial and government marketplaces even before the new design is formally offered to corporate and military customers slated for boeing intends to step up its presence in the commercial market mr chambers said in an interview the new spacecraft is expected to be less expensive and easier to tailor to individual customers than current offerings in the satellite making unit bid only on three of the largest most complex commercial projects seeking contractors and won one of them this year mr chambers said "we will be active we will bid more" commercial jobs max engel an analyst with consulting firm frost &amp sullivan said that "strategically its a really good idea" that "makes sense as a commercial option " but like some others mr engel remains skeptical about whether the move means a fundamental attitude shift by boeing managers in recent years under several leaders the satellite making unit has primarily focused on larger more complex and typically higher margin communication imaging and spy satellites for the pentagon and the intelligence community boeing also found commercial customers generally lukewarm about its models accelerating retreat from the commercial arena global prospects for satellite orders are looking up with overall manufacturing prices somewhat more stable than before boeing is telling customers it has learned from a painful period of design and manufacturing defects stretching back to early in the decade that affected many programs going through its satellite factory the new model able to be much lighter and sometimes to need only half the electrical power of the heaviest also is designed to use modular construction to accommodate a wide range of customer requirements boeing doesnt break out satellite manufacturing results but mr chambers said the business is still in the black after longtime losses and write offs an indication of the upswing a chart at the factory shows a drop since in postinitial assembly problems needing fixing or testing flying high number of satellites launched last year by manufacturer lockheed commercial total satellites alcatel alenia commercial total satellites loral space commercial total satellites eads astrium commercial total satellites boeing commercial total satellites note noncommercial satellites can be military or research source futron corp
