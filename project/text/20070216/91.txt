putin and progress whatever the wests grave misgivings about vladimir putin they are not widely shared by the russian people who consistently give their president approval ratings in opinion polls even former presidents gorbachev and yeltsin much admired in the u s have given a nod of approval to mr putins "strategic" direction even though they express reservations about his moves to consolidate federal authority nonetheless there are two pertinent issues to face first would any russian president succeeding mr putin act differently in foreign policy second is russia regressing irretrievably into authoritarianism or is she likely to embrace western democratic norms despite the zigzags the kremlins pursuit of national interests in foreign policy whether we like it or not reflects a broad agreement among russians indeed on a whole range of issues ranging from natos eastward expansion to mr putins hardball tactics with the independent states in russias neighborhood the majority of russians support his decisions even russias leading reformers regard the neighborhood as russias area of interest former prime minister mikhail kasyanov who successfully carried out a series of reforms during his tenure insists that russians "have special interests and responsibilities" in their immediate neighborhood "we have a long history of shared problems and common tradition although the former soviet republics are now independent states " mr kasyanov told me in a december interview anatoly chubais the legendary privatizer of russian industry was even more explicit in his pronouncements suggesting that russia should become a "liberal empire " in an interview on vremya tv he added "we must be frank and straightforward and assume this mission of leadership not just as a slogan but as a russian state policy i believe this mission of leadership means that russia is obliged to support in every way the expansion of its business outside russia " in short unlike europe and japan which share u s concerns despite occasional differences russia always will have geopolitical interests in its immediate neighborhood extending its decision making periphery as far as the middle east and china this does not imply that the west should uncritically accept specific decisions in pursuit of these interests such as the expulsion of georgians from russia but even if russians were to subscribe to liberal western values as president bush desires their future leaders still might choose to define their interests independently moscow would continue to engage the u s leadership in win lose dialogues over russias determined foreign policy but never mind the likelihood that a liberal democratic russia might change its foreign policy style what are the prospects of such a russia emerging in the first place if its correct to say that a prospering middle class dare one call it a bourgeoisie inevitably leads to the rise of democracy then russia fits the bill admirably the transformative changes in russia a remarkable development since mr gorbachevs glasnost are phenomenal russians are acquiring private housing automobiles and fixed and mobile telephones at a dizzying speed the overall poverty rate has declined from around in the mid s to about today and of college age youngsters receive a higher education there has been much angst over russian muscle flexing on the pricing and supply of oil and gas however ham handed moscow has simply used its bargaining power to extract better economic terms in situations of bilateral monopoly gazprom the russian gas supplier has sought maximum possible terms from its european customers before they switch to alternative energy sources at the same time ukraine and belarus have bargained with gazprom over transit charges because russian gas must pass en route to europe via pipelines located in their territories russian industry and energy sectors will increasingly adopt market economy rules and practices as they learn to interact and integrate with western business recognizing this german chancellor angela merkel signed with mr putin a agreement in which wintershall the energy unit of german chemical giant basf and gazprom exchanged equivalent stakes in early more contracts are proliferating with french and italian partners russias giant power company is poised to raise &# billion in the next two years and to invite western companies to supply power generating units technology and management know how gazprom according to some reports is set to raise &# billion in the next decade for financing a variety of projects will american businesses be sidelined from lucrative contracts and a liberalizing market oriented mission in a fast growing and diversifying russian economy "there is a definite consensus among russian society and the elite that russia needs a market economy " yegor gaidar mr yeltsins young reforming prime minister told me in october "by contrast our struggle to form a robust functioning democracy has not brought decisive results i do not think that the educated urban populations in large countries such as russia can put up with undemocratic regimes for long " ms desai harriman professor of comparative economic systems and director of the center for transition economies at columbia is the author of "conversations on russia reform from yeltsin to putin" oxford
