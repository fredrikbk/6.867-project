weekend journal sports by the numbers stewart steps up to the plate when the nascar nextel cup season kicks off at this sundays daytona race observers will be focusing on such drivers as upstart david gilliland and resurgent veteran ricky rudd who share the front row but maybe they should focus on a mundane piece of hardware under the hood of the cars called a "restrictor plate" a inch thick inch aluminum plate drilled with four th inch holes it fits between the carburetor and the intake manifold meant to reduce a cars horsepower and thus its speed it represents an attempt to increase driver and fan safety but it could also play a prominent role in who will win daytona international speedway is one of two tracks the other is alabamas talladega superspeedway where restrictor plates are mandated for nextel cup races the plates impact is clear in a test at talladega rusty wallace drove a car with no restrictor plate to a top speed of mph and an average mph lap speed thats almost mph faster than the fastest qualifying laps of a restrictor plate car at the track last year plus the plates affect more than speed they also mean that drivers run at full throttle for the whole race keeping drivers from goosing the gas pedal as they attempt a pass while some fans love the resulting nose to tail racing it can make for a dull procession and it could be argued that the large tightly bunched packs sometimes cars or more are a bigger safety hazard than running unrestricted cars but everyone agrees that racing at restrictor plate superspeedways is different from other nascar races with no pull away passing drafting or driving in the wake of a leading car is emphasized extreme drafting puts a premium on patience and strategy pulling out of the draft to try an unsuccessful pass can send a car from within inches of the lead to the middle of the pack in a matter of seconds the reigning master of restrictor plate racing is nextel cup champ tony stewart while he hasnt won the daytona mr stewart has dominated at daytona and talladega over the past two seasons in the events at the two tracks mr stewarts averaged a top five finish to be exact he led for of possible laps or of the time most importantly mr stewart won four of those races all at daytona including last weekends budweiser shootout a nonpoints race that doesnt affect the nextel cup standings no other driver comes close to matching mr stewarts superspeedway resume but there are still some solid competitors last years daytona winner jimmie johnson and victor jeff gordon both have three restrictor plate wins mr gordon sports an impressive laps led but a few back of the pack finishes pushed his average finish to mr johnson was more consistent avg finish but led only laps two former nascar points champs matt kenseth and kurt busch have also performed solidly in restrictor plate races mr kenseth whose crew chief was suspended for a rules infraction during qualifying had an average finish of but led only laps mr busch had an average finish and led laps so while sundays race should provide dramatic racing remember that at daytona racings rules are different on its high banks the right move or the smallest lapse in judgment could decide the sports biggest race just blame it on the plate keeping on track tony stewart has dominated the racing at nascars two restrictor plate tracks daytona and talladega over the last two seasons driver laps led wins avg finish tony stewart matt kenseth kurt busch jimmie johnson dale jarrett dale earnhardt jr jamie mcmurray ryan newman elliott sadler kevin harvick jeff gordon
