weekend journal review film cooper decodes double agents soul in breach d c tales style is grim music and lyrics has nice stars wobbly key chris cooper has a face that could slow a clock in the happiest of times his expressions range at a measured pace from thoughtful through meditative to mournful in billy rays thriller "breach " he has little to be happy about he plays robert hanssen a tortured and devious fbi agent who was a spy for the soviet union and who became on his arrest in the most notorious turncoat in the bureaus history the movie is serious intelligent intentionally claustrophobic and awfully somber you remember it in black and white though it was shot by the masterful tak fujimoto in color but youll remember mr coopers performance for exactly what it is an uncompromising study in the gradual decay of a soul thats not to suggest that the robert hanssen of this film whos already under suspicion when the story begins might ever have been mistaken for a model of mental health when the fbi sends ryan phillippes young agent in training eric oneill to work as hanssens assistant in hopes of gaining the suspects trust the man oneill finds is a walking definition of alienation a computer whiz he seethes with arrogant anger at the stupidity of his superiors he quivers with jealousy religious zealotry glib hypocrisy and a haughty correctitude that covers sexual deviancy on top of that he disapproves of women in pants suits "the world " he declares "doesnt need any more hillary clintons " this is the beginning of the george w bush years since we know what the fbi only suspects that hanssen is as guilty as his career is long hed been selling classified documents to the soviets for decades its remarkable that we see him as anything but loathsome yet we do and so does young eric who comes to admire in a perverse way hanssens prickly intellect and buried humanity the center of the film essentially a chamber piece is the battle of wits between the young inexperienced oneill and his elusive dangerously canny quarry one close up pauses briefly on two dvds in hanssens car "the mask of zorro" and "entrapment " it seems to be a whimsical comment on the cat and mouse plot but in fact hanssen was convinced that his wife was a catherine zeta jones lookalike as trust grows between the two men so does the shrewdness of oneills spy craft hes an interesting character in his turn despite some clumsiness in the writing stiff shards of dialogue like "is this the music of your childhood " and ryan phillippe more than holds his own in a drama inevitably dominated by the older actor laura linney is kate burroughs an fbi agent who says she has no life not even a cat ms linney has no part this uncommonly graceful actress seems sandbagged by kates burden of grim exposition the script by adam mazer william rotko and mr ray sticks with the facts of the case by declining to speculate why its close mouthed antihero with his vacuum sealed spirit did what he did such reticence may be commendable given the possibilities for banalities but is unsatisfying as drama billy rays previous film an impressive debut feature called "shattered glass " was also an entrapment thriller its quarry was stephen glass a serial prevaricator who dazzled readers of the new republic in the s with reporting pieces that had everything going for them except truth the filmmakers touch in that one was light he got off on the crazy enthusiasm of his scribbler subject the doomy subject of "breach" has dictated a different style that i respond to with difficulty deliberate pace meaningful scowls are scowls ever meaningless encroaching shadows still chris cooper makes the movie worthwhile hes a dark star in a contracting universe music and lyrics remember "the flight of the phoenix " the movie about the misshapen plane built from scavenged parts that flies its builders to safety "music and lyrics" is like that plane up to a point the plot is misshapen the pieces are scavenged and nothing quite fits the film does manage to take off albeit barely then flits around cheerfully in search of coherence but finally crashes and fizzles hugh grant is alex fletcher a has been s pop star has a has been ever been so popular with his still faithful fans at amusement parks and county fairs alex gets a shot at a comeback when a pop diva with a glottal stop and dead eyes shes played doggedly by haley bennett as a buddhist ish slut invites him to write a song for her by friday its that kind of script alex cant pull it off hes lost his chops for lyrics until drew barrymores gabby plant waterer its that kind of script offers a casual miracle cure for his crippled couplets suddenly theyre a team writing supposedly inspired words and music except that that better title was taken by a not so hot old movie with judy garland and mickey rooney among many others and their music and lyrics are pretty lame ms barrymore is forced to work at being charming which she does with some success while hugh grant stuck with a relentlessly chipper role falls back on mostly effortless charm and unerring timing the timing of the movie which was written and directed by marc lawrence is another matter scenes stutter and sputter to tentative ends bridge to terabithia every now and then "bridge to terabithia" demonstrates the misuses of enchantment brief spasms of overproduced fantasy but this screen adaptation of katherine patersons now classic novel for young readers tells its story with agreeable simplicity in between computer generated monsters josh hutcherson is jesse the earnest artistic boy from a poor family and annasophia robb is leslie the beguiling tomboy who becomes jesses guide to an imaginary kingdom terabithia and then his co ruler one caveat about the film grows out of its fidelity to the book very young children may be disturbed by a tragedy that comes between the inseparable friends another relates to the kids performances which are appealing but unpolished though the first time director gabor csupo has achieved distinction as an animation artist he lacks experience directing actors the best adult performance in the film is that of zooey deschanel she comes off again agreeably as self directed dvd tip no one can accuse "the spy who loved me" of being somber its a glittering tide that lifts even roger moores james bond to heroic ish heights barbara bach is bonds russian counterpart and richard kiel is the bionic monster jaws lewis gilbert directed ken adam outdid himself no easy task in designing the production and the great cinematographer claude renoir committed the whole preposterous thing to film
