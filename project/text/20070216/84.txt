politics &amp economics firms ride high on chinas huge rail upgrade after years of putting up with a patchy overburdened rail network china is suddenly shoveling billions of dollars into new tracks and high speed trains beijing has embarked on a five year plan through that calls for a near quadrupling of investment to modernize the countrys railways which it sees as a foundation of a prosperous economy for general electric co siemens ag and other makers of locomotives signaling devices and related high tech railway gear the planned spending represents a potential sales bonanza in the latest deal bombardier inc of canada monday announced it would provide equipment to power and control freight locomotives to be delivered to chinas ministry of railways starting in the contract will earn bombardier &# million china is already the worlds second largest market for freight trains and related equipment after the u s and it is the fastest growing market for both passenger trains and those carrying freight ge which recently signed contracts with the ministry of railways for more than &# million of locomotives and signaling systems forecasts that china will be the rail industrys no market in the world in years the scale of chinas planned railway expansion is unprecedented says nigel rayner a transportation specialist at the asian development bank which has lent the chinese government &# billion for railway improvements since "north america in the early days of railway development might be the only vaguely comparable situation " he says "but that was not the result of a coordinated long term plan " chinas railroads many of which were built in the early th century have struggled to keep pace with the demands of its burgeoning economy shortages of rolling stock make for packed passenger cars especially during national holidays such as the spring festival that starts this weekend china transports an average of million passengers per kilometer about million per mile of a train route almost six times the world average the squeeze on freight capacity is even worse china moves more than times as much freight per kilometer of its train routes than the global average and while shippers in china fill an average of freight cars each day they need closer to according to the asian development bank beijings investment in its railways has lagged far behind spending on its highways and seaports and railroads still dont reach large swaths of the country particularly in the interior where many of its natural resources are located congestion is the norm on most rail lines and travel on them is slow and often fitful a passenger train must frequently slow for a sluggish freight train ahead of it to pull over on a siding and let it pass although trains are much more cost efficient than trucks for carrying freight over long distances the shortage of railway capacity forces a lot of cargo onto chinas highways where overloaded trucks pollute the air and damage road surfaces coal makes up almost half of all rail freight in this energy hungry nation leaving little room for containerized cargo and other goods yet bottlenecks along tracks from coal producing regions in northern china mean that many coal burning factories in the south must rely on time consuming shipments by barge under its current five year plan beijing targets investment of trillion yuan &# billion in new rails and equipment and outlays of billion yuan for locomotives and rolling stock by the end of the ministry of railways aims to have laid more kilometers about more miles of track half as much as in all of germany to create a nationwide web stretching more than kilometers "i think in many other countries if i saw the sort of increase the chinese are talking about id have thought oh my theyre being overambitious " says mr rayner of the adb but he adds that the ministry of railways has "very clear ideas" and a record of performing "effectively and on time " last year siemens booked an order for high speed trains valued at &lt euro&gt million &# million alstom transport a unit of alstom sa of france and a consortium led by japans kawasaki heavy industries ltd each won identical orders for bullet trains while bombardier sold the voracious demand and the money beijing has available to spend together with the speed at which chinese railway officials decide what to buy have combined to make the country an "amazing market " says dirk hoke president of transportation systems for siemens ltd china the field isnt altogether clear while chinas railway market is growing annually at double digit rates much of what beijing spends on trains and related equipment will go to chinese companies a lot of the planned investment will pay for tracks bridges and stations work that local companies can do more cheaply than foreign ones michael chan an analyst with macquarie securities ltd in hong kong says of the billion yuan the government has budgeted for railways this year will pay for such civil construction "the boom in this market is not so big as some might anticipate " cautions alstom transport senior vice president marc chatelard who manages alstoms business in the asia pacific region mr chatelard adds that the ability to offer lower prices than ones competitors is "ultimately the decisive factor" in making a sale furthermore foreign manufacturers that win rail related contracts face demands to transfer technologies to chinese joint venture partners as a quid pro quo for the profits they stand to earn in china for example siemens a german conglomerate has agreed to build of its trains at a local factory the trick for these foreign companies as for those making aircraft and many other high tech products in china will be to give the chinese enough to keep them happy without sowing the seeds of home grown competition still chinas ambitious plan to modernize and expand its rail system is an opportunity no supplier can afford to miss siemenss mr hoke says he cant think of any other market in which every one of the worlds main producers of high tech trains is grabbing a share siemens recently clinched a million euro contract to manage construction of a high speed rail line from beijing to the coastal city of tianjin ge has gotten the railroad ministry interested in a range of products from diesel electric locomotives to signaling technologies and the fairfield conn company values the market in china at more than &# billion a year ge is "well positioned to win" business with a line of fuel efficient freight locomotives says patrick jarvis a spokesman for ge infrastructure the unit that makes railway equipment alstom which helped develop frances tgv high speed trains earlier clinched an order for locomotives valued at million euros alstom also has sold hundreds of train cars used in shanghais mass transit system and recently won contracts to deliver signaling equipment to beijings subways in time for the olympics there chinas appetite for railway equipment is so keen that the government must divide orders among several companies to ensure that it gets all it needs on time yet diplomacy also plays a role in beijings choice of suppliers just as it does with chinese purchases of commercial aircraft during a visit to beijing in october by french president jacques chirac for instance alstom signed a letter of intent to supply the chinese with freight locomotives sue feng and kersten zhang in beijing and juying qin in hong kong contributed to this article getting on track elements
