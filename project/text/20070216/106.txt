the evening wrap houses divided online edition the house of representatives sent a message to president bush opposing his decision to add more than troops in iraq but while some in the house are poised to take even stronger steps debate in the senate remains bogged down the nonbinding house resolution which also says congress will "support and protect" the troops passed seventeen republicans crossed the aisle to vote for the bill two democrats voted no the vote punctuated a weeklong debate that brought nearly all house members to the floor to speak "the stakes in iraq are too high to recycle proposals that have little prospect for success " said speaker nancy pelosi the bills passage could be only an opening salvo in the democratic partys efforts to bring a major changes in the bush administrations war policy rep john murtha is preparing a new bill that would set strict conditions on combat deployments and a critical battle over war funding is brewing but republicans warned that calling for withdrawal tinkering with troop rotations or imposing a cap on spending could be disastrous "cutting off funding limiting military options or pushing for immediate withdrawal will only make our future more dangerous it is time to stop the politics stop the games stop the finger pointing and do what is best for america " said rep steve chabot of ohio the measure is headed for a test vote in the senate tomorrow and republicans were basically calling it dead on arrival south carolina sen lindsey graham said he would "do everything in my power to ensure the house resolution dies an inglorious death in the senate " even with democrats in the majority mr grahams threat isnt a hollow one senate republicans already stymied debate on nonbinding resolutions opposed to the presidents troop surge and there was no indication that the upper chambers republicans found the house measure more palatable senate majority leader harry reid needs to keep his fellow democrats in line and persuade a number of republicans to cross the aisle in order to prevent the house measure from being frustrated by a filibuster but at least one prominent republican called the test vote political hackery and said hell skip it sen john mccain elected instead to spend tomorrow on the presidential campaign trail in iowa mccain spokeswoman eileen mcmenamin said he "thinks its a political stunt that harry reid is pulling instead of having actual open debate on iraq " as lawmakers wrestled military officials in iraq were calling a security sweep that got started in force only a few days ago an early success fewer than usual civilians were killed as a result of sectarian violence in baghdad overnight said iraqi brig gen qassim moussawi a spokesman for the baghdad commander only bodies were reported by the capital morgue compared with the recent reported average of roughly to per day a single days sample isnt much to go on but gen moussawi was ready to call it "a big reduction in terror and killing operations in baghdad " his american counterparts agreed maj gen joseph fil commander of u s forces in baghdad also reported a reduction in violence and attributed it to the increased u s and iraqi security presence but he also said those who have terrorized the city for so long may have decided to lie low and bide their time while the coalition flexes its muscles time

rules are cumbersome enough on a bright summers day a few times a week drivers must move their cars in order to make way for streetsweepers but when snowstorms happen along and drifts start to pile up along the curb the city often lets streetcleaning rules slide not so this week after a winter storm swept through and temperatures plunged all the snow shunted aside by the citys plows froze into natures own jersey barriers making extracting ones car from its spot slightly less labor intensive than extracting coal from a mountainside neither snow nor ice nor angry throngs could keep the parking police from their rounds however and they papered snowed in cars with tickets resulting in a hailstorm of complaints yesterday mayor michael bloomberg told cityfolk to stuff their simpering "this was not a lot of snow it was easy to move your car " he crowed but today hizzoner changed his tune "im sorry for the inconvenience to people " he said "but youve got to make decisions and try things and each storm is different " the tickets were waived write to tim annett at tim annett wsj com
