weekend journal the drivers seat volvos high tech safety net the problem with most &# luxury sedans these days is the cilantro or perhaps its dill theres nearly always something in them thats off putting dont misunderstand most of the cars in this price range would rate at least two of michelins three coveted stars if they were restaurants as driving something like a bmw series or a mercedes e class is the automotive equivalent of a gourmet meal but if you cant stomach a certain flavor does it really matter whether the chef went to le cordon bleu the automotive analogy is the overzealous engineer so enamored with electronics that he ruins even the best car much of the time this is courtesy of a "multifunction interface" that controls all the needlessly complex features built into a car in pursuit of some warped claim of technological superiority even as the system obfuscates a task as simple as tuning the radio such is the case with the aforementioned duo being forced to prod at bmws obligatory idrive or mercedess comand system is like taking a bite of pad thai and developing an allergic reaction to the peanuts in a segment where all the cars are so good so comfortable so capable and so wonderful to drive aggravation isnt to be tolerated its a deal killer surely there must be a joint down the street where they prepare a similar dish without the unwanted flavor that brings us to the volvo s just like the competition the s is brimming with technology but with a twist typical to the swedish maker the recipe revolves around safety not confounding control knobs and lcd screens if you have a vague recollection of having dined here before and being unimpressed well lets just say that the place has been renovated and is under new management completely redesigned for the s is actually two very different cars the base model is powered by a new liter inline six cylinder engine and is available only with front wheel drive the truly delicious version is the all wheel drive s with volvos horsepower liter v thats previously seen duty in the makers xc sport utility vehicle while its fast and elegant with a classy interior this sedan carries a sub &# starting price meaning it offers blue plate value too the awd s has excellent driving dynamics especially when its equipped with the optional sport package this includes an electronically controlled suspension with three settings the firmest of which really ratchets the pound car down to the pavement reducing body roll without sacrificing much comfort the steering on the s is also adjustable allowing another three settings for the amount of effort required to turn the wheel volvo will surely appreciate that were going to let slide the conflict inherent in equipping a safety flagship with a powerful v that can race to mph in under six seconds much of the good reputation of the ford owned brand revolves around its practice of building "safe" cars with features like crumple zones multiple airbags and a whiplash protection system all of which can help minimize injury in an accident but with the s volvo has moved beyond these passive systems with two interesting new features both of which can help make you a better driver rather than just a better looking accident victim the first is an option volvo calls blis or blind spot information system it uses two small cameras mounted under the side view mirrors that each take pictures of a drivers blind spots every second an onboard computer uses these images to determine when another vehicle is alongside the s the system then illuminates small orange warning lamps positioned where the front door frames meet the windshield pillars the lights are just within the drivers peripheral vision providing a subtle though not distracting warning of a nearby car the system works well in eliminating the need to perform head checks when changing lanes and its unobtrusiveness is trumped only by the fact that it can be switched off if for whatever reason youd prefer to live more dangerously the other safety feature is a collision warning system thats similar in approach working in concert with the cars optional radar based adaptive cruise control the typical job of adaptive cruise control is to "see" the traffic up ahead and keep you traveling safely behind it by operating both the brake and the throttle but by also calculating the time gap between your car and that traffic the s can alert the driver to an impending crash by sounding a warning and flashing a red light onto the windshield when this happens the brakes are primed to deploy full stopping power regardless of how hard the driver presses on the brake pedal while this may be less impressive than an adaptive cruise control system that can just brake the car to a stop automatically yes such a thing exists though volvo doesnt offer it the collision warning system is perhaps less prone to abuse by inattentive drivers no doubt there will be those who find the s unappetizing drivers who will gag at the collision warning system and refuse to use the blind spot detectors they are free to dine elsewhere for those luxury sedan shoppers
