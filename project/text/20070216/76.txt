new impotence ads draw fire just like old ones in december alone an ad for impotence drug viagra aired at around p m during "prancer " a g rated movie about a young girl who nurses one of santas reindeers back to health another spot for rival medicine levitra appeared during an afternoon showing of the comedy "pee wees big adventure " and another for cialis graced an early evening presentation of the holiday classic "miracle on th street " despite a pledge from the pharmaceutical industry to be more careful with prescription drug advertising impotence drug makers are sliding back to tactics that drew widespread criticism from patients doctors and regulators a pediatricians organization is calling for no impotence ads during hours when children are likely to be watching and a major aids group has expressed concern that ads have become too suggestive again encouraging people who arent suffering from erectile dysfunction to use the drugs recreationally one commercial coming under fire is for pfizer inc s viagra the market leader that shows a man and woman watching baseball on television when the woman walks away and beckons the man to join her he jumps up and pops a videotape into the vcr "they say in life theres only time for one great passion unless youre really clever " intones a voiceover "the ad is very smug and coy and suggestive in a way thats not useful for children and adolescents " says victor strasburger a professor of pediatrics at the university of new mexico and the co author of a recent american academy of pediatrics report on the commercials pfizer defends the ads it says that the cable network showing "prancer" was aware of the companys restrictions on audience and that it was composed of adults "in developing the current campaign our goal was to strike the right balance between motivating men to take positive action for their health and remaining sensitive to the environment " the company says in an email "we believe the campaign achieves both goals " the pharmaceutical industry implemented its self imposed advertising guidelines for marketing prescription drugs directly to patients last year the drug makers promised to target audiences that are adult defined as over years old pfizer and the other impotence drug makers said they would go one better and target only audiences that are or more adult "theyre not all sticking to this " says david kweskin senior vice president of tns a marketing research firm "its tough to spend that kind of money without some slippage " the american academy of pediatrics has called for the erectile dysfunction commercials to be restricted to after p m so that children wouldnt view sex as "a recreational sport " the makers of impotence drugs say they are abiding by their guidelines and have eschewed major sporting events like the super bowl this year to steer clear of younger audiences part of the problem though is that ad placement isnt always under their control advertisers have somewhat less say about when and where their ads can appear on cable channels than they do on traditional networks thats because advertisers can purchase the exact program on which they want their ad to appear on network tv but generally purchase less specific blocks of time on cable nonetheless advertisers often have an option to alert cable channels in advance when a specific program isnt appropriate for their ads for example kindra strupp a spokeswoman for eli lilly &amp co the maker of cialis says the ad on "miracle on th street" was an isolated mistake by the cable channel "we would not intentionally buy advertising during programming for which the content was not appropriate to the audience watching this serves no ones interest and does not make good business sense " and julie lux a spokeswoman for schering plough corp which jointly promotes levitra in the u s with glaxosmithkline plc says "we use our best efforts to target our television advertising to avoid audiences that are not age appropriate " levitra was developed by bayer ag and glaxo some impotence drug makers have recently ramped up spending on advertising in an attempt to jump start the categorys faltering sales which have topped out around &# billion a year world wide short of the &# billion some analysts had predicted by now despite its aggressive cost cutting in other marketing areas pfizer spent almost &# million on viagra ads in the third quarter of last year almost more than the year earlier period according to the most recent data available from tns spending on levitra quintupled in the third quarter of over the period both companies had pulled broadcast ads during parts of over regulatory concerns though spending on other forms of advertising continued drug companies still are spending less on the ads for impotence medicines than in when cialis and levitra had just launched after pfizer began selling viagra in it took an educational approach ads featuring former presidential contender bob dole made discussing impotence acceptable but as competitors crowded the market the industrys largest drug maker changed gears with a campaign that featured a man and woman shopping for lingerie the man seemed to grow blue horns when the viagra logo appeared behind his head and a voice called him a "wild thing " the fda criticized pfizer for not disclosing what condition viagra treats and what its major side effects are the following year the fda sanctioned levigtras makers for a similarly suggestive levitra spot after the companies removed their ads for a time pfizer returned in late with low key spots that featured two men in a telephone call center that kept the dialogue to educating patients about impotence never mentioning viagra levitra too re entered cautiously without its brand name attached to ads and a message focused on the correlation between impotence and other diseases but in recent months brand names have returned to viagra and levitra ads lilly has been the most consistent of the three in its advertising approach for cialis which has focused on older couples and the drugs hour period of effectiveness even it toned down its message early last year when it decided to feature a doctor reading the list of side effects then it pulled the doctor who seemed to interrupt the commercial in response to ads like the viagra baseball spot the aids healthcare foundation a large operator of free aids clinics sued pfizer last month alleging that the ads promote recreational use of viagra by men who arent impotent just last week it sent a letter to pfizers chief executive jeffrey b kindler banning the companys sales representatives from pitching any of their products at the groups offices pfizer said in a statement that it does not promote viagra for recreational use despite the criticism the new wave of impotence drug ads seems to be helping sales world wide sales of impotence drugs ticked up in according to catherine arnold an analyst at credit suisse viagra sales held steady in from while fourth quarter sales notched up the companies say they are taking the industry guidelines very seriously nonetheless the cialis ad appeared on "miracle on th street " according to video monitoring service a firm that tracks ad placement last month a levitra commercial ran during a p m showing of the movie "the flintstones in viva rock vegas " in december the ran during an inspector gadget movie around noon on a sunday a spokesman for rainbow media which owns the amc channel on which these movies as well as "prancer" and "pee wees big adventure " appeared declined to comment the renewed attention over the marketing of impotence drugs directly to consumers comes at a time when senators in both parties are focusing on restricting those kind of ads for all drugs which was on track to hit a record &# billion in earlier this month sens edward kennedy d mass and michael enzi r wyo introduced a bill that proposes new restrictions on direct to consumer advertising on jan sens christopher dodd d conn and charles grassley r iowa proposed legislation that would require drug makers to submit new ads to the fda days before they air ad notes another car ad bites the dust responding to complaints from suicide prevention groups volkswagen pulled its new tv spot off the air the spot "jumper " created by crispin porter + bogusky showed a man threatening to jump off the ledge of a building who changes his mind after learning about the reasonable prices of some vw models the suicide prevention action network said the ad was "irresponsible ill informed and ineffective" and asked the car maker to pull it just days before general motors also responding to complaints edited an ad that first appeared during the super bowl featuring a robot dreaming about jumping off a bridge "the campaign is all about how optimism is inherent in the vw brand " said keith price a spokesman for vw "another element of the brand is sensitivity and with that sensitivity we have withdrawn the spot " briefs mindshare wpp groups media buying firm named scott neslund who headed its chicago outpost as ceo of its north
