airlines corp filed a postbankruptcy business plan that projects a high equity value for the company and would give unsecured creditors a rate of claims recovery unprecedented in a string of recent airline insolvencies but northwests plan also outlined some potential concerns from further increases in fuel costs to modest revenue assumptions over the next four years that show clouds still linger over the industry despite its turnaround it also contrasts with the bankruptcy exit plan filed two months ago by delta air lines inc which foresees greater improvement in revenue as well as its own robust return for its creditors standard &amp poors corp considers the assumptions in the northwest and delta plans "broadly plausible in the near term " philip baggaley s&amp p airline analyst said
