a new study shows how baseball myths can hurt the game after st louis won the world series youd think fans in small cities would stop grousing that major market teams have a built in edge should any of you not be inclined to concede error economist j c bradbury is ready to regale you with statistics regression analysis and cartesian plots to prove mathematically that while big market baseball teams win more than small market teams do market size explains only part of the differential with pitchers and catchers reporting to the grapefruit and cactus leagues this week its time for baseball fans to dust off the equipment they too need for the season i am referring of course to calculators statistics economics and multiple regression analysis which calculates how much one factor such as market size contributes to some outcome team wins in the hands of prof bradbury of kennesaw state university georgia these techniques lead to counterintuitive results sure to spark a bar fight or two his coming book "the baseball economist the real game exposed " takes aim at all sorts of baseball lore to separate fact from myth ever since the american league introduced the designated hitter rule in its rate of batters hit by a pitch has exceeded that in the national league by a total of through economics offers a simple explanation in both leagues the cost of hitting a batter with a pitch is having a man on base but in the national league where pitchers bat there is also the cost of risking a retaliatory beaning when you the wild hurler step up to the plate ergo more hit batsmen in the al but retaliation explains only part of the nl al difference the nl hit batter rate equaled and sometimes exceeded the als after expansion years and the presence of more wild pitchers in the nl which had more new teams swamped the deterrent effect of possible retaliation which turns out to be only a minor factor in the hit batsman rate baseball wisdom holds that a team needs to "protect" its star slugger by having a decent hitter behind him by this reasoning the mets carlos beltran last year belted so many home runs a career high after in because carlos delgado hit behind him and barry bonds would have gotten fewer walks if albert pujols instead of jeff kent had been on deck a good on deck hitter supposedly keeps a pitcher from pitching around a strong batter a weak one makes a pitcher more willing to walk the slugger prof bradbury shows otherwise if the on deck hitter is a threat think boston clean up hitter manny ramirez then putting the slugger david ortiz on base carries a steeper price manny has a good chance of driving in ortiz the three spot hitter may therefore get fewer walks if theres a strong clean up batter and the strikes he sees may be even harder to hit because the pitcher reaches back for extra speed or movement to keep him from reaching base and therefore setting up an rbi a pitcher might let ortiz reach base if a hitter waited on deck but ratchet up his effort if he sees manny there speculation is fine but prof bradbury prefers multiple regression analysis using this technique he and a colleague found that a weak on deck hitter makes a batter more likely to get an extra base hit a strong on deck hitter lowers the chance that the batter before him will walk and also lowers his chance of hitting for average and power "protection " prof bradbury concludes "is a myth " so is the popular explanation for why there are no left handed catchers namely that a lefty would have a tougher time throwing out runners at third than a righty does prof bradbury analyzed data from tens of thousands of game situations to count how often various on base out configurations led to a run the difference in runs scored with a man on second rather than third a measure of how important it is to throw out a runner trying to steal third is a puny per game even that overstates the case because runners on second dont steal every time third is open that happens only of the time protecting against the steal is therefore not a convincing reason to have only right handed catchers stealing third is rare and even when it succeeds the gain is small lefties dont catch because managers have four other positions to play them three outfield slots plus first base and so dont need to put them behind the plate assembling a fantasy team prof bradbury finds that the best predictor of a hitters production is not average rbis or runs scored it is on base percentage plus slugging average this sum accounts for almost all the difference in how many runs a player will be responsible for oh and the big market small market question every million residents produces one extra win per season prof bradbury calculates using data from to based on population alone the yankees should win more games than milwaukee calculating "population adjusted wins " he shows which teams did better than their citys size predicts and which did worse im talking about you kansas city
