weekend journal taste public diplomacy tv style americans hear a lot about al jazeera the qatar based news channel censured and praised for airing anti american views and al arabiya its more moderate saudi owned rival we also debate the merits of al hurra the u s government funded channel that is struggling to find an audience in the arab world now theres a new kid on the block layalina productions a washington based nonprofit that makes arabic language programs for broadcast on the most watched tv channel in arab countries mbc the saudi owned middle east broadcasting center layalina is the brainchild of richard m fairbanks former ambassador at large under president reagan its mission is to project a favorable but non propagandistic image of america through entertainment as well as news surprisingly this concept was initially hard to sell founded in layalina boasts an advisory board that is a whos who of media business and diplomacy george h w bush is its honorary chairman but as mr fairbanks recalls "there was a disconnect potential donors in the u s kept saying the arabs will never put it on and mbc said we would love to broadcast arabic language shows made in america but americans dont make any " now they do layalinas maiden effort a episode series called "ala al tariq fi amrika" "on the road in america" is in its fifth week on mbc it is a "reality show " featuring real people coping with a real situation the people are three young arab men mohamed a year old jordanian doctor ali a year old egyptian and sanad an year old saudi studying in dubai and the situation is a road trip across america with a film crew that includes a year old palestinian producer named lara and a ish israeli american cameraman named guy layalina chose the three arab men in an audition that excluded women because vice president leon shahabian explained many arab viewers would object to seeing unmarried men and women traveling together yet mr shahabian described producer laras presence as "calculated" and added that the same is true of guys "our thinking was lets hire this guy and see what happens " part of what happens is fluff the participants clown mtv style while driving a limo through manhattan riding horses in montana and surfing in los angeles but beyond these fun in the sun sequences the show contains some all too real moments as the visitors encounter not only a mix of americans but also significantly one another because this tour took place in the summer of the first notable encounter is between palestinian lara and israeli american guy several of the americans that the group meets a congressman a catholic priest a zydeco musician offer platitudes about "breaking down stereotypes" and "going beyond political cultural and religious differences to celebrate our common humanity " and something like this happens between lara and guy when their sniping about the war in southern lebanon yields to a tentative grudging rapport its hard to know how this rapprochement is going over with arab audiences there are no nielsen ratings in arab markets according to mr shahabian however the participants are now celebrities in the region much sought after for interviews and other media appearances in part this is because the four look good falling off a surfboard yet thats not all as a foreign service officer posted to an arab country recently told me "arab youth are in a serious mood they want to be entertained of course but even more they want to debate and discuss " to its credit and in sharp contrast to most american "reality" shows "on the road" makes a little room for serious conversation including some grappling with national stereotypes for example when the group visits the king fahad mosque in los angeles an impressive edifice built entirely by saudi money and in that respect not typical of american mosques an argument breaks out between sanad and ali sanad chides ali for equating muslims with arabs reminding him that "the prophet never said the arab world he always said the muslim world " does sanad the better educated saudi triumph over ali the ill informed egyptian because this show is airing on a saudi owned channel not really sometimes ali wins as when he sanad and lara debate whether wealth makes people shallow and self absorbed the series has many episodes to go so far though this conversation seems free wheeling open ended and clearly enjoyable for the participants and in terms of americas image what matters is not who wins the debate but where it takes place without harping on "freedom and democracy " this program speaks volumes about the country that serves as its backdrop "on the road" is funded by a grant from the richard m fairbanks foundation established by the ambassadors father for the foreseeable future the other programs in production at layalina an animated childrens show and a version of " minutes" must similarly rely on donations as mr shahabian explains america friendly arabic language programming is not at the moment a money maker "the cost of this production about &# million has been low but we only get back about one percent from mbc " yet when it comes to improving americas image profit cannot be the sole consideration theres no lack of commercial american programming on arab tv mbc alone runs two channels that carry only u s films and tv shows headlining the schedule this week is "pepper dennis " a forgettable and forgotten warner bros comedy about an ambitious female tv reporter to american eyes it offers little more than stale jokes about one night stands wives leaving their sexually inept husbands and married men hiring prostitutes to liven up their poker games to arab eyes however such material reinforces the impression alluring to some repellent to others of america as a land of unbridled hedonism and materialism unlike russians and east europeans in the soviet era arabs today are not starved for stimulation from the west on the contrary they are glutted with it thats where layalina comes in as an enlightening exploration of america "on the road" will never win the tocqueville award or even the borat booby prize yet as a living illustration of the mysterious wonderful chemistry by which all sorts of people feel free to speak their minds when standing on american soil it may deserve the public diplomacy medal of honor a prize for which truth to tell there has been precious little competition lately ms bayles teaches in the boston college honors program and is a visiting fellow at the aspen institute berlin carol
