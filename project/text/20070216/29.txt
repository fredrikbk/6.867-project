democrats focus on tax relief for middle class bush may acquiesce to higher levies on rich to pay for curbing amt washington the new democratic controlled congress is looking to rein in looming tax increases on the middle class possibly covering the cost by raising taxes on upper income households and the bush administration may not stand in the way the possible bargain centers on the alternative minimum tax a kind of parallel income tax that hit million u s taxpayers in the tax year congressional democrats are eager to keep the amt from ensnaring millions more middle class taxpayers they also must find a way to cover the estimated &# billion cost of scaling back the tax this year in recent days bush administration officials have signaled they may not oppose a likely method of covering those costs raising taxes on the nations wealthiest citizens that concession could mark the beginning of a bigger debate on revisiting the bush tax cuts which could ultimately lead to reversing at least some of the cuts given to upper income americans over the past six years the amt dates back to the late s when congress discovered that a small number of upper income households had managed to avoid federal income taxes entirely by exploiting deductions credits loopholes and shelters the amt has been adjusted since but because it has never been indexed for inflation rapidly growing numbers of taxpayers are vulnerable to its bite the treasury estimates that unless congress acts more than million households will be affected by the amt in the current tax year many with incomes below &# among those most likely to face higher tax bills because of the amt at least in the near term are those who live in high tax states such as new york california and massachusetts which also tend to be democratic leaning unlike regular income taxes the amt doesnt provide for deductions of state and local taxes the bush tax cuts have accelerated the amts reach into the middle class by reducing the amounts those households would pay under the regular income tax thats particularly true for families claiming multiple child credits the white house and key lawmakers in both parties agree some kind of fix should be enacted to prevent the amt from reaching further into the middle class at least for this year the big question if congress passes a bill raising taxes to finance such a measure would president bush a staunch opponent of tax increases veto it mr bush is likely to remain firmly opposed to raising marginal tax rates but administration officials have been quietly suggesting that he wouldnt necessarily object if democrats passed a "revenue neutral" bill that cut taxes paid under amt and raised them elsewhere to offset any revenue lost to the treasury these officials say replacing the tax increase thats scheduled under the amt with a tax increase somewhere else doesnt on balance raise taxes indeed a health care proposal mr bush recently floated to raise taxes on people with high value health benefits shows he is willing to accept some forms of tax increases on upper income americans democrats have been circumspect about disclosing their plans for new taxes which are in the early stages a group of democratic senators yesterday unveiled a proposal for new middle class tax breaks including extending amt relief for two years a spokesman for one of the sponsors new york sen charles schumer said the lawmakers would suggest paying for that relief through some combination of higher taxes on oil companies higher taxes on families making more than &# a year and ramping up enforcement to grab more of the "tax gap " taxes that the internal revenue service says are owed but persistently arent paid the chairman of the senates tax panel montana democrat max baucus recently proposed eliminating the amt beyond the next year or two house democrats are studying how they might enact a longer term amt reprieve for some taxpayers one option under discussion would permanently exempt households with annual incomes of as much as &# from paying the amt with some kind of graduated relief for those between &# and &# to offset the revenue shortfall people making more than &# a year could be required to pay more tax either through a higher amt rate or higher regular income tax rates its unclear whether the administration would be amenable to such a major change and its attendant tax increases but some democrats are saying that providing a tax cut for the middle and upper middle classes would have political and policy benefits that justify tackling the issue "its going to cause a little pain i think for what were doing its worth it " says rep charles rangel d n y chairman of the house ways and means committee the amt requires taxpayers to do two sets of calculations first they calculate their taxes using regular rules then they have to calculate their taxes again using a second set of rules and pay whichever sum is higher typically the very wealthy dont get hit by the amt because their regular income tax liability tends to be higher although the bulk of filers who pay the amt have incomes above &# a year rep richard neal d mass tapped by mr rangel as the house democrats point man on the issue declined to comment on what specific direction he wants to take on the amt saying only that he is seeking an "egalitarian" approach mr neal has in the past proposed eliminating the amt altogether and making up for the lost revenue with graduated income tax increases for households with incomes of &# a year or higher theres broad agreement in congress that something should be done about the amt for the past six years with a republican majority lawmakers have voted to exempt millions of people from paying the tax keeping the number of people affected by amt at less than four million but this year house democrats have reinstated s era budget rules that lapsed under republicans requiring new tax cuts to be offset by equivalent tax increases or spending cuts senate democrats have indicated they will do the same and that in turn is leading to the bigger debate about the bush tax cuts democrats are gearing up to make the case that many middle class families wouldnt fully benefit from those tax cuts because of the amt and thus its a matter of fairness to modify the amt possibly by undoing some of those cuts many democrats say the bush cuts are the biggest factor in making middle class people more likely to pay the amt some republicans meanwhile say that its illogical to make amt relief contingent on raising taxes to offset lost revenues since congress has been rescuing most people from amt expansion anyway those points will be a major focus of a series of hearings next month by the select revenue subcommittee of house ways and means "there are a lot of people who never really benefit from the bush tax cuts " says mr neal who is chairman of the panel "there will be a full acknowledgement that is the case " reps rangel neal and others say the people in their states are acutely aware of the threat of the amt despite the repeated patches passed by congress in westchester county which covers several new york democrats congressional districts county executive andrew spanos financial adviser recently warned him he might be hit this year by the amt mr spano who is married and has a salary of &# has been urging action in washington to rein in the amt in the past mr spano hasnt been personally affected by the tax "im not happy about it but im in better shape than most " he says even people with seemingly high incomes may have trouble paying the amt in areas like westchester county where the cost of living is high he adds one self described "plain vanilla taxpayer" who mr neals office offered as an example is maggie rauh a year old tax accountant in chicopee mass ms rauh and her husband have three children under and a combined income of &# she tracks their projected tax refund monthly and says she recently was "shocked" to find out they would be subject to the amt "i sat here at my computer and my jaw dropped " says ms rauh "i was outraged " ms rauh who usually votes republican says she was happy about recent income tax cuts passed by congress especially the bigger credits provided for each child but with the amt "im losing any kind of gain i got " ms rauh says the rauhs say they will owe a projected &# this year because of the amt compared with the &# they would have owed under the regular income tax "that &# is our vacation our trip to disney " ms rauh says according to a recent report by the congressional research service households with incomes as low as &# to &# could be hit with the amt this year taxpayers at the lower end of the income range include those claiming three or more children for married couples with two children and an income of &# of the value of the bush tax cuts or &# would be lost to the amt that "take back" effect is higher more than or &# for people with incomes of &# to &# and two children the report said mr neal plans to suggest possible solutions to mr rangel by april "were going to have to get together and find out what is the political power of million people over those that will get hurt " says mr rangel "which i dont think is a big problem "
