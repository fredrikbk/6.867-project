breakingviews financial insight bud inbev suds synergy talk of giant beer merger holds up on strategic level busches would lose clout anheuser busch and inbev are made for each other a merger of the u s brewer with its european rival raised in the brazilian press yesterday would make strategic and financial sense so whats the hitch aside from potential antitrust hurdles control could be one though neither side is talking the busch family would play second fiddle in such a combination but if buds board represents the interests of shareholders it shouldnt let this get in the way of a deal consider the strategic logic inbev is a heavyweight in europe and latin america but struggling to make a dent in the u s with brands such as stella artois and brahma in its stable however it has an emerging presence in the premium beer segment which is growing faster than the market for standard suds such as bud anheuser busch meantime controls half the u s market but has little international presence it could pump inbevs higher priced beers through its massive u s distribution system inbev could do the same with the budweiser brand overseas where some beer connoisseurs may be aghast to learn it is considered a premium import financially the two companies are practically mirror images buds &# billion stock market value is just a smidgen below inbevs both trade at about times expected per share earnings a merger would allow for their shareholders to equally indulge on the synergies based on previous beer industry deals they could squeeze out at least &# billion of savings over time the net value after taxes may be some &# billion for investors today or on top of the current bud share price for the busch family which calls the shots at anheuser despite owning just a sliver of stock there is one drawback in a merger at current prices it would own just of the company inbevs belgian and brazilian backers would own a third that doesnt mean a deal is out of the question in its most recent bond offering bud didnt include language that would complicate any change of control more than half of recent investment grade bonds sold by nonfinancial companies contained such provisions this might not signal a change of heart but it is one less excuse standing in the way buds directors would be remiss if they didnt explore an inbev deal icahn vs the index carl icahns time warner campaign fell short of its mark the billionaire activist was rebuffed by shareholders after presenting an ambitious plan to break up the media giant last year mr icahn is now offloading some of his stake for a tidy profit but after paying huge fees investors in his hedge fund would likely have done just as well by putting their money in a low cost index fund according to regulatory filings icahn management lp unloaded million time warner shares in the fourth quarter given the year end share price of around &# the proceeds might have topped &# million the stake was accumulated in late and and probably cost around &# a share mr icahn declined to comment but that would work out to a profit or about &# million that is a nice gain but consider the fees because mr icahns services dont come cheap his annual fee and cut of profits are high even by hedge fund standards management fees on this stake would have lopped off about &# million after another &# million for mr icahns share of the capital gains the profit that flows through to investors is probably less than &# million that is a return of around on their original investment which is roughly in line with the s&amp p over the same period star managers who can charge huge fees such as mr icahn do well even when they make mediocre stock picks the lesson here is that running a hedge fund can be a lot more lucrative than investing in one rob cox and john christy this column is written by breakingviews com an online financial commentary site
