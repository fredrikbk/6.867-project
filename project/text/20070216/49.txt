how two scandals might overlap german investigators look for links between seimens russian telecom minister two of europes highest profile corruption scandals may be related a german probe of alleged corruption involving russias telecommunications minister is overlapping with a separate german investigation of suspected bribery at siemens ag prosecutors in munich are reviewing business transactions between siemens and russian telecom companies particularly those allegedly affiliated with telecom minister leonid reiman people familiar with the matter say siemens is embroiled in a broader cross border corruption scandal related to allegations that the company for years paid bribes to win lucrative contracts meanwhile a separate german criminal investigation is examining mr reiman a close friend and ally of russian president vladimir putin for suspected corruption siemens based in munich in december said it had uncovered about &# million in suspicious transactions stretching back seven years that disclosure came after more than german police raided offices and homes of siemens employees in mid november arresting several people linked to the companys telecom equipment business in a search warrant for siemens management offices issued in october german prosecutors said siemens officials may have paid bribes to unnamed russian bureaucrats in the telecom sector which mr reiman has regulated since the alleged payments could constitute possible large scale corruption and tax evasion according to the search warrant two of siemenss largest telecom customers in russia are companies that frankfurt prosecutors are examining in their fraud investigation that probe which began in focuses on whether officials at german bank commerzbank ag helped mr reiman disguise financial holdings in the russian telecom industry to date there have been no specific allegations of illicit payments made by siemens to entities affiliated with mr reiman or any other russian firm frankfurt prosecutors havent filed charges spokesmen for the munich and frankfurt prosecutors offices declined to comment a siemens spokesman said the company knows mr reiman only in his role as russias telecom minister the spokesman added that siemens isnt aware of any probe in russia into the companys business dealings he reiterated that the company is cooperating fully with german prosecutors the german criminal investigations are both politically sensitive and potentially explosive they come at a time of mounting tension between russia and the west mr putins critics have denounced his administration as riddled with corruption but many governments are reluctant to confront moscow owing to its control of vast energy resources and to the countrys critical role in efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to forge middle east peace agreements the u s federal bureau of investigation responding to a recent request from prosecutors in frankfurt is examining records of several u s shell companies allegedly used by the ipoc group a multibillion dollar telecom empire allegedly controlled by mr reiman german prosecutors in frankfurt made the request late last year say people familiar with the matter the question of whether mr reiman secretly controls ipoc which owns russian telecom assets valued at billions of dollars has spawned a range of criminal investigations and court litigation the allegations grow out of a bitter business dispute in russia over one of ipocs main assets a stake in mobile phone company oao megafon that is also claimed by russias alfa group much of siemenss growth in russia came from vendor financing and equipment sales to megafon a privately owned company in which mr reiman indirectly owns a major stake according to witness statements in the frankfurt probe megafon russias third largest mobile phone company was cobbled together by associates of mr reiman in and awarded a coveted global system for mobile communications or gsm license when he was telecom minister a large stake in megafon eventually became the key asset in the ipoc group megafon signed at least &# million of equipment supply contracts with siemens between and according to company financial statements and announcements mr reiman has vehemently denied ownership of ipoc a company spokeswoman reiterated that position his former lawyer and business partner danish national jeffrey galmond has said he is the sole owner of the group which originally registered with bermuda regulators in as a collection of mutual funds a spokesman for ipoc didnt return calls seeking comment in may a zurich civil arbitration panel hearing the megafon dispute found that mr reiman is "the sole beneficial owner" of the ipoc group and that his denials to the contrary "have no credibility " it said mr reiman had engaged in corrupt and illegal acts during his government tenure in order to build and protect his secret telecom empire the tribunal also concluded that mr galmond had provided "false testimony " ipoc has appealed that ruling russian prosecutors have said they have found no evidence connecting mr reiman to ipoc or any corrupt activity ipoc is under fresh legal pressure in bermuda financial regulators last week asked the islands supreme court to liquidate the ipoc companies for unspecified regulatory infractions such a move could greatly hobble ipocs efforts to defend itself and its shareholders in related criminal cases police in bermuda and the british virgin islands are also stepping up their inquiries of suspected money laundering by the ipoc group following recent moves to liquidate the company people involved in those inquiries said russia plays an important role in the unfolding siemens scandal at least three suspects have alleged in witness statements to prosecutors that bribes were paid by siemens in russia according to a review of their statements the three former high level siemens executives including the german governments star witness michael kutschenreuter were involved in russian telecom sales siemens began dismantling its struggling telecom equipment business formerly its largest unit in but russia generated significant sales for information &amp communications networks a former unit that sold switching gear for traditional land line phone systems and is now at the center of the corruption inquiry in may icn secured a &# million contract from a russian government controlled phone company svyazinvest by virtue of his being telecom minister mr reiman is chairman of that firm which acts as a purchaser for much of russias fixed line telecom equipment today siemens is one of russias leading providers of fixed line and mobile phone gear it also sells telecom equipment to a broad range of other companies siemenss position owes much to a series of deals the company made with entities the swiss panel concluded are controlled by messrs reiman and galmond thus far no evidence has emerged to suggest these deals were corrupt much of the russian telephone industrys equipment acquisitions are overseen by mr reimans ministry and most of russias fixed line telephone service providers are majority owned by svyazinvest to centralize the purchase and financing of telecom equipment svyazinvest gave that business to a subsidiary called rtc leasing rtc was privatized in a complicated transaction that left a group of companies affiliated with ipoc as its majority owner in early rtc nonetheless retained its role as a major intermediary for equipment leasing today rtcs major stockholders include two offshore companies mr galmond also claims to own rtc also arranged telecom equipment deals for megafon thomas ganswindt who ran the siemens telecom gear unit at the time icn won its &# million deal said at a signing ceremony that the deal made siemens "the leading supplier for switching systems in the russian federation " mr ganswindt who left siemens in september was arrested by german police on suspicion of fraud in december mr ganswindt who was later released has denied any wrongdoing he remains a suspect both mr kutschenreuter who oversaw the finances of a siemens division involved in russian telecom sales and another suspect who allegedly organized some illicit payments reinhard siekaczek have alleged in witness statements that siemenss former top mobile phone executive rudi lamprecht knew of an alleged system of slush funds and bribes according to a review of their statements mr lamprecht now a member of siemenss management board whose responsibilities include oversight of russia has denied any wrongdoing through a spokesman he added he has no knowledge of any wrongdoing in russia mike esterl contributed to
