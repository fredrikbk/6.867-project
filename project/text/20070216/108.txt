the morning brief why guineans strife may get more attention online edition the wall street journal online off most americans radar the west african nation of guinea is under martial law with dozens of people killed by rioting and demonstrators clashes with security forces but the violence has sent aluminum prices climbing in yet another reminder of how much the global economy relies on resources under the territory of developing countries which often get little attention in the capitals of their industrial counterparts president lansana conte put the military in charge monday and ordered a curfew that keeps most guineans indoors for most of the day after more than a year of unrest over a collapsing economy that has made it hard for average guineans to get their hands on the likes of rice and gasoline the protests mounted last week amid a general strike after mr conte appointed a close associate as prime minister violating a power sharing agreement in the eyes of union and opposition leaders at least people have been killed in the resulting violence and meetings between the two sides have failed to make progress the associated press reports repression of the demonstrations has "shown the regime will do anything to ensure its survival " according to the international crisis group the brussels based ngo calls on the "largely quiet and absent" international community "to react urgently to help produce real change if chaos that could well spread beyond guineas borders is to be prevented " guineas immediate neighbors include the fragile regimes in liberia

all but undisputed conventional wisdom that vladimir putin will get to pick his successor for the russian presidency next year thanks to his unequaled popularity and a ruthless pruning of democratic institutions that have left him with a firm grip over all branches of the far flung government so his promotion of defense minister sergei ivanov a former kgb officer like mr putin to the rank of deputy prime minister has been picked apart the way kremlinologists studied politburo seating charts in the soviet days mr ivanov now has the same rank as the apparently rival presidential contender dmitri medvedev who also happens to be chairman of state owned gas monopoly gazprom "the move which went largely unexplained like most of mr putins actions is certain to intensify speculation over which of the two might have the upper hand for mr putins endorsement " as the new york times puts it on the same day mr putin also dismissed the president of the once breakaway republic of chechnya a
