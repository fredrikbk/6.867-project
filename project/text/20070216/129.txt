weekend journal taste de gustibus hardback mountain the kiss off i was once told by an old graybeard was he a teacher at school an uncle in madras alas i cant remember that a cultured man should have very few friends but very many books i must have been a youngish mite at the time for i feel that ive carried the imprint of those words for as long as ive been sentient as my friends all two and a half of them will testify ive remained true to the first part of the sages dictum and my wife bless her and bless also her fortitude will leap to give evidence that ive not merely been faithful to its second half but have complied with its dictates in a manner that might easily be described as fervid a veritable katrina of books deluges the two places we call home and a day seldom goes by without my slinking in the front door with even more of the darn things in the pockets of my trenchcoat and so as my wife might have said of my books had walt whitman not said it first "wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and forever outward " my recent suggestion that we have a handyperson come around to put bookshelves in the last unshelved room in the brooklyn apartment the master bedroom was met with an opera perfect rendition of the riot act so imagine my consternation when on having to pack up the contents of my office last week i start a new job at the journal and must park myself in a new cubicle with fewer shelves i was faced with a devilish question what to do with the books id accumulated there these last four years books numbering conservatively well into four figures seduction is a reliable path out of domestic cul de sacs so i decided to try it on my wife all for the sake of my books grandparents enlisted to take our young son for the night i proceeded to cook a nifty meal for two to be gargled back with a brace of bottles of her favorite red lesprit des pavot from the peter michael winery in calistoga wine buffs will know how hard it is to score this stuff and i can only hint at the abundance of books i might have purchased with the funds i had to set aside for the vino and then halfway through dinner with the mood suitably softback i popped the question "love " i said sincerely but not unmindful of the words diplomatic possibilities "do you er mind the wines good isnt it er may i bring a pile of books home from the office " she brusquely actuarial "how many " he now a quivering wreck "oh i think about " she for there is a god and he enabled a munificent compromise "how about and not one book more " and thus began a process with which i have grown as a man who has led a peripatetic life heartbrokenly familiar you take root someplace then a call comes from fortune herself and you move on to another place and since there is no moving on without a leaving behind you teach yourself to discard you cannot take everything with you even the scriptures say that though in respect only of the last passage so acquaintances clothes furniture pictures all must be culled as too must books whose loss can sometimes weigh most heavily of all some measure out their lives with coffee spoons i do so with books left behind in such places as delhi oxford london and madrid i stood in my office beside my wall of books and sifted as gold miners do looking for what to keep and what to throw over my shoulder gold is a good measure in these things for unless one sets standards ruthlessly one can be distracted easily from the truths of onward movement "why did i want that book in the first place " and "can i live without that book " are my tests my cyanide solution to separate the aureate book from the dispensable take "industrial landscapes " a big book of ghostly and quite affecting pictures of abandoned factories in the ruhr valley did i really need to bear that home with me or that new hardback novel by a "gifted deft and luminous" i quote from the blurb on the dustjacket trinidadian writer must i keep it or that bantam classic edition of "leaves of grass " its a handy size for subway reading but dont i already have about eight different editions of the whitman at home not counting complete works etc only a few books are slam dunk discards "secrets of longevity hundreds of ways to live to be " by one dr maoshing ni a th generation doctor of chinese medicine was one such what could i have been thinking when i elected to take it from this newspapers books for review giveaway pile could it have been on a morning on which i was hung over a cameo of mortality playing before bloodshot eyes "sleep like a deer " the doctor exhorts on one page "no raw foods" in winter he says on another bye bye book such books are an exception most are like "love after war " a selection of contemporary fiction from vietnam certainly i could go through life without opening it and not be dismissed except fastidiously as poorly read that said the philistinism in its abandonment is plain to see but is a cruel number remorselessly rounded and inflexible and the tome had to give way along with many others there is in all this sloughing off a sense that im sinning in some way and that the old graybeard who taught me to hold fast to books would have disapproved quite thoroughly easy enough for him of course for it is not he who must abide by another greater dictum what the wife says the husband does and the wife has here her reasons after all we do need room for the childrens beds and a dining table and other things now regarded as essential in a well tended home but im reminded as i write of those bitter words of joseph brodsky who died in a house just a stones throw from mine "there are worse crimes than burning books one of them is not reading them " where i wonder would he have ranked the act of leaving them behind
