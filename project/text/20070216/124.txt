weekend journal review books how the grid became great grand avenues by scott w berg pantheon books pages &# city planning in the u s has generally been the creature of expediency rather than artistry the ubiquitous grid iron providing a quick and easy way to promote real estate development the chief exception and what an exception is washington d c the plan of the national capital is comparable in ambition and scope to pope sixtus vs replanning of rome in the th century peter the greats creation of st petersburg in the early th century and napoleon iiis reconfiguration of paris in the s the credit for this belongs chiefly to george washington and to the frenchman he commissioned to design the new city pierre charles lenfant lenfant is often referred to as a military engineer or an architect but by training he was neither he studied painting at the royal academy of painting and sculpture in paris and was destined to follow in the footsteps of his academicien father when in for reasons unexplained the year old art student joined a group of french volunteers headed to the american war of independence as scott berg vividly describes in "grand avenues " lt "longfont" had a good war he was with the continental army at valley forge where he met and painted a portrait of george washington he became part of von steubens retinue illustrating the barons army drill manual no desk man he saw action in savannah and charleston and ended the war with the rank of major an honorable limp many influential friends von steuben alexander hamilton james monroe john marshall and a firm resolve to find fame and fortune in his adopted country as a result of designing the setting for a franco american fete in philadelphia and transforming new yorks city hall into federal hall for washingtons presidential inauguration lenfant acquired a reputation as an architect how did he become the planner of the new nations new capital the site of what would become the district of columbia had been settled but not the precise location and form of the city itself the president asked lenfant to investigate the area along the potomac between georgetown and the mouth of what is now the anacostia river in order to identify the best locations for important public buildings the resourceful frenchman jumped at the opportunity and in three weeks prepared a rough sketch washington liked it and asked for more it took lenfant only months to produce a full fledged plan the ambitious design which encompassed no less than acres dramatically exploited the topography of the site the meeting place for congress was on the highest spot capitol hill and the presidents house on a ridge overlooking the potomac a long promenade the mall was positioned on a flat terrace between the two the streets laid out in the gridded american fashion were overlaid by broad diagonal avenues linking squares one for each state in the union the plan mr berg observes "displayed all the sophistication of the european baroque in combination with a good dose of george washingtons republican sensibilities " washington a trained surveyor and a gifted amateur architect fully appreciated lenfants accomplishment and approved the plan despite secretary of state thomas jeffersons lukewarm endorsement lenfant expected to design the congress house and the presidents house but six months later something unexpected happened he was fired the reasons were many lenfant was a masterly planner but lacked the training necessary to organize an undertaking of this scale and he produced delays at several critical junctures nor did he understand the exigencies of american democratic politics to him the artists word should be absolute high handed and arrogant lenfant managed to offend almost everyone at one time or another local landowners jefferson who schemed mightily against him and finally his long suffering patron washington as mr berg recounts the rest of lenfants life was a ruinous decline caused in part by bad luck and in part by his own stubborn pride thanks to monroe he was offered a teaching post at west point but he turned it down he died a pauper in his contribution to the planning of the capital entirely forgotten his reputation was revived in when a new york tribune journalist discovered a trunk with lenfants private papers shortly after his faded original plan of was resurrected and a facsimile published finally in his exhumed body was ceremoniously interred at arlington any biographer of lenfant labors under several constraints many documents such as his first sketch of the city and a preliminary design that george washington reviewed have disappeared we dont know what influenced lenfants ideas of planning or exactly how he arrived at his inspired design and there is very little evidence to illuminate the personal life of this singular character who never married and who remains something of a cipher but mr berg overcomes such constraints with ease he scrupulously reviews the historical record makes informed guesses where he can and expertly guides the reader through the details of this fascinating and momentous story mr rybczynski teaches at the university of pennsylvanias school of design his new book on real estate development "last harvest " will be published in april
