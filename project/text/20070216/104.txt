the afternoon report burned rubber online edition anyone searching for a current case study in u s manufacturing woes need look no further than goodyear tire &amp rubber during its fourth quarter the company dealt with soaring costs brutal competition and a production crippling strike when the rubber met the road goodyear was left with a loss of &# million or &# a share the strike by the united steelworkers that dragged on from early october to early january cost the company some &# million or &# a share at the same time that prices for core materials like rubber and petroleum were surging goodyear was able to offset some of that compression by jacking up its tire prices revenue increased about to &# billion even as tire volume declined due to the strike and the companys shedding of private label business for the first time in the companys long history its annual sales topped &# billion some on wall street had hoped for better analysts at bank of america thought quarterly sales would increase to &# billion as consumers who had driven their radials until the steel poked through would finally be forced to suck it up and slap fresh tires on their rides chief executive robert j keegan said given all it had been through the company "made outstanding progress " but traders sent its shares which hit a week high last week down most intriguing to many is the deal that the company struck with its workers on health care under the pact goodyear agreed to transfer its &# billion health care liability to a fund managed by the steelworkers union and place &# billion in cash and equity in the fund the payout is massive but it frees the company from paying benefits in the future the arrangement reflects a growing push to transfer management of employee benefits to labor unions and for companies such as the big three auto makers it may be a path out of their own seemingly intractable health cost problems indeed gm has said that it has "more than a passing interest" in the goodyear arrangement stuck with "junk" credit ratings detroits auto giants may have a hard time scrounging up the cash to fund such a huge transfer and the united auto workers might shrink from taking on the responsibility for fear of being the bad guy if the time comes to slash benefits but the sides agree that some kind of bandage is needed detroit and the uaw will start talks on a new contract this september goodyear noted that its raw material costs rose an estimated &# million from a year ago during the fourth quarter surging rubber and petroleum prices were the main culprit but analysts think those pressures will abate somewhat in months ahead and indeed a report out this morning from the labor department on january wholesale prices supports the view that pricing pressures in the supply chain are starting to let up amid a drop in the main producer price index raw materials prices plunged and intermediate goods prices slid thats certainly good news for companies like goodyear that have been punished by volatile commodity prices to be sure lower inputs have a cost too slimmer prices are evidence of slowing demand and that writes bnp paribas economist richard iley "means that corporate pricing power is fading " winning streak fizzles for stocks after three straight daily gains the dow jones industrial average simmered down this morning sliding about points to on some
