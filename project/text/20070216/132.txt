weekend journal tastings the wild world of australian shiraz trying under &# wine we find delights dogs beware critter labels its hard to believe now but when we conducted our first tasting of australian shiraz in we had trouble putting together a large sample that was before australian wines led by shiraz and chardonnay took over the world and the shelves of wine shops shiraz has become so popular that it has helped spark interest in syrah same grape different name all over the globe for a time inexpensive australian shiraz was a reliable everyday wine it was fun affordable easy to drink and great with informal food but quality has suffered over the years in our most recent broad blind tasting in we found most inexpensive shiraz unimpressive simple sometimes sweet and not very pleasant worse we found that most of them basically tasted the same which certainly isnt fun australian wines have peaked since then imports into the u s barely rose last year theres a lake of surplus wine in australia inexpensive chardonnay from australia has been deeply disappointing in our most recent tastings so we wondered what would all this mean for inexpensive shiraz we bought the first we saw on store shelves to find out we focused on the most recent vintages and because those are the ones you are most likely to see our sample included the familiar names of course but also some less usual suspects about half the wines in our tasting had critter labels australian winemakers have led the way in cute labels but weve generally found that kangaroos dogs birds and other animals are not good indicators of the quality of wine inside the bottle we tasted the wines in blind flights over several nights we completed our tasting with very mixed feelings the good news was very good indeed the best under &# shiraz is better than it was a few years ago in the past we felt you could tell the difference between expensive and inexpensive shiraz with a simple whiff the less expensive wines even the good ones smelled and tasted like raspberries simple quaffable and in some cases better chilled they were pleasant but not special we found that shiraz over &# and expensive shiraz such as penfolds grange is after all what originally put australia on the map of the wine world was a much different taste darker richer with pepper and other spices and a very interesting black core in this tasting we are happy to report we found that those interesting dark fruit tastes have migrated to the lower end in some cases several of the wines we tried tasted like more expensive shiraz with rich deep fruit good acidity some intensity peppery flavors and a serious dark look theyd be excellent with your best steak our favorites are listed in the attached index we disagreed so thoroughly on the best of tasting however that were presenting competing best of tastings as always its impossible to know which wines you will see in your store but our notes will give you an idea of what the good ones taste like and what bargains they can be "can be" is the operative phrase however the bad news as it turned out was very bad the overwhelming number of wines we tasted were simple forgettable and tasted pretty much exactly the same as each other few were terrible but few were better than ok but heres the weirdest thing they tasted more like "wine" than wine most tasted lab made and watery as if various flavorings charred wood blackberry or black cherry sauce a little sugar a splash of lemon and some alcohol had been blended with water to make them the wines tasted like water in the front then tasted like the component parts in the middle of our mouths and then when swallowed disappeared again into a taste of water it was an entirely phony taste if not entirely unpleasant the bottom line wed say is that the aisle of inexpensive shiraz continues to be a pretty scary place we wouldnt simply pick up a new one and try it because the chances of success are low but there are good ones out there at low prices if you have a reliable wine merchant who can steer you to the ones with true tastes and away from the ones that taste like purple water you can find a winner oh and one other thing might be worth keeping in mind of our eight favorites not a single one had an animal on the label dont forget that saturday feb is open that bottle night when all of us will finally pop the cork on that wine thats always too special to open if youd like to know more about otbn drop us a note at wine wsj com and we will send you our recent column the dow jones inexpensive shiraz index in a
