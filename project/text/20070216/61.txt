irans smoking guns following the weekend intelligence disclosures about iranian supplied weapons killing gis in iraq we predicted tuesday that "a large part of washington will pretend the evidence doesnt exist or suggest the intelligence isnt proven or claim that its all the bush administrations fault for bullying iran " sure enough president bush faced a barrage of questions wednesday wondering whether senior iranian leaders were really aware of the weapons transfers whether he was using "faulty intelligence " and whether the disclosures were part of a strategy designed to "provoke iran " so here is the state of our public discourse american military officials present prima facie evidence of iranian weapons implicated in killing u s soldiers and wounding more and washingtons main concern is not for the gis but in refighting the last intelligence war well heres an item that doesnt seem to have been manufactured by dick cheney according to a report in britains daily telegraph u s forces in baghdad have recently discovered high powered sniper rifles made by austrian gun maker steyr mannlicher the caliber steyr can accurately fire an armor piercing round at a range of meters the weapon is good against humvees helicopters and body armor in iran purchased some steyrs allegedly for use against drug traffickers at the time both u s and british officials urged the austrian government to bar the &# million sale fearing the weapons would fall into enemy hands former austrian chancellor wolfang schussel thought otherwise and let the deal go forward to better grease the skids then steyr mannlicher ceo wolfgang furlinger made the case that the weapons were basically harmless and that tehran had signed "end user certificates" guaranteeing they would not be re sold according to the german newsweekly der spiegel today the austrian government pleads that the sale had been "checked very thoroughly " and that "what happened to the weapons is the responsibility of the iranians" which prompts the question of why the austrians would have bothered with the end user certificates the bush administration took a less cavalier view and in banned steyr mannlicher from bidding for u s government contracts it remains to be confirmed whether the serial numbers on the steyrs found in iraq match those from the sale if they do it ought to prompt a top to bottom review of all austrian military contracts meantime is it too much to expect american journalists and members of congress to devote as much skepticism to irans motives and behavior as they do to mr bushs see related letter "letters to the editor we dont want our guns used in iraq" wsj march
