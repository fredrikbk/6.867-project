the race to update tech gear by does your computer know that congress changed daylight saving times lawmakers have lengthened daylight saving time so that it will begin three weeks earlier this year than it used to the idea is to shrink the hours between sunset and bedtime so that people will reduce the amount of electricity they use at home thereby saving energy now try explaining that to your computer the energy policy act of meant to improve energy efficiency included an item that called for "springing ahead" earlier than usual and "falling back" later than usual starting in that means daylight saving time will now begin on the second sunday of march instead of the first sunday of april but the programs that run on personal computers and handheld devices such as blackberrys were built assuming that daylight saving time would always kick in on the same weekend the upshot to avoid broader time related troubles some computer users will now have to scramble to update their software programs internal clocks if the dilemma sounds familiar thats because it is in the late s technology experts warned that computers could reset their clocks to the year when the year arrived causing "yk" havoc for electrical utilities phone carriers and other software users this time experts say any potential damage is likely to be less severe at worst programs will be off by an hour not a century and because computer users have been through a much more daunting version of this already theyre better prepared to handle such glitches at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc are in the process of updating their software to deal with the daylight savings shift according to spokesmen for each company the verizon spokesman says there have been two tasks identifying the systems that are involved and applying the necessary updates "its just a matter of going through blow by blow and making sure each system is ready to go " he says there have always been quirks in the way time zones are organized arizona for instance doesnt have daylight saving indiana had to deal with a small scale version of this years problem when it decided to start observing daylight saving last year for the most part computer users can easily change settings in key software programs to account for state to state differences this time consumers and smaller businesses could get hit by troubles such as showing up for a meeting an hour late because a software calendar is operating an hour behind marc charbonneau a year old software developer at a childrens research institute in rochester n y has already had to troubleshoot one daylight saving puzzle his organization had begun patching some of the software it uses when a secretary realized that a recurring appointment scheduled every wednesday at p m on her microsoft outlook calendar was showing up at p m on the weeks between march and april the would be start of daylight saving it turned out the patched software on her pc was trying to communicate with unpatched software elsewhere throwing off the calendar though the problem was ultimately fixed mr charbonneau says the daylight saving change "is definitely the biggest thing thats come up recently " other potential issues are less obvious dave cole director of symantec corp s security response center paints this scenario say a security expert realizes in september that a breach took place at the end of march if the software he uses to pinpoint the timeline of events wasnt updated to account for the change in daylight saving time he could end up with incorrect data that would make it trickier to solve the crime "is it the end of the world not by any stretch of the imagination " says mr cole "is it a pain in the neck you bet " companies from microsoft corp and apple inc to blackberry maker research in motion ltd have crafted special updates to keep their software running without glitches some get sent to computers automatically and some require consumers to download the patches manually consumers who bought a pc this year with microsofts new windows vista operating system have nothing to worry about the software installed on new pcs since late january includes the time change microsoft executives say yet many pcs run older windows xp software which doesnt account for the change some windows xp owners use a microsoft internet service called automatic update that routinely downloads bug fixes and patches to their pcs they should have received a fix on feb microsoft says those that dont use the service will have to get the patch from microsofts web site http update microsoft com microsoft has focused most of its effort on raising awareness about the shift among its business customers last year the company and some partners started running online seminars and other programs to alert companies about the change they included advice on how to inform employees including a suggestion to hang signs on employees office doors to remind them to download the software many large businesses already have systems for delivering bug fixes and other software updates to their pcs microsoft expects those customers will include the daylight saving software in their routine updates says microsoft vice president rich kaplan users of apple macintoshes running the two most recent versions of the mac os x operating system known as tiger and panther have already automatically received software updates to their computers over the internet to reflect the daylight saving change the company says for people with older versions of the mac os x operating system apple suggests manually adjusting the date and time preferences for the computers clock intuit inc which makes software for personal finance and tax preparation and symantec a security software maker say their software for home pc users bases its time related functions on the clock in the operating system its customers use that means users of software like intuits quicken accounting software and symantecs norton security programs can make sure those programs dont run into daylight saving issues by ensuring that their operating systems are properly updated the daylight saving issue could also affect users of handheld devices blackberry maker rim for instance is encouraging blackberry users to download a patch from its web site http www blackberry com select dst that will fix the problem most big companies typically handle such updates for their employees but those who use personal blackberrys for nonwork tasks are expected to download the patch themselves otherwise a blackberrys calendar could be off by an hour for the weeks between the new daylight saving start date and the old one users of tivos probably wont need to worry a spokesman for tivo inc says the company has already sent out a software update to all tivo digital video recorders which connect to the companys computers at least once daily to receive fresh television program schedules in the end much of this fuss could be for naught microsofts mr kaplan points out the energy policy acts "right to revert" provision says that congress can move daylight saving time back to the old schedule once it reviews the impact of the change on energy consumption "so stay tuned " he says nick wingfield and peter grant contributed to this article
