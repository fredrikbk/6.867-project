bearing down probes of backdating move to faster track stock option emails at broadcom are focus monster worldwide plea on jan the chief financial officer of broadcom corp tapped out an email about stock options to his chief executive and others "i very strongly recommend that these options be priced as of december " he wrote they were and that was fortunate for recipients broadcoms share price rose between the two dates the pretense that the options had been granted on the earlier date made them extra valuable it also violated the rationale of stock options they give recipients a right to buy stock in the future at the price when the options are granted so that recipients can profit only if the price of their companys stock goes up setting a lower "exercise price" for the options gives recipients a head start on profiting the broadcom correspondence found in an internal investigation at the maker of communication chips is just one of a number internal documents that have drawn the attention of federal prosecutors and federal bureau of investigation agents in orange county calif prosecutors are strongly considering filing criminal charges against the former broadcom chief financial officer who wrote the email william j ruehle and at least one other former executive according to people familiar with the situation mr ruehles lawyer said his client didnt break the law the broadcom probe is a sign of how long running investigations of stock options backdating are heating up yesterday a former general counsel of monster worldwide inc pleaded guilty to securities fraud in federal court in manhattan the day before the founder of take two interactive software inc pleaded guilty to a new york state charge in a backdating scheme prosecutors in a half dozen jurisdictions are zeroing in on other cases the filing of criminal charges in some of these in coming months would mark a watershed in the scandal as prosecutors and regulators winnow the roster of some companies with options problems to a tighter list of promising cases the government is nearing charges against a former official of computer security company mcafee inc say people familiar with the situation and is strongly considering bringing cases against ex executives of apple inc and semiconductor equipment maker kla tencor corp in st louis at least one former executive of engineered support systems inc a defense contractor now owned by drs technologies inc of parsippany n j has been told of a likely charge says a person close to the matter the former monster worldwide general counsel who pleaded guilty yesterday is myron olesnyckyj he admitted that he and others conspired to systematically backdate stock options inflate the companys earnings and mislead auditors separately the securities and exchange commission filed a civil complaint against him mr olesnyckyj agreed to forfeit &# in personal gains he faces sentencing in august mr olesnyckyj fired last year is expected to cooperate with prosecutors investigating monster founder andrew mckelvey mr mckelvey who hasnt been charged quit late last year rather than be interviewed in an internal company probe of options a lawyer for him declined to comment in a email cited by the government mr olesnyckyj wrote to a human resources official "no written document should ever state lowest price over next days the auditorw sic will view that as backdating options and well have a charge to earning in the amount of the difference between price on day and any lower price which is used " thats the type of evidence investigators are looking for "plus factors" that can give a case more promise of success such factors might include written indications of deliberate backdating falsified documents efforts to hide manipulation from auditors or investigators or indications that top executives gave themselves backdated options with so many companies admitting to an improper options practice investigators have an abundance of possible cases broadcom illustrates some of the elements investigators are focusing on as they set their priorities the irvine calif company is one of the biggest companies in the options spotlight it makes chips that help power all sorts of communications devices and has a stock market value of more than &# billion the sec in addition to the justice department is looking at broadcom also being investigated are henry nicholas the former chief executive to whom the cfos email was addressed and henry samueli broadcoms chairman messrs nicholas and samueli co founded broadcom the two made up the committee that handed out options broadcom has admitted were backdated mr nicholas said in a statement his focus was on running broadcom and "the minutiae of employee paper work and documentation were not at the top of my list " mr samuelis attorney declined to comment except to say that some of the journals information was "misleading " mr nicholas founded the company in with help from mr samueli his former engineering professor after they took it public in its stock soared fold in two years together the men sold more than &# billion in broadcom shares near the end of the tech boom each still holds about &# billion of broadcom stock a domineering figure mr nicholas routinely scheduled late night staff meetings and boasted of working for days without sleep at a yearly sales conference he quizzed subordinates about chip designs forcing those who erred to gulp down shots of hard liquor he stepped down from his ceo post in along the way he settled into a square foot mansion which he outfitted with a billionaires toys waterfalls secret tunnels into the hills a sports bar mr samueli cuts a less flamboyant figure a leading philanthropist in orange county he also owns the mighty ducks hockey franchise two university of california engineering schools bear his name last year broadcom admitted rampant backdating it restated several years of results taking &# billion in charges against earnings the biggest restatement so far in the scandal mr ruehle stepped down as broadcoms chief financial officer a few days before he was to be interviewed by outside lawyers doing the internal investigation broadcom said in a securities filing that mr ruehle was "at the center" of backdating mr ruehles lawyer richard marmaro said that if his client is charged he "will not plead guilty because he did not commit any crime " broadcom in its filing also blamed a former human resources chief nancy tullos it said she "encouraged assisted in and enabled" the backdating a lawyer for ms tullos who left in declined to comment for this article the lawyer has said previously that ms tullos followed the directives of superiors didnt select any grant dates and always acted in the companys best interests broadcoms backdating which it has said occurred from to took place amid a gyrating stock price and a heated technology industry in which valued employees were often poached by others with big options packages broadcom emails described by people who have seen them suggest that executives sometimes deliberately gave grants earlier dates and sometimes cautioned others not to mention the dating process in writing broadcoms auditor ernst &amp young raised concerns in about an aspect of the options process and reminded executives about the rules say people familiar with the matter at that time options granted at the current stock price didnt affect companies earnings but a grant at below market prices was considered compensation so that companies had to count it as an expense in broadcom made a giant options grant to a large number of employees purportedly on a day in may when the stock had its lowest close for the quarter ernst discovered that the company hadnt finished divvying up the grant among employees until months later accounting rules say an option isnt recorded as granted until recipients are determined ernst warned company officials including mr ruehle not to make such "subsequent allocations" again according to people familiar with the matter ernst reminded executives of how options should be accounted for taking them through the rules like many stocks broadcoms sank after the sept terrorist attacks it hit its lowest price in three years on oct before recovering and then more than doubling by year end broadcom claimed to have granted a slew of options to non officers on oct investigators are looking at whether the company may actually have made this grant later and backdated it say people familiar with the situation broadcom said in its federal filing that co founder mr nicholas was "at times" involved in the backdating and bore a large responsibility for the problems because of "the tone and style of doing business he set " a person familiar with the grant dated oct said it engendered jealousy among those who didnt get options then and that mr nicholas and others appear to have retroactively added more people to the list in an email on jan mr nicholas sent a list of employees included in the oct grant to at least two people including ms tullos say people familiar with the emails contents "i found my old share grant spreadsheet from before october " he wrote but the electronic time stamp on the computer file indicated the spreadsheet had been created toward the end of long after oct say people familiar with the matter the discrepancy has led investigators to examine whether the email and spreadsheet might be an attempt to provide written cover for manipulated grants broadcom said in its federal filing that co founder mr samueli was "involved with" the "flawed option granting process " the company cleared him saying he "reasonably relied on management and other professionals" regarding proper treatment of the options according to people familiar with the matter mr samueli as a member of the equity award committee received a number of emails that discussed retroactive date selection mr samueli cooperated with the internal probe but so far has declined a request to speak to government investigators unusual for a sitting chairman when weighing how much responsibility corporations themselves bear for fraudulent conduct prosecutors are supposed to consider how cooperative top officials have been according to justice department guidelines an outside lawyer for broadcom said it wouldnt comment on the investigation except to say that it was cooperating fully "dr samueli did cooperate fully and voluntarily with the companys independent internal investigation " said the lawyer david siegel in any effort to link backdating to messrs nicholas and samueli prosecutors would face a potential hurdle the co founders didnt regularly receive option grants themselves the two received just one grant for a million options each in broadcom has said no grants to the founders or to directors were among those misdated ms tullos and mr ruehle by contrast received numerous options including grants the company has said were manipulated mr ruehle had &# million of unexercised options when he left last year the company canceled them last year the company canceled &# million of options ms tullos held several emails written by ms tullos suggest she may have been aware the dating practices were troublesome in a period when broadcoms stock was falling a business unit head repeatedly asked her when his subordinates would get options eventually she told him "i cannot tell you what we are doing" in a "post enron" world according to people familiar with the matter in a message to another employee asking about options she wrote "i cannot answer in writing " prosecutors would need more than suggestive emails to make a successful criminal case a document that seems like a smoking gun can grow cold when the context is explained to a jury by an experienced defense lawyer another obstacle for the government in prosecuting backdating is at some companies the practice was discussed openly making it harder to argue that executives knew they were engaged in wrongful conduct defense lawyers will doubtless pass blame around those representing ceos are likely to argue that their clients being business leaders not accountants relied on others to figure out how options should be issued and accounted for those representing subordinates are likely to argue that the boss made them do it helping boost momentum toward the filing of charges is the statute of limitations its five years for securities fraud and wire fraud but theres some flexibility based on the notion that misdated options might affect earnings in later years paul davies contributed to this article
