fed suggests it is loosening employment inflation link federal reserve officials appear to believe unemployment can go lower than they previously thought without generating inflation a potentially important shift that some economists think could make interest rate increases this year less likely the monetary policy report that fed chairman ben bernanke delivered to congress this week indicated that members of the policy setting federal open market committee now expect a lower unemployment rate this year than they did just seven months ago but they dont expect that to result in higher inflation reduced inflation concerns at the fed and weaker economic data such as a drop in january industrial production reported yesterday have led financial markets to boost expectations the fed will lower its short term interest rate target now later this year fomc members generally expect the unemployment rate to end both this year and next between and essentially unchanged from januarys by contrast julys monetary policy report saw the unemployment rate ending between and that report didnt have a forecast despite forecasting lower unemployment fomc members didnt change their inflation expectations they see core inflation which excludes food and energy as measured by the commerce departments price index of personal consumption ending this year between and the same forecast as july and next year falling further to between and that shift probably reflects the fact that actual unemployment has fallen further than expected last july while inflation has also been a bit lower than expected though not as low as officials would like unemployment generally cant fall to zero even in a robust economy as different industries are always contracting and expanding or because personal characteristics such as disability make it hard for some people to find work fed officials like most economists believe economic growth that pushes joblessness too low can result in companies raising wages to attract scarce workers beyond the productivity of those workers then passing on the higher wage costs in higher prices mr bernanke told congress that putting a number on this "nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment" or nairu is difficult "theres no specific level of employment or unemployment that is a trigger for inflation " moreover fomc forecasts must be interpreted with caution because they are a range of committee members views rather than a single coherent view still there are two possible explanations for the new numbers one is that fed officials have lowered their estimate of nairu perhaps to from said jan hatzius chief u s economist at goldman sachs if so the fed would have "a lower hurdle to easing and a higher hurdle to tightening" monetary policy the other explanation is their estimate of nairu is unchanged but the fed believes lower energy prices and slower rent increases are affecting core inflation more than low unemployment if that is the case the fed might worry that persistent low unemployment could yet push up inflation once those restraining factors subside peter hooper chief economist at deutsche bank securities noted that mr bernankes testimony to congress this week belied more concern about the unemployment rate than the fomc forecast his warning that high "resource utilization" could nudge up inflation suggests he would like to see unemployment edge higher mr hooper said mr hatzius speculated that the forecasts if not signaling a lower nairu might instead signal "a repudiation of the nairu story that you need to generate more unemployment to contain inflation " indeed while fed economists still believe in the nairu they have recently come to believe its influence on inflation has declined while the influence of the publics expectations of inflation governed heavily by where inflation has been has grown but while it may take longer for low unemployment to push up inflation once it did it would be far harder to get inflation down again that could keep the fed biased to raising rates as long as unemployment is low new data suggest that some of the pressure on capacity is starting to ease the fed reported yesterday that output by factories mines and utilities fell in january from december due mostly to a drop in factory production with demand from consumers holding up the output drop appears largely due to efforts by housing motor vehicle and other industries to reduce inventories because of lower production industry operated at of available capacity in january down from in december separately the labor department said the number of people filing initial jobless claims rose by last week to that could be a sign that unemployment may be headed higher though cold weather likely played a role in the jump christopher conkey contributed to this article
