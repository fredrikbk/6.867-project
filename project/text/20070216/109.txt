posting high revenue followed by crashes mixed with high drama under mr dougan a year old american who runs marathons and is known for often working hour days the investment bank has refocused its ambitions and cut costs in one move he limited the use of limousines by employees the timing of his appointment was a surprise because many had expected oswald grubel to stay on until mr grubel told the board in the second half of that he wanted to retire he said accelerating the formal appointment of a successor the move is partly aimed at helping keep credit suisse shares aloft the stock has climbed almost in the past year in zurich trouncing the rise by its chief rival ubs ag as the u s investment banking unit run by mr dougan has enjoyed improved fortunes yesterday credit suisse shares jumped more than on upbeat earnings news but powering them still higher may be a challenge mr dougan may have to grab market share from u s and european rivals to send the stock up and also continue on his cost costing mission mr dougan said he plans to continue carrying out the "one bank" strategy as devised in "this is about consistency and making it at a time of great strength " he said in an interview the banks american depositary receipts a share like instrument that trades in the u s are now at almost times estimated earnings for slightly more pricey than ubss price earnings multiple credit suisses earnings are expected to grow in the next year according to analysts a tad below the growth rate anticipated for ubs mr dougan will succeed mr grubel who retires may taking over an

problem in managing the private bank "he has been part of the board that has overseen all of the decisions that impacted the entire bank so he has experience in managing the unified firm " mr grubel
