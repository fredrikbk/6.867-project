weekend journal review theater back in mint condition new york heres a sentence i never thought id write two of harley granville barkers plays are running off broadway to fully appreciate the unlikeliness of that coincidence you have to know that granville barker who died in was a british playwright and director whose once popular "problem plays" about edwardian england and its social discontents are mostly long forgotten "the madras house " for instance was last seen in new york years ago now the mint theater company whose smartly mounted revivals of neglected but worthy plays have put it on the map has given "the madras house" a staging of the highest possible quality and guess what its a terrific play the only reason why this doesnt surprise me is that im one of the many new york theatergoers to have been thrilled by the atlantic theater companys similarly impressive and hugely successful revival of "the voysey inheritance " granville barkers best remembered play which opened in december and has since been extended three times it closes march "the madras house " written in is another school of shaw play of ideas about a stageful of talkative characters who have come to question the cast iron moral certitudes of their victorian forebears this time around the parties in question are the well heeled owners of a family run department store in london and the nagging doubts with which they find themselves beset prove to be the stuff of high drama and much laughter granville barker may have been an egghead but he was also a shrewd and knowing man of the theater and he filled "the madras house" with fascinatingly complicated characters each of whom receives a turn in the limelight and a hatful of showy lines "i have unconventional opinions but i dont do unconventional things" such plays demand first class acting to make their mark and gus kaikkonen who directed the mints revival of "the voysey inheritance " has put together an uncommonly fine ensemble cast for "the madras house " of whom mary bacon thomas hammond and george morfogen make the strongest impressions in part because they have the flashiest roles not only is mr kaikkonens direction glisteningly exact but charles morgan has somehow managed to cram four different sets onto the mint theaters shoebox sized stage a trick i would have assumed to be physically impossible had i not beheld it with my own amazed eyes ive never seen a bad show at the mint whose revivals of rachel crotherss "susan and god" and john galsworthys "the skin game" are among the finest productions ive reviewed in this space to that roll of honor i now add "the madras house " cheers to the mint theater for bringing it back to the new york stage and doing it in style oren safdie first caught my eye three years ago with "private jokes public places " a bristlingly intelligent madly funny comedy about the aesthetic follies of celebrity architects mr safdie is the son of one moshe safdie that had a memorable downtown run he then vanished without a trace leaving me to wonder what had become of so promising a debutant now i know mr safdie has been running malibu stage company a california troupe whose production of his latest play is currently being performed off broadway "the last word " the ellipsis is mr safdies is a two man comedy about an uncomfortable encounter between a pair of bad playwrights one old blind and grumpy daniel j travanti and the other young and painfully earnest adam green its as clever as "private jokes public places " and messrs travanti and green sail through it with aplomb mr travanti is best known as the star of "hill street blues " the groundbreaking cop show that kept him busy throughout most of the s since then hes been making forgettable tv movies and laboring in the vineyards of regional theater mr safdie has written him a dream part henry grunwald is a formidably cranky viennese jew who escaped the holocaust fled to america made and lost a bundle in advertising and longs to see one of his awful plays produced before he dies mr travanti plays grunwald with lip smacking relish you can see how much fun hes having and no sooner did i get over the shock of seeing capt frank furillo concealed behind a gray beard and an inch thick sachertorte accent than i settled down to enjoy a superior piece of acting this is amazingly enough mr travantis new york stage debut i dont know what took him so long to get here but i sure hope he sticks around mr green is no less effective in the far less grateful role of len a priggish whiny graduate student looking for part time work who is forced to submit to an minute long interview in which the envious grunwald hoses him down with a tankful of simmering resentment it seems that the old crock loathes all english speaking playwrights specifically including samuel beckett david mamet terrence mcnally tennessee williams and funniest of all shakespeare "he kills everyone off before they really have a chance to suffer anyone can do death " good staging good set good everything welcome back oren safdie mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at
