chinas congested skies between military maneuvers and outdated equipment travelers face agonizing delays hong kong as a frequent flier to chinese cities philip leung has learned to expect long delays like the five hour wait he endured last july before boarding a flight from beijing to hong kong the flight scheduled to depart at p m was delayed in frustrating increments and he didnt emerge from what is normally a three hour journey until the next morning "i was furious " says mr leung a hong kong based consultant "thank god it didnt cost me a customer or contract " what mr leung didnt know is that while he was steaming in an internet cafe only of the airspace above him was open to passenger planes making china one of global aviations most restricted countries the reason is the powerful chinese military which controls the nations skies shanghais pudong international airport shut down for four hours one afternoon in december when chinas air force ran a drill airports in at least three other big coastal cities that fall under the nanjing military area command also had to close forcing the diversion or delay of hundreds of flights both foreign and domestic adding further frustration for travelers military affairs are a state secret in china so there is no way to predict the snap shutdowns in the pudong shutdown for instance pilots said they assumed the closure had to do with military maneuvers but passengers werent told why their plane had landed in an unexpected airport raising concerns there had been a crash or other calamity a military run newspaper noted that the drill had been a success the civil aviation administration of china the official regulatory authority for civilian air travel in china declined to respond to requests for comment under the military chinas aviation authorities have been slow to adopt practices that have become standard elsewhere in the world planes flying from new york to chicago can travel at any of about altitudes china limits civilian aircraft to flying at seven altitudes which means fewer jets can enter the sky cathay pacific airways for example has just four altitudes to choose from roughly and feet for its planes traveling from hong kong to shanghai such constraints have taken a toll as chinese commercial aviation has boomed fueled by deregulation of the airline industry a prospering middle class a surge in foreign business people seeking opportunities and a plethora of new airlines tourists and corporate road warriors scurrying to do deals all over china are finding themselves stuck in sometimes agonizing delays "i can pretty much always bank on an hours delay and i think im doing well if its less than that " says irishman joe healy a director of engineering at emerson climate technologies in hong kong airport closures due to bad weather exacerbate the problem alexander mackintosh a partner at ernst &amp young recalls taking a flight last month with hong kong dragon airlines or dragonair that left hong kong for beijing after a three hour delay it was minutes from its destination when the pilot abruptly turned around on account of heavy fog and returned to hong kong "air traffic congestion has become a serious issue on several of our routes in china mainland " dragonair said in a statement "we have been in contact with the relevant government departments in an effort to seek an improvement in the situation " pilots grouse that even blue skies are no guarantee of smooth flying because chinas air force often picks the clearest days to practice congested corridors over the chinese coast facing taiwan which beijing considers a renegade province are particularly prone to military disruptions they say the reason for last months airport shutdowns when the limited routes into southern china get too crowded air traffic controllers on the mainland try to slow the inflow of planes by reducing the number of altitudes available to them jetliners bound for china or europe from southeast asia and australia can get backed up and forced into fuel guzzling holding patterns as a result along chinas western frontier a few international flights have been pushed "right to the ragged edge" of having to break away to refuel in neighboring kazakhstan says one aviation expert japan airlines requires its planes heading into chinese airspace to load up with extra fuel in case of in flight delays or diversions chinese airlines flying domestic routes often postpone their departures to take on as many late arriving passengers as possible and chinas smaller carriers have few planes in reserve to use when delays ricochet through their networks deng jie owner of a private company in beijing says he has taken some local flights that left as much as a day behind schedule "the situation has definitely gotten worse in the past two years progressively worse " says a foreign pilot who has flown to china for years hong kongs government reports a tripling in departure delays from its airport over the past three years to last year from in because delays and cancellations tend to worsen throughout the day some passengers try to beat the system by flying as early as possible cathay pacific airways has a a m cargo flight from hong kong to beijing that also carries as many as passengers the flight almost always leaves on time and in spite of the ungodly hour with most of its seats full with the olympic games looming however there have been signs that the generals who control chinas airspace are easing up a bit to help reduce congestion they agreed last year to open a new corridor that trims up to minutes off flight times between china and europe china has since authorized another new route and is considering opening a third possibly in time for the olympics iata says within the past months chinas three largest cities beijing shanghai and guangzhou have all installed new air traffic control equipment that is "light years ahead" of what most western countries use according to one foreign airline executive the new equipment enables controllers for example to track each plane electronically and digitally whereas controllers formerly used a hand written system china generally requires an airliner to fly with a cushion of roughly feet of empty space between it and the next plane directly above it and a similar cushion between it and the next plane directly below it this is an old standard for flight safety designed to help prevent mid air collisions but aviation technology has improved to the point that most countries now require a vertical cushion or spacing between planes of just feet instead of feet china plans to change its rules and introduce foot vertical spacing of its own on august says yan xiaodong a director at the north china air traffic management bureau a regional sub office of the caac this would let up to twice as many planes fill the sky on any given air route thus easing congestion the civil aviation administration of china suggests it can step up work on efficiency partly because the nations aviation safety record has improved so much in recent years china recently hit a record million flying hours without accidents in another welcome sign chinese flag carrier air china says it plans this year to start sending text messages to its passengers cellphones to notify them ahead of time about any flight problems but right now flying in china can be a confounding exercise to minimize the pain china hands advise fellow fliers to avoid traveling at the most popular times and to take only carry on luggage in case they need to switch flights at the last minute mr leung the consultant recommends seeking out a good passenger lounge "its a must " he says "in order to keep your sanity " yang zhou and kersten zhang contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications commercial aircraft cruising at the same altitude one behind another over land in the u s generally must maintain a minimum safety separation of five nautical miles a diagram with a feb article in the marketplace section incorrectly gave that distance as roughly nautical miles which applies to planes in u s airspace over the ocean without radar coverage the diagram also incorrectly said the minimum over much of china is minutes flying time chinas general minimum for areas over land without radar coverage is minutes with radar coverage kilometers wsj march
