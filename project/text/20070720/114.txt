weekend journal review books beltway confidential the prince of darkness by robert d novak crown forum pages &# it was most appropriate for robert novak to title his autobiography "the prince of darkness " he has spent years raising hell in washington or at least trying to and proudly writes that he has "collected enemies like barnacles " his most noteworthy offerings as a columnist and broadcaster have been "things people do not want me to reveal " even more annoying to his natural foes he hates big government and its growing infringement on american freedoms his many critics will enjoy few things about this detailed and highly readable account of a remarkable journalistic career but most will read it anyway if for no other reason than to learn who the sources were for some of his more memorable scoops sources who still demand protection remain secret but there are many revelations of who leaked what to mr novak and his partner for years rowland evans the old saw that "knowledge is power" is nowhere more true than inside the beltway and how better to employ power than to leak selected juicy tidbits of knowledge to the nationally syndicated columnists evans and novak in washington personal loyalty is seldom an issue the game has unwritten rules the leaker knows that if he tricks a reporter into printing a lie he will cease to be a source and become a target the reporter knows that if he "burns" a leaker by revealing his identity the source will dry up thats the way the game is played and mr novak has been so good at it that he has earned fame and a fairly nice fortune but "the prince of darkness" is also a cultural history of how a sleepy southern city became the roaring strife ridden power center that it is today mr novak has hobnobbed with the players in this transformation since the eisenhower years his narrative reminds us that they were mere mortals who rose to prominence mostly because they were good at politics and expanding the role of government in wielding the federal governments vast police and military power they have often made dangerous mistakes but good reporters like mr novak have given the voting public a means to assess their performance confirming the founding fathers belief that a free press is democracys best protection against fatal error mr novak feels compelled to give a full account of his role in a minor but bizarre political dogfight the "plame affair " valerie plame worked at the central intelligence agency as a weapons proliferation analyst her husband joseph c wilson iv a career diplomat won favor from bill clinton with a white house post as an africa specialist in july mr wilson wrote a politically damaging new york times op ed alleging that george w bush in his haste to go to war in iraq had ignored intelligence that mr wilson had provided to the cia he claimed that his report contradicted a bush statement that saddam hussein may have sought uranium ore presumably for a nuclear weapon in niger mr novak asked deputy secretary of state richard armitage why a former clinton aide with no intelligence experience was sent on such a sensitive mission the not for attribution answer "you know his wife works for the cia" went into a novak column war critics screamed that the administration had illegally blown valeries cia cover in retaliation for the wilson article there is no need to rehash the full story here it has had more press coverage than it deserves mr novak deals with it thoroughly noting that the senate intelligence committee with no objection from democratic members found that no crime had been committed that mr wilson had lied and that his "intelligence" was unsubstantial mr novak writes that the dust up cost him heavy legal fees undermined his year relationship with cnn kept him off "meet the press" for two years and subjected him to "constant abuse from journalistic ethics critics from some colleagues and especially from bloggers " his epithet for joe wilson whose cause lost momentum after the senate report is a scatological term unprintable in a family newspaper mr novaks book has little to say about the principal victim of the plame affair vice presidential aide lewis "scooter" libby who was bizarrely convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice because his memory of events conflicted with those of reporters no doubt mr novak had so little to say because the book was in print before the libby case played out but the scant attention is yet more evidence that mr libby was a mere bystander he was convicted even though no underlying crime had been committed and he himself was not guilty of the offending leak mr novaks latest columns have cited conservative anger at president bushs timidity in only commuting mr libbys prison sentence rather than granting a full pardon mr novak seldom minces words after quoting john sears a former richard nixon aide he concludes that "nixon was a fraud a make believe tough guy " elsewhere republican senate minority leader trent lott is described as "a jerk " jimmy carter is termed "a habitual liar who modified the truth to suit his purposes " of cable news magnate ted turner "i think it is easier for madmen to be creative entrepreneurs and visionaries and thats what turner was " an al gore double cross involving a promise to appear on a novak tv show "demonstrated that he was more of a phony than i thought " former fbi director j edgar hoover was "a megalomaniac and petty tyrant " but mr novak has had heroes too on a trip to vietnam he met john paul vann a counterinsurgency expert who was successfully organizing local resistance to the communists but whose efforts which cost him his life were undermined by washington this passage of the book has cogency today as the american military in iraq faces a similar sell out at a time when it is finally making progress in organizing iraqi resistance to al qaeda as to presidents mr novak thinks jerry ford was the nicest man ever to occupy the oval office democratic sen pat moynihan would have made an excellent president in mr novaks view had it not been for his drinking mr novak was a supporter of the "supply side revolution" in federal economic policy in the late s when we on the journal editorial page were in the center of a battle that would be ultimately won in the reagan years he had been a prolific washington reporter for the journal in the early s but turned down an offer to join the editorial page staff in favor of teaming up with rowland evans he explains that he didnt like the constraints of corporate politics he nonetheless asserts that the late journal editor robert l bartley was "the most influential editorial page editor in america " mr novak is seldom complimentary toward his fellow washington scribes he details how as a young ap hand he was told by the other reporters covering a congressional hearing on communist penetration of a united auto worker local not to give ink to the republican staff director for the hearings "because he doesnt deserve it " it was he notes "censorship by a self created news cartel " he quotes a partisan new york times reporter in who bragged that he "could do more good for kennedy" by writing about the richard nixon presidential campaign the clear implication was that the reporter ostensibly conveying to readers the policy intentions of the republican candidate was in fact looking for gaffes and missteps that would damage his chances mr novak isnt the first to have noticed that the much vaunted journalistic creed of "objectivity" is mostly a fiction in the washington press corps he has had the advantage of seeing it from the inside robert d novak has come a long way from joliet ill where he was the son of the manager of the local gas company and the grandson of a jewish chicago shopkeeper who had deserted from the russian imperial army he has survived heavy drinking expensive gambling reckless driving occasional fistfights spinal meningitis and a parachute jump with the armys golden knights at age late in life he converted to catholicism and gave up his bad habits he has written a meaty book full of delicious anecdotes washington insiders will read it with interest and the many who have been targets of novak hell raising will find themselves scorched once more they will feel all the more discomfort from knowing that a book is a more enduring record than the transient offerings of newspaper columns or tv talk shows i recommend the book as well for youngsters who want to make a career in journalism if you want to do the job well dont expect to be loved mr novak has made mistakes some of which he details and has often spread himself too thin with his tv and writing commitments with the result that his column has sometimes lacked detail and depth but he has rarely made the classic error that afflicts so much journalism better than most he has maintained the perspective of an outsider in a town where almost everyone is bent on capturing the favor of the press and by extension the votes of readers and viewers if this casts him as satan in washingtons overheated environment he wears the label proudly mr melloan had a year career as a journal reporter editorial writer and columnist
