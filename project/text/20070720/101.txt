u n high tech for kim the united nations cash for kim jong il scandal is now six months old so its a good time to assess progress if thats the right word the evidence of misdeeds at the u n development program in north korea continues to mount but theres still no "urgent" and "external" inquiry as ordered by secretary general ban ki moon in january now the u s has uncovered evidence that in addition to transferring millions of dollars in cash that may have gone to help prop up kims grotesque regime the undp also transferred dual use technology it did so without bothering to secure a u s export license and despite the fact that the commerce department had denied an earlier application for a license for technology for the same project our melanie kirkpatrick lays out the details nearby one of the striking features of cash for kim has been the response of the undp which has obfuscated denied and dissembled its way through the past half year when the u n board of auditors issued a report confirming violations of u n rules at the undps operations in north korea the agency brushed it off with an "everyone does it" defense the technology transfers have been variously denied minimized or deflected to others shoulders the same modus operandi was on display in response to u s inquiries about the undps operations in another asian dictatorship burma where the agency appears to be following the same practices that got it into trouble in north korea inspection of projects is limited by the government and a percentage of u n outlays is required to be in foreign currency given what weve learned about north korea the u s is right to worry that undp aid &# million from to may have been diverted to the regime the undp has responded with its usual transparency while deigning to release the information that it has conducted two internal audits of the burma program in the past decade it wont give the u s access to the audits or let it review the line by line details of the budgets this is the equivalent of a ceo refusing to let a member of his board of directors see the companys financials and is hardly the way to treat the country that has donated &# billion to the agency over the past decade in addition there has been no external audit of the burma program for more than years meanwhile the board of auditors examination of the undps north korea operations is about to enter a new phase deputy secretary general asha rose migiro wrote to the general assemblys budget committee on june announcing that "it is the wish of the secretary general" for the board of auditors to undertake "the necessary visit to" north korea good luck pyongyang has already refused once to let in the auditors so itll be interesting to see how it welcomes any new request in any event philippe seguin the french chairman of the board of auditors says the board "cannot serve in an investigatory capacity " as he put it in a june letter to the budget committee as we learned from the multibillion dollar oil for food scandal the u n is not good at policing itself the only way to get to the bottom of cash for kim is through an independent investigatory panel along the lines of the one run by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker that opened up oil for food the u s has been pressing for this for months its past time
