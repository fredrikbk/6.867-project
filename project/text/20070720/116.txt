weekend journal review television a many layered thriller damages" is a dark legal thriller set and filmed in new york fx tuesdays p m edt its crowning glory is glenn close as patty hewes the passive aggressive head of a high stakes litigation firm this season the firm will be waging war over one major case on a battlefield far more vicious than a courtroom ostensibly patty is on the side of the angels fighting on behalf of some former employees who apparently were cheated out of their life savings by their boss hes named arthur frobisher and ted danson gives a chilling performance as a man descending ever further into evil yet patty who seems at first to be a legal version of the meryl streep character in "the devil wears prada " is equally frightening in her way this is no zealot whom we automatically admire for doing anything to win her case something is rotted in pattys soul too in the middle of this morass is new associate ellen parsons played by the wide eyed rose byrne like almost everyone in the series shes been lured first by the thrill of working for famous patty onto a dangerous path early on in her employment there are what should be warning signs that she has entered a world of duplicity and deceit yet the perks such as a new upper west side apartment for her and her physician fiance are too good to resist in this noir world nobody remains wholly innocent for long we grasp that almost from the start because the series opens in a present that follows ellen bloody and clothed only in underpants and a raincoat staggering through the streets of new york the story then flashes back to six months earlier when she first got a job with the hewes firm it will take many episodes to get from then to now and to learn exactly how and why it all went so wrong knowing from the outset the key elements of the ending which includes a grisly murder does not spoil the thrill despite its fantastic nature the story is an onion with a thousand layers each one a satisfying mystery of its own the only drawback is that "damages" cant be consumed in one sitting or out of order to feel the menace here and follow the progression of its many characters through hell youll have to watch it religiously another celebrated movie actress holly hunter comes to tv this week tnts "saving grace" mondays p m features ms hunter as an oklahoma city detective named grace hanadarko who lives on cigarettes and bourbon and is what might be politely called a good time girl she also has perhaps the most hideous hairdo of any leading lady in tv drama history while no other human in the show can begin to rival the hamminess of ms hunters performance the hair comes a close second at any rate as the series begins grace is rollicking in bed with her married police partner it wont be the last time ms hunter gets naked for us later in a drunken stupor she rams her porsche into a guy on the highway killing him like anyone in that situation might do she mutters for gods help and to her astonishment she is actually helped not by god himself but by earl leon rippy a tobacco chewing guy who looks like a bum but is he informs her an angel nobody was killed it turns out the accident was just to get her attention this gimmick of down to earth heavenly visitors is not new nor is the emphasis throughout on all inclusive nontraditional spirituality although earl chides grace for profanity hes far from saintly himself and hes not trying to turn her into a standard christian or anything unlike "joan of arcadia " however in which god appeared in the guise of ordinary people to guide a teenage girl "saving grace" goes out of its way to extinguish any spark of the divine were left with a heap of hocus pocus that will offend some viewers and seem pretentious or silly to others it still might work this sort of show is about suspending one sort of belief while reaching for another if the lead character is someone we can care about the standard elements are pasted in to let us know that she is one of those tough troubled women who is carrying some deep emotional wounds were meant to look beyond her awful behavior driving recklessly with kids in a car fantasizing about sexually taunting a devout christian teenager and glimpse the good person worth rooting for it can be distracting though watching miss hunter acting up a storm will grace be saved as our bawdy boozy detective goes about her business of solving crimes each week while tussling with angel earl the answer doesnt often seem to matter as much as it should "john james audubon drawn from nature" pbs tuesday p m but check local listings reminds us early on that the famous illustrator was a bundle of contrasts chief among them "his name is synonymous with american conservation yet he killed thousands of birds " this disconcerting observation aside the person that emerges here is an appealing and fascinating character the french born audubon was the illegitimate son of a ships captain and his chambermaid raised partly in haiti he came to america after the french revolution found a wife thrived in business and then risked it all to pursue a grand obsession with seeing and drawing all the new worlds birds by the time he was finished in he had depicted species some of which like the migrating passenger pigeons that were told used to darken the skies for hundreds of miles in flocks of a billion birds were already facing extinction audubons eventual laments on behalf of disappearing american wildlife came too late for many creatures yet his drawings inspired future generations of conservationists and today are all the more precious because they are the only accurate record of many natural wonders that have been lost
