strongly against buyout deals in june forcing bankers to put off fund raising for some midsize buyouts or to make the loans to these companies directly the latest developments suggest these huge deals which recently came to market with few hitches are also facing resistance "two or three months ago the banks could have said that this is the price take it or leave it " says gary jenkins a portfolio

leveraged buyout deals that need to come to the market for refinancing in the u s and more than &# billion in europe the banks are in a potentially precarious position because they have committed to

first planned bankers are also working tougher performance requirements known as covenants into the deal and plan to sell the debt at a discount to its face value investors are more receptive to debt from chrysler financial because the financing company has a track record of profits but many are less enthusiastic about lending to the auto business which is burning through cash "there are too many questions still about chryslers future " said one investor who attended a presentation by bankers on the deal "cerberus has to make the financing more attractive for us to buy into it " he added "i dont want to be left holding the bag if it fails " kkrs gbp billion purchase of alliance boots is europes largest leveraged buyout to date and the financing is being closely watched as a barometer of the global credit markets late yesterday the banks were working to identify new terms of the financing to win over investors if those terms dont work the banks would have to decide whether to change
