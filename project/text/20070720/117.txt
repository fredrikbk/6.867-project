weekend journal review theater role of a lifetime gypsy city center w th st new york &# &# closes july relatively speaking westport country playhouse powers court westport conn &# &# closes july new york patti lupone who was last seen on broadway puffing on a tuba in "sweeney todd " stopped the show cold at her first entrance in mondays performance of "gypsy " no sooner did she march up the aisle of city center shouting "sing out louise " than the sold out house popped its collective cork thats how excited playgoers are about her "gypsy" as well they should be not only will ms lupone be remembered as the mama rose of her generation but every other aspect of this production is as good as it can be point for point its the best revival of a golden age musical ive seen in or out of new york staging casting design even the orchestra all are gloriously exhilaratingly right not counting the show itself ms lupone is the very best thing about "gypsy " but the director comes in a close second arthur laurents who turned last week wrote the book of "gypsy" and also directed the shows and broadway revivals though hes never been much of a playwright mr laurents was a kind of genius when it came to writing the books of musicals "gypsy " like "west side story" before it is a fat free masterpiece of compression that cuts to the chase in every scene discarding all superfluous detail and sticking unswervingly to the main dramatic line needless to say mr laurents knows it cold and his staging which i gather is a close but not slavish copy of the revival zips along like lightning unfussily nailing every laugh and jerking every tear "gypsy" purports to tell the tale of mama rose hovick who took her mousy daughter louise played as a child by emma rowley and as a young woman by laura benanti and transformed her into gypsy rose lee the most glamorous and celebrated stripper of the s in fact mr laurents and his songwriting collaborators jule styne and stephen sondheim turned the real life story of mama rose and her little girl into a super sized myth the age old tragedy of the frustrated stage mother who pushes her children into the spotlight feeds vampirishly off their applause then finds it impossible to let them grow up and live their own lives as a straight play "gypsy" would be too corny for words but the incomparably brilliant styne sondheim score blows up its emotions to near operatic proportions mama rose even has a mad scene and so ennobles them the part of mama rose was hand stitched for ethel merman in and has since been played on broadway by angela lansbury tyne daly and bernadette peters thats a constellation and a half but i doubt if anyone has sung roses songs with such profound and unerring musicality as ms lupone or spoken her lines with more conviction guided by mr laurentss knowing direction and her own powerful theatrical instincts she plumbs the depths of roses monomaniacal desperation so much so that her singing of "everythings coming up roses" is downright scary whenever ms lupone strides onto the stage "gypsy" is no laughing matter yet this is no one woman show and laura benanti lately of "the wedding singer " is hardly less impressive as louise ms benanti one of broadways most endearing young performers was born to play girls next door which makes it all the more thrilling when she finally sheds her inhibitions and outer garments and tells off her mother in an explosion of wholly convincing rage except for his not quite brooklynesque accent boyd gaines is equally believable in the famously ungrateful role of herbie roses long suffering suitor i wish i could mention everybody else in the cast they deserve it but then there wouldnt be room to praise james youmans cheap and cheesy burlesque house set to rave about the pistol hot playing of the piece synthesizer free onstage orchestra to marvel yet again at jerome robbinss eternally fresh choreography or to express the heartfelt hope that this production will survive its sell by date "gypsy" is the first summertime show in city centers much admired encores series of musical revivals and unlike its predecessors which normally play for just four nights its being given a fully staged three week run like "chicago" and "wonderful town " both of which transferred from city center to broadway "gypsy" deserves to move a few blocks south for an open ended commercial run alas i suspect thats not in the cards since bernadette peters played mama rose on broadway just four years ago in sam mendess revival so youd better see it now if you can get in westport conn if the recent brits off broadway production of "intimate exchanges" made you long to see another alan ayckbourn comedy as soon as possible i strongly suggest you catch the next train to connecticut where "relatively speaking " the first of mr ayckbourns odd plays to hit the box office bulls eye is being performed with pizazz at westport country playhouse written in and first performed in this country the following year in westport "relatively speaking" is a two set four character comedy of errors whose convoluted carryings on cant be summarized concisely on paper but become crystal clear as soon as the curtain goes up suffice it to say that mr ayckbourn has taken the hoariest of stock farce plots the one about the middle aged businessman paxton whitehead and the nubile young secretary geneva carr who get caught with their pants down and twisted it into a pretzel of the utmost complexity in which all four actors are constantly talking at cross purposes and nothing is as it seems to be unlike his later plays "relatively speaking" is a pure comedy with no audible undertones of doubt or rue and to see it performed skillfully is the best of all possible antidepressants john tillinger who staged the manhattan theatre clubs revival of mr ayckbourns "absurd person singular" two years ago has done even better by "relatively speaking " which hasnt been seen in new york since hint hint ms carr and james waterston who plays her younger lover sound slightly uncomfortable doing english accents but their acting is otherwise fine while cecilia hart who plays mr whiteheads sweetly oblivious wife leaves nothing to be desired as for mr whitehead who was terrific in "absurd person singular " hes giving acting lessons in "relatively speaking " he gets his laughs effortlessly playing each scene with the easy economy of the old pro that he is i would have gladly paid good money just to hear him read his lines out loud in his plummy rumbling basso
