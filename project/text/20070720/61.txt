north korea tech transfer of all the evidence turned up by the u s concerning irregularities in the united nations development programs operations in north korea some of the most disturbing concerns the transfer of dual use technology as reported last month the u s has uncovered documents showing the undp procured and delivered to north korea in may technology that could be used for military purposes global positioning system gps equipment a portable high end spectrometer and a large quantity of high specification computer hardware according to packing lists and confirmation receipts the items were intended for a "gis" geographic information system project the equipment "is the type of technology subject to u s export controls " says a spokesman for the commerce departments bureau of industry and security which is responsible for issuing export licenses so how did it end up in pyongyang it would seem more than passing strange that commerce would have issued the requisite export licenses the answer is it didnt u s officials led by ambassador mark wallace at the u s mission to the u n have spent a year looking into the undps operations in north korea now at the request of the state department commerce searched its archives and found no record of any application for export licenses for the gps spectrometer or other equipment for the gis project in north korea over the past years commerce has received more than license applications to export u s technology for u n projects in north korea of those applications the undp was named in a grand total of two including one for software for the same gis project that was equipped last year that application was rejected previously undisclosed documents show that the undp had been trying to equip the gis project since at least when the application for an export license for mapping software was denied commerce cited concerns over the lack of safeguards in the project that could result in the software being diverted to the north korean government and used for military purposes yet seven years later the undp procured and transferred sensitive technology to the same unsafeguarded project this time without bothering to apply for a license and while theres no evidence the undp went ahead and purchased the software for which it had been denied a license that possibility must be considered since gps equipment is useless in such a project without mapping software the denial notice for "case number z" is dated sept the "consignee in country of ultimate destination" is listed as the undp in pyongyang the one page notice is written in prose that is clear and unambiguous "the department of commerce has concluded that this export would be detrimental to u s foreign policy interests " the items on the undps wish list were all classified "ear " which means they are subject to commerce jurisdiction but didnt specifically appear on the commerce control list of items restricted for export in discussions over the past several weeks with state department officials commerce officials who examined the archives explained their agencys decision to deny the export license during the interagency review of the undp request they say questions were raised about whether the software would stay in north korea after the undp international staff left and whether north koreans would have access to the software supporting documents show that the answer to both questions was yes a letter dated april from the software manufacturer that was seeking the export license on behalf of the undp explains "the project is supposed to be completed in three years and the software will be left with the state agencies " emails from the undp to commerce offer further information about the undps security controls or lack thereof an aug email from the undps shankar manandhar in response to a commerce query says "we would like to inform you that the north korean nationals will have access to the computer in the project office in the presence of undp staff " in another email mr manandhar notes that the software will be "utilized in the project office " the defense department recommended to commerce that the application be denied in a memo dated july defense explains that "these items could pose both national security and proliferation issues for the us and allies if diverted to the north korean military " among the list of potential military applications cited are "planning a nuclear weapons infrastructure or missile launch sites " and "it could also be used for targeting " in the end as one commerce official explained since this type of mapping software can be used for military purposes it was deemed to be "too great a risk of diversion " the commerce official also says the case notes for the denial specify that several earlier licenses granted to the undp in north korea had been conditioned in such a way that no north korean nationals were to have access to the licensed items oh really based on the undps replies to commerces questions regarding the application the official says that the licensing officer at the time believed it was "highly likely" that the undp was violating the terms of its previous licenses by allowing north koreans access to licensed items we now know as confirmed by the u n s preliminary audit of the undps north korea operations that the agencys local staff were ministry of foreign affairs employees assigned to the undp by the government its also worth noting the year these events took place that is the denial notice originated in bill clintons commerce department part of an administration that was "conducting a one sided love affair with north korea " in the felicitous phrase of christopher cox then a republican congressman closely monitoring asian issues on sept the day before the issuance of the denial notice the administration announced it would ease economic sanctions on north korea but approving the sale of sophisticated mapping software was a bridge too far even for the clinton administration since the u s went public in january with evidence of the undps lack of oversight of its programs in north korea the agency hasnt exactly been forthcoming at first the undp denied that it had purchased dual use equipment for north korea referring instead to "rice husk removers" and "plotters to help the korean authorities more accurately produce maps for environmental monitoring " next it look the line that the gps equipment portable spectrometer and computers delivered in may "do not represent state of the art technology " as ad melkert the no undp official put it in a june letter to zalmay khalilzad u s ambassador to the u n an annex to mr melkerts letter describes the technology as "not high end or sophisticated" an assessment at odds with the representations of the manufacturers trimble for example maker of the gps geoxt handheld sent to north korea describes its product as having "a powerful mhz processor running the most advanced operating system available " mr melkert says in the annex that the undp is investigating "whether the vendors in the netherlands and singapore were required to obtain export permits for these items" which sure sounds like an effort to shift responsibility since january when the u s concerns were made public the undp has pulled out of north korea and the u n audit has confirmed extensive violations of u n rules regarding hiring practices the use of foreign currency and site inspections the latest u s revelations raise far more serious questions about the undps oversight under the most generous interpretation the agency was negligent of its legal responsibilities to keep dual use technology out of a country that is on the u s list of terror sponsoring states at worst it deliberately transferred the technology knowing it was breaking u s law and helping to strengthen kim jong ils military dictatorship these questions and many more concerning the undps record in north korea highlight the need for an independent external inquiry of the undps programs world wide the u s first went public with its concerns in january after months of pressing the undp for more transparency if anything as the latest u s evidence shows things are worse than anyone thought ms kirkpatrick is a deputy editor of the journals editorial page
