dismissing meritless cases in regard to jim lewiss response to my july letter "contingency fee cases often have no merit " july the u s judicial system has a means of dealing with cases filed without merit they are quickly dismissed through a simple motion it is quite misleading to state that cases without merit are settled due to the costs of defending them a great majority of cases are settled prior to trial and both sides avail themselves of the settlement option but these are usually cases that have survived a motion to dismiss and are moving through the stages of discovery or legal fact finding in other words these cases have some merit in your scenario public entities and perhaps all plaintiffs public and private could only file lawsuits that they are absolutely sure to win this forecloses just about all civil rights and environmental cases as well as any case where a less powerful or less well funded entity wants to challenge a powerful entity amy widman center for justice &amp democracy new york
