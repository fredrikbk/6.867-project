turkish test istanbul sundays parliamentary elections here will make for yet another chapter in the long clash between secularism and islam in turkey simmering disputes between partisans on both sides came to a boil with mays presidential elections street protests against the ruling and religiously oriented justice and development party akp and its candidate for president encouraged the army chiefs to stage the softest of their "soft coups" in this case a midnight internet missive warning that "some circles disturb fundamental values of the republic of turkey especially secularism " turkeys highest court another secular bastion got the message and followed up with a technical but patently political ruling on parliamentary quorums prime minister tayyip erdogan angrily withdrew his candidate foreign minister abdullah gul who was assured to win the presidency in a straight parliament vote to defuse tensions early parliamentary elections were called and the presidential vote postponed none of it was very legitimate and the relief is bound to be temporary with a wide lead in polls mr erdogan will almost certainly return and demand to pick the next president and push a constitutional overhaul to give his party a freer hand the military long the stewards of kemal ataturks secular republic may be tempted to push back perhaps not so softly this time kurdish terrorism in the southeast and the european unions latest anxiety attack over turkeys membership bid further complicate the outlook yet in spite of the turmoil turkey has never been as prosperous or free as it is now and stands a betting chance of pulling through even secularists acknowledge that ataturks design for modern turkey with its fanatical opposition to religion in public life is overdue for an update the surprise is that the akp has taken the modernization mantle from them aside from well publicized exceptions such as mr erdogans thwarted attempt to criminalize adultery the akp has made its mark by opening up the economy and by liberalizing laws on womens and kurdish rights free speech and civil liberties and in an unfortunate role reversal the once pro western secular parties have turned against the political and economic reforms demanded by the eu and backed by the akp for a glimpse of the new turkey where economic growth has averaged annually since look around istanbul right off the bosporus are gleaming business districts garish nightclubs and bustling street scenes straight out of london or new york further inland the lower and lower middle class suburbs called varos are rising with a million people in the s turkeys commercial hub is today home officially to million but probably far more most of the new residents migrated from rural areas the old urban order accustomed to running the country is unsettled by its new neighbors their village habits and mores ilber ortayli the director of the topkapi palace in istanbul and a noted historian of the ottomans despairs at the sight of "these peasants " whose women tend to cover their heads with scarves and whose men wear moustaches the mustachioed mr erdogan a former businessman and istanbul mayor himself emerged from the varos and later tapped into massive support there for his akp the partys pro business and anti corruption planks as well as pledges to loosen restrictions on wearing headscarves that date back to the republics early years play well with this constituency of entrepreneurial and socially conservative shopkeepers and blue collar workers many of whom lately made the jump into the middle class the akp has injected funds for schools along with other goodies into the varos islamist pork so to speak but the akp is hardly radical in its islamic orientation its leaders were chastened by their brief stints in power in the s theyve adopted and mostly stuck to a liberal agenda this time the party bridges the traditional and modern world to claim around in recent polls the akp needs to attract its share of secular voters in this campaign akp leaders are able to claim credit for overseeing the growth of a sophisticated market economy which like its democracy also makes turkey unique in the muslim world the akp pushed the most far reaching privatization in turkeys history corporate income and sales taxes were cut unusually for the region growth was driven by private consumption and investment as the government kept a tight lid on its own spending turks who work outside the state sector showed their business chops with exports up three fold in the last five years foreign investment is times the figure at &# billion last year though there is widespread agreement that turkey is headed in the right economic direction cultural issues such as the headscarf are the focus of bitter debate as in ataturks model france turkey legislates on womens clothing banning headscarves in schools and government offices the akp claims to want to institute positive rights to let women wear whatever wherever they please the secularists see a slippery slope to enforced piety if the law is changed true enough more girls in turkish cities can be seen in headscarves than a decade or two ago but is this a sign of rising islamism or of turkeys new economic and social pluralism as with much else gender roles have shifted dramatically so that the headscarf doesnt automatically signal provincialism submission or lack of education secular or not women are asserting themselves in politics and business the activist womens ngos linked to the akp gave rise to the term "islamic feminism " another irony is that the akp has pushed womens rights further than any government since ataturk abolished polygamy and islamist courts as part of an overhaul of the penal code the akp criminalized rape in marriage eliminated sentence reductions for "honor killings " and ended legal discrimination against non virgin and unmarried women they arent noted feminists but the men of akp knew these changes were popular with women constituents and the eu "with the new penal code " notes a european stability initiative report "turkeys legislation entered the post patriarchal era " needless to say the secularists who accused the akp of repressing women at the big protests in ankara istanbul and izmir this spring give them little credit mr erdogan makes no secret of wanting to relieve pressure on "social islam " but secularists charge he secretly wants to implant "political islam " which in the name of democracy would destroy it anecdotes about alcohol bans in akp strongholds or teachers bringing religion into classroom made headlines in turkeys lively press but are hardly proof of systematic islamization lacking that secularists fall back on speculation about the akps ulterior motives orhan pamuk who last year won turkeys first nobel for literature once told me "every time theres a political debate in this country we dont discuss whats really happening but what are the hidden intentions " so what is happening with the economic and political flowering of recent years has come a cultural and religious one too according to one recent survey of turks call themselves "very" or "quite" religious compared with in but turks are also developing a clearer civic identity separate from islam the share of people who describe themselves first as "citizens of turkey" as opposed to ethnic turks or muslims went up to in from seven years ago theyre souring on political islam too opposition to the imposition of shariah islamic law rose from in to in while support for it fell from to meanwhile the overall number of women in headscarves is dropping steadily this just goes to show that prosperity and democracy tends to secularize without need for coercion the last three months have left voters bitter about politics mr erdogans thin skin and arrogance can make the general staff look the model of civility as a bunch turkish politicians arent a pretty lot but the flexible akp machine responded to the crisis in the spring by purging of its most hardline mps from the electoral list and moving the party further into the mainstream independents are expected to claim a larger possibly decisive block of seats political compromise is not a bad thing as long as turkey doesnt revert back to do nothing coalition governments america can do worse than strongly encourage the turks to play by democratic rules especially by keeping the military in the barracks continued european engagement on future eu membership in jeopardy thanks to continental politicians unable to think strategically the latest being frances nicolas sarkozy helps guide domestic reforms turkey is a crucial nato state that borders iran iraq the caucasus balkans and mideast and though not an arab country an important cultural and historical distinction turkey is on a journey toward becoming a mature democratic nation state that its mideast neighbors have barely started but are watching closely in the past few years turks asked hard questions about themselves can turkey stick together if kurds get minority rights what if discussion of the armenian massacres is opened up if women wear headscarves in schools if the army stays out of politics most fundamentally can public space be carved out in a muslim country for islam in a way that safeguards the rights of believers and nonbelievers and strengthens democracy in the process how unfortunate it would be to fail to get answers and if this remarkable period in turkish history were in the name of some s era notion of secularism prematurely brought to an end such an outcome would lead to the conclusion that muslim polities are incorrigibly illiberal unable to stomach real democracy though their politics are messy the turks give us good reason to believe otherwise mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
