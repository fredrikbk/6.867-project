politics &amp economics lawmakers question if nonprofit hospitals help the poor enough federal and state officials are increasingly questioning whether not for profit hospitals provide enough care to uninsured patients to warrant the sizable tax breaks they get for charitable work yesterday the internal revenue service released a report noting that many hospitals spend or less of total revenue on care for the poor and others who dont pay at the same time sen chuck grassley the ranking republican on the senate finance committee released a document suggesting congress might for the first time in decades impose firm rules on how much care charity hospitals must provide to the poor the scrutiny is fueled in part by the hospital industrys strengthening finances after its difficulties in the s hospitals of all kinds have seen profits increase by an estimated from through in part because of improved government and insurance reimbursements as well as strong investment returns according to consulting firm cleverley + associates of worthington ohio nonprofit hospitals net income often dubbed "excess of revenue over expenses" has risen to about from about over the same period nonprofit hospitals dont generate returns for private owners but they can still generate surpluses that are then saved or spent on expansion and improvements "when nonprofit hospitals sit on big cash reserves i wonder how much public service theyre offering " said mr grassley who last fall held a finance committee hearing examining hospital tax breaks executive compensation and related issues many nonprofit hospitals are cash strapped and operate on razor thin margins more than report cash and investments valued at less than a days operating expenses the intensifying scrutiny also comes as both state and federal policymakers grapple with how best to treat the uninsured hospitals for decades the health care provider of last resort for the poor and uninsured have long received a slew of tax benefits in return for ill defined requirements to provide "community benefits" often presumed to include significant charity care for the destitute now regulators and lawmakers are seeking to put dollar figures to the benefits provided and received by hospitals and in some cases they are contemplating stiff requirements on hospitals that have largely grown accustomed to setting their own standards in addition to the irs study and mr grassleys efforts regulators in illinois have revoked property tax breaks for three hospitals saying they provided too little charity care to qualify and across the country more states are collecting detailed information about how much hospitals provide and in some cases how much they reap in tax exemptions not for profit hospitals have a long tradition of charity care or free medical care for those who cant afford it in part because of that charity work not for profit hospitals have been given special tax breaks by federal state and local governments by the congressional budget offices measure those tax breaks totaled more than &# billion in but the cbo found in a recent analysis of hospitals in five states that not for profits provided only slightly more uncompensated care or charity care plus uncollectible bills than for profit hospitals measured as a percentage of operating expenses yet for profit hospitals dont get the tax benefits that can give not for profits a financial edge over competitors and may account in part for the ability of some to accumulate large cash hoards some states including illinois and texas are requiring standardized reporting by nonprofit hospitals and in many cases assembling lists comparing charity care or tax breaks a january study by minnesotas health department for example found that nonprofit hospitals absorbed about &# million of charity care and unpaid bills but received &# million of tax and other benefits complicating the debate is a lack of clarity about what hospitals need to do to quality for the tax benefits federal law requires that hospitals provide "community benefit " but doesnt offer much guidance on what that means in addition to charity care some hospitals count spending on health fairs as well as unpaid bills including the gap between what they bill medicare or medicaid and what the government actually pays states are also taking a closer look at charity care by minnesotas tally lake region healthcare corp a bed facility in fergus falls spent about &# or less than of its operating costs on uncompensated care in the state said the hospitals exemptions from property sales and income taxes on the federal state and local level were worth about &# million chief financial officer ed strand disputes the states figures and says the hospital provided overall benefits to surrounding communities totaling more than &# million which includes &# million in what it says it lost on medicare and medicaid care minnesota this year adopted legislation requiring nonprofit hospitals to file standardized reports with the state on their community benefit spending some states are going beyond collecting data and even penalizing hospitals they think could be doing more last year illinois attorney general lisa madigan suggested hospitals must spend at least of operating costs on charity care to receive tax breaks she withdrew the proposal after industry protests her office says she is in discussions with state hospital groups meanwhile illinois tax officials have revoked some property tax exemptions for three hospitals on the grounds that they provide too little charity care the facilities are contesting the decision the irs survey of hospitals found a broad range in charity care practices while devoted or less of their revenue to uncompensated care nearly a quarter spent less than of revenue on it one in five spent of revenue or more sen grassleys report yesterday which he explicitly labeled "not proposed legislation " drew a stir from the hospital industry among other things it proposed a firm charity care threshold in order to qualify for tax exemptions of patient operating expenses or revenue whichever is greater and outlined governance changes that would limit the proportion of insiders and physicians who could sit on a hospitals board if it wanted to protect its tax exempt status "some people thought when grassley lost his chairmanship hed go away " said michael w peregrine who represents nonprofit hospitals for chicago law firm mcdermott will &amp emery llp not for profit hospitals "clearly have a legislative fight on their hands "
