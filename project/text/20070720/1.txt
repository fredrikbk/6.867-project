a rise able fallacy the idea that an increase in economic growth leads to an increase in inflation and that decreased growth reduces inflation is reflected endlessly in the media on april for example ap writer rajesh mahapatra claimed that "high economic growth" of more than annually in india since "has spurred demand and caused prices to rise " this makes no sense all other things being equal an increase in economic growth must cause inflation to drop and a reduction in growth must cause inflation to rise in his congressional testimony yesterday federal reserve chairman ben bernanke thankfully did not state that the higher economic growth he expects will lead to higher inflation although he didnt connect growth and inflation at all mr bernanke has long understood that higher growth leads to lower inflation heres why inflation as the old saying goes is caused by too much money "chasing" too few goods just as more money means higher prices fewer goods also mean higher prices the connection between the level of production and the level of prices also holds for the rate of change of production that is the rate of economic growth and the rate of change of prices that is the inflation rate some simple arithmetic will clarify start with the famous equation of exchange mv py where m is the money supply v is the velocity of money that is the speed at which money circulates p is the price level and y is the real output of the economy real gdp a version of this equation incidentally was on the license plate of the late economist milton friedman who made a large part of his academic reputation by reviving and giving evidence for the role of money growth in causing inflation if the growth rate of real gdp increases and the growth rates of m and v are held constant the growth rate of the price level must fall but the growth rate of the price level is just another term for the inflation rate therefore inflation must fall an increase in the rate of economic growth means more goods for money to "chase " which puts downward pressure on the inflation rate if for example the money supply grows at a year and velocity is constant and if annual economic growth is inflation must be more exactly if however economic growth rises to inflation falls to actually why do even fairly sophisticated analysts sometimes talk as if they think higher growth causes higher inflation its probably because they have noted that inflation and real growth of gdp sometimes rise together how could that happen as the above equation reminds us inflation can rise only if the growth rate of the money supply increases or if the velocity of money increases or both if the federal reserve bank increases the growth rate of the money supply and if this increase is unanticipated then sellers of products and sellers of labor will for a while mistakenly think that the higher dollar prices of goods and higher wages they are seeing are higher real prices and higher real wages in other words in the short run the federal reserve has "tricked" them in response to this delusion they supply more goods and more labor increasing real gdp faster than otherwise so we observe higher inflation and higher real gdp this was the major insight that milton friedman presented in his presidential address to the american economic association in and that his fellow nobel laureate edmund phelps presented in a more technical paper around the same time when they see this combination of higher inflation and higher growth some reporters and analysts mistakenly conclude that the higher growth led to higher inflation it didnt higher growth of the money supply led temporarily to both higher inflation and higher real growth why does this matter imagine that you are trying to predict inflation and that you conclude that say productivity will grow faster than you had thought or that the labor force will grow possibly due to increased immigration faster than you had thought then you will predict higher growth of real gdp if you then conclude on this basis that inflation will increase you will be wrong if higher growth really did cause higher inflation think of the bizarre implications imagine that you care strongly about keeping inflation low imagine also that you could deregulate some sector of the economy say health care or energy and that this would increase real gdp would you advocate doing so in the absence of other considerations those who understand that higher growth leads to lower inflation would say "yes " but those who believe the mistaken view that higher growth causes higher inflation might say "no " and that would be a big mistake mr henderson is a research fellow with the hoover institution an economics professor at the naval postgraduate school and co author of "making great decisions in business and life" chicago park press
