during the day must pay a gbp or about &# "congestion charge " "i wasnt prepared to pay eight quid for the pleasure of being five minutes early to the theater " says mr cockell london mayor ken livingstone introduced the fee in to relieve the citys traffic jams and expanded the zone in february since its introduction the congestion charge has reduced traffic prompted people to use public transportation and cut pollution now a number of u s cities including dallas miami minneapolis st paul and san diego are considering congestion charges on busy roads or highways san francisco is discussing a congestion charge for its downtown one of the busiest traffic zones in the country officials from the san francisco county transportation authority have been to london numerous times to study its scheme says tilly chang the authoritys deputy director of planning londons plan was also the model for new york mayor michael bloombergs proposed &# fee for cars south of th street in manhattan between a m and p m yesterday the city reached an agreement with state legislators to create a committee to conduct hearings and study how to implement the plan along with any other anti congestion proposals and will need final sign off from the state legislature early next year the project is dependent on receiving at least &# million in federal funds although the city hopes to get &# million mr bloomberg said in a statement the city would "begin immediately to prepare for the installation of needed equipment to make our traffic plan a reality " several other international cities have introduced similar schemes though none have been on londons scale since drivers in singapore have paid to enter busy parts of the city during the day which made traffic move faster during peak hours and encouraged people to share cars oslo and stockholm charge for access to their city centers in santiago chile drivers must pay more to drive on popular roads at busy times in about of londoners said they support the congestion charge up from in according to ipsos mori a polling company in mr livingstone was easily re elected over a conservative steven norris who promised to scrap the charge but the zone is changing routines and creating new ones becoming one more factor in the complex series of calculations that urban dwellers make every day parents ask where their childrens friends live before agreeing to play dates to see if they will have to drive through the zone expectant mothers pay before driving to the hospital rebecca nicolle an interior decorator decided her daughters dora age and mamie needed to start taking the public bus to school by themselves this year because it was too expensive to pay to drive them she practiced with mamie and dora for three weeks before allowing them to go on their own the girls thought it was an adventure on their first day solo ms nicolle fought back tears "the school was really good about it " ms nicolle says "they would ring me to say they got there ok " when the private charles de gaulle school in south kensington suddenly found itself in the newly expanded zone the parents association appealed to the government for an exemption for parents dropping off their children at school the request was rejected says katherine cecillon president of the association some families are car pooling she says for parents who pay every day it costs about &# a year to do the school run one real estate firm w a ellis bought its staff motor scooters which are exempt from the charge and paid for rider training courses and riding jackets and boots so it wouldnt have to pay the charge for its employees london with its narrow winding roads laid out centuries before the automobile was invented has long been highly susceptible to traffic jams in mr livingstone in his first period as leader of the london council cut bus and train fares sharply to encourage people to drive less the move prompted many londoners to swap cars for public transport but a legal challenge against the change was successful and fares soon went up again by a poll paid for by london council found traffic congestion was residents no complaint with the city above housing costs and crime the average city driver spent minutes sitting still or driving slowly for every mile they traveled buses going through the city averaged miles per hour a similar pace to the horse and buggies used in london years ago the toll cut the number of vehicles entering the city since to a day in as more people walked rode and took buses and trains instead says transport for london the government agency that administers the program the average driving speed rose to miles per hour in from miles per hour in the city is less polluted with carbon dioxide emissions falling in the year the charge was introduced the number of traffic accidents in which someone was hurt fell to in from in and people cycled through the city every day in up from in according to transport for london it is also easier and quicker to catch a taxi or bus it says judging the plan a "brilliant success " mr livingstone doubled the tax zone in february to some square miles and included many of londons wealthiest neighborhoods and famous attractions like kensington palace the victoria &amp albert museum and harrods department store he made the charge applicable from a m until p m instead of p m heres how it works people can pay the charge at convenience stores by phone by sending a text message from their cellphones or on the internet commuters can pay by the year people have until midnight after the day they drive through to pay motorcycles taxis police cars ambulances buses and cars using alternate fuels are exempt the residents who live inside the zone get a discount they pay about &# a day since anytime they drive anywhere theyre in the zone there are no toll booths or barriers instead the zone is ringed by hundreds of cameras that photograph car license plates a computer program reads the shots and checks the license plate numbers against the list of people who have paid the charge license plates that show up as unpaid are matched against the governments motor vehicle registry to find the car owners name and address people who dont pay are fined about &# or &# if they pay within two weeks of getting the fine the system designed to be paperless and environmentally friendly is expensive it costs about &# million a year to run and generates &# million in revenue including fines according to transport for london when mr livingstone proposed expanding the zone in february people protested a government survey found that of residents in the new zone areas opposed the idea on the first day of the expansion people protested by driving their cars slowly around the border of the zone the company that administers the congestion charge capita group plc discovered a letter bomb in february that injured a mail room clerk police have arrested and charged a year old in the attack one of several at traffic enforcement offices at the time but havent said what the motive was he is due to face trial next month acupuncturist roison golding opened her new clinic in wandsworth five miles outside the city in may because she thought it would be impossible to convince many clients to drive through the congestion zone "i knew they wouldnt drive in because they resent it " she says "its so much harassment driving a car around london anyway " one of the few times shell drive into the city is to pick up her year old grandmother who visits from ireland once a year otherwise ms golding says "im not going to take the risk of going anywhere near the city " some shop owners and restaurants say they are worried their business will suffer because fewer people are driving into town and the london chamber of commerce and industry a business group says it has anecdotal evidence that the charge is hurting shops but a page study of the plan by transport for london concluded it hadnt damaged business people stay away because "its not just about the money its the hassle factor" of having to pay says jane morris owner of percy bass an interior design shop in kensington so far she hasnt noticed a drop in customers at her shop but she says she is worried she led shopkeepers in two protest marches against the charge the zones expansion placed one of the citys large hospitals chelsea &amp westminster yards inside the zone suddenly the hospitals emergency room was busiest just after p m when the zone stops operating instead of at p m says chief executive heather lawrence "maybe the er patients are not as urgent as they thought they were " ms lawrence says people who can prove they drove through the zone for a genuine medical emergency can get a refund but that doesnt include women in labor a spokeswoman for transport for london says when hazel keegan went into labor she went to the university college hospital in central london by ambulance her husband drove to visit her the next day but he was so distracted he forgot the pay the charge a few weeks later the couple was home with their new son ryan when a fine arrived in the mail for about &# "we were furious " ms keegan says "we just knew it wasnt worth contesting it because they really do not care " about one million fines were issued last year to people who didnt pay the charge according to transport for london many foreign embassies dont pay arguing the charge is a tax and cant be levied on diplomats under international law the u s embassy has racked up more than &# million in fines prompting mr livingstone to publicly call u s ambassador robert tuttle a "little crook " a spokeswoman for the u s embassy susan domowitz declined to comment but referred to a statement issued by the embassy last year saying british embassies dont pay taxes in the u s drivers who believe they have been unfairly fined can appeal to the road user charging adjudicator tribunal which was set up to handle complaints about fines it received about appeals last year the tribunals adjudicators lawyers who hear traffic cases part time reject most in writing the tribunal says but each year several thousand people opt to argue their cases before an adjudicator the tribunal is housed in an old office building near trafalgar square in the morning people gather in the foyer waiting to be ushered up to the small hearing rooms which contain little more than a few chairs a desk and a computer one recent morning at the tribunals offices rich asherman a year old policeman pleaded his case in a minute hearing mr asherman said he simply forgot to pay "one hundred pounds about &# is completely disproportionate to my mistake " he said the adjudicator timothy smith rejected his appeal on the spot and ordered him to pay a few days before flying to sri lanka for his honeymoon last october richard williams drove through the zone without realizing he returned home six weeks later to a letter from a collection agency demanding &# for failing to pay the fine soon after a bailiff from a debt collection agency turned up at his country home and clamped his mercedes car he complained to the collection agency which agreed he could pay about &# instead "i certainly keep my eyes open when i drive into london now " mr williams says still for some people living in the zone there are benefits they say streets are quieter making it easier to find parking spaces in kensington and chelsea parking meter payments are down since the neighborhoods were included in the zone earlier this year because people leave their cars outside the zone according to a spokesman for the local council when june adams returned from an art exhibition at londons royal academy few weeks ago she found a space in front of her north kensington home on what had previously been a crowded street ms adams is waiting for second hip replacement surgery and walks with a cane so liked being so close to the house "its also a lot more pleasant to walk the dog " says her husband eddie "i think londons traffic was appalling and it needed sorting out " says nick jones who owns the soho house clubs in london and new york the congestion charge "has helped to do that " mr jones says the tax hasnt affected his businesses which include a restaurant cinema and night club in notting hill part of area included in the zone this year but expanding the zone this year has had one counterintuitive effect the number of vehicles in the original area rose from last year to thats because the residents who live in the newly included area are now free to drive downtown without paying any more than it costs to travel their own streets like john daly a fund manager who lives in an apartment near hyde park mr daly says his wife now regularly drives to his mayfair office to pick him up friday afternoons he used to catch the train home
