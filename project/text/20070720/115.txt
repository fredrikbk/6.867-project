weekend journal review film hairspray is campy fun but travolta is a drag a turbocharged tracy sci fi epic sunshine careens into deep space next to the canny pop score the chief charm of the hit broadway musical "hairspray" is its utterly boundless energy a few songs have gone missing from "hairspray" the movie musical the latest iteration of john waterss cult favorite but the energy well to paraphrase the shows climactic number "you cant stop the energy " "hairspray " which concerns the efforts of a big hearted s adolescent to integrate an "american bandstand" style tv dance party is lively pretty good fun and as exhausting as a richard simmons exercise video when director rob marshall brought the hit broadway musical "chicago" to the screen it became a whole other entity reconceived and rethought only dna testing could have made its paternity clear the movie version of the hit broadway musical "the producers " on the other hand had no such reimagining it was a flat footed and utterly flat transfer to celluloid with the stage roots showing "hairspray" falls somewhere between the two admittedly no new ground is broken here indeed with its necco wafer palette dance dream sequences and characters suddenly and unaccountably bursting into song the movie is a throwback to mgm musicals of the s but its a giddy unselfconscious throwback that in itself is refreshing a triple espresso jolt named nikki blonsky plays tracy turnblad a chubby irrepressible stump of a teenager who gotta dance gotta dance dreams of becoming a regular on the "corny collins show" read dick clark those extra pounds make tracy a nonstarter in the eyes of wyzts viperous station manager velma von tussle michelle pfeiffer wonderfully over the top whose daughter amber brittany snow is the shows reigning sweetheart but when corny sees tracys moves at a school sock hop shes anointed and much to the rage of the von tussles becomes a viewer favorite cornys outreach is admirable and of course necessary for the plot but with all due respect to ms blonsky her terpsichorean skills are nothing special the racist velma who gives "negro" teenagers the dance floor exactly once a month is further exercised by tracys on air wish after all shes learned her snazziest footwork from black classmates to have every day be negro day the integration issue was reasonably well handled on stage here it comes across as preachy the subsequent civil rights march with the curiously subdued queen latifah leading the charge has the unfortunate effect of stopping the movie in its tracks one of the enduring camp conventions of "hairspray" is that tracys plus size mother edna is played by a man in drag john travoltas donning of mrs turnblads housedress has received far more attention than it or his performance warrants except for one deftly tossed off "pulp fiction" salute the jape falls flat mr travoltas specific contributions to the role are an overlay of creepiness and an impossible to place accent in the musical numbers where by rights mr travolta should shine hes almost out danced and certainly out charmed by ednas better half wilbur christopher walken who is one of the movies great assets an oasis of calm amid the twisting and shouting sunshine those who share al gores concerns about global warming point to the shrinking polar ice cap they talk about the dangers of rising sea levels the likelihood of severe droughts of more frequent and powerful hurricanes but so far there hasnt been a single word about the collateral damage of global warming movies like danny boyles "sunshine " a warmed over stew of sci fi and gothic horror with bits of "alien " " a space odyssey" and "ten little indians" thrown in its the mid st century and for reasons not made clear in alex garlands incoherent script the sun is dying unless something is done and fast mankind is doomed seven years earlier a manned spacecraft was launched armed with a bomb apparently the nuclear version of defibrillator paddles to boost the wattage of the star at the center of the solar system things went awry the spaceship was apparently lost in the cosmos now aboard icarus ii unfaltering recall of greek mythology is not advantageous here a crew of eight is trying again in fact "sunshine" has a promising takeoff the exposition is crisp and imaginatively executed the visual effects stunning but when the astronauts hear a recognizable radio signal they decide to veer off course and investigate soon after the movie careens off course as well instead of going where no man has gone before "sunshine" inhabits familiar territory there are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft the banal speechifying about the fate of mankind the issue of who will live and who will die who cares the characters are so sketchily drawn that its hard to keep them straight let alone get worked up about their survival i now pronounce you chuck and larry its not much of an achievement these days for a movie to disparage one or another ethnic group race religion political party or sexual orientation some like "borat " managed to offend several in under two hours the synthetic insufferable "i now pronounce you chuck and larry" manages to insult gays straights men women children african americans asians pastors mailmen insurance adjusters firemen doctors and fans of show music thats championship stuff larry valentine kevin james and chuck levine adam sandler are best friends and fellow firemen and as the filmmakers are at pains to make clear heterosexuals larrys a widower and still mourning his wife so thats why he isnt getting anything like the action of ladies man chuck an unreconstructed mattress tester if ever there was one when larry saves his buddys life on the job a grateful chuck wants to return the favor and larry has quite the favor in mind a thicket of red tape is preventing him from naming his two children as pension and life insurance beneficiaries to protect the kids interests uncle chuck need simply declare himself larrys domestic partner all on the qt of course when a prissy bureaucrat begins checking on the legitimacy of the arrangement with javert like fervor the two men hire a lawyer jessica biel with whom chuck is immediately smitten get married she urges her new clients the inevitable complications make chuck and larrys relationship front page news and a cause celebre in the guise of lampooning gay stereotypes "i now pronounce you chuck and larry" simply reinforces them there are witless attempts to wring humor from the nudge nudge wink wink fondness of larrys young son for tap dancing and belting out show tunes this is a movie determined to have it both ways blending empty piety why cant we all just accept one another with prurience in one cringe inducing scene ms biel clad only in bra and panties bemoans the fact that everyone believes her breasts are silicone and invites chuck to conduct a personal inspection his carefully considered opinion theyre real if so theyre the only things in the movie that are dvd tip kevin klines wedding to fellow teacher joan cusack is just days off when hes made to realize hes gay in the sharp hilarious "in &amp out" joe morgenstern is on vacation
