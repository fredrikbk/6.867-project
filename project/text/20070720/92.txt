musharraf pakistans president and a key u s ally is becoming even trickier on friday pakistans supreme court reinstated the nations top judge ruling that his suspension by gen musharraf was "illegal" and quashed a separate case of alleged misconduct by the chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry chief justice chaudhrys suspension last march the government said he used his position to help secure a police job for his son and took advantage of privileges such as using government aircraft sparked protests by lawyers and political opponents that has since blossomed into a powerful democratic movement the government insisted the case had no political motive and that gen musharraf had little choice under the constitution but to suspend chief justice chaudhry but opponents accused gen
