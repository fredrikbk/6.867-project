weekend journal tastings looking past big names little known wines can reap big benefits a genuine appreciation andrew barker grew up near napa valley with a wine called charbono and still has a soft spot for it not to mention one last bottle of inglenooks charbono ask mr barker who now lives in seattle whats so special about charbono and he links adjectives "tradition great structure cachet " just for starters and we know how he feels we too remember the charbono of our youth big spicy and proud the most memorable bottle we ever had was a inglenook that we drank in with veal chops "delicious " we wrote "lots of black fruit yet a real dryness mature but not at all over the hill " never tried a charbono its not too late there is still some out there theyre hard to find but they exist along with some made in the u s a valdiguie and cinsault and even rkatsiteli the world is full of interesting different grape types walk into just about any store and you might think every acre is planted with only chardonnay merlot sauvignon blanc shiraz pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon but passionate committed american vintners continue to make small amounts of all sorts of wine often for their own amusement because they personally like the wine or for sentimental reasons these are wines that you will rarely read about because they are so quirky and made in such small quantities as a group though there are quite a few of them out there some are made from grapes that are simply obscure others are made from grapes that are common somewhere else in the world but rare in the u s we cant stress this too strongly when you see a varietal on the shelves that youve never seen before give it a try and youre likely to have a fun interesting experience its impossible to know if you will like the wine but part of the fun of wine is experiencing the unknown one important lesson on the road to a genuine love of wine is appreciating wines that might not be exactly your cup of tea we spent a little while visiting wine stores in new york and florida recently to see what kind of unusual american varietals we could find we tasted them over several nights not blind because we only had one or two of each type and heres a half case of our favorites we list them only to give an idea of the very unusual stuff on shelves and some sense of the interesting stories behind them we have listed the price we paid but prices especially on unusual stuff vary widely mahoney vineyards vermentino las brisas vineyard carneros &# if youve never heard of vermentino youre not alone its better known in sardinia for instance than in the u s this was dry crisp clean refreshing and fun why use choice land in carneros for such an odd grape francis mahoney told us that he makes vermentino because of a vow to his wife kathy during a visit to her family home in liguria italy in "i made a promise to my wife that ill plant every varietal that your family puts in front of us " said mr mahoney whose winery is better known for its pinot noir he searched for some cuttings and eventually planted vines "we just loved the bright fresh taste of it its like a white peach when we introduced it in our tasting room we had to teach people to spell it and then to pronounce it two years later we ran out of it in seven days it was unbelievable " the winery makes around cases and its distributed in about states shooting star aligote washington state &# aligote is the "other" white grape in burgundy where chardonnay rules this was charming and earthy with some weight and clearly meant for food there are just five acres of aligote in washington why is jed steele who first became famous as the winemaker at kendall jackson making one an old friend made an aligote in washington and used to send some to mr steele "he was so proud of it and i became a fan " mr steele said in time the winery in washington was bought by a large company that had no use for the aligote so mr steele decided to purchase the grapes himself he makes from to cases and its distributed across the country lecole no "bottle fermented" semillon columbia valley &# semillon is a traditional blending partner with sauvignon blanc both for dry and sweet wines it adds richness and some weight but its unusual to see it as a varietal in the u s this is sauvignon blanc this was quite a wine with earthy richness that demanded attention lecole produces four semillons including a late harvest one "sometimes i joke that thats three semillons too many " said martin clubb who owns the winery with his wife megan whose parents baker and jean ferguson founded the winery it has been making semillon since mr clubb told us because his father in law loved white bordeaux from graves "and that kind of set us down that road " he explained that "after years of hand selling the wine hoping that some day it would garnish some recognition the last several years have been rewarding for our semillon we always felt we were pushing a new wine onto people it doesnt feel that way anymore were known for it now its our niche white wine " its distributed in about states and a little more than half of it goes to restaurants the winery produces from to cases of this semillon each year konstantin d frank &amp sons vinifera wine cellars rkatsiteli finger lakes &# and you thought viognier was hard to pronounce this is pronounced something like "r cat si telly " its crisp and floral with peaches kiwi and lychee and a shake of white pepper its planted throughout eastern europe but is very rare in the u s this has been a little specialty of this new york winery for years frederick frank who inherited the winery started by his grandfather after his fathers death last year says the wine has become so popular that the family added acreage of it so it now has acres the winery produces about cases that are distributed in states "theres a lot of interest in this varietal because it is one of the oldest known wine grapes going back thousands of years they have found seeds of it in early clay pottery used for winemaking and at one time it was one of the most widely planted grapes " mr frank said st amant winery tempranillo amador county &# tempranillo is the great grape of spains rioja but its pretty unusual in california the st amant was exceptionally smooth with blueberries blackberries plums and a dash of lemon with a very nice earthiness underneath in the late tim spencer who loved port grafted more than two acres of zinfandel vines to five traditional douro valley port varietals his first "port" was bottled in and he was so happy with it that he eventually started experimenting with tempranillo his son stuart co owner and winemaker told us "it was a natural progression he was always looking for alternative things to do " mr spencer said "our opinion has always been that there are thousands of wines in the marketplace and thousands of wineries and you need a niche we found this one and we think our wines do well with our soil and our climate " the winery makes about cases of tempranillo a year that are distributed to five states and like many unusual wines shipped directly from the winery to consumers in states where thats allowed summers winery charbono villa andriana vineyard napa valley &# this takes us full circle and its a good example of our point that these wines are out there somewhere we werent looking for charbono but happened to see this on a shelf in new york weve been fans of summers charbono since we first tasted it at the winery a few years ago its like an old friend it has a beautiful deep red purple color and tastes of ripe red berries with a surprising vitality from good acidity it reminds us of a very drinkable italian red there are just about acres of charbono in california jim summers the co owner says that in he saw an advertisement for the winery in the wall street journal and "purposely bought the wine property because it had charbono on it i was fascinated with it but it was the rodney dangerfield of wine for the first couple or three years " in those first years his primary buyers were the members of the charbono society at inglenook now summers has to limit purchases at the winery to two bottles per customer the winery distributes the to cases it makes in states "sometimes i joke that were the ernest gallo of charbono " mr summers says because he says no other california winery makes that much in fact mr summers said he always wondered how many wineries produced charbono so a few years ago they all got together and there were producing a total of around cases "we love the wine " he says "its a big part of who we are " melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com
