weekend journal taste houses of worship the dems fate on the left wing and a prayer in a speech on tuesday barack obama told his audience that the presidential election would answer the question "what kind of america will our daughters grow up in " what one might wonder does he want to protect our daughters from an oversexualized culture predators on the internet alas no mr obama was addressing a planned parenthood convention and worried that if the wrong person got into the white house our daughters might grow up in a country without partial birth abortions polls conducted by the pew forum on religion and public life show that americans believe the democrats to be less friendly to faith than they had been even a few years ago yet a donkey with a halo over his head graces the cover of time magazine this week and the story inside chronicles "how the democrats got religion " from faith working groups to faith breakfasts mr obama hillary clinton and john edwards are all participating in what strategist mike mccurry tells time is "a great awakening in the democratic party " and as far as leslie brown is concerned the democrats are making progress ms brown the coordinator of the faith in action initiative at the democratic national committee says she is working for a "big tent party " with plenty of room for people of faith she tells me for instance that "evangelicals often get painted in broad strokes as a monolith " but theyre not efforts to get these potential swing voters include speeches by dnc chair howard dean at various religious institutions and the addition of both national and local religious leaders to the organizations advisers kim gandy president of the national organization for women is probably less than excited by such initiatives she recently said in a speech "i dont want a progressive evangelical movement any more than i want the conservative one we have right now " so do ms gandy and the secular wing of the party constitute a problem for democrats in can mr obama appeal to the faithful of planned parenthood and rick warrens saddleback church at the same time according to jesse lava co founder of an online community of christian democrats called faithfuldemocrats com the two groups can agree on "promoting the common good" specifically protecting the environment and reducing poverty while having diverse views on some social issues but how practical is this plan in their contribution to a new book from the brookings institution called "faith matters " pew fellow john c green and three other scholars compare what they call "the core religious left" and secular liberals the former whom mr green calls religious modernists are churchgoers who generally favor womens ordination do not believe in biblical inerrancy and are split on the question of whether all religions are equally true the latter the secularists do not hold religious beliefs or engage in religious practices demographically the differences between the two groups are "dramatic " according to the authors of secularists have college degrees versus of modernists of secularists have incomes over &# versus of modernists and of secularists are white compared with of modernists in addition secularists congregate in the northeast and west the least religious regions of the country the authors conclude "all these differences are likely to complicate cooperation between secular liberals and religious left groups " and what about the issues does their liberal outlook hold these groups together not exactly among secularists are pro choice on abortion while only of modernists are and of secularists favor gay rights compared with of modernists theres a point gap between the groups on school vouchers and a point one on whether the ten commandments should be posted in public places even on economic issues the divide is great of secularists are against tax cuts compared with only of religious liberals and theres a point difference on the use of pre emptive force in u s foreign policy if this is how far secularists are from the core religious left just imagine the distance to a more traditional religious voter ms brown who hasnt read "faith matters" denies that democrats will need to do anything besides attend religious events talk to religious people and advertise on christian radio to increase their flock among churchgoers but thats unlikely to get them anywhere if the party platforms are still the same to win over the religious left the candidates could moderate their positions on certain issues but louis bolce a political scientist at baruch college in new york tells me that "radical secularism has such a stranglehold that house democrats by a to margin could not bring themselves to vote in favor of keeping god in the pledge of allegiance " in addition to making up almost a fifth of democratic voters in the election secularists are the most active members of the party more likely to give money and go to rallies for instance than their religious peers to judge by the candidates pledges to teachers unions abortion advocates and other interest groups theyre not going to risk offending the irreligious by shifting their liberal stances alternatively the democrats could simply speak in more religious terms which theyre occasionally doing now a policy shift or more god talk could annoy the partys secularists but enough to make them stay home next november probably not because lets be honest no one thinks the election is going to be decided on gay marriage secularists probably wont risk having a president who will keep the troops in iraq just to make a point about abortion interestingly the fact that the election will not be determined by social issues may make it a watershed for both parties despite the protests of some evangelical leaders the republicans may nominate a vocally pro choice politician for the first time in a quarter century and the democrats may start to sneak god back under their big tent ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
