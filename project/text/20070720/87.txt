redstone split bears on future of viacom cbs a falling out between viacom inc chairman sumner redstone and his daughter and heir apparent shari redstone is raising questions about future control of mr redstones media empire which includes cbs corp mr redstone years old is no longer confident his year old daughter should succeed him as controlling shareholder and chairman when he dies according to people familiar with the situation through his lawyers he is in negotiations with her to end her involvement with the media empire the talks are likely to lead to ms redstones departure from the boards of viacom and cbs at both of which she is nonexecutive vice chairman ms redstone isnt likely to go happily a spokeswoman for her said she isnt stepping down from either board and remains "committed and involved " one person familiar with the situation said she would likely want a big price to be bought out of her interest in the family empire one option that has been explored is for mr redstone to transfer to his daughter the familys theater chain which she already manages the chain operates more than theaters in the u s as well in latin america england and russia mr redstone like the patriarchs of some other family companies appears torn between wanting to pass his business on to his descendents and not wanting to let go associates sometimes joke that mr redstone is determined to live forever he certainly wants to remain intertwined with the company that is so much a part of his identity the business which like any whose boss is an octogenarian needs a succession plan is caught in the middle at the heart of the dispute is ms redstones right to succeed her father as chairman of viacom and cbs while mr redstone has said in the past that his daughter would "likely" succeed him a couple of years ago he agreed to changes in trust documents relating to his estate planning to say that she would succeed her father if he died while she was on the board according to two people familiar with the situation father and daughter are now in dispute over the meaning of this provision the people say ms redstone believes her succession is automatic mr redstone believes it is conditional allowing ms redstone to automatically succeed her father means that she could take over against the wishes of the rest of the board said one person close to the situation in a brief interview yesterday mr redstone said "i have always believed and i have consistently stated my view that proper governance requires that the boards of public companies like viacom and cbs should be the ones to select my successor " on wall street the dispute raises questions about whether the redstone family is more likely to sell viacom or cbs speculation has swirled in recent months that mr redstone may sell cbs to private equity firms although mr redstone has said he isnt considering such a plan but if mr redstone succeeds in buying his daughter out of the family company he alone would own his familys stakes in viacom and cbs that could make sale of the investments more likely on his death investors pushed up the stocks of viacom and cbs yesterday viacom class b shares rose almost to &# and cbs class b shares were up a bit less than to &# ms redstone is the latest high level figure to fall out with mr redstone since the brilliant but prickly investor acquired control of viacom in in he forced frank biondi out as ceo and took the reins himself in mel karmazin quit as president after four years of friction with mr redstone last september mr redstone by then executive chairman of viacom ousted ceo tom freston and appointed philippe dauman who himself had been forced to leave as deputy chairman in when viacom acquired cbs through much of this time viacom was growing into a major entertainment industry power owning highly successful cable networks like mtv nickelodeon and comedy central as well as paramount pictures studio and for while cbs tv and radio in recent years its growth has stalled as viewers spent more time on the internet mr redstone spun off cbs as a separate company at the start of last year hoping to boost shareholder returns cbs stock has surged viacom has done much less well leading to mr frestons ouster the cable channels have struggled to adapt to competition from the internet the father daughter dispute comes less than six months after mr redstone settled a lawsuit filed by his son brent by buying out his interest in the family holding company for about &# million the suit had alleged that mr redstone led a campaign to freeze his son out of the family business the settlement left mr redstone with of the family holding company national amusements inc and shari with the rest its properties include controlling interests in viacom and cbs videogame concern midway games and the national amusements theater chain mr redstone still faces another lawsuit in which a nephew contends he and other family members were deprived of their inheritance national amusements has called the allegations "baseless " brent redstones suit valued national amusements at &# billion putting a &# billion value on his sisters current stake the settlement of this suit seemed to cement ms redstones status as heir apparent ms redstone began her career as a criminal defense lawyer after having three children she went to work for the theater chain which her grandfather had founded she became its president in and has guided its expansion into south america and russia just a year ago mr redstone was keen to raise her profile in march of that year he traveled to new york to attend what company executives called her "coming out " a luncheon presentation at a media conference at the palace hotel mr redstone sat a table toward the front with his grandchildren sharis children and senior executives shari outlined her strategy for national amusements and why she believed movie theaters have a bright future mr redstone clapped enthusiastically at the end of her talk beneath the surface tension was building while ms redstone ran the theater business her father wouldnt give her the ceo title which he retained late last year ms redstone unveiled plans to add gaming to the theaters and told the wall street journal she was confident of the theater businesss future mr redstone said he was less optimistic about it and that he thought national amusements should cash out of the business and expand in areas like casinos which he saw as having more growth potential ms redstones growing involvement with viacom and cbs in addition to the theater chain added to the tension she appeared to want to prove she had something to add to those companies beyond her relationship with her father say people familiar with the situation that sometimes meant she would take on her father publicly say these people which they say infuriated mr redstone according to these people mr redstone appeared to feel the two should present a common front as a family and also that he was more of an expert in matters concerning viacom and cbs whats more mr redstone was not impressed with the way she handled relations with board members the people said the disagreements at times led to such friction that the two didnt talk to each other for weeks the people familiar with the situation say they say the relationship got so tense that mr redstone and his daughter sometimes communicated only by fax last year and more recently only through legal representatives mr redstones relationship with his daughter was tested when he divorced her mother phyllis to whom he had been married for years before they split up and married paula fortunato a schoolteacher from new jersey whom he had met on a blind date shari was close to phyllis redstone who like her lived in boston mr redstone lived mostly in new york in the carlyle hotel but moved to los angeles with his new wife who was several years younger than shari the newlyweds bought a house in the exclusive north beverly gated community in the hollywood hills mr redstone discovered a new life entertaining his hollywood friends with paula they held dinner parties attended by such hollywood figures as steven spielberg david geffen and jeffrey katzenberg mr redstone also rarely missed the premieres of paramount movies turning up on the red carpet with paula to give interviews for his wifes th birthday earlier this year he hired one of her favorite singers michael mcdonald to play in the living room of their house before around friends and business associates paula drank champagne and danced to songs such as "yah mo b there" with her friends and family from new jersey including her sister lillian and brother in law jim who have become close to the couple the redstones travel together on business trips most recently to turkey where mr redstone launched a new mtv channel and met with government officials against that backdrop shari redstone found it increasingly difficult to get her fathers attention earlier this year mr redstone said in a cnbc interview that "my wife is closer to me these days than my daughter " the boston globe reported in april that lawyers for both shari redstone and phyllis redstone wrote letters to the national amusements board protesting that a large gift mr redstone wanted to give to three health care centers in the name of his private foundation should instead be marked as having come from national amusements which controlled a company that was providing some of the funds the board rejected their plea adding to the strains have been difficult relations between ms redstone and cbs chief executive leslie moonves say two people familiar with the situation one particular point of tension was ms redstones efforts to gain support on the cbs board to persuade mr moonves to restructure his compensation package according to people familiar with the situation a cbs spokesman declined to comment
