what do we want in a surgeon general a yes man or an advocate your july editorial "surgeon corporal" asserts that political appointees should resign rather than compromise their beliefs you even suggest they could choose to speak up anyway offering a few examples of predecessors who did just that by that standard there are many other appointees who failed the test colin powell and george tenet come to mind though much like richard carmona both believed apparently in error that they could make important changes by staying longer you breezily counsel appointees to expect to toe the line on ideological matters while also scolding them for not resigning rather than compromising their judgments so is it loyal yes man service that we should expect from appointees or should the appointees speak up for what they believe is in the best interests of all americans and just resign unlike your editorial page most americans want a surgeon general who offers them advice informed by the best science available without the prism of partisan political spin the case of dr carmona highlights the ideology before facts mindset of president bushs management he often knows he is right without having anything to support his claim such tunnel vision and the desire to surround oneself with yes men have yielded the worst possible management mistakes in business and political history president bush has ignored fact based assessments that run against his beliefs at every turn james mccrane newtown pa your editorial neglected some of former surgeon general richard carmonas more prominent deficiencies he often got the science wrong in he testified before the house energy and commerce committee "no matter what you may hear today or read in press reports later i cannot conclude that the use of any tobacco product is a safer alternative to smoking " that statement is manifestly untrue it had been known for almost a decade that switching from smoking to smokeless tobacco is a lifesaver all forms of tobacco are not equally risky smokeless tobacco causes neither lung cancer nor other pulmonary diseases nor do its users experience an enhanced risk of heart attacks oral cancers are the only important adverse health effect of smokeless tobacco and they are relatively infrequent about half as great as in smokers in a position that lacks a significant budget or staff and whose impact depends on visibility and moral suasion dr carmona was virtually invisible toward the end of his four year stint as surgeon general in an informal poll that i conducted only five of experts in public health and public policy could identify the current surgeon general even when offered a multiple choice format many thought the post had been abolished a couple of years ago dr carmona spoke to an audience of scholars here at stanford universitys hoover institution thirty five of his forty minutes were devoted to self serving autobiography the remaining five minutes offered no specifics but merely a promise to "implement the public health policies of the president " that was not what policy wonks came to hear perhaps the most revealing insight into dr carmonas tell all congressional testimony is that after enduring the alleged muzzling political interference and manipulation for four years he asked to continue in the job he was turned down henry i miller m d the hoover institution stanford calif as a politically appointed official the surgeon general should follow the overall directive of the president however he should never be silenced for suggesting policies or discussing facts that do not completely agree with the presidents narrow beliefs this practice is devastating to the foundation and traditions of our government unlike every recent president who has installed people of various beliefs in their administrations for well rounded advice president bush surrounds himself with yes men and shuts out any original ideas while he is clearly not required to follow the surgeon generals advice it is sound historical practice to at least listen to him why have an adviser if youll only listen to him when he says what you want to hear blake albohm washington
