dow jones board member quits in protest german publishing heir cites news corp deal net falls on charges dieter von holtzbrinck an heir to a german publishing empire resigned from dow jones &amp co s board of directors to protest the boards decision to endorse a &# billion offer from news corp "although im convinced that news corp offer is very generous in financial terms " he wrote in a letter to directors thursday "im very worried that dow jones unique journalistic values will long term strongly suffer after the proposed sale " mr von holtzbrinck abstained from a board vote endorsing news corp chairman rupert murdochs offer tuesday evening a vote that put the future of dow jones in the hands of the bancroft family who control of the companys shareholder voting power the vote was otherwise unanimous except for two of the four board members representing the family but the family is divided on the news corp offer mr von holtzbrincks resignation is mostly of symbolic importance if the deal goes through he wouldnt be a board member any more it nevertheless could resonate with the bancrofts as the family prepares to convene next week to vote on the sale and perhaps sever its century long connection to dow jones and its flagship paper the wall street journal the familys ambivalence still makes such a vote too close to call and investors appear to agree dow joness shares continued their drift below the &# a share offered by news corp closing thursday at &# the slip reflects the markets view that the deal may not pass muster with the family stocks in takeover deals almost always trade below their offer price due to risks in final closing and financing conditions but this gap known as the arbitrage spread is a bit wider than usual in this case the uncertainty of the familys position is making traders question whether it is worth paying &# to earn another &# all the while they may be facing the risk that the stock would fall to around &# a share or less should the bancrofts reject the deal dow jones also yesterday reported a drop in second quarter net income on stock compensation and restructuring charges the company took a charge of &# million or cents a share as the takeover related stock surge inflated expenses for employee stock based pay dow joness stock increased sharply after news corp s offer became public in may the shares had been trading in the mid s before the offer became public the company also reported a charge of &# million or seven cents a share due mainly to the elimination of about positions primarily in its consumer media group

dynasties in addition to the business daily handelsblatt his family publishes berlins tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche in the u s the company owns six trade book publishers including st martins press and farrar straus &amp giroux three college textbook companies and scientific american magazine mr von holtzbrinck said his concerns about the news corp offer were based on news corp s business practices and the objections raised by other shareholders such as james ottaway who has been an outspoken critic of mr murdoch "i cannot prove that my worries are right " wrote mr von holtzbrinck "i can only refer to news corp business practices in the past can only refer to jim ottaways article in the journal etc " mr von holtzbrinck said in his letter that he didnt believe that a "special committee" on editorial independence would protect dow joness journalistic integrity dow jones and news corp have agreed on a set of editorial principles to protect dow joness independence in the event of a takeover by news corp those principles include a five member committee that would serve as a buffer between news corp management and dow joness editorial staff "i do not believe that the "special committee" can finally prevent mr murdoch from doing what he wants to do from acting his way " mr von holtzbrinck wrote "dieter von holtzbrinck has served dow jones with distinction as a director since " said m peter mcpherson chairman of the board of dow jones "the board has accepted his resignation with regrets and we wish him well " after running the family

to his good relationship with mr kann "dieter von holtzbrinck was a distinguished principled publisher a dedicated dow jones director and a good friend of dow jones and mine " said mr kann like the bancrofts mr von holtzbrincks family has watched the value of its assets decline amid a difficult business climate for newspapers and magazines while internet advertising has yet to make the same inroads in germany that it has in the u s holtzbrincks flagship handelsblatt faces a much more difficult competitive landscape than the journal in recent years the newspaper has been forced to make deep cost cuts yet closely held holtzbrinck has maintained its independence and the family has resisted the temptation to sell mr von holtzbrinck is known to have prized the independence of the companys journalism a fact that may have contributed to his decision to abstain from a vote on the news corp deal and subsequently resign separately the sec has notified dow jones director david li the chairman and chief executive of bank of east asia ltd that it plans to recommend filing civil charges against him it is unclear exactly what the sec case against mr li is built on or what law they
