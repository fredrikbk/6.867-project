weekend journal taste de gustibus the nanny state diaries echoing h l mencken humorist p j orourke once quipped that conservatives are a group of stiff collared puritans with a "haunting fear that someone somewhere may be having fun " he should have joined me at the recent fifth annual alcohol tobacco and firearms summer gala hosted by a right leaning colorado think tank the independence institute at a gun club in kiowa colo this years theme was "stop the growth of the nanny state" but it might as well have been "live free or die hard " every activity seemed designed to annoy hillary clinton there was a whole lot of drinking smoking and shooting but thankfully not in that order during the morning hours we carried nine pound rifles through the woods shooting pellets at clay pigeons flung into the air by a m the park was alive with the continuous claps of gunfire and hollering "ahh dont you love the sound of freedom " exalted jon caldara the president of the institute this was a family affair with many gun toting children and women participating the "girly man" of the group i managed to hit all of two clay pigeons the entire morning and i didnt so much break them into pieces as inflict minor wounds when mr caldara introduced me as the lunch speaker he said "moore is reportedly with the wall street journal editorial page but after watching him shoot a gun today i wonder if it isnt the new york times " i live in the nations capital where guns are illegal and so the closest ive come to a firearm was the time i was mugged walking home from work in i was equally out of my element in when working for the republicans in congress i found myself in rural georgia trying to rally voters encircled by a boisterous crowd of gun enthusiasts most of them dressed in military fatigues and holding their rifles at the ready position as i electioneered i ended my rally the troops talk "and that is why we have to take over the house of representatives in " one middle age woman held her gun over her head nudged herself to the front of the crowd and in a deep southern drawl asked "son do you mean by force " no i didnt nice idea though many of the folks at the institutes um policy forum had come from all over the state to have a good time sure but they also had a deeper motivation to stick their tongues out figuratively at the tyrant politicians in washington and denver who keep enacting rules about how they should run their lives these people are just dog tired of having the government tell them what to do buckle your seat belt wear your bike helmet dont smoke dont shoot teach your year olds to wear condoms and most of all stop complaining and pay your taxes one participant was incensed that denver now has a law requiring that every dog be neutered unless the owner gets a government permit allowing the animal to reproduce on the left even sex is becoming taboo then there are the more mundane rules there was a discussion over lunch at my picnic table about how congress is regulating nearly every basic household appliance refrigerators washers and dryers toilets hair dryers shower heads lawnmowers to make sure that we are not god forbid wasting water or energy a woman told me that she is stocking up on cartons of incandescent light bulbs because soon it will be illegal to buy them the poor lady insisted on remaining anonymous so that the light bulb police dont come to search her home the buzzword on the left nowadays is "tolerance" for those with different lifestyles like cross dressers but almost everything that these folks want to do liberals wont tolerate one smoker lamented that if "gays were discriminated against today the way smokers are there would be an uproar " gun owners have reason to be fearful too in a recent blog interview on moveon org john edwards of north carolina proclaimed that health care child care a livable wage and a clean environment are "rights " but owning a gun is a "privilege " the men and women who gathered in kiowa would like to send him a copy of the constitution im not a smoker or a gun owner and not much of a drinker other than at margarita parties but as mae west once cracked "sometimes i dont drink so the next day i can remember having fun " the gathering in kiowa was pure joy and i suspect that if liberals would loosen their puritan collars and start showing real tolerance of conservative "alternative lifestyles " theyd be having more fun too mr moore is a member of the journals editorial board
