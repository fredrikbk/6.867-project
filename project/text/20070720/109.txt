unusually structured reit got bid now fund founder is being sued shareholders of an unusual real estate investment fund are suing the funds founder claiming that the fund failed to disclose a takeover offer and instead paid &# million in stock for a group of companies he controlled under the terms of the takeover offer shareholders would have received higher payouts if the fund didnt buy the companies from the founder leo wells iii the year old founder of wells real estate funds based in norcross ga personally received roughly &# million of the &# million purchase price as the predominant owner of the companies which had been paid millions in management fees by the fund wells real estate investment trust meanwhile the would be acquirer of the fund has launched a tender offer for roughly of the funds shares giving its shareholders until today to tender their shares the controversy involves one of the quirkiest corners of the booming commercial real estate industry wells real estate investment trust is a real estate investment trust that acts just like the reits that have been hugely popular with investors it takes investor money and buys office buildings and the like then pays out the income they generate to its shareholders the key distinction is wellss shares arent listed on a stock exchange instead investors can only sell the shares back to the fund the fund now owns about office buildings in states that are valued at about &# billion according to standard &amp poors ratings services in essence shareholders own wells real estate investment trust while the management companies were owned primarily by mr wells company officials declined to be interviewed citing a quiet period for fund raising mr wells through a spokesman declined to comment but a company spokesman said in regard to the lawsuit "the reits board has proceeded very diligently and the stockholders were kept informed of all relevant information " he added that the lawsuit had no merit wellss funds have been controversial because they are heavily marketed by brokers who earn high fees for selling the shares though the funds have generally lived up to their billing as relatively safe income producing investments the funds typically have a year life wells reit mr wellss first was launched in with the promise that it would be liquidated or listed on a stock exchange by jan with the deadline approaching mr wells has been preparing the fund for an initial public offering on april shareholders of wells reit were asked to approve the acquisition of a group of mr wellss management companies which had handled the buying selling and managing of wells reit properties the reits directors said this "internalization" would maximize shareholder value and make wells reit more attractive in an ipo shareholders approved the plan paving the way for wells reit to pay &# million in wells reit stock at &# per share to buy the management companies mr wells himself received the lions share of the stock in the transaction about &# million worth according to the shareholder lawsuit mr wellss potential payoff was disclosed to shareholders and he recused himself from the decision by the funds directors about whether to acquire his companies what wells reit directors didnt disclose was that at least one potential suitor offered to buy wells reit and the offer would have been more lucrative to wells shareholders if the fund didnt buy mr wellss management companies that buyout offer came earlier this year from lexington realty trust a publicly traded reit which offered to buy wells reit for one of two prices depending on whether wells reit bought out mr wellss companies if wells reit didnt buy mr wellss companies the offer was &# a share if it did buy the companies the offer was &# a share the latter offer was lower because there would be more shares outstanding if wells reit bought the management companies wells reit directors rebuffed lexingtons offer and didnt tell shareholders about it "its hard to conceive of something thats more important to tell them " said lawrence sucharow of new york based labaton sucharow &amp rudoff llp one of the attorneys representing plaintiffs in a shareholder lawsuit filed in u s district court in maryland labaton sucharow is joined by chimicles &amp tikellis llp as lead counsel in the case which has been transferred to the u s district court in the northern district of georgia in addition to mr wells the lawsuit names wells reit the management companies and wells reit directors as defendants in court filings wells reit said lexingtons offer was "too insubstantial to pursue " the allegations come at a time in which the delaware court of chancery which holds broad sway in corporate law has been critical of companies that failed to disclose incentives to company managements that may effect their position on a deal in a recent letter to wells reit shareholders that was filed with the securities and exchange commission lexington said that wells reit directors never requested more specific information regarding lexingtons financing "your attempt to discount the quality of our proposal due to your own failure to take the most meager steps to create an informed business judgment with respect thereto is unconscionable " wrote michael ashner the chief executive of lex win acquisition llc the joint venture that lexington created to do the tender offer lex win disclosed lexingtons original buyout offer when it made a tender offer to purchase as many as million wells reit shares on may wells reit shareholders have until p m today to decide whether to sell their shares at a price of &# per share regardless how that vote turns out wells reit shareholders could benefit from the companys planned ipo which will allow them to sell their shares on the market but if wells reit doesnt meet the ipo deadline and liquidates instead then it is unclear how wells reit shareholders benefited from paying &# million for the management companies
