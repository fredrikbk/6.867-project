unraveling rahodeb a grocers brash style john mackey has never needed the anonymity of the internet to speak bluntly "im going to destroy you " the co founder and chief executive of whole foods market inc shouted at perry odak ceo of wild oats markets inc the first time the two men met six years ago at a retailing conference in manhattan according to mr odak at that time mr mackey had already established a reputation as a maverick whose growing chain of upscale natural foods stores was shaking up the way traditional grocers did business officials at whole foods say mr mackey tells a different version of the story with milder language but the confrontation has nonetheless become part of his food industry legend mr mackeys combativeness became even more widely known with the revelation last week that he used an alias for nearly eight years to post messages on yahoo finance message boards bashing competitors and praising everything from his companys quarterly financial performance to his own haircut on tuesday mr mackey apologized and the whole foods board announced it will launch an internal investigation the securities and exchange commission is examining the chief executives posts to see if they violated the law mr mackeys online alter ego came to light in a court filing by the federal trade commission which filed a lawsuit last month seeking to block whole foodss planned purchase of wild oats on antitrust grounds meanwhile mr mackeys critics and supporters alike find themselves struggling to explain his behavior while mr mackey has declined interview requests whole foods said in a statement last week that its chairman and ceos online comments attributed to rahodeb an anagram of his wifes name were personal not professional but friends and colleagues of the vegan college dropout say that as mr mackey built the worlds largest natural foods retailer there was little distinction between his professional and personal sides thats why few people close to him were surprised that he tooted his own horn and blasted his critics online their only surprise was that he did it anonymously obviously wfmi is no wal mart not yet anyway rahodeb nov mr mackeys career and a revolution in american supermarkets began in a three story building on eighth street and rio grande in austin texas late in the s there mr mackey and a girlfriend had a health food store called saferway on the first floor a restaurant on the second and a bed on the third a few years later a handful of health food store operators from around the u s began gathering periodically to socialize and talk about the business they were united by two things their powerful belief in the importance of healthy and natural foods and a sense that mainstream grocers dismissed them as a bunch of soy milk sipping hippies with no clue how to run a business "that brought us all together " recalls harry lederman an independent consultant in the natural food business whose wife founded a health food chain in southern california called mrs goochs at one of their gatherings in the mid s mr lederman recalls mr mackey casually mentioned that he thought local health food stores ought to unite to form a national chain he didnt press the point and no discussion followed "he just started doing it " mr lederman says mr mackey fit in nicely among the health food industrys scrappy entrepreneurs he was a six time college dropout curly haired and casually dressed he spoke passionately about food the natural kind politics the libertarian kind and capitalism the aggressive kind colleagues who knew him as a young man say he was and remains today at a man of opposing characteristics forthright and yet distant compassionate and yet cutthroat idealistic and yet capable of compromise mr mackeys mother was a schoolteacher in the houston area his father william s mackey jr was an accounting professor who later became the ceo of a health care company lifemark corp after years of running the company the elder mr mackey engineered its sale in for about &# million before that he lent his son some money to help him get his grocery business off the ground in the younger mr mackey now calling his store whole foods opened outlets in houston and dallas and soon after expanded to new orleans and palo alto calif in the s he took whole foods public and went on a buying binge eventually acquiring small chains including mrs goochs "we didnt have any clue how he put that together " says philip tauber who with his wife gayle founded the kashi cereal brand in "for him to do that he needed to have a compulsive highly competitive leadership quality " as whole foods grew kashi and other brands grew with it foods once regarded as hopelessly unpopular and even unpalatable found a home and a customer base the way i see it the aging of the baby boomers and their quest for health and longevity will fuel whole foods growth for many years to come rahodeb august mr mackey broke not only from the mainstream grocery business but also from many of his peers in the natural food world he built his stores big with room for beer wine and potato chips items that some health conscious merchants refused to carry he also expanded his audience by offering prepared foods from salads to gourmet soups and lasagna in doing so he assured that consumers would do more than pop in for a few items they would make whole foods their primary food store whole foods today is a giant with employees and stores in the u s canada and the united kingdom in the fiscal year ended sept it had a gross profit margin of compared with at kroger co and at safeway inc and sales of &# billion yesterday whole foods shares closed at &# in p m nasdaq composite trading that is up from a split adjusted &# per share in but below the stocks peak of around &# in according to a march regulatory filing mr mackey owned million shares a stake now worth about &# million despite its size and fat profit margins the company has maintained its reputation as a crunchy counter culture operation whole foods donates at least of its annual net income to charity some stores have solar panels in that sense the company still reflects its founders business casual character mr mackey works from the early morning when he reads about management or the environment from a tall stack of books at home to well into the night when he often sends emails to other executives he often wears sandals and khaki pants or shorts to the office he sticks to a vegan diet friends and associates characterize mr mackey as straightforward and transparent a few years ago mr mackey was having dinner with terry dalton who founded a miami natural food store called unicorn village marketplace at about the same time whole foods started in austin whole foods acquired unicorn in for &# million in cash mr mackey and mr dalton have remained friends during dinner mr dalton marveled that at the time whole foodss market capitalization had exceeded those of familiar food industry giants such as h j heinz co mr mackey was so astonished mr dalton recalls that he pulled out his cellphone to call whole foodss chief financial officer to ask if she knew that their company was bigger than heinz whole foods briefly approached heinzs market capitalization in but heinz is now larger when mr dalton heard about mr mackeys online alias he was stunned in no small part because he had engaged in dialogue with rahodeb on the yahoo board a few years ago mr dalton was also using a screen name he says but doesnt now recall what it was mr dalton assumed at the time that rahodeb was a whole foods regional president or finance executive given his knowledge of the company at one point rahodeb accused mr dalton of being an industry insider saying he knew too much to be a run of the mill investor mr mackey in a statement on whole foodss web site last week said his anonymous statements didnt reflect his or his companys policies or beliefs some of the views rahodeb expressed mr mackey said didnt match his own beliefs mr dalton says he doesnt believe mr mackey would do anything unethical "the last thing i would call john is hypocritical or dishonest " he says "maybe he has a little more vanity and ego than i thought " mr mackeys colleagues say the ceo has had an enormous influence on the marketplace today thanks largely to the influence of whole foods organic milk and yogurt can be found in virtually every grocery store in the country including wal mart among natural food enthusiasts its not unusual to hear mr mackey compared with bill gates and steve jobs "hes a rock star " says jeff metzger publisher of food world and food trade news two regional grocery newspapers in the northeast "he is the company " mr metzger says the board may feel pressure to replace mr mackey depending on the outcome of the sec and internal investigations if that happens he says the food industry would lose a visionary leader as for whole foods he says "there isnt a clear line of succession " i am neither kneejerk or a conservative my positions are very well thought out they are based on years of life experience encyclopedic reading and clear honest thinking conservative hardly im more a revolutionary than anything else my political views fall into the category of independent with a strong tilt towards libertarianism teach me to dance that is very sweet of you thank you but my life is pretty full right now rahodeb march though mr mackey felt compelled as rahodeb to defend himself frequently on the yahoo site including one post on christmas day in he has received relatively little substantive criticism during his tenure at whole foods if theres been any rap its that some people have found him hard to work with and unpleasant when angered industry analysts say several former senior company executives including former president peter roy left the company in part because they had difficulty dealing with mr mackey mr roy declined to comment walter robb one of two co presidents at whole foods acknowledges that mr mackey has rubbed some people the wrong way and that he too has occasionally butted heads with his boss but mr robb says the no nonsense style is refreshing and inspires loyalty "hes not vanilla ice cream but then were not a vanilla ice cream shop either " says mr robb who has worked at whole foods for years "john creates a space that allows you to bring your full creativity and potential to the company " mr mackey has also squared off with those outside the company including the economist milton friedman michael pollan author of "the omnivores dilemma" and union leaders who have tried to organize workers at whole foods stores perhaps his most energetic confrontations in recent years have been with executives from wild oats at least of rahodebs or so posts which can be seen on yahoo finance mentioned the rival company after wild oats entered dallas and a few other whole foods markets in the s mr mackey retaliated by opening a store in boulder wild oatss hometown and offering steep price discounts he sent mike gilliland co founder of wild oats the board game risk a simulated battle for world domination attached was a note mr gilliland says that read "forewarned is forearmed " in conversations with mr gilliland over the years mr mackey "made no secret of the fact that he thought whole foods would eventually kick wild oatss butt " says mr gilliland who now runs a small boulder colo based chain of stores called sunflower farmers market "john is a little lacking in social graces " in mr odak replaced mr gilliland as ceo of wild oats mr odak was new to the job when he attended the manhattan conference a goldman sachs global retailing event where mr mackey confronted him mr odak was in the audience during a breakout session in a small room where mr mackey discussed the latest news from whole foods "john i want to introduce myself " mr odak recalls saying to mr mackey after the session mr mackey became angry that mr odak had been sitting in mr odak says the men havent spoken since mr odak left wild oats in october mr mackey doesnt remember the incident the same way according to mr robb "yes john gave him a competitive passionate statement " but he said "it was something along the lines of were coming after these markets " mr robb added that mr odaks presence at a breakout session typically aimed at institutional investors was highly unusual the company wild oats still stinks and remains grossly overvalued based on very weak fundamentals the stock is up now but if it doesnt get sold in the next year or so it is going to plummet back down wait and see rahodeb june in february whole foods announced plans for its biggest acquisition of all offering &# million or &# a share for wild oats which has locations the deal if approved would make whole foods roughly the tenth largest u s grocery chain by number of stores but the ftc announced plans to block the acquisition saying it would increase concentration in the health food supermarket industry and drive up prices supporters of the deal including mr mackey note that whole foods no longer competes with natural food companies alone now its biggest rivals include many of the mainstream grocers that have embraced the products they once spurned some antitrust experts say mr mackeys yahoo messages could hurt the companys case if the ftc uses rahodebs comments to show that mr mackey viewed the health food market as distinct from the mainstream grocery market mr mackeys defenders say his anonymous comments though boastful provocative and impulsive were no different from his public ones and were never intended to disclose insider information or move stock prices for his part mr mackey told visitors to the whole foods web site that he had made the online comments because he "had fun doing it " that explanation is consistent with mr mackeys decision last year to cut his annual salary to &# starting on jan of this year in a letter to company stakeholders at the time he explained "i have reached a place in my life where i no longer want to work for money but simply for the joy of the work itself " shelly banjo contributed to this article
