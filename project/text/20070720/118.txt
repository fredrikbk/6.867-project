weekend journal sports by the numbers course crashes when the british open was last decided at scotlands carnoustie golf links in as it will be this weekend it left us with an indelible golf image jean van de velde with his trousers hiked up wading in barry burn on his way to blowing a three shot lead on the th hole every golfers nightmare scenario so was mr van de veldes free fall golfs greatest choke to get a handle on that question we went back and looked at some high profile collapses from the past our first rule was to confine our candidates to the majors no other tournaments not even the ryder cup carry the weight of the masters the british open the u s open and the pga collapses come in two different forms the first which well call the instant choke as exemplified by mr van de velde is largely about making one horrendous shot or decision on one hole late in the tournament the other the delayed choke is when a player fritters away a huge lead the way greg norman did in the masters well place outside our range such procedural collapses as roberto de vicenzos signing an incorrect scorecard at the masters to place these different kinds of collapses against one benchmark we devised choke quotient or cq start with the lead the golfer held when things began to go wrong then multiply that by the average amount of the lead he had to surrender on each successive hole to come up short at the rounds end add a point if the collapse cost the tournament outright rather than forcing a playoff the higher the cq the worse the collapse and cq sets the bar quite high phil mickelson may have called himself an idiot after blowing a one shot lead on the last hole of the u s open but cq doesnt even put that in the top five here are the five biggest chokes we found  sam snead u s open cq the legendary mr snead never won the u s open but he came very close having sunk an footer to earn a place in a playoff against lew worsham mr snead held a two stroke lead with three holes to play but that disappeared on the th hole as mr snead stood over a putt mr worsham called for a measurement to determine which ball was farther from the hole distracted mr snead missed his putt while mr worsham holed his for the win  greg norman masters cq this is considered one of the greatest chokes not only in golf history but in sports history but cq doesnt judge mr norman quite so harshly his collapse started early in the round and most forget that nick faldo who had two masters titles to his credit already carded a winning the tournament every bit as much as mr norman lost it  ed sneed masters cq after beginning the final round five strokes ahead mr sneed was three strokes ahead with three holes to play after bogeying and he played the first sudden death playoff in masters history with tom watson and fuzzy zoeller losing to mr zoeller on the second extra hole  arnold palmer u s open cq even golfs legends arent immune to pressure at the olympic club mr palmer held a five stroke lead on the th hole but thanks in part to billy caspers on the back nine saw his lead vanish by the th and had to scramble to force a playoff to add insult to injury after taking a two stroke lead with eight holes remaining in the playoff mr palmer still came up short  jean van de velde british open cq what should have been a high point for mr van de velde a three stroke lead before the final hole morphed into murphys law come to life after hitting an errant tee shot the frenchman decided against laying up and went for the green his shot bounced off the grandstand and into the rough near barry burn another shot at the green sent his ball into the water after considering an attempt to take the shot from the water mr van de velde took a drop and tried to pitch onto the green but his ball made it only as far as a greenside bunker he ultimately made a putt for triple bogey that put him into a tie with justin leonard and eventual winner paul lawrie who was shots behind at the beginning of the day
