politics &amp economics edwards trails in polls but may be driving agenda democrats champion populist hot topics a focus on poverty new orleans john edwards may be stuck in third place in the polls and fund raising in the race for the democratic presidential nomination but the populist seems to be playing an outsized role in driving the terms of the partys debate generally to the left on everything from iraq to health care this week the former north carolina senator has made his most prominent bid yet to place the oft ignored issue of poverty prominently on the agenda with a four day tour of some of the most run down parts of the south and midwest beginning with his sixth trip this campaign to this city devastated by hurricane katrina he has talked about the issue more than any of his rivals and was the first to craft a "poverty" plank in his platform about the time mr edwards announced plans for his tour one of his better positioned rivals illinois sen barack obama posted a poverty plan on his website and as mr edwards ended his tour wending through a poultry factory and an industrial neighborhood hit by factory closing in kentucky wednesday mr obama delivered a major speech on the subject in washington d c an obama campaign official dismissed as "absurd" the notion that mr edwards drove the debate on poverty or any other issues but some voters feel otherwise "i appreciate edwards because hes at least talking about poverty " said scott myers lipton a san jose state university professor who caught mr edwards speaking in new orleans "hes the only one talking about it " "hes a serious candidate and hes not to be discounted just because he lags in the national polls " says democratic pollster mark mellman who is neutral in the nomination contest "its a smart strategy for the front runners to follow him " it is the essence of mr edwardss strategy for winning the nomination to come from the left and win over the party activists who tend to dominate the early primaries and caucuses other candidates notably front runner hillary rodham clinton have tended to take a more cautious tack in an attempt to preserve their ability to appeal to the middle should they ultimately win the nomination but with little to lose mr edwards seems to feel freer to address issues that might alienate the party and business establishment just as former vermont gov howard dean pushed the democrats toward more staunch opposition of the iraq war four years ago mr edwards seems to be having a big impact on forcing the pack to follow his agenda "he has worked very hard over the past four years to figure out what every constituency wants " says a leading progressive grass roots political activist "he has gone to groups from labor to environmentalists and said how can i be the best on your issues " such appeals won mr edwards the endorsement of abortion rights leader kate michelman and helped him win by a landslide a recent straw poll held by the liberal grass roots online moveon org on which candidate was favored by members for dealing with climate change of course message is just one factor that determines a candidates appeal mrs clinton is citing experience mr obama his charismatic appeal for "change " and those so far are trumping mr edwardss pitch to old line democrats by adopting part of his message the leaders of the pack may be able to limit his appeal for the party stalwarts who propelled mr dean to an early lead in the presidential contest and while mr edwards seems to have a knack for sensing what partisans want to hear his campaign has failed to catch fire for other reasons many democrats are looking to make a clear break with their loss to president bush when mr edwards ran as the vice presidential candidate on the failed ticket his populist image has been muddied by attention to the time he spent between campaigns as a highly paid consultant to a hedge fund and his campaigns spending &# on a haircut he has also failed to put together an organization on the scale of mrs clinton or mr obama still on issue after issue mr edwards has been the first to stake out where the partys consensus message seems to end up on iraq mr edwards led the tack to the political left apologizing early for his vote to authorize the war pressing congress to cut off money for the conflict and demanding an immediate exit for u s troops mr edwardss stance put tremendous pressure on mr obama and mrs clinton to vote against a recent funding measure which they did somewhat quietly in march mr edwards laid out a detailed policy on revamping health care calling for universal coverage and a business tax to pay for it the next month mr obama put out his own proposal to dramatically expand coverage for the uninsured on taxing hedge funds and private equity firms the leading democrats remained silent until last week when mr edwards complained that the current rules allow fund managers to pay taxes "at a lower rate than their secretaries " within a few days sens clinton and obama both said they back legislation that would raise those taxes it is an open question whether pushing poverty will have the same political resonance as say opposing the increasingly unpopular iraq war poor people dont vote as frequently as wealthier citizens and mr edwardss main rivals are likely to get a large slice of the lower income voters who do show up at the polls mr obama has appeal as an african american candidate with a history of working in chicagos poor neighborhoods as a community organizer mrs clinton can lean on the huge popularity of her husband with african americans even so mr edwardss media entourage this past week was significantly larger than his usual traveling crowd and he has certainly talked more than anybody else about poverty and spent more time in particular in hurricane ravaged new orleans as a symbol of the intractable problem he started the week here with a pledge to hire a full time rebuilding czar to jump start the balky recovery along the gulf coast build a veterans hospital in downtown new orleans and create a program that would offer job training and "stepping stone" employment to workers he also promised to push the minimum wage to &# an hour by "nobody should be working in america and living in poverty " he said "this is not a political strategy " mr edwards insisted to a new orleans crowd when an audience member at a rebuilt school he was visiting posed sharp questions about his poverty platform as a political strategy "this is an issue that america needs to focus on i think the country cares " of course the trip wasnt without a requisite request for donations an email mr edwards sent out in advance of the trip asked supporters to donate &# each "to the campaign that wants to end poverty in our lifetime " mr edwardss top campaign strategist joe trippi who ran mr deans campaign and out a similar missive under the headline "george bush doesnt care about poor people " in coming weeks mr edwards plans to shift his focus toward the middle class and begin including policy statements on trade and taxation globalization and corporate responsibility whether mr obama and mrs clinton will follow is unclear "john may try to push them a little farther to the left than they want to go " an edwards aide said
