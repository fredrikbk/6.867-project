in sicily farmland seized from mafia is hard to cultivate in anticrime campaign co ops face intimidation a dead dog in the yard corleone italy a decade ago when anti mafia sentiment in sicily was riding high the italian parliament passed a law aimed at humiliating organized crime on its own turf land seized from mafiosi such as "boss of bosses" salvatore "toto" riina would be handed to cooperatives made up of local unemployed workers who would put it to good use simply sticking shovels into the ground to cultivate fields the idea went would be a public expression of the states triumph in its long running battle with organized crime but the reality has been more troubled one cooperative had its tractor stolen its warehouse robbed and fields set ablaze farmers from another cooperative found a dead dog with a noose around its neck dumped on their land two weeks ago their fields were torched too "these were messages meant for us this is our house not yours we decide everything even which plants grow and which dont " says calogero parisi head of the cooperative lavoro e non solo or "not only work " the sicilian mafia and other organized crime groups such as the ndrangheta of calabria have transformed themselves into modern global financial enterprises but as the clash with the cooperatives shows their survival still rests on their ability to control their local territory the mafias iron grip on the sicilian economy provides a secure operational base and breeding ground for future generations "the mafia even as it has grown into a complex international financial organization can only hang on as long as it rules locally " says francesco forgione chairman of the italian parliaments anti mafia commission "without that their whole organization falls apart " in when parliament approved the plan to give confiscated land to local farming cooperatives one of the bloodiest periods of mafia violence was still fresh in peoples memories four years earlier two of italys most successful anti mafia prosecutors giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino were blown up bombings of landmarks such as the uffizi gallery in florence followed along with numerous assassinations within the mafias own ranks as old scores were settled the bloodshed led to a major crackdown by the state after some high profile arrests mafia killings slowed to a trickle but the lull has vexed the state even more with fewer killings to investigate putting the mafia on trial becomes more difficult most of the criminal groups activity rests on controlling the everyday business of peoples lives from waste hauling contracts to hospitals or real estate deals that makes it almost impossible for prosecutors to distinguish illegal activity from the legal "they have become lets say almost legal economic entities " says mr forgione thats why fighting the mafia is as much a cultural battle as a judicial one he says "you cant beat them just in a courtroom " sicilys agricultural sector had long been in the grips of organized crime so handing over mafia land to farming cooperatives was a key weapon in the states cultural battle "the state didnt run this place the mafia did " explains lucio guarino a local administrator who helped set up the cooperatives project "a gesture like this tries to say this land is ours not theirs " in this part of sicily adds mr guarino "thats an incendiary concept " under the program all employment contracts at the cooperatives would have to be entirely aboveboard which is rare in sicilys agricultural sector where traditionally farm laborers worked off the books and nobody paid much attention to the letter of the law all the cooperatives business partners would have to be vetted by police to ensure they had no mafia ties but these rules quickly prevented the cooperatives from doing business with most local merchants though sicily has a jobless rate of close to the cooperatives at first had trouble recruiting workers because many of them feared joining groups so clearly aligned against the mafia gianluca faraone president of placido rizzotto a cooperative named after a sicilian labor leader slain by the mafia found himself in a bind when his group got its first plots of land in late the land was in bad shape after years of lying fallow some of it had belonged to toto riina a semiliterate now in prison who was convicted of ordering the assassination of the two prosecutors and the bombings of the uffizi the cooperative spent weeks repairing a rusty tractor that had once belonged to a mr riina only to have it stolen then someone broke into the cooperatives warehouse taking a &# electric generator that was still being paid for in installments in july the night before placido rizzotto was to start harvesting its first ever field of grain a farmer who had agreed to rent a thresher to the cooperative called to say it was broken "that was clearly a sign " says mr faraone it meant no one else in sicily was going to rent him a thresher either but mr faraone felt that his giving up would doom the entire government program by sending a sign that the cooperatives couldnt stand up to the mafia instead he sent a stronger message he told police that nobody would rent him a thresher and they immediately went to the first local farmer they could find and ordered him to hand over his thresher for the cooperatives use one of the biggest threats is that the mafia will find a way to infiltrate the cooperatives impairing their ability to stand apart from the surrounding illegal economy many businesses that start as legitimate enterprises in sicily are eventually forced to cede power to the mafia in a town council near agrigento on sicilys southern coast was about to award parcels of confiscated land to a new cooperative but the cooperative turned out to be controlled by relatives of the same mafioso who once owned the land had the deal gone through the state would have returned the confiscated land to the mafia italys interior ministry dissolved the town council after concluding that it had been infiltrated by organized crime low level mafiosi antonio castro placido rizzottos agronomist regularly fights attempted infiltration when he hires extra workers during harvests and plantings those who come looking for jobs are sometimes low level mafiosi so mr castro screens them carefully "the mafia works by parentela " or family connections he says "you ask around town who someones brother is married to and you begin to understand " the cooperatives can boast some success though lavoro e non solo is still losing money placido rizzotto is in the black one of its most successful products is pasta made with organically grown wheat which it sells through a supermarket chain based in northern italy sporting a special label "from lands liberated from the mafia " demand for the pasta has now outstripped placido rizzottos ability to supply grain so the cooperative is trying to recruit other local growers to supply more but it struggles to find farmers who are willing to publicly repudiate the mafia and submit to the strict legal vetting the cooperative requires "we have to be very careful every time we work with a new person " says mr faraone "its a very very slow process "
