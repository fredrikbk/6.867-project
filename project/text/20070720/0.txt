a key strategy of japans car makers backfires tokyo for want of a piston ring costing &# nearly of japans auto production has been temporarily paralyzed this week blame it on kanban the just in time philosophy of keeping as little inventory on hand as possible the strategy keeps inventory costs down and ensures quality it generally works because japans auto makers have long prided themselves on the almost familial relationships they have with a handful of suppliers of custom parts that deliver several times a week or even daily the strategy also has a downside as became evident after the magnitude earthquake that hit central japan on monday damaged riken corp riken which supplies all major japanese car makers makes the sought after &# piston ring but has been unable to make deliveries and because piston rings and other key parts are made specifically for each car maker and little inventory is kept in hand it is nearly impossible for auto makers to simply switch to another supplier at the last minute "its very difficult for japanese auto makers to hedge any risks " says hirofumi yokoi a tokyo based manager at auto industry consultancy csm worldwide "just in time manufacturing is the culprit in this case " whats more riken which has employees and had revenue of &# million in the year ended march is one of the few suppliers focusing on such specialized parts as piston rings which fit around the head of the piston to create a seal that traps combustion gases and minimizes oil burning with market share of more than riken has a reputation for quality and a close relationship with many car makers making them all vulnerable to the earthquake induced damage the riken closure has forced toyota motor corp the nations no car maker by sales to cease production for at least a day and a half at all of its domestic plants causing a loss of output of at least vehicles about of which are made for export honda motor co said it would close a plant that produces the popular civic and fit models today resulting in the loss of vehicles nissan motor co also will halt operations on several production lines at three of its plants today and will shut down all four of its plants tomorrow and monday mitsubishi motors corp mazda motor corp suzuki motors corp and fuji heavy industries ltd which makes the subaru brand of vehicles also have stopped or slowed down production its not clear what impact the disruption at riken will have on u s production of japanese cars "we are investigating and communicating with our colleagues in japan to see whether or not there will be an impact " says victor vanov a spokesman for toyotas u s manufacturing operations ed miller a spokesman for hondas u s manufacturing operations says honda doesnt expect interruptions in production in the u s the production delays in japan may serve as a cautionary tale for the many manufacturers of all kinds around the world that are keeping smaller inventory and sourcing key parts from the same companies but it isnt as if this were the first example of its kind here or elsewhere in an explosion destroyed a sumitomo chemical co factory in southern japan that made of the worlds supply of a chemical used to seal computer chips into plastic cases the accident pushed prices for computer memory chips up in a magnitude earthquake in taiwan severely damaged the islands chip makers which supply chips to about of the worlds semiconductors personal computer and semiconductor makers world wide suffered from shortages and delivery delays during the busy christmas season nor is this the first time toyota has been paralyzed by an unexpected disaster a fire at a factory of aisin seiki co the main maker of the brake valves toyota uses in most of its cars forced the auto maker to shut down for five days resulting in a production loss of about vehicles toyota admits that this type of unforeseen disaster is a big worry "in the case of special parts like piston rings we dont have any backup " a company spokesman says riken has dominated the piston ring market since the s the company has factories in china and the u s and has also supplied parts for such companies as bmw ag and ford motor co two of rikens factories and nine affiliated facilities were affected by the quake the company says it will resume production of piston rings on a limited basis on monday but it adds that it will be at least a week before operations return to normal auto makers are helping out toyota has sent engineers to help riken recover mitsubishi which suspended production for at least three days at three plants has sent engineers riken had originally established all of its manufacturing facilities in one area of japan to increase efficiency but says it has recently been trying to diversify production in other cities "it turned out we couldnt do it in time " says company spokesman akiyoshi nemoto the good news analysts say the production shutdown will have a relatively small impact on annual earnings as car makers can make up for the lost days during weekends and holidays
