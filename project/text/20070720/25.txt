drinks drugs dysfunction star on summer cable tv on one of the first episodes of the new summer cable series "tyler perrys house of payne " four men visit a drug den they are there to bring home a family member found strung out on a dirty cot but rather than being one of those "very special episodes" about a character overcoming a personal challenge this is the start of a recurring plot line on a family sitcom with a laugh track "my cousins on crack " one of the characters explains so much for a summer of feel good tv as cable networks pump out more original programming a surprising number of drug users and problem drinkers are wobbling into the summer lineup on "saving grace " a tnt series premiering monday night actress holly hunter plays a hard drinking cop who meets an angel after running someone down while driving drunk there is a heroin addicted surfer in the mix on hbos "john from cincinnati " and a lieutenant colonel suffering from post traumatic stress disorder self medicates with booze on lifetimes "army wives " the growing cast of addled characters comes as cable networks look for an edge during their most competitive summer yet there are new scripted series on tv this season up from last summer last year hardly any of the new characters were saddled with substance abuse issues this summer at least six of the new shows not including miniseries have characters who do more than dabble an additional three shows weave drugs and alcohol into story lines more generally in amcs "mad men " set in a advertising agency characters often have cocktails in hand "should we drink before the meeting or after or both " asks a character in the first episode which aired last night brown forman corp maker of jack daniels whiskey made a deal for its products to appear in at least three episodes the "happy drunk" has been a tv trope since the "honeymooners" era but outright dependency is a newer trend says tim brooks a tv historian and research executive at lifetime "its certainly ramped up this summer season " he says no longer content to run repeats until fall the big network broadcasters have tried to hold their ground in the hot months with new reality programs and glitzy game shows but in recent years cable networks have stolen the show by introducing more original offerings broadcast networks attracted about one million fewer viewers in prime time in june than a year earlier while ad supported cable gained about viewers according to nielsen media research for creators who need to hook viewers quickly some summer series get only eight episodes compared with the typical substance abuse can help establish a shows edgy bona fides there are signs though that characters with that kind of baggage may be hard to maintain long term fxs popular "rescue me" broke ground four years ago with its portrayal of firefighters who drink too much among other antisocial behavior but the outlook for its fourth season is sobering so far this summer the series has lost about a third of its viewers from the same period last season according to nielsen some series creators like protective parents arent eager to categorize their characters by their substance abuse nancy miller who invented the self destructive detective that ms hunter plays on "saving grace " says the titular character isnt an alcoholic though she concedes "there are times when she drinks too much " in the pilot episode in which grace mows down a pedestrian in her porsche we see her pour whiskey into her morning soda before heading out to solve a kidnapping ms miller an executive producer says graces bad behavior amps up the drama for viewers the pilot opens with the character naked and having sex with a married man but she says she is counting on graces redeeming traits to balance things out graces foibles also have their limits viewers wont see her doing drugs partly because she is a cop but also because "its not in her nature " says ms miller ms millers approach reflects the shift in how drugs and alcohol are depicted now that cable networks have gained credibility and ratings characters are now more likely to grapple with a drinking or drug problem over the life of a series not just in an episode or two the more limited approach typically associated with previews promising "a very special episode" often marked the influence of advocacy groups working with writers to send public health messages one of the most famous and successful initiatives was spearheaded by a harvard university program the campaign dubbed the harvard alcohol project helped shape the now ingrained concept of the designated driver during four tv seasons starting in designated drivers were depicted in more than prime time episodes of shows like "cheers" and "the cosby show " advocacy groups are still active behind the scenes meredith wagner executive vice president of public affairs for lifetime says the network has worked with "several hundred nonprofit groups" to not only shape scripts but also to promote lifetimes offerings to potential viewers recent partners have included a group called operation homefront for "army wives" and mothers against drunk driving for a movie called "the party never stops " which aired in march some watchdog groups say they are uncomfortable with the spread of drugs and alcohol on cable "to continue to just portray the drama of active addiction is just destructive what we need is some stories that tell us about the positive side and thats what recovery is " says robert lindsey president of the national council on alcoholism and drug dependence an education and advocacy group but these groups acknowledge that they have little recourse because cable channels unlike the major broadcast networks arent monitored by the federal communications commission and some of them dont even accept advertising if the drug and booze addled characters of this summer were popping up on the public airwaves it would be a "major concern " says melissa henson senior director of programs for the parents television council which has launched a number of protest campaigns against media outlets although it is difficult to quantify the rise of drug and alcohol use among tv characters by at least one measure it has spiked the prism awards the entertainment industrys recognition of "the accurate depiction of drug alcohol and tobacco use" in tv and film received submissions in about more than in other recent years as the incidence has increased pressure has mounted on producers to get the details right the showtime series "weeds " about a widowed mom who goes from peddling dime bags of marijuana to a full blown growing and dealing operation takes pains to avoid "cheech and chong" style gags and stereotypes says creator jenji kohan behind the scenes consultants include a manufacturer and retailer of high tech devices used for growing marijuana and research for the third season which starts aug included visits to the writers room by several pot dealers including one who had been operating a dope delivery service since the s according to ms kohan "it was like career day " she says so far none of the shows drug culture realism has sparked public protest from watchdog groups or concerned viewers much to the disappointment of ms kohan and showtime a subscription channel she says they were hoping controversy would help build buzz for the show "i was ready for a fight " she says corrections &amp amplifications the fx cable show "rescue me " as of last week had lost of its live
