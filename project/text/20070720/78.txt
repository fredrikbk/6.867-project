power broker google goes to washington with own brand of lobbying internet giant offers its services to congress as d c scrutiny grows in a conference room overlooking the washington monument about young democratic operatives in training recently munched on animal crackers as google inc executives pitched the internet companys offerings googles newly hired team leader for political sales peter greenberger explained how attendees could use online ads and other services from google to help their candidates win one google product could provide details about people who visited a campaigns web site such as the approximate area where they lived mr greenberger explained "tremendously valuable info " he said adding "its free did i mention its free its free " free in the sense that google isnt charging money for the service but the internet giant is ultimately hoping for something in return greater influence in the nations capital as googles ambitions grow along with the ranks of its rivals the company is relying on people like mr greenberger to reinvent corporate influence peddling for the internet age instead of just hiring a roster of lobbyists and tossing out millions of dollars in campaign contributions google has embarked on a quiet march through the conference rooms of washington to explain how its products can help politicians get elected the company is telling campaign staffers how to target political ads to people who live within a certain radius perfect for candidates who want to reach only people in their district its showing campaign web site designers how googles maps can contribute to a user friendly site google founded in didnt even bother to set up a washington office until now it finds itself playing defense on several critical fronts telecommunications companies are trying to keep the right to levy extra fees on big users of internet bandwidth that could take a big bite out of the google unit youtube which delivers web video clips to consumers billions of times each month lawmakers in congress on wednesday announced plans to examine googles proposed &# billion deal for ad services company doubleclick inc some want the federal trade commission to block the deal on the grounds it would give google too much control over the business of delivering ads to web sites meanwhile google faces pressure on both sides of the privacy issue from consumers worried about personal information leaking and from authorities who want the search engine to assist in criminal investigations "were more and more under the microscope " says robert boorstin who held several positions in the clinton administration and was hired just over a year ago as director of policy communications in googles washington office "it would be disingenuous to say we werent trying to have influence with decision makers and people who try to influence them " google has tried to make its mountain view calif headquarters a de rigueur stop for presidential contenders just as car factories and steel plants have been in past years john edwards sen hillary clinton and sen john mccain are among those who have spoken before crowds of young workers at the headquarters also known as the googleplex in its highest profile move so far youtube will join cnn as a sponsor of a debate on monday between the democratic presidential candidates in charleston s c an unusual role for a nonmedia corporation chief executive eric schmidt and youtubes two co founders will be on hand and google staff will demonstrate their services to the candidates teams youtube and cnn plan a similar event for republican candidates in september besides the candidates google is proffering free tutorials and technical handholding to government officials nonprofits and trade associations it isnt uncommon for corporations to display their wares on capitol hill american car companies regularly bring new models to washington and offer test drives to members of congress and their aides last year cable television companies opened a lavish new space a few blocks from the capitol to host parties and show off cable gadgets offering help with web services however is an unusual tack since most of the services google is peddling are free and widely available the company generally avoids federal rules on campaign contribution limits occasionally it runs into snags lawmakers cant put google maps directly on their official web sites because of rules restricting the kind of outside services that can be carried on congressional computers like many rapidly growing silicon valley firms before it google was slow to recognize the need for a washington presence as recently as two years ago it had just one lobbyist in the capital but a series of conflicts served as wake up calls to management early last year the justice department filed a motion in federal court against google seeking to get information about users searches in connection with the departments defense of a child online protection law that had been challenged in court a judge eventually limited the amount of information google had to hand over around the same time google came under fire in washington for censoring search results in china "can you say in english that you are ashamed of what you and your company have done " democratic rep tom lantos demanded at a february hearing rep lantoss northern california district is near the googleplex last year also marked googles first participation and first defeat in a major lobbying war the company and its allies including ebay inc and amazon com inc battled telecommunications and cable companies in congress over what kind of fees could be charged to carry internet traffic google wanted legislation to block the carriers from tacking on extra charges for delivering data such as video at high speed to consumers congress didnt go along theres little evidence the carriers are levying such charges yet but theres nothing to prevent them from doing it and the lobbying on both sides continues while google says its acting on behalf of internet users some of its opponents call the company selfish "googles call for federal regulation of the internet with no facts to back up its demand seems designed only to benefit google and not consumers " said a statement this week from mike mccurry a former spokesman for president clinton who now heads a public relations effort partly funded by phone and cable companies yet another issue that could get google in trouble in washington is copyright protection media companies allege that google and particularly youtube knowingly enable piracy of television shows and movies google says it complies with the law and works with media companies to keep pirated content off its sites google has stepped up the pace of hiring in washington over the past year it has expanded its communications and lobbying shop to nine mr greenberger the political consultant turned sales executive is among the recent hires he has worked on the campaigns of several democratic candidates including the clinton gore campaign another newcomer is johanna shelton the former top telecom staffer for michigan democratic rep john dingell rep dingell is chairman of the committee that oversees telecom laws in november the company plans to leave its cramped quarters a few blocks from the white house and move to lavish office space in one of the few "green" office buildings in washington it plans to offer "tech talk" receptions there that would allow google executives to woo lawmakers and congressional staffers by traditional lobbying yardsticks the company has a long way to go to become a major beltway player google spent about &# on outside lobbyists last year compared with roughly &# million by at&amp t inc googles political action committee contributed &# to candidates in the election cycle microsofts pac handed out &# million and at&amp ts gave &# million mr boorstin and other google executives say that under their unconventional "googley" approach influence cant be measured by the number of lobbyists or the size of campaign war chests google points to a project by nebraska democratic sen ben nelsons staff to report on his recent trip to iraq using the google earth online mapping technology a junior staffer reconstructed the trip and posted a link to it on mr nelsons senate site reaction to the project was so favorable that the office recently unveiled a google maps tour of the senators favorite places in nebraska including his childhood home says david demartino mr nelsons communications director the company is touting its online ads with rates a fraction of tv advertising as a cost effective way to spread a candidates message "think of this as our contribution to campaign finance reform " google advertising executive kim malone joked at a recent conference for political consultants and activists google is even working on a version of its checkout electronic payment system tailored for fund raising by campaigns and nonprofits youtube has created "you choose " an area specifically for presidential candidates to post videos free for anyone to see users can see a clip from a democratic presidential candidate sen chris dodd of connecticut in which he encourages them to "bypass the traditional media filter" and upload home videos of themselves supporting legislation to pull u s troops out of iraq sen clinton posted a video on youtube asking supporters to help select her campaign theme song she followed up with a clip poking fun at some of the home videos people submitted in response in may youtube chief executive chad hurley visited the capitol hill offices of the national republican senatorial committee which focuses on electing republicans to the senate to discuss how the site could be used by campaigns he pointed out how candidates could create their own youtube "channels" to post their videos rebecca fisher the committees communications director says staffers kept waiting to hear a pitch for pricey services but it never came republicans are keenly aware of the impact of internet video such as the famous clip posted on youtube last year showing then sen george allen of virginia calling an indian american "macaca " sen allen a republican narrowly lost his re election bid and the republicans lost control of the senate the republican senatorial committee is digitizing old videotapes to build a video database so it can release clips onto the site quickly next year to make or respond to attacks in the campaign about of all american adults got most of their campaign news from the internet up from in according to a study released in january by the pew internet &amp american life project google is also reaching out to groups such as the u s hispanic chamber of commerce and the national association of women business owners it is proposing to help their members in areas such as online advertising with the hope of winning allies in policy fights some other google initiatives are less explicitly geared toward currying favor with policy makers and powerful constituents but could help further those ends just as well at the state level google executives met earlier this week with several secretaries of state at a conference as part of an exploratory effort to make voting information such as locations of polling sites more easily accessed online katie jacobs stanton the product manager for googles financial news and information service says she was disappointed that the company didnt provide more services to voters during the presidential election ms stanton who spent a year working at the senate committee on foreign relations in the s has helped pull together about colleagues to work on services for next years election the employees are using the of their work time google allows them to spend on individual projects one fruit of their efforts is a tool to be released in the near future that individuals will be able to use to annotate video of the presidential debates other people could then play back the video and see running commentary such as fact checking analyses of the candidates statements
