china product scare hits home too exports of toxic toothpaste are halted but government lets domestic sales go on shanghai last week chinese authorities banned the manufacture and export of toothpaste containing diethylene glycol a poisonous chemical used in automobile antifreeze which regulators in the u s and elsewhere deemed a health hazard but china didnt order a recall of what appear to be millions of tubes still on store shelves across china where the chemical has been widely used in domestic toothpaste instead chinas general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine insisted that diethylene glycol levels of as much as are safe and told consumers not to worry the chinese governments decision to stop exports of the toothpaste but still permit its sale throughout china until stocks are sold out underscores the fact that the people most at risk from chinas public health and safety lapses are the countrys own citizens the u s food and drug administration says even small amounts of the chemical are dangerous and bars its use in food and drugs chinese officials say theyve received no complaints of illnesses or deaths related to diethylene glycol in toothpaste however the chinese government is still trying to develop an effective nationwide reporting system of problems and illness related to consumer products toothpaste is just one area where differing product safety standards and levels of enforcement in china and abroad are coming into contrast amid growing concern abroad about the potential hazards posed by some less regulated chinese exports yesterday the chinese embassy in washington said that americans should deal with flaws in their own system before criticizing china citing problems in the u s with contamination problems in spinach lettuce and peanut butter over the past year "certain isolated cases shouldnt be blown out of proportion to mislead the public into thinking that all food from china is unsafe " said the statement adding that more than of all exports from china meet quality requirements reliable statistics are difficult to come by but in recent years chinas official press has cataloged an epidemic of food borne maladies as well as deaths and illnesses caused by unsafe products or adulterated medicines in the first half of the chinese government reviewed types of products made for domestic consumption by more than companies and found nearly a fifth of them failed quality and safety standards the worst problems occurred in canned and preserved fruit and dried fish which had excessive levels of bacteria and additives in one case last year at least five people died and five others fell ill after injections of gall bladder medicine that contained diethylene glycol the case prompted chinese premier wen jiabao to declare at the time "the pharmaceutical market is in disorder " according to the official xinhua news agency as reports of problems multiply even in chinas tightly controlled press the issue has caused a crisis of confidence among chinese consumers over the safety of the countrys food and drug supplies and the ability of their government to protect them in a survey conducted by the state run xinhua news agency earlier this year of respondents said they were "concerned about food safety " and said they believed government enforcement of safety regulations was "not good " "its really unfair to our citizens that the problematic toothpaste is forbidden for export and still allowed to be sold in china " says ma xin a year old manager at a beijing real estate development company "food and drug safety is a problem " ms ma says "all i can do is just live with it " to protect herself ms ma says she tries to shop at large supermarkets where she says the quality of goods is likely to be higher she also favors well known brands often those produced by foreign manufacturers government efforts to police the problem are hampered by widespread corruption and the proliferation of mom and pop manufacturers making everything from personal care products and processed foods to pharmaceuticals the increase has overwhelmed chinas inspection bureaucracy china is still at the early stages of developing the type of product liability and product recall system that is common in many western countries a situation that leaves little recourse against companies that flout regulations that are rarely enforced product liability lawsuits common in the u s are rare in chinas legal system and there are no government regulations for the recall of products other than cars though rules for recalls of hazardous toys and unsafe food are expected to be in place as soon as the end of this year chinas leaders recognize that they have a political problem on their hands earlier this month the new head of the state food and drug administration shao mingli said "food and drug safety matters to the peoples health and life security and matters to social stability and harmony " mr shaos predecessor zheng xiaoyu was executed july after being convicted of accepting bribes from drug companies local media reports have fanned concerns a beijing newspaper reported that about half the water supplied for water coolers in the capital was either tap water or purified water of miscellaneous small brands poured into empty barrels sealed with quality standard marks a serious concern since many are reluctant to drink tap water the state council chinas cabinet in april announced plans to expand the countrys food and drug safety surveillance network step up inspections set up an emergency response mechanism and put recall procedures in place over the next five years sun yueming a year old retiree in shanghai blames chinas product safety issues on what she sees as the chinese private sectors embrace of profits at nearly any cost "these wicked people only care about money so they try very hard to cut costs " ms sun says some chinese companies say they decide to focus on the local market instead of exports because standards are lower and enforcement more lax a representative of yong cheng chemical co in dongguan which makes paint for toys says it is expensive to reduce lead content "theres no money to be made" by meeting foreign safety standards she said instead yong cheng sells to toy makers aiming at local customers cost was clearly the driving factor in companies widespread use of diethylene glycol as an ingredient in toothpaste manufacturers say they turned to the poisonous chemical when the price of glycerine the substance they had previously used to help make the toothpaste smooth and keep it moist started to rise a group of chinese chemical companies and toothpaste makers in the mid s discovered a way to replace the glycerine with a much cheaper mixture of diethylene glycol and another material called sorbitol a thickener and artificial sweetener according to chinese industry executives use of the diethylene glycol eventually became common in the chinese toothpaste industry executives say it was known to be toxic but the companies reasoned since people dont eat toothpaste the risks to consumers would be minimal if consumed in large enough quantities diethylene glycol can damage the central nervous system it can also cause serious damage to the kidneys and liver diethylene glycol laced cough syrups have resulted in fatalities in more than people died in the u s after taking an antibiotic formula containing diethylene glycol the case is credited with hastening the passage of the federal food drug and cosmetic act which broadened fda oversight of new drugs fda officials when they moved to block imports of chinese toothpaste last month said they were concerned about consumers long term exposure to diethylene glycol as well as the special dangers the chemical presents to children and those with kidney and liver disease though the fdas warning named specific brands that were recalled such as dr cool coolmint made by goldcredit international enterprises and freshhspearmint made by shanghai light industrial products the fda also broadly advised consumers "to avoid using tubes of toothpaste labeled as made in china " on july chinas quality and safety watchdog prohibited the import and export of toothpaste containing diethylene glycol it also ordered chinese companies to stop using it as an ingredient in toothpaste for the domestic market but the administration said that consumers shouldnt worry about negative effects from the chemical citing a study by experts assembled by chinas ministry of health aoqili co a guangzhou based toothpaste company makes about tons of toothpaste a year mostly for the domestic market the companys president zong changbao says the company has stopped using diethylene glycol since the government order but he says it has no plans to recall toothpaste thats already been shipped "this problem doesnt exist " says mr zong "its just a matter of u s standards not a safety problem " but mr zong says "the fda standard is used as a reference in many countries if china were as powerful as the u s we could set the world standard " goldcredit whose products are being recalled by their u s importer mainstar america llc of miami fla says it sees no reason to pull its toothpaste containing diethylene glycol from shelves in china "its accepted by the local market " says shi jun an executive at the company goldcredit based in wuxi miles from shanghai says it has now stopped using diethylene glycol but has no plans to return to the u s market "the market is too up in the air " says ms shi ellen zhu and tang hanting in shanghai and zhou yang in beijing contributed to this article
