uaw weighs health care trust plan could relieve auto makers of some retiree benefits obligations detroits unionized auto workers under pressure from the big three auto makers are signaling a willingness to consider proposals that would lift billions of dollars of retiree health care obligations off the companies books the nitty gritty details however pose significant and potentially costly hurdles the united auto workers union has begun working with investment bank lazard ltd to study scenarios for restructuring retiree health care obligations at general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group according to people familiar with the matter though lazard has yet to be officially hired the firm played a crucial role in the uaws decision in to fork over concessions a lazard spokeswoman declined to comment blue collar retiree health care obligations will be a central issue as the union sits down today with chrysler to formally begin bargaining toward a new master labor agreement gm and ford will kick off talks on monday the current contracts based on the last agreement expire on sept the auto makers are seeking answers to the benefits issue their obligations are eating up cash detroit needs to retool its product lines in an effort to better compete with toyota motor corp and other growing asia based auto makers those competitors have relatively few retirees in the u s and their production workers at home benefit from national health systems the uaw represents more than one million blue collar retirees and family members quantifying the size of the big threes obligations to the group is difficult but analysts estimates range from roughly &# billion to &# billion or more already the u s auto makers are taking steps that could free up funds to pay for a solution yesterday ford said it had received interest from a number of potential bidders for its jaguar and land rover luxury car units though it didnt disclose further details a widely talked about solution that has support within the uaw is forming a union run trust that would take over at least part of the legacy liability and manage it themselves a trust has gained a slew of proponents on wall street and senior executives at ford gm and cerberus capital management which is buying chrysler are telling various financial constituents that such a framework is ideal for detroit some union officials see advantages in such an arrangement including preservation of benefits should one of the auto makers someday seek chapter bankruptcy court protection two years ago the uaw offered such a deal to gm but the two sides couldnt come terms according to people at the company and close to the union uaw leaders including president ron gettelfinger are leery of forming a trust because it puts the union on the hook for meeting benefit obligations people familiar with the situation say it also lets auto makers off the hook for promises it made to the uaw and mr gettelfinger sees that as a philosophical problem under the trust scenario jones day attorney andy kramer who was influential in creating such deals for various auto companies including gm said the auto makers would funnel billions of dollars of cash securities and loans into a trust known as a veba for voluntary employees beneficiary association the parties would have to agree on a value related to the liabilities for instance gm is expected to ask the uaw take &# billion to &# billion or about to of the current estimate for its liability in upfront cash said people familiar with the matter officials at the auto makers say the negotiations will hinge on establishing a workable agreement on how much of a "haircut" it will take on the liabilities if a deal is struck the uaw would appoint a group of trustees to oversee the veba and an administrator would do the work of actually paying benefits and trying to maximize returns of assets in the trust analysts point to several pros and cons related to this strategy a veba would relieve the big three of considerable cash outflows and remove considerable risk from the balance sheet fitch ratings auto analyst mark oline said it would be one of a few critical steps the big three could take in an effort to restore investment grade credit ratings but funding a veba would be costly for gm and ford even with more than a combined &# billion in available liquidity even after pouring cash and potentially some stock into the trust the companies would likely need to raise additional debt to fund a veba the interest on the loans could easily total billions of dollars on an annual basis offsetting much of the savings related to forming the trust in the first place fitchs mr oline said the markets likely would be receptive to floating loans to the big three under this scenario partially because it would clear up much of the risk associated with the auto makers still one automotive executive said that the cost of financing the veba could prove to be too prohibitive if the uaw demands more than the auto makers are willing to give mr gettelfinger of the uaw could balk at undertaking another big overhaul of retiree benefits so soon after a deal that raised health care costs for uaw retirees and reduced the companies liabilities people close to the auto makers and union say mr gettelfinger also has expressed his view that detroits health care problem cant be fixed in contract bargaining but instead should be addressed by convincing the federal government to create a national health care system comparable to those in japan or canada or europe
