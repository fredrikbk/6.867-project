weekend journal hollywood report lets invest in a show one outfit woos budget backers partying with patti the small investor in the theater has become an endangered species as walt disney warner bros and other big corporations increasingly dominate broadway some producers dont even want to hear from a potential show backer unless he or she has a half a million dollars to chip in but one outfit is still doing it the old fashioned way soliciting cash from doctors and dentists with big dreams but only &# or so to invest surprisingly this group is now one of the more successful producers in show business backing such hits as "hairspray " "the producers" and "stomp " the organization is called by a variation of routh frankel viertel baruch group after the names of its partners the name order rotates by show the partnership has three shows playing in new york two in las vegas two in britain and three in asia the group has a solid track record in failure prone broadway people who invested the same amount in each of its shows over the years have enjoyed a return well over the partnership says small investors who put money into a routh frankel viertel baruch production become part of the theatrical experience bringing with it bragging rights invitations to the opening night party and a topic for dinner party conversation for the four producing partners relying on small investors often takes out of the picture the big name broadway backers who can demand to be involved in a shows creation in exchange for their cash of course theater investing remains highly risky the investment agreement for one recent routh frankel viertel baruch show warns that becoming a backer entails "a significant possibility of loss of the entire investment " moreover it says that "most theatrical productions fail to sell out consistently at full ticket prices or to fully repay their investors" and that the producers have the right to close the show at any time "for any reason whatsoever " some of the partnerships ventures have in fact been finacial duds its revival of "the sound of music" lost its entire &# million investment while its production of "swing" returned only of its &# million capitalization still some people cant resist the allure of putting money into theater for mel brookss highly anticipated new musical this fall "young frankenstein " the partnership had to limit the number of small investors in the show for which it is an associate producer because there was so much demand frank arcaro a vice president at tiffany &amp co invested &# each in two recent routh frankel viertel baruch productions both of them revivals of stephen sondheim musicals he got back all of his investment plus a "fractional" profit from "sweeney todd " a show about a murderous london barber but he lost about &# on "company " a musical about a manhattan mans romantic troubles that closed july mr arcaro says his participation was an "emotional" one rather than one based on financial gain as he had long wanted to be involved in theater and in particular was attracted by mr sondheims work "i give the producing partners high marks for organization " he says pointing out that for his investment he received show posters a bottle of private label "sweeney todd" cabernet a cast album for "sweeney todd " bad seats for the opening nights "theyd warned me it was out of their control" and the opportunity to mingle with patti lupone raul esparza and other stars at the musicals opening night parties the group was formed years ago when richard frankel an independent producer acquired the theatrical rights to "penn and teller" and started raising &# for the comedy and magic duos off broadway production through that process mr frankel met tom viertel and steven baruch who are cousins marc routh who was mr frankels assistant became a partner in the early s the four partners each tackle different aspects of putting on shows messrs viertel and routh negotiate deals and construct the business plans for the productions mr frankel along with his four general managers and large staff handles most of the day to day production details while mr baruch tends to the " dentists from westchester college presidents small and large business owners and more than a few little old ladies" who provide the financing mr baruch also handles the cast album deals "we organically developed a system of engaging small investors in our activities " mr baruch says which has "given us a reliable source of capital that permits us to produce what we want no one in a hundred years has ever raised money in quite this way " in the th and early th centuries theater owners generally produced wrote financed and sometimes even starred in their own shows the era featured larger than life impresarios such as florenz ziegfeld who put up their own money for productions later producers sought investments from outsiders some were "angel" investors who were willing to lose money to support a play by major theater artists such as the lunts similar to how corporate and private donors today give to nonprofit cultural groups says robert viagas a theater historian and director of playbill broadcast a division of the theater guide playbill in the s and s small investors often played a part in funding shows but as plays became more expensive to produce in the s and s gradually the small investor was left out shows began relying on four or five experienced producers to raise a shows budget typically by tapping wealthy investors who put up several hundred thousand dollars each what the baruch viertel frankel routh group does is solicit and manage the investments of scores of people who put up &# to &# each depending on the show "company " for instance had individual investors the group also often teams up with large scale producers as minority partners to mount shows a standard broadway practice that limits risk future projects by the partnership include a new musical by alan menken the composer for "beauty and the beast" and "the little mermaid " that show will be based on the steve martin movie "leap of faith " and will be directed by film director taylor hackford "ray " "an officer and a gentleman" it also plans a stage version of the coen brothers movie "the hudsucker proxy " directed by jerry zaks in addition the partnership produces broadway style shows in asia and sends shows on u s tours both of which also tap small investors "i would work with them again in a minute " says mr arcaro the tiffany executive "theyre the only game in town for the small investor "
