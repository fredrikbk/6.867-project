appeared in separate videoconferences to congress and the pentagon to express support for the troop surge gen odierno also said that while he would participate in the mid september progress report to congress he would need an extra days "to do a good assessment " the washington post reports gen odierno said there has been "significant success" against insurgents in baghdad and surrounding towns but it wouldnt be possible to know in september if such successes were "just a blip " the new york times adds the commitment to the surge strategy which has sent additional troops to iraq and led to a rise in u s casualties illustrates divisions between top commanders in iraq and a growing number of democratic and republican lawmakers who have turned against the war the wall street journal writes senior republicans and democrats responded to the appeal for more time with a warning that time is running out both for the iraqi government to effect agreements with warring factions and for what remains of congressional support for the current strategy the n y times says democratic sen john kerry called the appeal an attempt to move goalposts the september report had been seen as a potential turning point for some republican lawmakers such as virginia sen john warner who has indicated he wont challenge policy on iraq until after the assessment is delivered the los angeles times says in his address ambassador crocker took a step back from the benchmarks used by the administration to measure political economic and military reforms in iraq the hill writes in his testimony to the senate

toward political reconciliation " democratic sen barbara boxer of california reminded mr crocker of his earlier statement that "electricity is more important to the average iraqi than all the benchmarks rolled into one " and pointed out that electricity service in baghdad is far below prewar levels with residents getting only one or two hours a day the l a times writes aside from political wrangling the briefings were plagued by organizational and technical problems sen majority leader harry reid of nevada said many lawmakers werent aware of the briefings and "some offices still cant find the invitations " the post reports adding that majority whip richard durbin of illinois said he never got one the white house described the complaints as petty griping but spent at least part of
