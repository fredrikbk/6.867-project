the daily fix bonds cracks two home runs moves within two of aaron online edition the san francisco giants barry bonds missed the first three games of his teams series at wrigley field against the chicago cubs but bonds was in the lineup yesterday and delivered despite a strong wind blowing in cracking a solo homer over the right field wall in the second and following that with a three run shot into the center field basket in the seventh the giants lost but bonds now has homers leaving him two behind hank aaron and three behind no one "as the ball ripped through the summer sky much like a syringe injected into soft tissue a spooky sense of finality settled over wrigley field " writes jay mariotti in the chicago sun times "the villain is going to win isnt he a grand jury cant stop him the commissioner cant stop him old age cant stop him and the weight of overwhelming public disapproval cant stop him barry bonds creep of creeps is about to own the mother of all baseball records " like a syringe injected into soft tissue wow in the chicago tribune rick morrissey sat down with bonds in an effort to get a column but wound up having to duck and weave with his subject in an effort to get somewhere he didnt so he simply posts the transcript of his alternately infuriating and amusing conversation with the slugger meanwhile the san francisco chronicles ray ratto briefly explores the circus that will surround bondss next three home runs but is more interested in what will happen after that his guess "the sounds of crickets the chase is what invigorates spectatorworld and once achievement occurs we seek out the next chase what happens is he recedes into the anonymity of playing on a bad and uninteresting team he will try to stir some interest in a new suitor for and we will follow that with the interest of any good fantasy fan but beyond that our long national fixation with making our separate peaces or waging our separate wars with barry bonds will end " sports illustrateds tom verducci meanwhile considers aaron and his homers a mark he thinks will keep its magic given all the venom about bonds just re read that mariotti simile mr verducci writes that "aaron and have acquired the immutability of granite it may have taken setting the record for aaron who was a consummate ballplayer and remains a quiet gentleman with a fierce social conscience to be properly noticed it may take losing the record for aaron to be sufficiently appreciated like roger bannister and the sub four minute mile bob beamon and feet and roger maris and aaron and are partners in posterity not by defying belief as bonds has done but by encouraging it aarons record may be broken by bonds but it wont be eclipsed " craig biggio has hits but the new york suns tim marchman is more interested in another record the houston astro is close to breaking mr biggio has been hit by a pitch times three shy of the all time record set by hughie jennings who played from through mr marchman notes that mr jennings record has stood for years by way of comparison aarons endangered home run mark has stood for years walter johnsons strikeouts record lasted and ty cobbs hits record endured for "whats even more impressive is that nearly every player who breaks a long standing record does so because the game has changed " mr marchman writes "its far easier to hit home runs in todays game than it was in aarons time and it was easier in aarons time than it was in babe ruths time similarly it was probably less difficult for cal ripken to maintain his consecutive games streak than it was for lou gehrig to maintain his because of modern medical and travel technology biggio by contrast will set this record not because of conditions but despite them " in the washington post michael wilbon ponders football of various types crossing oceans can the nfl export american football to others having shuttered nfl europa its new strategy is to have every team play a game outside the u s each season can what the rest of the world calls football crack the u s if his ankle holds up david beckham will make his los angeles galaxy debut tomorrow and why cant either sport be happy with its current dominance "the overwhelming majority of europeans dont want american football which is why nfl europe lost approximately &# million since it began play as the world league of american football in " mr wilbon writes "its not enough for the nfl to control the sundays of million people and be the dominant form of sports entertainment in the united states the nfl apparently wont be satisfied until it dominates the world not that the league is alone in its thinking professional soccer isnt satisfied with being the most popular sport in the world its international powers that be wont be satisfied until soccer has conquered the united states no matter how many times americans have turned thumbs down on domestic professional soccer " uni watch recently took a field trip to liebe athletic lettering a facility outside of st louis that espn coms paul lukas describes as "a uniform enthusiasts dream with patches insignia nameplates and rolls of twill fabric all over the place as you can imagine uni watch was like the proverbial kid in the candy store " join mr lukas for an interesting tour complete with video and photographs and then stick around for mr lukass usual compendium of uniform links the fix still cant get over redneck night the fix is not a fan of joe morgan he strikes us as a self satisfied lazy thinker who offers bromides about intangibles when hes not wallowing in his medieval hatred of statistics but it was still surprising to read the new york posts phil mushnick pondering a story mr morgan told during espns telecast of the philadelphia phillies th loss about how he helped extend the phillies famous collapse with an rbi single against them in his major league debut "great story " writes mr mushnick "but unless morgan was confusing himself with reds rookie infielder chico ruiz it never happened as several readers were moved to write the phillies played the reds braves and cardinals during that losing streak houston wasnt in the mix furthermore morgan though called up in did not have an rbi that season for houston and he did not make his big league debut in either that came sept when he went for pinch hitting against the phillies the next day morgan did have an rbi single to beat the phillies but those phillies were well out of the race and not in the throes of a historic collapse theyd actually won four of their previous five games " that news sent the fix rushing to the awesome fire joe morgan where we found nothing rats however we did find this marvelous point by point takedown of a column by michael ventre about what alex rodriguez is worth julio franco is back with the atlanta braves prompting jon bois of the dugout to imagine this conversation between mr franco and various braves a couple of decades junior to him in typical dugout fashion it winds from the image of young braves playing with plastic army men to michael vick to an invocation of baseball from obscure infielder bill pecota in the dugout pantheon hes a prophet thats funny but also in its sneaky way heartfelt and beautiful tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
