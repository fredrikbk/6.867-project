facebook gets help from its friends music horoscopes help boost sites user base will new offerings allow it to catch myspace no social networking site facebook inc has persuaded a year old college dropout two microsoft corp veterans and more than others to help it do the hard work of catching up to news corp s myspace last month facebook launched a new "platform" that lets people unaffiliated with the company build online services that operate within its web site among those who have stepped up ali and hadi partovi twin brothers whose ilike inc service lets users search concert listings post second music clips and compare their scores on quizzes testing music acumen with those of their friends and numair faraz who left college as a freshman and built a service called facebook audio that enables people to play full length songs on their profiles as a result of these and other outsiders efforts facebook now offers more than new services from photo slideshows to online file storage up from fewer than a month ago meanwhile those who are creating the facebook services can access information about their customers and make money by selling related items and ads other popular new services are fairly basic one from slide inc a san francisco start up lets people highlight their "top friends" and recently had million users a horoscope service from rockyou inc a start up in san mateo calif had million users other applications include flash sudoku which lets users add the popular numbers game to their page and stress meter which lets users chart their stress level for all to see theres a weight tracker called thinner socialight which lets users share their favorite places with their friends complete with maps and photos and a carbon diet plan which lists ways to improve ones ecological profile "and provides inspiration for your friends to do the same " adam dangelo facebooks chief technology officer says he expects the services to become more complex and deeply integrated with facebook in coming months "weve only seen the applications that take less than a month to develop " he says already all the activity has helped facebook grow to million active users from million before the platform launch with more than half using at least one of the new services facebook says facebooks success has attracted the attention of news corp chief executive rupert murdoch when asked in a recent interview whether newspaper readers are migrating to myspace he responded "i wish they were theyre all going to facebook at the moment " according to web tracking firm comscore inc million people visited myspace in april and million visited facebook facebook is actually borrowing a tactic pioneered by microsoft rather than building every piece of technology yourself let others build on your "platform " much the way adobe systems inc intuit inc and others built software for microsofts windows operating system in the s using this strategy facebook can nurture an ecosystem of developers who can create services far faster than facebook could build them on its own its also a profitable move for facebook the company expects close to &# million in profit on revenue of &# million this year mostly from ads say people familiar with the matter by drawing more members and tracking which services members are using facebook can command higher web advertising rates says facebook chief operating officer owen van natta facebook is also planning to offer paid services to the third party service providers creating a potential new revenue stream mr van natta says options being discussed include brokering ads for facebook partners for a cut of the revenue and offering a "wallet" service that would process online payments facebooks newest music services are an early case study in how it all works facebook has long lagged behind myspace in providing music services like concert listings and playing songs thats where the partovis and mr faraz come in the year old partovi brothers each led parts of microsofts web business before starting ilike in seattle in october with funding from iac interactivecorp s ticketmaster unit they approached facebook ceo mark zuckerberg in april asking to become the sites exclusive provider of music services in an email mr zuckerberg said no but told them about the coming platform hadi partovi immediately decided his start up needed to move most of its resources to facebook "somebodys going to end up being the facebook music service " he says "its either going to be us in which case were made or its not " at a meeting with ilikes web developers mr partovi asked them to act quickly "i basically said this is a sprint not a marathon " he says mr faraz meanwhile built his service in three hours by using his laptop in a san francisco hotel within days of the launch ilike had hundreds of thousands of users and facebook audio had thousands both say their growth has attracted the interest of record labels and artists who want to work with their services this week ilike began offering some full length songs on facebook by letting representatives of artists like kelly clarkson and keith urban upload their music to stay ahead as more people develop services for facebook ilike plans to spend &# on a marketing campaign already the company is getting more revenue from facebook than from ilike com by displaying ads and getting commissions for selling songs and concert tickets via facebook facebook still faces some hurdles the company is still tweaking its platform to the frustration of the third party service providers that have to scramble to keep up with its changes the site has also slowed at times as it has struggled to handle the surge in new information now moving between users facebook and the third party companies "they launched it in a huge rush " says jia shen founder of rockyou "theyve really made it brutal for us " mr dangelo doesnt disagree that "there were a few small problems but " he says "we were able to fix them really quickly as soon as they came up " sarah tucker a year old in little rock ark visits facebook daily mostly to stay up to date on her friends lives she recently started using ilike to post clips of songs she likes on her profile page "i think it was good for them to give the option to put music on your profile because thats something i like on myspace " she says
