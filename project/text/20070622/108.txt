weekend journal the wealth report new rules for the rich wealthy mimic old elite or do the opposite the lucky sperm club to be an official member of the american "upper class" you used to have to follow a clear set of rules in his classic "the theory of the leisure class " sociologist thorstein veblen wrote that the gilded age rich were defined by their excess leisure and cultivation "refined tastes manners and habits of life are a useful evidence of gentility because good breeding requires time " paul fussell the cultural historian updated these rules in his satiric book "class a guide through the american status system " the upper crust he said was distinguishable from the middle class and "proles" by their tweed jackets aristocratic chins and aversion to bowling "if you want to have status its important that you never never go bowling " he wrote billiards were fine as long as your house had a "rather large" billiards room even "the preppy handbook " lisa birnbachs parody of the prep school set served as a useful field guide for blue bloods going to harvard princeton or yale was acceptable columbia and cornell were "out of the league " yet today the rules for high society are breaking down there are simply so many new millionaires and billionaires from diverse backgrounds and lifestyles that the old signifiers of status have become obsolete the guy in jeans at the sothebys auction is more likely to buy a &# million picasso than the guy in the suit who is probably just an art dealer and the vast majority of todays richest americans didnt go to ivy league schools others like bill gates even dropped out as for veblens "breeding" and "manners " one look at the all you can eat sunday brunch buffet at donald trumps mar a lago resort in palm beach will tell you that manners no longer maketh the rich man or woman so what are the new rules while there is no longer a unified culture of the elite todays moneyed class is following certain patterns that sometimes mimic the ways of the old elite and sometimes turn them on their head inheritance in veblens day those with inherited wealth had higher status than the self made rich "wealth acquired passively by transmission from ancestors or other antecedents presently becomes more honorific than wealth acquired by the possessors own effort " he wrote most of the upper class mr fussell said "owe it all to their ancestors " today most of americas rich are self made and inherited wealth counts for less than of the fortunes of current multimillionaires according to a study by prince &amp associates a connecticut based wealth research firm entrepreneurs are the new kings of affluence the inherited wealthy are looked down upon as in the words of billionaire warren buffett "members of the lucky sperm club " spending in veblens era conspicuous consumption was the order of the day he coined the term the basis for status he wrote was wealth and the proof of your wealth was in the things you purchased the rich man or woman "consumes freely and of the best in food drink narcotics shelter services ornaments apparel weapons and accoutrements " wasteful spending wasnt just tolerated by the wealthy it was required to show your ample means by the early s the rich had become reserved responding to a post depression cultural backlash "showing off used to be the main satisfaction of being very rich in america " wrote mr fussell "now the rich must skulk and hide " no more according to some studies american millionaires are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on homes cars antiques jewels jets and other consumer goods veblens conspicuous consumers in other words are back clothing for the elite of the late th century clothing was designed to be deliberately impractical the most honored kind of wealth was inherited so daily work was considered a debasement clothing therefore conveyed a life of pure leisure whether it was white linen suits and "lustrous" hats for men or corsets and elaborate bonnets for women clothing verblen said should be "expensive but it should also make plain to all observers that the wearer is not engaged in any kind of productive labor " todays elite are all about being conspicuously practical the idle rich have been replaced by the roll up your sleeves workaholic wealthy even if their "work" involves organizing charity fund raisers for women corsets and bonnets have been replaced by lavish accessories like fendi handbags and &# jimmy choo sandals are the new status symbols for men white linen suits are out &# jeans and designer t shirts are in suits are for the help as one palm beach banker who serves the rich told me recently "the wealthy wear t shirts and shorts every day because theyve earned that right we work for them so we wear suits " yachting in "class " mr fussell wrote that of all the pastimes of the wealthy yachting specifically sailing topped the list "sail is far superior to power partly because you cant do it simply by turning an ignition key and steering you have to be sort of to the manner sic born " bigger was better yet the boats had to be slightly uncomfortable made of wood and "hinting at privation " today yachts are almost all powerboats with sail accounting for just of yachts over feet long built each year and they are designed to remove all the discomfort of being on the water computerized stabilizers which make the boat sit perfectly still at anchor are now standard on many boats most also have marble bathrooms inlaid wood paneling and jacuzzis on the sundeck of course with todays megayachts topping feet bigger is still better
