life to pass on " he thinks the odds of his seeing his treasured ring again are slim but perhaps he can take heart from the tale of catherine zenkus who had a lost wedding ring returned to her years after it went missing the ring turned up in tucked away behind a baseboard heater in a home she lived in at the time and the homeowner who found the ring had dedicated years to finding the owner "i
