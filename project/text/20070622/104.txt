weekend journal the drivers seat porsche cayenne turbo cayenne turbo adds heat to the horsepower race theres a senseless war going on right now and im not talking about events in the middle east im speaking of the horsepower battle thats being perpetrated by german luxury brands one thats driving engine outputs to silly levels record high gas prices and global warming be damned look back a decade and a horsepower engine was an oddity strictly the province of six figure exotic sports cars that rarely saw the road today audi bmw mercedes benz and porsche sell all manner of sedans station wagons and suvs with this kind of power mass produced daily drivers priced in the five figures whats more this mine is bigger than yours contest shows no sign of nearing its limit as recent introductions of several and even horsepower models attest among the newcomers stands a reworked for porsche cayenne turbo which hits that absurd mark thanks to a bigger liter twin turbocharged v with direct fuel injection porsche claims its top of the range sport utility vehicle now has a top speed of miles per hour and can accelerate from zero to in seconds despite weighing nearly pounds the only possible justification for spending the &# it costs to park one in your driveway is hubris indeed press the cayenne turbos new "sport" button to punch up the throttle response and firm up the suspension goose the throttle and youre dennis tito behind the wheel of this truck it certainly feels like you can conquer space and time thanks in large part to a new optional chassis control system that uses hydraulic motors to twist the vehicles antisway bars countering body roll back seat passengers may lose their lunch but the new cayenne turbo corners even more like a true porsche than its predecessor that one already was the ne plus ultra of sporty suvs cost considerations meant porsche wasnt about to change it much beyond the engine and suspension upgrades so the new model uses the same basic body structure and it still looks like a bloated porsche coupe with an extra set of doors similarly the interior continues on as a supersized version of the s with acres of leather and suede covering nearly every interior surface its like driving around in a western wear shop new headlights set into a new front end design and some tweaks to the aerodynamic bits at the back are the other significant changes helping the cayenne turbo cut a sleeker path through the air thereby reducing its coefficient of drag from to oh and theres a new power liftgate dont all you cayenne owners rush out to trade up at once the suv is the first model year vehicle ive tested as such the cayenne turbos fuel economy now theres an oxymoron deserves special mention since the epa has revised its estimates to better reflect faster driving speeds and air conditioner use among other factors this is going to reduce stated fuel economy across the board even for s that are mechanically identical to last years models thats not the case here the new cayenne turbos official epa rating is mpg in the city mpg on the highway and mpg combined by comparison the cayenne turbo there was no model was rated at city highway and combined under the epas old system in the real world i got mpg over nearly miles of driving with the preponderance of that on the highway a few acceleration runs and a day spent doing errands dragged that number down some but its unreasonable to expect to get mpg out of a cayenne turbo the new epa highway estimate porsche insists the new model returns up to better highway fuel economy than its predecessor which may be true in a laboratory but not with any normal person driving definitely not with the vehicle in "sport" mode which fixes the electronic throttle controls sluggishness and the six speed automatic transmissions refusal to use first gear the thing is the cayenne turbos lb ft of torque is oxycontin addictive and once those turbos spool up it burns gas like a refinery fire of course conventional wisdom says that people with the means and inclination to buy horsepower cayenne turbos dont care about fuel economy to which id like to ask why not or to really sharpen the point when is it going to become socially unacceptable to drive vehicles that return s vintage fuel economy clearly not anytime soon as these megahorsepower models are being snapped up with the same reckless abandon with which their owners drive them not that porsche is alone in bearing this criticism as this whole realm of vehicles is out of place in a country so restricted by speed limits choked with traffic congestion and increasingly concerned about where its fuel is going to come from today tomorrow and years on but the problem is not so much the cayenne turbo and its brethren its whats not happening on the other side of the equation there is no meaningful fracas being fought over fuel economy today surely not one contested with the intensity of this horsepower war contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
