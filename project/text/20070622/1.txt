a tale of two prosecutors this week the duke nifong drama oozed to its finale with a payout to the victims a confidentiality agreement the usual salutes to the healing process and plans on the part of the principals to begin putting the case behind them missing from these declamations was the core reality that had brought this day to pass no one expected participants in this peace and resolution ceremony to find a moment to recall the rightful fury and amazement this case engendered across the nation and outside of it but such a moment would not have been out of place the story about the duke athletes and district attorney nifong was not simply a riveting drama it was in its searing way an educational event not just about prosecutorial ambition run amok but about a university world reflective of many others where faculty ideologues pursued their agendas unchecked and unabashed here was a nearly successful legal lynching applauded by a significant chunk of the duke faculty proud to display their indifference to questions of guilt or innocence duke president richard brodhead was doubtless disturbed by the charges and the plight of the accused athletes but that didnt prevent him from firing the lacrosse coach in deference to the reigning hysteria or treating the team members as though they merited shunning for the most part he kept his head down while the fires raged around him his was it should be said not unusual behavior the great consuming career goal of our college and university presidents with the exception of oddities like harvards larry summers has for more than two decades been the same to avoid any word or deed that might incur the wrath of their gender and race obsessed faculties and allied campus activists university presidents once had higher ambitions it was a noteworthy week on the justice front even as mr nifong was facing ethics hearings in north carolina scooter libbys attorneys came before trial judge reggie walton in washington to plead for a delay in the beginning of the month sentence the judge had handed down special prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds project the construction of a major case of obstruction of justice out of a perjury rap against mr libby had come to a satisfactory conclusion for mr fitzgerald whose prosecutorial zeal and moral certitude are in no small way reminiscent of mr nifongs the victory was complete with those two final judgments the severe sentence for mr libby and the judges refusal last week to allow its postponement pending appeal the prosecutors argument for a heavy sentence emphasized mr libbys alleged serious obstruction of justice a complicated effort considering that there was no underlying crime or evidence thereof and that this case which had begun in alleged pursuit of the leak of a covert agents identity was as the prosecutor himself would finally contend not about that leak at all just what serious obstruction of justice mr libby could have been guilty of then was at the least a heady question though not one clearly that raised any doubts in the judge neither did mr fitzgeralds charge also in pursuit of a heavy sentence that the defendant had caused by his obstruction no end of trouble and expense in government effort the obligation to truth the prosecutor argued was of the highest importance and one in which mr libby had failed by perjuring himself it would be hard to dispute the first contention it is no less hard to avoid the memory of mr fitzgeralds own dubious relation to truth and honesty as for example in his failure to disclose that he had known all along the identity of the person who had leaked the valerie plame story that person he knew was richard armitage deputy to colin powell not only had he concealed this knowledge in what was supposedly all that time a quest to discover the criminals responsible for the leak of a covert agents name he had instructed both mr armitage and his superior colin powell in whom mr armitage had confided not to reveal the truth special prosecutor fitzgerald did of course have a duty to keep his investigation secret during grand jury proceedings according to the rules he did not have the power to order witnesses at those proceedings not to disclose their testimony or tell what they knew instead mr fitzgerald requested messrs armitage and powell to keep quiet about the leakers identity a request they understandably treated as an order why the prosecutor sought this secrecy can be no mystery it was the way to keep the grand jury proceedings going on a fishing expedition that could yield witnesses who stumbled or were entrapped into "obstruction" or "lying" violations it was its own testament to the nature of this prosecution and the prosecutor that prosecution was abetted by the draw of reggie walton a trial judge not disposed to sympathy for the defense still even for a judge with a reputation for toughness and a predilection for severe sentences the courts behavior was there is no other word for it strange there were bouts of regularly expressed irritation when it occurred to judge walton that his conduct of the trial was being challenged as when the defense arguing for postponement of the sentence cited the existence of grounds for a successful appeal and judge walton was impelled at frequent intervals to hold forth on the need for the man in the street to be persuaded that he receives equal justice defense lawyers must do what they must do but at a certain point it was obvious that letters of support testifying to mr libbys service to the country would avail nothing given a judge enamored of the image of his courtroom as an outpost in the class struggle a judge obviously determined that this government official had to be sent to prison now the outcome of this plea hearing was clear it would have been the same one understood if mr libby had been a medal of honor winner in a wheelchair at one point the judge delivered an outraged denunciation running to several paragraphs about a footnote to an amicus brief filed on behalf of the defendant one he complained in which the brief writers cited white collar cases this indicated the judge concluded their indifference to the principle that blue collar criminals were entitled to the same rights as white collar ones the writers had put the names of these white collar cases out there the fugue continued "solely in the hope that it would cause me to feel pressured " finally the judge dismissed the amicus brief filed by distinguished law professors as "not something i would expect from a first year law student " nothing however quite equaled the courts flow of resentment toward the brief writers as his jeering observations about "these eminent academics" and how he trusted they might be moved in the future to "to provide like assistance" for litigants around the nation who lacked financial means the judge of course knew nothing about the signers of the brief or their pro bono work nor did he have any need to as he knew a judge with life tenure doesnt have much to fear among the signers of the brief dismissed as unworthy of a first year law student was alan dershowitz more than half of whose cases are done pro bono as to the merits of the case for allowing mr libby to remain free pending appeal mr dershowitz a liberal democrat notes that one of the other signers is robert bork "i agree with robert bork on nothing but on this were of one mind " the prospects for mr libbys success in an appeal hinge on three points two concerning the courts refusal to allow the defense to present certain witnesses the other potentially powerful issue relates to mr fitzgerald the special prosecutor was given on his appointment by his long time friend acting attorney general james comey a remarkable freedom from accountability to any higher authority or justice department standards this unique freedom was made explicit in his appointment letter such unparalleled lack of control the appeal will argue is a violation of the principle of checks and balances however it comes out both the case mounted against mr libby and the sentence delivered have plenty of parallels it is familiar stuff the fruits of official power run amok in the name of principle and virtue and its an ugly harvest mr libby is another in the long line of americans fated to face show trials and absurdly long sentences the sort invariably required for meritless prosecutions there was at least one bright spot in the events of the last week specifically mr nifongs removal from office a case at long last of a prosecutor called to account it will be some while we can guess before any such wheels of justice grind their way to the special prosecutors ms rabinowitz a member of the journals editorial board won
