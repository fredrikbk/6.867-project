weekend journal review theater a satisfying serving of southern fried gothic tobacco road triad stage s elm st greensboro n c &# &# closes july beyond glory laura pels theatre w th st new york &# &# closes aug pirates paper mill playhouse brookside drive millburn n j &# &# closes july greensboro n c its always interesting if not always edifying to revisit the great popular successes of the past thats why i flew down to north carolina to see triad stages production of "tobacco road " jack kirklands stage version of erskine caldwells once scandalous novel about the private lives of georgia sharecroppers as all trivia buffs know "tobacco road" was and is the longest running drama ever to hit broadway where it opened in and ran for performances closing seven and a half years later to make way for john fords scrubbed up yucked up film version since then though productions of "tobacco road" have been scarce and so far as i know triad stages revival marks the first time the play has been performed anywhere in some years why did "tobacco road" disappear from american stages now that ive finally seen it i havent a clue for it turns out to be an immensely powerful piece of theatrical goods needless to say some of the impact of the original production must have derived from the fact that few new york playgoers then knew anything whatsoever about the poverty wracked corner of america that caldwell and kirkland portrayed so frankly but "tobacco road " unlike "inherit the wind " is not a sniggeringly condescending travelogue about life in the hookworm and incest belt of the deep south it combines humor and horror to strikingly modern effect and its unattractive characters are portrayed with an unsentimental sympathy that fills the viewer with pity preston lane triad stages artistic director has updated "tobacco road" from the s to the s its usually better when an unfamiliar play is produced as written but mr lane knew exactly what he was doing for the blunt immediacy of his staging is enhanced by the familiarity of its contemporary setting a rusted out house trailer that looks as though it had been towed all the way from the backwoods of georgia to downtown greensboro howard c jones the designer has evoked the "famished desolate land" of "tobacco road" with breathtaking exactitude right down to the thick threatening kudzu and the faded confederate flag that hangs in the trailers broken window mr joness set is as much a "character" as any of the actors on stage and it adds immeasurably to the plays terrific impact gordon joseph weiss plays jeeter lester the leering burnt out patriarch of "tobacco road " his performance is so believable that it makes you shudder though everyone in the cast is convincing especially elisabeth ritson as jeeters fast fading wife and rebecca nerz as his inbred hare lipped daughter to be sure some of the characters run more to caricature than others but mr lane has clearly encouraged everyone to play it straight with wrenchingly powerful results "concentrate on the truth of the scene " alan ayckbourn wrote in "the crafty art of playmaking " "let the comedy take care of itself " mr lane and his players do just that so none of the laughs of which there are plenty are cheap instead triad stage has given us a flawless realization of jack kirklands introductory stage direction "grim humor pervades all stalking side by side with tragedy on the last short mile which leads to complete eventual elimination " new york it took long enough but "beyond glory " stephen langs fire eating portrayal of eight recipients of the medal of honor has finally opened off broadway two years after i saw it at chicagos goodman theatre "mr langs one man play is no simple minded piece of flag waving " i wrote in this space in "it is an unsparingly direct portrait of men at war pushed into narrow corners and faced with hard choices it is also one of the richest most complex pieces of acting ive seen in my theatergoing life " i went back to see it again last week and i stand by every word of my original review the roundabout theatre company has done a great thing by bringing "beyond glory" to new york for a two month run this is acting of the highest imaginable quality a performance that will sear its way into your mind and linger there forever after millburn n j paper mill playhouse which came within hours of closing its doors back in april has since solved some of its pressing financial problems and is now putting on an updated version of "the pirates of penzance" called "pirates " purists who believe that "pirates" is perfect as is should note that arthur sullivans elegantly mendelssohnian score has been rewritten by john mcdaniel in the manner of a broadway musical w s gilberts witty libretto has been rewritten by nell benjamin lately of "legally blonde" in the manner of a three stooges short and gordon greenbergs staging is loud frenetic and nudgingly naughty at first i bristled but then i gave in went with the flow and ended up having a fine time in part because of the ever gratifying presence of farah alvin one of new yorks very best musical comedy singers whose voice as always is brilliant and true classy it aint but "pirates " is full of cheerfully vulgar pep a commodity never to be despised mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater
