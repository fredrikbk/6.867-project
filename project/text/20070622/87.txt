vietnams dark years in march le quoc quan returned to his native vietnam after finishing a fellowship at the national endowment for democracy in washington he was promptly arrested and charged with planning to overthrow the government the charges make sense in the communist country his fellowship focused on how to peacefully spread democracy under pressure from the u s he was released on saturday today president bush will meet with the president of vietnam nguyen van dai at the white house high on the agenda will be the southeast asian nations record on human rights americas military efforts to stop the communist takeover of south vietnam ended in defeat more than years ago the result was what many vietnamese call the "dark years " a period of oppression and economic stagnation that lasted until the mid s but now something interesting is happening america is once again waging a campaign for freedom in vietnam only this time with "soft power" and bipartisan support in recent weeks president bush met with vietnamese human rights advocates house speaker nancy pelosi herself met with diem do chairman of the vietnam reform party this week other democrats have spoken out too including former secretary of state madeline albright who called for mr quans release earlier this year in john kerry told a senate committee that "we found in vietnam that most people didnt even know the difference between communism and democracy " now it is accepted on both sides of the aisle that the vietnamese desire and deserve political freedom there is bipartisan recognition that freedom is a universal human aspiration but of course this consensus is flourishing even as the parties are sharply divided over another war and if abandoned now iraq would almost certainly be doomed to its own dark years just as vietnam was thats a cost many americans and the democratic partys leadership seem willing to incur notwithstanding that with decades of hindsight a decision to leave iraq will likely haunt this nation back in president bill clinton demonstrated remarkable foresight when it came to vietnam he opened an american embassy in hanoi that year would later become the first post war president to visit the country and unleashed what wasnt possible before a torrent of trade today trade stands at &# billion a year between the u s and vietnam more than a five fold increase since mr clinton left office the u s has also grown to be the eighth largest investor in vietnam with more than american businesses operating there in the coming years vietnam will likely become an even stronger trading partner it joined the world trade organization in january and is now looking to outfit its national airline with a fleet of boeing planes capable of making nonstop flights to the u s and as the economy grows there will likely be more pressure to grant economic and political freedoms increasing such pressure is in americas national interest the u s will need new allies in asia to help manage china and isolate north korea but going back to vietnam isnt entirely about finding new markets or old fashion geopolitical positioning in sen john mccain demonstrated as much in making an emotional return trip to the country that had imprisoned and tortured him for more than five years many other veterans of the war have made similar trips back for rep loretta sanchez a democrat who represents a large vietnamese american community in orange county calif its not about economics either she sees the old flag of south vietnam flown by her constituents and knows that there is still a moral fight that needs to be won she often delivers speeches about vietnams human rights record and points out that mr quan isnt the only example of recent abuse to cite just one more father nguyen van ly a catholic priest in vietnam was recently sentenced to eight years in prison perhaps americans need the distance of a few decades to see the full cost of leaving a battlefield uncontested to an oppressive ideology or perhaps the nation needs to spend a few decades with those who were able to flee that ideology following the fall of saigon in there was a massive outpouring of refugees many of whom ended up in the u s today this country is home to the largest community of ethnic vietnamese million outside of vietnam itself mr quan saw this as evidence that this nation is a beacon of freedom for the million people who live in vietnam now thirty years on will we be haunted by a similar history in the case of iraq that will depend on how many on capitol hill remember what we left behind in vietnam and resolve not to leave something similar behind again in the coming months well likely see who has learned from our history and who seems to want to repeat it mr miniter is assistant editor of opinionjournal com see related letter "letters to the editor from the vietnam war a dire lesson for iraq" wsj june
