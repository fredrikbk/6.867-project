solidarity movement u s labor leader aided chinas wal mart coup unlikely alliance helps beijing backed union organize at retailer as china imprisoned dozens of dissident labor activists after massive worker demonstrations in an american labor leader decided it was time to embrace chinas government backed unions andy stern head of the second largest u s union began working behind the scenes with the all china federation of trade unions which has long been criticized by labor leaders around the world for being more aligned with beijings communist government than with chinas workers his service employees international union helped the chinese federation successfully organize wal mart stores inc the worlds largest retailer which unions have failed to do in the u s afl cio director barbara shailor calls mr sterns gambit "a leap of faith " because he undertook it "without any strong signs" that the chinese union is changing its ways amicus one of the united kingdoms largest trade unions concluded after a recent visit that official chinese unions often are used to control workers rather than represent their interests mr stern acknowledges the fears that his move has helped legitimize a labor organization he calls "part of a power state " for mr stern and beijing the alliance has paid off though so far advances for workers are harder to discern mr stern has gained a foothold in china and scored points in his own public battles with wal mart and u s labor leaders in the afl cio and china has raised the profile of its official union which has begun working aggressively to unionize multinational corporations their cooperation is helping spur more hesitant union organizations to increasingly reach out to china as more of the worlds work shifts there afl cio head john sweeney plans to visit for the first time in his capacity as president of the trade union advisory committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development teamsters leader james hoffa a stern ally last month met with chinese labor officials for the first time he hopes they will help organize the china operations of united parcel service inc and trucking company yrc worldwide inc both teamsters strongholds in the u s the union network international a swiss based federation of service sector unions in countries also is exhorting its members to engage the chinese federation says its general secretary philip jennings but he adds "i realize that this is not a choice that everyone is making this is not a free and independent trade union movement " the recent activity is causing increasing discomfort for multinational companies used to operating in china without union entanglements the chinese unions dont use collective bargaining or the right to strike pivotal differences from western groups that make it difficult for them to affect chinas low wages but each company they organize is required to contribute of its local payroll to support the unions activities a law nearing adoption would require companies to "consult" with their unions on changes in workplace rules the union presence also guarantees an extension of the ruling communist party within a companys work force "we are concerned about the labor vs management tone " mike barbalas president of the american chamber of commerce in china said in an email the chamber cites reports that the federation enlists local government authorities such as tax or labor bureaus to persuade companies to establish trade unions a federation official confirms these methods have been used since since its wal mart win last summer the chinese federation has gotten bolder in late march it publicly accused mcdonalds corp and yum brands inc s kfc of paying workers in southern china less than the hourly minimum wage of cents provincial authorities absolved the companies of wrongdoing but the companies are allowing more union representation the federation has set a target of unionizing of foreign companies by the end of this year up from about today chinas dissident labor activists are unimpressed arguing that mr stern has helped empower a fundamentally toothless labor organization which in turn stifles genuine efforts to raise chinese workers poor living standards some of the chinese federations representatives admit they arent accustomed to agitating preferring to hang out at union clubhouses outfitted with amenities such as karaoke machines some of those trying to be more ambitious feel stymied gao haitao head of the wal mart union branch at nanchang bayi square says he has made little headway in trying to talk to wal mart about wages "i feel helpless " he says han dongfang a well known labor activist who spent two years in jail for his union activities says that chinas most egregious labor conditions arent at multinational companies but in construction coal and manufacturing industries areas dominated by large chinese firms mr han now exiled in hong kong calls the setup of the chinese federation in wal mart "an instant noodle union" that "gives people false hope " but even he is using the wal mart example to rally the cause of chinese workers saying in radio broadcasts that workers shouldnt be scared of organizing "since the government tells you it is your right to have a union " mr stern years old is a silver haired ivy league educated iconoclast who takes pride in unconventional methods he says he is searching for new ways to keep unions relevant today when membership is shrinking in most american organizations though he notes his own has grown "i think theres a real difference between doing whats real comfortable and being successful " he says during his first visit to china in the union leader was struggling with the death of his daughter cassie who died of complications from spinal surgery he was searching for something different to do and the challenge of china appealed to him he says at that time china was suffering from what one government report described as a "high tide" of worker dissatisfaction as the nation took steps toward becoming a market economy thousands of workers staged protests after being laid off from state factories or seeing their benefits disappear thanks to corrupt bosses labor activists were imprisoned and official union membership sank mr stern began familiarizing himself with the workings of the federation known as the acftu the organization founded in has grown into a giant bureaucracy and is considered similar in standing to a government ministry many top union officials also rank highly in the ruling communist party the acftu describes itself as a union "with chinese characteristics " meaning it mediates to promote harmonious relationships between employers and employees many union officials describe it as having operated as a sort of social and welfare club organizing concerts or facilities for ping pong and distributing coupons or small cash bonuses during chinese festivals by mr stern was focused intently on the acftu organizing wal mart which has vigorously fought union attempts to organize wal mart stores are unionized in a few countries including brazil mexico the u k and japan in most cases the stores were unionized before being acquired by the retailer eduardo castro wright wal marts ceo of u s stores is a director of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal beth keck a wal mart spokeswoman says the bentonville ark company respects workers wishes and the labor practices where it operates "our whole approach to labor practices is that they are consistent and respectful of the country we are operating in " by organizing wal mart in china mr stern could gain information such as labor violations by the company and its suppliers in the country in mr stern formed wal mart watch in the u s it is a nonprofit largely funded by the seiu that challenges the companys business practices among other things wal mart watch collects information from wal mart employees and vendors and offers it to the media and other interested parties mr stern also led a faction that broke away from the afl cio causing one of the most contentious divisions in recent american labor history with fellow giants the teamsters the united food and commercial workers and several smaller unions he formed a group dubbed change to win focused on new methods to recruit members an area in which the seiu is one of the few unions to gain ground in china his timing was good in a government report said labor and trade union laws werent respected by foreign companies as concerns about inequality were rising the chinese union placed wal mart and several other employers on a public blacklist hoping to shame the companies into agreeing to unionization wal mart which now has more than stores in china responded that it was following chinese laws and its workers hadnt asked to unionize "id asked myself are you really going to help is it worth the time and energy " said mr stern "but wal mart was the symbolic question here was china explaining to us that the law requires unionization and here was the largest company flaunting their role " the acftu was used to chinese companies acceding to its request to represent workers but a top down approach with wal marts management was going nowhere said acftu officials "they were challenging us " wang ying a director at the acftu said in an interview last year in november a delegation from the chinese union flew to the u s for a trip hosted by the seiu that included thanksgiving dinner at the washington d c home of a top union official a cirque du soleil performance in las vegas and daylong seminars with academics during a dinner at a san francisco chinese restaurant people squeezed around a table meant for taking advantage of the relaxed atmosphere josie mooney head of an seiu local in san francisco suggested the group play a game where an organizer would identify a problem they were having while the other side would suggest resolutions some members of the chinese delegation said when they went to wal mart stores to talk to workers management often shooed them away chinese union officials say workers in nanjing city had made more than fruitless attempts in two years to meet with wal marts local management ms mooney and her team suggested the chinese union start talking to workers at their homes catching them at bus stops or restaurants where they lunched "i think the idea of talking to workers outside of their work hours was something new to them " says ms mooney wal mart spokesman jonathan dong said that "the fact that meetings took place in the nanjing store validates what weve always been saying that is wal mart respects the law respects associates wishes and has maintained an open channel for discussion regarding this issue " wal mart also says it is company policy not to allow union organizing at work sites during business hours acftu officials say the u s meetings were useful they also say they already had been planning to seek out workers at the retailer but they still needed an employee willing to force wal marts hand union officials cast around various wal mart outlets looking for college graduates who were native to their region in early june of they found their first candidate ke yunlong now years old is a worker in the frozen meats section in southern chinas jinjiang city union officials approached mr ke through zheng wenshan secretary of the local communist party branch an indication of the partys interest in unionizing wal mart mr zheng got mr kes elderly neighbor to drop by his home and then the neighbor had him meet the local union boss fu furong "they said if i did this i would make history be famous " recalled the slender bespectacled mr ke a graduate in chemistry who held a higher paying white collar position before working at wal mart he said he took the job because he wanted the experience of working for a well known western company "and the most famous is wal mart " with some trepidation mr ke persuaded five other co workers to go to a meeting at the communist party secretarys house where they met mr fu the local union made them a written promise that if any worker was fired by wal mart because of union membership the union would get them other similar paying jobs over the next two weeks the acftu sent union organizers to the entrance of the store to catch workers before and after shifts on july the jinjiang workers held the first wal mart china union meeting at a m so that workers from the day and night shift could be present dressed in his tomato red company shirt mr ke affixed his fingerprint to an application for union membership followed by the other workers as they gathered under a banner that read "determined to take the road to develop trade unionism with chinese characteristics " days later several other wal mart unions sprang up within other regional acftu branches in a similar manner on aug wal mart signed an agreement allowing the formation of unions at all of its china locations joe hatfield chief executive of wal mart asia said in a written statement at the time "i fully anticipate working collaboratively with leadership from acftu and union organizations at all levels to create a model working relationship " mr fu and other local organizers met with mr stern and other u s union officials in beijing the mood was celebratory "the irony is to this day we have wal mart unions in china a communist country but not in democratic countries " mr stern says "but spillover could happen " while theres little evidence of that yet mr stern has reaped some benefits dominique muller hong kong director for the international trade union confederation whose members include the afl cio says the seius involvement in china creates a perception among labor groups the "seiu looks more progressive and afl cio more hidebound " mr stern also says that stronger ties with the acftu are getting him and his colleagues entree to some of chinas major state owned companies the teamsters mr hoffa for instance met with officials of china ocean shipping co a major state owned shipping company "without the acftu i dont think we wouldve had that conversation " says mr stern the seiu has given workshops to some chinese union officials on collective bargaining techniques the federation says it is beginning to try to do industrywide or companywide contract negotiations "were encouraging them " mr stern said in jinjiang city mr ke and his wal mart union colleagues have been a bit at loose ends the new union clubhouse is plastered with photos of mr ke and equipped with about &# in new exercise computer and karaoke equipment but seiu training doesnt extend to the local level "we didnt know what is the job of a trade union " he says so they have had to consult with mr fu a month after the union was formed one of its original members li wei was fired for sleeping on the job workplace siestas are common at many companies in china and mr li believes he was unduly singled out for punishment because of his union role wal mart says it doesnt differentiate between those belonging to the union and those who dont "sleeping on the job is not acceptable for any associate " says mr dong the newly formed organization didnt protest mr lis dismissal instead it gave him a job taking care of the new union facilities matching his salary union leader mr ke said at the time they had to focus on more important issues such as "protecting workers rights " kersten zhang in
