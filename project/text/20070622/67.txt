politics &amp economics feeding the watchdogs democrats steer more funds to oversight washington after devoting months to oversight hearings house democrats are steering millions of dollars to inspectors general and regulatory agencies they hope will be their eyes and ears and even allies in the governments executive branch house appropriations bills would add enforcement funds for federal agencies that regulate securities job safety and consumer products the federal trade commission for example would get a funding increase and a nudge to step up investigations into fraud in the market for subprime loans or loans made to borrowers with troubled credit histories inspectors general who serve as fiscal watchdogs inside government departments are getting added funds and senate democrats have gone even further than the house guaranteeing double digit increases the strategys goal is to show that the democratic majority that took power in congress this year can be a good steward of federal funds while countering the white houses veto threats against spending bills that would add more than &# billion to president bushs domestic budget requests democrats argue that the increase amounts to only at a time when far more money is being consumed by wars overseas but with iraq and immigration dividing republicans mr bush appears to be eager for a fight over spending to appease his restive political base house republicans scored a round last week when democrats stumbled by failing to disclose what spending earmarks for home state projects would be attached to the appropriations bills days later mr bush tapped former rep jim nussle known for his confrontational personality to become white house budget director stepping back the house appropriations committee yesterday began to spell out the home state projects contained in the bills in a more transparent fashion and to cut the funding for them to half the level under republican rule less than &# million about half the total in was devoted to members projects in a &# billion natural resources bill for example how that measure fares next week will be a major test of whether the committee and its embattled chairman rep david obey d wis have righted themselves the bill covers the environmental protection agency interior department and forest service and follows a series of hearings overseen by its manager rep norman dicks d wash the legislation &# billion over mr bushs budget includes extra money for inspectors general at interior and epa and funds an amalgam of programs affecting western lands and rural southern districts important to republicans "i found it fascinating some of the problems were facing " said rep todd tiahrt the bills republican manager mr tiahrt broke with mr dicks over the last &# million added to the bill but the conservative kansan supports many initiatives that grew out of the expanded hearings including some affecting native americans and the forest service mr obey is promoting a commitment to congressional oversight urging his subcommittees to look years ahead in shaping their bills "what kind of country are we going to be facing if we make investments or we dont " he says "if you think that way then you think about problems rather than accounting " on the appropriations committees homeland security panel for example chairman david price d n c broke with past practice by inviting in more outside witnesses including inspectors general of dhs agencies to review the departments performance the resulting bill demands more competitive bidding withholds &# billion from nine programs until more detailed plans are submitted and increases funding in the departments procurement office to improve oversight it also orders studies to be performed by outside entities including a first ever request that the national academy of sciences be hired to evaluate the governments biowatch program to detect pathogens in the air "weve opened up i believe a wide ranging discussion of the way we prioritize funding both for terrorism and natural disasters " mr price said democratic rep jose serrano of new york a native of puerto rico who was raised in the south bronx is now chairman of the appropriations committees financial services panel which oversees the regulators who watch over the new york stock exchange and the rest of wall street he is pressing federal agencies not only to be aggressive in their enforcement but also to pay more attention to problems of the poor and immigrants his plan would give the securities and exchange commission an added &# million above the presidents budget aimed at cracking down on frauds that victimize seniors and low income communities the bill makes investor education and financial literacy activities a priority while mr serrano beefed up internal revenue service enforcement he also added &# million more for taxpayer services than the president requested "financial services doesnt mean only folks who make a lot of money " mr serrano says "what were saying is those of you who are agencies that have the ability to investigate and do enforcement get on it get on it strongly but what im proudest of is its a switch to say that all these agencies should take care of the guy who is not making &# million " for mr obey the challenge is to learn not just from republican mistakes but from democratic errors as well before losing power in democratic run committees were too independent he says now the goal is to let the leadership set an agenda and committees provide expertise "the only way you have to develop that knowledge is to have adequate oversight hearings so you actually know how the hell programs are working " mr obey says his headstrong style has hurt him not just with republicans but also fellow democrats embarrassed by last weeks dust up over earmarks "if you want heaven die and go to heaven " the chairman snapped at a reporter but he is betting a big investment in oversight will pay dividends "substance trumps politics " mr obey says quoting another headstrong character richard bolling of missouri an influential house democrat in the s and s but the strategy is a gamble mr bolling failed to reach the top rung of the house leadership ending up as rules committee chairman and a lieutenant to house speaker thomas "tip" oneill of massachusetts whose motto was "all politics is local "
