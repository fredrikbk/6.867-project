weekend journal sports by the numbers the wind in their sails historically the americas cup has been a very lopsided competition in of the previous cup challenges including the past three the winner swept the series but as this years finals get under way tomorrow there are reasons to think that the face off between emirates team new zealand and defending champ alinghi of switzerland might be the exception to the rule theres at least one reason the competition has been so lopsided the holder of the cup decides on many of the terms of the challenge including where the races are held since switzerland is landlocked this years races in the best of nine series will be in the mediterranean off valencia spain but the weather there could become a wild card throwing the competition wide open winds in valencia have tended to be light generally knots or less this calmer water tends to suit boats with a v shaped hull like team new zealands while the u shaped hull of alinghis boat usually performs better in higher winds knots and up indeed the kiwis have been exceptionally good so far having the first boat ever to sweep the finals of the louis vuitton cup which is contested among all of the challengers for the americas cup the current americas cup holder doesnt race in the vuitton cup in americas cup races held off valencia from to the present new zealand has capitalized on light wind situations winning of races when winds were at knots or below an success rate when the winds were over knots the kiwis success rate was five of seven races alinghi having yet to unveil the new boat it will use in the finals the alinghi sui has been less successful than new zealand in light winds of for but has an edge over them when the wind picks up four of five or with the winds over knots head to head since the americas cup new zealand has won six of their meetings including four of five last year and keep in mind that the alinghi sui shares the u shaped hull that characterized the boat alinghi sailed in those earlier races the americas cup has generally been considered more a boat building competition than a test of racing skill courageous won the americas cup with ted turner as skipper after all but in valencias generally light wind conditions that might not be the main story this time after winning three straight cups while amassing a career record skipper russell coutts will sit this one out in he brought the cup back to new zealand from the u s in a sweep five years later he defended easily against italys challenger prada unhappy about the lack of credit he received mr coutts along with his tactician brad butterworth jumped ship for the cup and joined forces with financier ernesto bertarelli to head alinghi alinghi earned a cup victory against new zealand that year making switzerland the only nation to win the cup on its first try in sailing mad new zealand mr couttss defection provoked threats against his family and the families of his crew when it was time to plan alinghis defense mr coutts suggested that the races be run in the strong winds of the atlantic off portugals coast and that the size of the boats be increased slightly mr bertarelli opted to keep the current boats and hold the races in valencia the ensuing acrimony led to mr couttss dismissal and a legal settlement which will keep mr coutts out of the competition with the defending champion skipper not on board alinghi may turn to american ed baird peter holmberg of the u s virgin islands or dark horse jochen schuemann the announcement is set for today helming new zealands boat will be dean barker mr barker was on the short side of new zealands defeat but made history when his mentor mr coutts handed him the helm for the last race of the defense making him at age the youngest winning skipper in history so unless alinghis sui has hidden speed this should be one of the most competitive americas cups with the outcome largely dependent on the mercurial mediterranean weather wholl take the cup home the answer is blowing in the wind
