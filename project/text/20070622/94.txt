weekend journal review books the man in the spotlight this time this place my life in war the white house and hollywood by jack valenti harmony books pages &# with his silver mane barrel chest and stentorian voice jack valenti who died in april at age two years after retiring as president of the motion picture association of america was hard to ignore over time he even acquired a kind of celebrity status as the movie industrys chief lobbyist and public defender senators congressmen and presidents readily took the calls of the man who headed the mpaa for four decades and little wonder they were so inclined to speak with him no one was better at playing both sides of the political aisle and jawboning concessions from lawmakers as the go between for washington and hollywood valenti guided politicians through mogul meetings and the twinkling parties of filmmakers and stars his two mentors were lew wasserman the longtime chief of universal and lyndon johnson both of whom he served untiringly as confidant and consigliore with valentis death the postwar era of hollywood when movies came to dominate popular culture and represent america to the world drew to an unofficial close valenti opens his autobiography "this time this place " with a flashback to dallas on nov as it happened he was riding in president kennedys motorcade that fateful day at the time valenti was a mere houston adman and aspiring politico who had known lbj since his early senate days the vice president was so impressed with valentis adept work at smoothing arrangements for his arrival in dallas that lbj snatched him up on the spot as his aide de camp valentis face can be seen in the background of the famous photo of lbj being sworn in as president aboard air force one valenti was to spend the next hours only a few feet from the new president and was to remain figuratively close throughout lbjs presidency a precocious working class kid from houston valenti was a spinning gyro of energy and can do spirit the son every parent would love to have earnest industrious respectful he graduated from high school at worked in the advertising department at humble oil during the day and studied at the university of houston at night in he joined the u s army air corps taking his first solo flight after only nine hours of instruction during the war he piloted bombing missions over europe in a b and learned to appreciate after taking antiaircraft fire that the b was "a brute for punishment" that could "fly on one engine better than any craft i know " thanks to the g i bill valenti was able to attend harvard business school after the war he returned to houston to open a small ad agency soon branching out to become a political handler he was a born hustler in the nonpejorative sense of the word with a knack for getting to know powerful people in powerful places indeed one of valentis weaknesses appears to have been an unquestioned awe of powerful men he would have called it loyalty his early affiliation with lyndon johnson was the direct result of his having fallen in love with mary margaret wiley a johnson aide and his future wife "the plain fact is that mary margaret was the key to my growing intimacy with lbj he trusted her completely " valenti writes as such a remark suggests valentis account is far from pure braggadocio he tells his story straightforwardly acknowledging debts sketching the people he knew and giving a not entirely flattering account of himself "a fierce ambition burned in me even before i could define the word " he acknowledges the self portrait he draws is one of a restless indefatigable young man who is committed to his own advancement but does not put off people in the pursuit of it he knew how to hold his tongue if he needed to when the admissions officer at harvard business school sniffs that he has never heard of the university of houston "rather odd dont you think " valenti responds lightly with "well there has to be a first time " underneath he admits he is seething his chronicle of the white house years reads like a fast paced novel with a level of detail appropriate for such important history he devotes a page chapter to one week in july when lbj and his advisers debated how far the country should commit itself to the vietnam war he even reconstructs verbatim the dialogue of two crucial meetings in which undersecretary of state george ball ends up as the lone dissenter opposing escalation "no one spoke up to second ball and urge his course on the president " writes valenti when valentis story moves to hollywood oddly it loses its appeal and pace the first mpaa board meeting in a banal affair hardly deserves the long recounting he gives it as for glitzy parties after academy awards shows they are by now over familiar to all of us from gossip magazines and entertainment television valentis versions in "this time this place" are pale by comparison and name droppingly tedious its as if the former bomber pilot and high ranking government official goes ga ga at finding himself swirling in a galaxy of movie stars and insists on telling us about it valenti pokes fun at some of the pompous behavior and trappings of hollywood satraps he describes a cigar in the mouth of the tormenting fox studio chief and producer darryl zanuck as "larger than a louisville slugger protruding a full zip code from his mouth " but much of last part of the book is given over to his invariably delightful dealings with hollywood icons frank sinatra quincy jones rex harrison cary grant kirk douglas warren beatty the superlatives pile up joness bel air mansion is "stunning" beatty is "one of the most fascinating citizens of the hollywood pantheon of stars" madonna is "glorious " who knew alas valenti is less interested or assumes that we are in more important matters the movie ratings system that he devised and defended the effort to squelch the rampant pirating of films and tv shows and not least the long battle by movie studios and their television production divisions to block tv networks from owning the shows that they air the battle seemed to have been won in when the studios succeeded in getting the fcc to pass the financial interest and syndication rules commonly known in the industry as fin syn barring networks from demanding a financial stake in programs made by outside producers and from syndicating them without fin syn valenti writes the networks would be able to use their power over what aired to "make producers do their bidding everyone would be a contract employee a horrible thought " but in during the deregulatory heyday of the reagan administration the fcc announced that it was contemplating revoking the fin syn rules valenti sprang into action "it must be a massive round the clock effort enlisting every ally we could find and all the political clout we could muster " he writes then we learn what was long suspected that valenti called lew wasserman who was once ronald reagans movie agent "i knew that reagan knew he owed his last role as host of general electric theater to wasserman" and reagans close friend screen actors guild president charlton heston reagan had also been a sag president to enlist them in persuading the president to back the studios side valenti claims that he never checked to see whether wasserman and mr heston contacted the president "its what the cia calls deniability " at any rate the studios campaign succeeded for a time the fcc let fin syn stay in place until and once the rules disappeared altogether the result was that the studios and networks immediately did what fin syn prevented them from doing all along they frantically merged disney bought abc the following year viacom which owned paramount bought cbs and universal joined nbc under general electrics umbrella in demonstrating once again hollywoods penchant for working against its own best interests witness the movie industrys rabid opposition to videocassette recorders a fight it took all the way to the supreme court and was lucky enough to lose in home video promptly became a goldmine for the studios "nothing lasts everything changes" is the extent of valentis reflection on the aftermath of the misguided fin syn campaign when not lapsing into starstruck gush valentis prose can be admirably spartan occasionally decorated with bons mots from historical figures and references to literary classics unlike a lot of people who inhabit the back rooms of washington and back lots of hollywood valenti appears to have enjoyed a firsthand acquaintance with the written word he claims to have read "every word" of macaulay and "every book" by winston churchill he even says that he has "read and reread" gibbons "decline and fall of the roman empire " good for him but "this time this place" itself falls short of being memorable a missed opportunity if ever there was one a detailed account of how valenti operated behind the scenes at the nexus of hollywood and washington might well be one of the most instructive political manuals since machiavellis "the prince " like a court chamberlain valenti was privy to secrets and handled them with discretion he knew how to act prudently to get what he wanted and sometimes ruthlessly but no secrets are revealed in "this time this place " no great lessons in power are on offer it appears that a man who spent his lifetime breathing the re circulated air of hollywood and washington where information and image are mercilessly protected couldnt bring himself to stray from the shooting script mr lippman is a former reporter who covered the movie industry for the wall street journal
