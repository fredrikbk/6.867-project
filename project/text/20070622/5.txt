blackstones green day firm co founders stack up billions in ipo priced at &# a share blackstone group and goldman sachs group inc are investment powerhouses that generate huge profits from their investing and advisory prowess but the heated interest in blackstones initial public offering of stock which was priced after the close of trading yesterday at &# a share and will begin trading today suggests that investors are willing to pay much more for each dollar of earnings from blackstone than from wall street investment banks such as goldman for the shares to be winners blackstones heady growth will have to continue blackstone raised as much as &# billion last night after million common units were sold into the offering making it one of the biggest ipos on wall street the personal winnings for blackstones leaders already are eye popping at &# a share assuming the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares the firms year old co founder and chief executive stephen schwarzman is expected to collect almost &# million from the ipo and will be left with a stake in the company valued at about &# billion earlier calculations assumed a &# price the midrange of the offerings potential pricing mr schwarzmans year old co founder peter peterson will collect about &# billion in the ipo and retain a stake valued at about &# billion the stock price is expected to climb on the first day of trading today on the new york stock exchange in part because so many investors were prevented from participating in the ipo which creates pent up demand especially from foreign investors following on blackstones heels kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co a giant in the private equity world also is expected to go public behind all of the enthusiasm is a view that blackstones business model is in some ways better than goldmans blackstone makes money advising and investing for others and it doesnt have to spend much on advertising and infrastructure by contrast goldman risks its own money to generate much of its profits and depends on a big balance sheet blackstone is seen as a "best of breed" manager of so called alternative assets such private equity funds capable of piling on profits as more pension funds and others shift into this category an attractive dividend yield of about is another plus blackstones ipo comes as market conditions change with the relatively low interest rates that sparked the deal frenzy going up and the favorable financing for commercial real estate already becoming a thing of the past if the market deteriorates current tax rules change or blackstones size isnt as much of an advantage as bulls expect investors lining up for the shares likely will be disappointed "it isnt coming out as a grossly overvalued stock if you want exposure to a very interesting part of the capital markets " says ted wolff who invests in financial stocks for solaris asset management a new york investment manager that has more than &# billion in assets and is considering buying the stock "but its very very hard to value because there are few companies that look like it " a bill recently proposed in washington threatens to tax financial services partnerships at the corporate rate rather than their current although the bill as currently worded gives blackstone a five year grace period to enjoy the current tax rate there is growing chatter about shortening or even eliminating the five year period at the same time shareholders will have limited voting rights and will be unable to replace blackstones directors and compensation to employees is expected to rise once blackstone begins trading under ticker symbol bx investors tracking the company say they have been guided to expect earnings of &# a share in meaning the stock at the ipo price trades at almost times next years expected earnings though some investors are confident blackstone can make &# a share next year if blackstones tax treatment is changed it will put a crimp on profits by way of comparison firms such as goldman morgan stanley merrill lynch &amp co lehman brothers holdings inc and bear stearns cos trade at an average price earnings ratio of about other asset management firms such as alliance bernstein and t rowe price trade at richer multiples of about as do advisory firms such as greenhill &amp co and alternative manager fortress investment group llc reflecting the profitability of those businesses blackstones shares also seem expensive using other metrics such as in relation to the firms assets under management blackstone is being valued at almost of its &# billion of assets compared with less than for firms such as t rowe price and alliance bernstein the reason alternative assets are more lucrative than traditional assets like mutual funds blackstones assets under management have soared to &# billion as of the beginning of may from &# billion in one way to keep expanding and help returns tapping into its new relationship with chinas government to generate a flow of deals there blackstone recently sold about &# billion of shares to an investment vehicle run by the chinese government the money blackstone is raising as well as its huge size should give it enough of a cushion to ride out any difficulties if the lending environment sours providing it an advantage against competitors though the stock price could be hurt nonetheless at his many appearances pitching blackstone to investors mr schwarzman has referred to the advantage of its size noting that blackstone gets the critical first and last calls from bankers about potential deals but goldmans scale makes blackstone look puny at the end of may goldman whose shares closed yesterday at &# on the big board had &# billion under management of which &# billion was in its alternative asset business goldmans sources of earnings are far more diversified too of the &# billion in revenue in the year ended last november only &# billion was from gains on its private equity and real estate portfolios by contrast blackstone makes its money by running hedge funds and other vehicles conducting buyouts and investing in real estate it is easy to argue that private equity is a cyclical business and that the ideal conditions of the past several years may be coming to an end goldman is more diversified for the bad times indeed one of the recurring questions for the mr schwarzman at the firms recent roadshows was about the turn in the cycle last year blackstone recorded &# billion in net income but in at the time of the last downturn its net was a mere &# million illustrating how severe the potential peak to trough can be at a private equity firm another fear of participants at blackstones tour for investors the act of listing will in itself change the magic of blackstone and instead of focusing on high return deals the firm will devote itself to asset growth mr schwarzman took pains to stress that this wont be the case and that blackstone will be run in the interest of the investors in its funds
