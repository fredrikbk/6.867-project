weekend journal taste houses of worship highway to heaven defying years of fusty precedent the vatican this week issued a document customized for speedy entry onto the information superhighway if not prominent mention in late night monologues a "ten commandments" for the road as church officials called it with letterman esque whimsy the document offers guidance for drivers so that "the road also becomes a path to holiness" rather than a flashpoint for road rage in reality the drivers decalogue was just one section in a page document titled "guidelines for the pastoral care of the road" which makes it sound as if the pavement itself may be on the path to perdition issued by the vaticans pontifical council for migrants and travelers the documents other three sections dealt with the critical issues of ministry to "street women" and pastoral care for street children and the homeless naturally it was the section on "the pastoral care of road users" that drew all the attention and created as much buzz as anything else the roman curia has done under the aegis of pope benedict xvi indeed it is not often that a single church document prompts references to popular movies "i dont care if it rains or freezes long as i got my plastic jesus sitting on the dashboard of my car " sings paul newmans character in "cool hand luke" pop rockers jon bon jovi and his "lost highway" and overly suggestive anthems meat loafs "paradise by the dashboard light" to cite just a few examples from the blogosphere and beyond beneath the drollery however was widespread puzzlement as to why the vatican would be devoting time and resources to such a mundane topic doesnt the holy see have more serious worries such as war and famine and of course the salvation of souls one explanation is that the document was generated by the vatican agency headed by cardinal renato martino a longtime curialist whose flair for the juicy soundbite has periodically irritated his higher ups yet if this weeks document was not exactly benedicts doing it does reflect a concern the pope has expressed several times and as the extensive footnotes in the document show every pontiff from pius xii to pope john paul ii has voiced reservations about the worlds burgeoning car culture indeed it is not much of a leap to see the vaticans "highway code" as an important amplification of the churchs ethic of life according to steve koepke director of the mississippi based sacred heart auto league yes such a thing exists vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among americans from to years old "i think this document fits quite well within the churchs teachings on the respect for life " vatican officials also noted that across the globe vehicular accidents result in million deaths and million injuries each year moreover as mr koepke rightly notes there is no small virtue in the church addressing itself to matters of everyday life in the trenches where the battle between faith and fear plays out "driving and its dangers and frustrations are something that everyone can relate to " mr koepke said in fact people everywhere but especially in the u s are driving more than ever before and usually under pressure to arrive ahead of the growing number of other drivers whose very presence makes the longer commute even longer and the likelihood of crashes ever higher as the vatican document notes driving can bring out the "primitive" side of modern man encouraging a "domination instinct" and reducing interpersonal communication to an exchange of obscene gestures the vatican is careful to preface its comments by highlighting the positive aspects of mobility which are not only "expressions of human nature and of our cultural development" but also have a scriptural lineage from the wanderings of the israelites to the parables of jesus including the prodigal son and the good samaritan and modern transportation has facilitated interactions between cultures as well as pilgrimages but the document also warns that in the contemporary world "our lives are conditioned by the car as mobility has become an idol which the car symbolises " and here is the heart of the document and the influence of benedict himself when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april many expected his papacy to be an extension of the doctrinal border patrol that he led during his years as head of the vaticans congregation for the doctrine of the faith yet not only has he switched jobs from theological "bad cop" to pastoral "good cop " but his role as pope has also revealed his nature as a classic conservative a spiritual son of augustine who stresses the cultivation of personal holiness through the grace of god as the remedy for societys ills rather than structural "big government" solutions yes benedict has frequently evinced a "crunchy cons" solicitude for the environment the vatican recently announced it would install solar panels on the main audience hall and the document states that the toll excessive driving exacts on the earths resources is a chief concern yet the new ten commandments are above all consistent with benedicts thinking in that they do not demand a greater reliance on mass transit nor do they push controversial proposals for congestion pricing or stricter fuel standards rather the document stresses the primacy of the relatively low profile virtues of prudence humility and christian holiness "those who know jesus christ are careful on the roads " the document says "they dont only think about themselves and are not always worried about getting to their destination in a great hurry " in a culture that produces shows like "pimp my ride" and exalts the use of military vehicles as family cars that may not be such bad advice so before dismissing the vaticans latest pronouncement as a waste of time that one could better spend sniffing out a prime parking space it may be worth everyones effort to sit down and read the document closely just pull over to the side of the road first mr gibson is the author of "the rule of benedict pope benedict xvi and his battle with the modern world " see related letter "letters to the editor
