weekend journal taste another school dropout when the kids in the oakland public schools left for summer vacation last week they did so oblivious to any staff changes at the districts offices its not really their concern for instance that barak ben gal the budget director for the school system recently decided to become yahoo s director of corporate finance but when people like mr ben gal who has a bachelors degree in economics from harvard and degrees in business and education from stanford spend three years trying to change the system and then give up someone should notice the people who run the operations and finances of public school districts are not visible the way that teachers are but as with teachers recruiting and retaining smart ones is an uphill battle after finishing at stanford in mr ben gal full disclosure i know him from college was accepted into the broad residency in urban education funded by billionaire eli broad the program takes people with jds mbas or degrees in public policy and at least four years of work experience and places them in inner city school districts when mr ben gal started his residency the oakland unified school district was bankrupt it had been placed under state control and his first role was as the special assistant to the state administrator in the subsequent two years he was the executive officer of financial services and then finally the budget director for the whole district today thanks in some part to his efforts the district is out of bankruptcy and several foundations have made large grants to oakland now that he has left though mr ben gal can offer his criticisms of the system and they are worth understanding particularly for two reasons first an increasing number of school districts are hiring leaders from business backgrounds whether its joel klein the new york city schools chancellor who was once a corporate lawyer or joseph olchefske who left investment banking and eventually worked as the superintendent in seattle for a few years some businessmen find that running a multimillion or multibillion dollar school system has a certain appeal but those thinking of this track should know what theyre getting into second as standards based education has become more prevalent thanks to no child left behind "some people may think that the problems in our schools are going to go away " says frederick hess director of education policy studies at the american enterprise institute in fact he explains all that information were collecting about student achievement wont be helpful "if we cant figure out what specifically is improving student achievement and how much it costs " even if administrators can get all that data he adds their hands are often tied so for instance mr ben gal tells me that if a school has a surplus in its textbook fund and needs a new security officer the money cannot be transferred indeed in many cases a district administrator wont even know how much money is available until its too late mr ben gal explains that thanks to the timing of the state budget process he would not find out about discretionary funds available for say a music teacher or a school counselor until halfway through that school year the lack of information is not just coming from above its coming from below principals often dont tell the district that they have a position to fill at their school until a few weeks before the school year begins why according to the collective bargaining agreement every teacher under contract has the right to work someplace in the school district if a principal doesnt want a particular teacher the district still owes him a job a principal would rather start the year with no teacher in the classroom than take the one who has been cut from another school and the clerical union is like the teachers one seniority not competence gets people promoted mr ben gal reports "there were people in accounting who didnt know the difference between a debit and credit " and the administrators as mr hess explains administrators are almost entirely former classroom educators "there is nothing in their background that would lead you to believe theyd be good managers of teams of adults " mr hess who has done extensive studies of the way principals are trained says that they are not getting any kind of education in these areas once they move out of the classroom either even if you can assemble a team of competent people and somehow hold on to them without offering merit raises mr ben gal notes that you are still constrained in ways that would be unimaginable in the private sector for instance he compares the operations of his local school board with the board of a corporation "corporate boards look at big picture governance they ask what are the major milestones our ceo should be achieving board conversations are held behind closed doors because the board members are supposed to act as trusted advisers " by contrast the oakland board like most school committees has all of its meetings televised every contract no matter how minuscule must be put to a vote and every financial decision has to be put on hold while waiting for a monthly board meeting as for its members acting as trusted advisers mr ben gal assures me that thanks to the public nature of its meetings "the school board typically knows less than what the staff knows " in principle smart businessmen should want to enter this field as mr olchefske the former seattle superintendent tells me "these are fascinating complex jobs there are academic goals financial goals a lot of balls to juggle the skills you develop are applicable in other environments " mr ben gal at age was overseeing the budget of an &# million organization with employees &# million in construction projects security officers mail carriers nurses and bus drivers the results based budgeting system mr ben gal helped institute became the subject of a case study at berkeleys business school and spawned a case competition with seven other institutions to develop recommendations to help districts tackle similar issues new york and chicago later consulted heavily with oakland on their own budgeting reforms how was this news taken by mr ben gals colleagues he tells me it was a "morale hit " people asked "why do we need to bring in outsiders to solve our problems " to this day he remains amazed that the effort to "attract and draw more talent into the sector was not well received " when asked why he left mr ben gal cites various structural problems as well as a "lack of professional mentorship " he advises newcomers from the business arena to make sure they find a supervisor "who can make use of their skills otherwise someone coming in might feel frustrated and underutilized " mr ben gal took a pay cut when he came to the district but he has no regrets about that he says he didnt join for the money and he didnt leave for it either ms riley is
