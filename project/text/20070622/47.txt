kims u n buddy the last time we wrote about adrianus petrus wilhelmus melkert the dutch politician turned international bureaucrat he was busy disavowing his record at the world bank in an effort to oust president paul wolfowitz mr melkert had run the bank boards ethics committee which advised mr wolfowitz to give the raise to his girlfriend that became the basis for the phoney accusations against him now mr melkert has resurfaced as an anti american agitator in another global sinecure as associate administrator of the united nations development program he recently threatened to "retaliate" against the u s for its efforts to get to the bottom of incompetence and possible corruption in the undps program in north korea the international diplomats nasty but revealing threat occurred in a meeting this month with mark wallace who is the point man at the u s mission to the u n for the continuing investigation into the cash for kim jong il scandal in which many millions of dollars of undp money may have been diverted to pyongyang the incident was recounted in a june letter to mr melkerts boss kemal dervis from zalmay khalilzad u s permanent representative to the u n "i was surprised and concerned to learn that mr melkert suggested to ambassador wallace that undp viewed the united states inquiry relating to north korea as justifying some kind of retaliation against the government of the united states " mr khalilzad wrote the undp issued a statement "categorically" denying the accusation as reported in the new york sun we believe mr khalilzad not least because in addition to being a bully mr melkert has shown he plays fast and loose with the truth here we refer directly to mr melkerts own words as expressed in his june statement to the undp executive board in response to the preliminary findings by u n auditors confirming u s allegations of massive irregularities in the undps operations in north korea this is how mr melkert characterized the report the auditors "found no evidence that undp funding was diverted to the north korean regime they further found that undp operated a modest program and that the organization had controls in place to determine that its funds were used for development purposes " that was the sum of his report other than to pat his organization on the back for "changing long standing practices with regard to staffing and currency " in fact as mr melkert knows the u n board of auditors found that the undp repeatedly violated its own rules until it pulled out of north korea this spring it hired staffers selected by the north korean government and paid their salaries directly to pyongyang it disbursed large amounts of cash in foreign currency and it inspected only a small fraction of its projects which may or may not even exist the auditors who were barred from traveling to north korea were careful to note that they were unable to follow the money trail that is they had no way to know whether as mr melkert blithely asserts the undps funds "were used for development purposes " the bottom line is that no one knows how much money the united nations has actually spent in north korea or where it went using sums "self reported" by the u n the congressional research service says u n development assistance to north korea for was a staggering &# billion of that the undp spent a minimum of &# million if payments made by undp on behalf of other u n agencies are included the total could reach more than &# million thats money kim has used to prop up his brutal regime and perhaps to fund his nuclear weapons program mr melkert has been obstructing the investigation of the undps operations in north korea since he slow walked the initial u s inquiries last year it took nearly a year of u s questioning before he conceded that the undp office in pyongyang had possession of counterfeit u s dollars the slippery dutchman also had a hand in the dismissal of a longtime undp veteran and onetime chief of operations in north korea whose contract was not renewed after he reported undp violations there the undp staff union has called for him to be reinstated and the u n ethics office is reviewing his case yesterday the u s house of representatives passed an amendment redirecting &# million in u s contributions away from the undp a reduction for which the u n can thank mr melkerts stonewalling antics congress wont continue to finance an outfit whose no official is so hostile to america see related letter "letters to the editor offensive broadside against u n program" wsj june
