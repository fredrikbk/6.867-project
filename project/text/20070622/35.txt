in case we cant give up the cars try trillion mirrors what if we wait too long to act on global warming what if nothing we do is enough already scientists are working up plans of last resort stratospheric sprays of sulfur trillions of orbiting mirrors and thousands of huge off shore saltwater fountains each is designed to counteract global warming by deliberately deflecting sunlight rather than by retooling the worlds economy to eliminate carbon rich oil coal and natural gas some scientists argue that such actions might be easier and relatively cheaper until recently though whenever university of maryland economist thomas schelling recipient of a nobel prize raised such geo engineering ideas "half the audience thought i was crazy and the other half thought i was dangerous " he said as global temperatures rise and greenhouse gas emissions accelerate however even wild ideas are becoming respectable one now under more serious scrutiny was inspired by volcanoes climate researcher tom wigley at the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo and nobel prize winning chemist paul crutzen at the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz germany last year proposed that an overheated planet could be safely cooled by an artificial haze of sulfur particles which would reflect solar radiation the eruption of mt pinatubo spewed enough sulfates to lower the average world temperature by almost one degree fahrenheit for a year with no apparent ill effects a sulfate sunshade might cost &# million a year earlier this month researchers at the carnegie institution of washington d c released the most precise computer studies yet evaluating the controversial sunshade idea their findings reported in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences revealed that a last ditch engineering effort to block sunlight could reverse global warming at least temporarily indeed it could lower average temperatures to levels not seen since "every study we do seems to indicate it would work " said carnegie climate modeler ken caldeira dr caldeira and his colleague damon matthews at concordia university in montreal calculated the effects of curbing solar radiation instead of co emissions over the next years they tested different scenarios in a complex computer simulation of the worlds climate they didnt weigh the merits of any particular engineering plan but instead evaluated the broad effects of lowering solar radiation as a counterweight to rising carbon dioxide emissions in every case the planet quickly cooled often in as little time as five years the computer scenarios also revealed the quandaries of climate control without emissions reductions even on a cooler planet oceans still would become more acidic because excess carbon dioxide would continue to leach into sea water endangering marine wildlife and commercial fisheries regional rainfall also would be disrupted the researchers reported the world would become much drier all in all geo engineering is no substitute for reducing greenhouse gases because it can only suppress the symptoms of global warming the scientists calculated it might even make things worse "if the system failed for technical or political reasons you would be compressing a centurys worth of climate change into a decade or so " said dr caldeira depending on the scenario they tested the rebounding climate could heat up to times faster than today or as much as degrees fahrenheit per decade "the dangers clearly are very large " said ocean chemist peter brewer at the monterey bay aquarium research institute even the most fervent proponents of geo engineering are reluctant to sound enthusiastic "nobody likes geo engineering at all " added university of arizona astronomer roger angel even so prof angel proposed a plan in the journal science last year to cool earth by orbiting trillion tiny mirrors at a cost also in the trillions "just as insurance we ought to be thinking about it " prof angel said many geo engineering advocates are desperate for a safety net worried that people cant cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to make a difference since world wide co emissions have risen at a faster rate than the most pessimistic trends envisioned by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change carnegie researchers reported last month "i dont think we can globally reduce emissions enough " said dr wigley "forget the politics i dont think we can do it technologically " for nobel laureate schelling the political advantages of geo engineering outweigh its technical risks it may be easier to launch a climate control project than to persuade people all over the world to stop using fossil fuels "it drastically converts the whole subject of climate change from one of regulation involving six billion people to a simple matter of a budgetary agreement about how to manage the modest cost " prof schelling said "i think geo engineering is going to be the deus ex machina that will save the day " in case of climate emergency please break glass inside find contingency plans email me at sciencejournal wsj com
