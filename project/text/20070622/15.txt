congresss energy follies if the american people are suspicious of bold pledges from washington about energy independence and reform they have good reason to be since the first energy crisis almost years ago our nation has had a very expensive education in such matters whether it was president nixons project independence that called for the elimination of foreign oil imports or president carters mandate that of all domestic energy be supplied by solar technologies both of which were set to be achieved by projects have come and gone to no avail wishful thinking is again on full display this week as democrats and republicans alike have assembled an ambitious energy policy agenda our hope was that congress would embrace past lessons and forge pragmatic and workable solutions but that hasnt happened here is a sampling of some of the most troublesome initiatives being considered "price gouging" laws despite proponents arguments to the contrary proposed laws would create de facto price controls reminiscent of those applied in s and early s that caused supply disruptions long waiting lines and economic chaos across all industries if the goal is to lower gasoline prices we cannot do so without first addressing the cost of foreign crude oil or the need to increase domestic refining capacity the current debate completely avoids these paramount issues instead focusing on punitive measures that will not add one new drop of gasoline or decrease fuel prices refiners today are running at near capacity but need to increase gasoline output to meet increasing demand so called "price gouging" laws would ensure the opposite effect in fact the potential for price controls in times of crisis or normalcy coupled with criminal penalties will simply discourage capital investment and place planned refinery expansions in limbo mandates for alternative energy renewable energy portfolios are undoubtedly beneficial but mandating rather than providing greater incentives for utilities and industrial customers to leverage opportunities for alternative resources presents a least optimal path to progress in contrast establishing an incentive based means to bring "green prosperity" to market is a much better approach given the option of paying current rates or suffering higher utility bills for energy from "forced" alternative sources congress knows which one the overwhelming majority of americans would choose hence it would rather force the nations energy providers to deliver the bad news for them in the form of higher monthly utility bills renewable fuels standards biofuels especially cellulosic ethanol hold great promise and deserve continued investment in research and development but rapidly accelerating corn based ethanol requirements at this time is simply a mistake beyond an inability to transport corn based ethanol nationally significant issues remain with respect to the actual energy efficiency gained the impact on food livestock feed and natural gas prices lingering environmental implications and the unique production requirements that would result from mandates now wrongly being offered as a silver bullet solution consumers and the market are better equipped to define the increased role timing and type of biofuels that will proliferate not government windfall profits taxes proposed windfall profit taxes will only drive away needed commitments in technology and facilities upgrades aiding foreign competitors at the expense of u s consumers when such laws discriminate by industry investors and shareholders will lose confidence and simply shift their money elsewhere impacting employees and employers in the process according to the congressional research service similar policies put in place between and reduced domestic oil production by billion barrels and increased oil imports as much as largely omitted from the debate has been the need to develop comprehensive and effective coal and nuclear transition policies the u s energy information administration predicts energy consumption to rise by by and coals share to rise from to over this same period likewise nuclear power presents great promise on both the energy and environmental fronts but is a hugely capital intensive industry that must be further considered opportunity still exists to forge a sound and stable domestic energy program that benefits consumers industries and our economy yet the agenda presented thus far from some corners must be viewed in tandem with the potential costs including higher prices for fuel food manufacturing and services gasoline shortages limited domestic capacity increased reliance on foreign sources of energy decreased capital investment and lower economic growth congress must recognize and act upon the difference between hope and reality mr johnston a democrat is a former senator from louisiana mr nickles a republican is a former senator from oklahoma and now serves on the board of the american council for capital formation
