pork project it was about a week ago that house democrats ran up the white flag on earmarks and begrudgingly agreed to live by their campaign pledges to make pork requests public it was also about a week ago that texas gov rick perry signed a sweeping new state transparency law which will give his taxpayers detailed information about every state expenditure grant and contract mark the difference even as washington has fiddled on earmarks delaying obfuscating and basically doing all it can to avoid enacting real reform a transparency movement has been sweeping the nation angry over alaskan bridges to nowhere and frustrated by the lack of willpower in the nations capital small government activists have turned their attention to the states if ever washington lagged behind a movement this is it in april kansas became the first state in to sign into law comprehensive legislation mandating a public web site to show its citizens where all their money was flowing minnesota gov tim pawlenty quickly followed suit signing his own states reform the following month mr perry was next and oklahoma and hawaii have bills awaiting their own governors signatures indiana gov mitch daniels issued an executive order to disclose state contracts all the way back in in total some states have passed or are now working on legislative or administrative reforms that would hand the public tools to examine government spending "transparency is the next big thing " says grover norquist president of americans for tax reform his organization along with other national anti waste groups has turned this issue into a top agenda item and theyve been joined by local grassroots organizations such as texans for fiscal responsibility and washington states evergreen freedom foundation these groups are aiming for more than just feel good "open government " theyre making a bet that transparency will succeed in limiting spending in ways that their other campaigns have not that hope is rooted in the idea that the best way to get americans actively engaged in the debate over the size and efficiency of government is by giving them examples of government gone wrong reformers point to the current furor over washington earmarks as proof tell americans that the size of the federal government increased to a whopping &# trillion and their eyes glaze over tell them that the alaska delegation was trying to appropriate some &# million of taxpayers hard earned dollars to build a bridge for people and they go berserk much as they went berserk decades ago at the news the pentagon had spent &# on a toilet seat texas shows how big the transparency debate has become at the local level and is even offering some signs that the reformers might be on the right track having seen national republicans bounced from power in part because of the earmark issue gov perry got out ahead on the transparency issue running on greater disclosure in his re election campaign last year and proposing in january that all state agencies publish their expenditures online he received a boost from republican state comptroller susan combs who got elected in part by promising more disclosure a message that resonated with voters angry over washington shenanigans within days of taking office in january shed listed her departments spending "down to the pencil category" and by may was offering information for dozens of other state agencies her web site runs the gamut from the states commission on environmental quality to its employees retirement system and includes data on everything from salaries to travel bills the legislature meanwhile also rushed to get some good government kudos from voters and the bill gov perry signed last week requires spending information from all state agencies as well as state contracts and grants the media government groups and blogs have been combing through the details with some lively results among the first to have to answer for spending actions was none other than ms combs within a few weeks of posting the comptroller offices outlays a local newspaper was asking why telephone costs had nearly doubled going into fiscal her office also had to explain why cable costs had soared more executive staff members had wanted it in their office she noted that this expansion in services had now been cut back and would cost less which is exactly the sort of debate the reformers had aimed to inspire mr norquist argues that the very existence of transparency laws "gets rid of half the problem " since politicians are on uncomfortable notice that their spending habits are being watched if a politician knows that joe public can find out that he helped award a huge grant or government contract to a big campaign donor he might think twice about pushing the grant in the first place at the state level transparency has been an easy political sell voters have made clear they are willing to turn spending abuse into a top issue in local elections and while big government politicians may not fear arguing against budget caps or spending limitations few are stupid enough to argue against better information if anything state republicans and democrats are racing to sponsor transparency bills the question is if any of this translates back to washington national politicians understand the anger which is why democrats ran on greater earmark transparency last year and why we had last years successful legislation from sens tom coburn and barack obama to set up a public web site detailing all federal contracts and grants yet for all the sweet talk most of congress is still hoping voters will forget all this hubbub about pork amid more pressing issues like the iraq war the uproar over democrats decision to hide the details of earmark requests suggests those hopes are as yet misplaced even with greater transparency will the humiliation factor work amid all house appropriations chairman david obeys unconvincing reasons for keeping the public in the dark he did make the fair point that even when embarrassing earmarks have been disclosed congress rallies around its porksters and approves the money its hard to shame people who have no shame and thats the next stage of the earmark debate forcing national politicians to admit to their bad spending habits is clearly difficult forcing them to stop or pay the price at the polls is the real test of "earmark reform " write to kim wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor more windows opened on government spending" wsj july
