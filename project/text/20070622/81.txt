espn com jeff pearlman looks at the long island ducks an independent league team with former big leaguers on the roster including the likes of edgardo alfonzo carl everett and jose offerman mr pearlman keeps you guessing with an entertaining tale weaving from the ducks refusal to accept that they might be done as big leaguers "they dont belong here because in the mind of the professional ballplayer acceptance of inadequacy is acceptance of death" to suggesting that the ducks would make a great reality tv show think about it a dozen ex big leaguers some of them former all stars graves

friday nights at target pass for excitement where fans dont boo or cheer but blow into &# plastic quackers writers note please kill me where the biggest of studs is paid &# per month its "the surreal life" meets suburbia but he then gives his tale another twist finding a sweetness to the simple life of independent league ball "though everyone here longs to reign in the land of seat cathedrals and a bottomless tub of sunflower seeds there is a fun an easiness oozing through the long island clubhouse that cant be found in the big leagues " he writes adding "with the yankees or mets or dodgers or padres the games are played the chartered jets are boarded the ipods are turned on and the world is tuned out with the ducks x box tournaments are ongoing card games never seem to cease and conversations of yesteryear can stretch deep into the night " speaking of the minor leagues espn coms uni guru paul lukas has an entertaining tour of minor league jerseys teams break out for theme

welcome the new york yankees to town tonight itll be a meeting between circuses the yankees are always worth three rings while barry bonds would demand a ring of his own in which to brood its also the first meaningful game in san francisco between the two clubs since game of the world series "it was baseball at its heart stopping best " recalls tom fitzgerald in the san francisco chronicle "the giants trailed with two outs in the ninth inning but they had the yankees right where they wanted them matty alou on third willie mays on second and cleanup hitter willie mccovey coming up against the yankees ralph terry first base was open and the next batter righty orlando cepeda was hitting in the series terry went after mccovey though not without trepidation on a pitch mccovey lined a ball that second baseman bobby richardson speared after moving slightly to his left i couldnt hit that ball any better said mccovey who never got any closer to the brass ring " think about that for a minute and all the giant fans it must still haunt in sleepless hours of the night in december charles m schulz referenced it in a "peanuts" cartoon of linus and charlie brown sitting numbly before charlie brown moans "why couldnt mccovey have hit the ball just three feet higher " that was followed by an identical strip a month later except charlie brown winds up lamenting "why couldnt mccovey have hit the ball just two feet higher " any baseball fan understands sticking with the chronicle bruce jenkins hopes giants owner peter mcgowan is getting a wakeup call about his team which is and games behind the colorado rockies who are in fourth "magowan and his right hand man larry baer should know that there are loyal longtime fans praying the giants finish last just so ownership truly gets the picture " he writes "people are terrified and rightly so that the team will climb to within six or seven games of the division lead in late july theyre afraid it would trigger the latest in a pathetic series

hoping to become a big league catching prospect with his rifle arm outweighing concerns that hes too small to catch at " and pounds "conyedo has endured the kind of turbulence that many teenagers in the united states have never experienced and his recollections provide a rare glimpse inside the secretive world of baseball development in cuba " writes david picker in the new york times "although he has found a home behind home plate he seems to be a young man still searching for his place in the world " the outfield for the miracle mets was anchored by two friends from mobile ala tommie agee
