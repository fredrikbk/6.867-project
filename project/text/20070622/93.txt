weekend journal hollywood report an idol cracks clarkson writes songs fans and critics cringe clive daviss subtle dig for her third album pop queen kelly clarkson set out to create more deeply personal songs than the polished megahits like "since u been gone" that vaulted her to stardom somewhat improbably ms clarkson told associates she wanted the new material to be her "nebraska" a reference to the dark stripped down bruce springsteen album of that served as a serious counterpoint to his exploding fame but while mr springsteens move burnished his reputation as a contemplative songwriter ms clarksons "my december " due in stores tuesday is having the opposite effect it has set off a cascade of fiascoes that represents the first downturn in a career that had only skyrocketed even amid the overall decline in the music business last week ms clarkson announced she was canceling the date arena tour slated to kick off next month citing poor ticket sales she also fired her manager jeff kwatinetz adding to the misery the albums first single "never again " received tepid reviews from critics some of whom said it sounds more like pat benatar than mr springsteen the song has stalled on pop radio and people close to ms clarkson believe her record label sony bmgs rca stopped too early pushing to get it airplay rca has yet to release a followup single ms clarksons plight highlights the pitfalls that face a pop star who makes a bid for status as a serious artist the trouble started when she decided she wanted to write and produce "my december" herself with creative input only from her regular bandmates not a coterie of slick professionals that was an unusual proposition for any top pop star and all the more so for a year old singer whose career had been launched after winning the season of tvs "american idol " ms clarkson had already become an anomaly well before she began making plans for "my december " despite the manufactured start to her career her second album "breakaway " gained a modicum of credibility among the kind of music enthusiasts rock critics and bloggers who normally shun mainstream pop stars even web site pitchfork the notoriously finicky arbiter of indie rock cool posted a gushing news item when it learned that alternative rock icon mike watt had played bass on some of "my december " nonetheless several people familiar with the situation say that executives at rca were aghast at ms clarksons suggestion that she write her own material true she had co written a handful of the singles from her second album but most of the songs had been created with big name collaborators and she hadnt written the buoyant breakthrough "since u been gone " as early as last july rca executives were at loggerheads with ms clarksons management company the firm and its chief executive mr kwatinetz over the issue of her writing the songs spokesmen for the firm and ms clarkson declined to comment for this article clive davis the legendary chief executive of rcas parent bertelsmann music group suggested at least three replacements for tunes ms clarkson had created two were written by lukasz gottwald a swedish popsmith better known as dr luke who co wrote "since u been gone " the third song had previously appeared on a lindsay lohan album a history that horrified the clarkson camp she declined to add the material to the recording sessions rca did win one important concession ms clarkson agreed to work with producer david kahne one of five suggested by the label largely as a result of the wrangling over the material that would go on it the album was delayed from its originally planned spring release the rancor also stalled efforts to renegotiate ms clarksons contract while such a renegotiation is a standard move after a massive success like the million selling "breakaway " both sides considered song selection on the new album a critical issue people close to rca say it wouldnt enter a renegotiation before hearing a finished product ms clarkson ended up receiving an advance well under &# million instead of the &# million to &# million her managers thought she deserved the trouble continued when the album was completed at a conference in april for top sony bmg executives from around the world mr davis gave a presentation nominally to unveil new music including "my december " according to people familiar with the meeting however many in the audience interpreted some of his comments as denigrations of the albums prospects "does this look like a hit " he rhetorically asked as a projector displayed the lyrics to one of ms clarksons compositions on a screen behind him when they were told of the remarks ms clarkson and her representatives were livid considering them a not so subtle signal from mr davis that the company shouldnt bother making the album a priority then mr davis himself appeared on "american idol" in may and made a thinly veiled criticism of her decision saying "everyone in american idol must toast that much too often underappreciated professional songwriters those who have greatly enhanced the american idol album franchise right from the very beginning by writing no hit songs for clay aiken through since u been gone and breakaway for kelly clarksons huge breakaway album " at the same time ms clarksons handlers were booking a tour that might have looked ambitious even if the new album hadnt been under a cloud despite a tour last summer that struggled to fill amphitheaters they booked her into three dozen even bigger arenas around the country and put the tickets on sale weeks before "my december" was available and with the single "never again" performing only moderately well on radio though "never again" reached the top of billboard magazines hot chart it quickly drifted downward audience polling research showed a lack of familiarity with the song despite fairly heavy nationwide rotation on the airwaves people close to the situation say it isnt clear when rca will release a second single the tour strategy puzzled some in the music industry and even some involved in the tour itself who figured that with all ms clarksons talk of "nebraska" and artistic integrity she would be wooing hardcore fans with dates at intimate theaters and listening parties not trying to fill tens of thousands of seats a night ticket sales for the tour quickly stalled and some markets saw as few as seven or eight sold a day according to one person familiar with the situation "there was a dropoff in sales after the initial on sale date " says gregg perloff chief executive of another planet entertainment llc a berkeley calif concert promoter that was scheduled to promote seven of her west coast dates "a safer strategy might have been to wait until two or three singles were out " faced with the turmoil ms clarksons handlers scrapped the tour believing that the alternative of transplanting the schedule to smaller theaters would be an embarrassment some people around ms clarkson felt it would be better to trot out a standard music industry excuse for the cancellation such as a family emergency or throat problems but in the end she copped to the real problem of poor ticket sales as ms clarkson appeared to put on weight there was even a debate in her camp about whether to encourage the petite texas native to get in better shape with the help of a trainer some people close to her also advocated a more glamorous look it is unclear whether the debate reached ms clarksons ears or took place only in the background
