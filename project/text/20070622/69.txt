politics &amp economics incomes suffer more volatility amid heightening risks families find ways to cushion blows washington weighing in on an intensifying debate on income insecurity three economists including two from the federal reserve have found that american families today are more likely to experience big drops in their income than three decades ago their analysis however finds far less volatility in family income than some recent studies the authors of the new study douglas elmendorf of the brookings institution and senior fed economists karen dynan and daniel sichel caution against interpreting their findings as evidence that families face more risk of hardship than before they note that financial innovation has given americans more ways to maintain their spending when their incomes fall the study found that the volatility of household income rose between the early s and early s while small changes in family income are no more frequent large changes in income more than are the probability that a family will experience a decline in annual income of or more compared with their average income in the previous three years rose to in from in after the probability dipped and has risen back to "the increase in volatility we document is not trivial " mr elmendorf said in an interview "our work is quite consistent with being concerned about the level and increase in volatility of household income " that said "i dont think our results support the view that the world is dramatically more adverse for households " he added mr elmendorf previously served in senior staff positions at both the fed and the treasury ms dynan spent a year on the staff of president bushs council of economic advisers and mr sichel spent a year at treasury during the clinton administration their credentials could help make their work an important benchmark in a growing policy debate since the early s economic growth has become less volatile with recessions milder and less frequent and unemployment has declined at the same time advances in technology deregulation and globalization while aiding the dynamism of the nations economy are often said to have added upheaval to the lives of ordinary workers who must adjust to job changes layoffs and new sources of competition that assumption underlies some policy proposals such as wage insurance enhanced assistance for those whose jobs are lost to trade and universal health care yet research into the assumption that income volatility has increased has reached differing conclusions yale university political scientist and author jacob hacker in a book titled "the great risk shift " documents a fivefold increase in household income volatility between the early s and early s mr hacker who described himself as "thunderstruck" by the result has written widely and testified to congress on the subject he couldnt be reached for comment by contrast the congressional budget office using a different set of data found that earnings volatility for individuals as opposed to households has changed little since the early s the new study uses the same database as mr hackers the panel study on income dynamics or psid which began tracking the fortunes of representative families in today that group including offspring has grown to about families the database is maintained by the university of michigan and funded by a variety of government agencies and private foundations it isnt clear why the new study found a far smaller increase in income volatility than mr hackers despite using the same data it employs a slightly different yardstick for volatility mr elmendorf and his colleagues believe that changes in the way the psid collected and tabulated data in the early s resulted in an artificial increase in the number of people reporting a temporary spell of zero earnings their calculations exclude households whose head reported zero labor income in his book mr hacker says he excludes zero earners as well the new study finds that volatility in all the components of income wages capital income and government payments has risen in the past few decades and income volatility has risen for both high school and college graduates it finds that for individuals income isnt any more volatile than years ago because an increase in volatility for men has been offset by a decrease in volatility for women but because men typically earn more than twice as much as their wives their experience dominates the trend for households thus the study reinforces the view among academics that household volatility has risen although the magnitude is in dispute on the other hand it is at odds with the cbo study which used extensive social security record and found no increase in volatility for either male or female wage earners since mr elmendorf and his co authors emphasize they dont yet know why volatility has risen in particular whether it reflects voluntary reductions in work such as to care for children or forced reductions such as layoffs or whether it reflects a shift in the makeup of households such as more single parent families but the authors argue that bigger swings in income need not force households to slash their spending they cite preliminary findings from other research they have conducted that show financial innovation such as easier borrowing against the value of a home has helped to insulate family spending patterns from fluctuations in income
