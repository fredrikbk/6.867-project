politics &amp economics high court raises the bar for filing shareholder suits washington continuing a string of pro business rulings the supreme court dealt a blow to class action lawyers making it harder for shareholders alleging securities fraud to file suits against companies yesterdays decision underscored the courts position on shareholder lawsuits when theres ambiguity in federal laws designed to discourage such claims the court has tended to side with defendant companies and executives with the justices approaching the end of their annual term which concludes next week the decision adds to the long tally of wins for business at the court this year the rulings have made it tougher for employees to sue for discrimination tougher to bring antitrust claims against market leading companies and tougher for plaintiffs to win punitive damages the courts position on these issues will be tested again this year when it hears a case with big implications for wall street the suit asks whether third parties such as investment banks can be sued for another companys fraud this years decisions which often have been close to unanimous have bridged the sometimes contentious divisions that mark the court in other areas such as election law and abortion rights and when the justices split on business issues they sometimes scramble the courts typical line up when the court threw out a &# million punitive damage award against philip morris the tobacco unit of altria group inc conservatives antonin scalia and clarence thomas joined liberal ruth bader ginsburg in opposition justice ginsburg wrote yesterdays opinion clarifying a provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and resolving a split between lower courts although the ruling was a win for defendant tellabs inc justice ginsburg didnt go as far as the business lobby had wanted the act requires plaintiffs to demonstrate the defendants intention to deceive known by the legal term scienter according to the law plaintiffs must show a "strong inference" that the defendant "acted with the required state of mind " lower courts differed on what counts as "strong inference " the sixth u s circuit court of appeals in cincinnati supporting companies said suits should be dismissed if an innocent explanation for a defendants behavior seems more likely the seventh circuit in chicago took a less exacting tack it said the only reason to toss a suit was if the suggestion of wrongdoing was wholly unreasonable using that standard the seventh circuit reinstated a suit brought in by the class action law firm now called milberg weiss &amp bershad llp against tellabs a naperville ill telecom manufacturer the suit alleged that from december through june tellabs then president richard notebaert publicly puffed up the companys prospects while being privately aware that demand for its networking products was flagging when the companys true condition became public in mid its stock fell to &# from a high during the contested period of &# the defendants have denied the allegations mr notebaert left tellabs in to head qwest communications international inc denver and this month announced his retirement from that company in her written opinion justice ginsberg defined a new stricter test to assess the viability of shareholder suits the trial judge must "consider the complaint in its entirety " justice ginsburg wrote specifically "whether all of the facts alleged taken collectively give rise to a strong inference of scienter " or the intention to deceive the judge must also consider "plausible opposing inferences " she wrote at the same time justice ginsburg didnt embrace all the defendants arguments plaintiffs dont need a "smoking gun " as long as no innocent inference is more plausible than a sinister one thus she wrote tellabss defense that mr notebaert didnt sell stock during the questioned period and he had no financial motive isnt enough to get the suit thrown out the court sent the case back to the lower court to determine if it could pass the new test justices scalia and samuel alito while concurring said the standard should be even tougher the defendant should win a "tie" when positive and negative inferences are of equal weight justice john paul stevens dissented arguing that the meaning of "a term such as strong inference is surely in the eye of the beholder " the courts standard will weed out "baseless allegations of securities fraud " said robin conrad executive vice president of the national chamber litigation center which filed a "friend of the court" brief backing tellabs in a written statement trial lawyers said that while the ruling clarifies what must appear in a complaint it doesnt make life significantly harder "its going to come up in every case but the decision doesnt really change much " said jeffrey white an attorney with the american association for justice which represents trial lawyers tellabs inc v makor
