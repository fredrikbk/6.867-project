weekend journal tastings south americas rising star argentinas malbec makes a big splash living with success heres the wine worlds equivalent of a man bites dog story in the first four months of this year the u s imported almost more wine from argentina than from its neighbor chile this represents a big change as recently as chile exported almost five times as much wine to the u s as argentina did even just last year chiles imports were about one third higher than argentinas but now imports from argentina are so strong that theyve outstripped almost all other countries and arent far below the figure for france were sure there are many reasons for this related to trade policies and such but to us it all comes down to one word malbec malbec is argentinas signature grape long ago it was known as one of the classic blending grapes of bordeaux but now its best known as a stand alone varietal in argentina at its best malbec produces a wine of dark color spicy blackberry herbal intensity and crisp acidity in a medium weight package when we first wrote about malbec in we had trouble getting enough for a blind tasting how things have changed argentina in general and malbec specifically are getting a tremendous amount of attention from the wine world these days the people who make the famous chateau cheval blanc in bordeaux for instance now make a cabernet sauvignon malbec blend in argentina along with a local winery terrazas de los andes big inky and age worthy it sells for around &# in fact even though malbec is often inexpensive and a great deal more high end offerings are hitting the market which indicates that argentinas winemakers think americans are familiar enough with the grape at this point to risk big bucks on something more intense and memorable for a few years several reliable names alamos altos las hormigas catena finca flichman navarro correas kept malbec in the game in u s wine stores but now they have lots of company with so many malbecs on shelves we decided the time was right for a new tasting we found so many so quickly that we scooped up before we knew it we could have easily added another as always we were not looking for "the best" malbec from argentina but were trying to get an overall sense of whats out there has success spoiled malbec having finished the tasting lets get right to the point if you dont pick up a malbec to pair with one of your cookouts soon youre making a mistake this is a special grape and this is a good time to be trying it they were not all winners to be sure the interesting herbal qualities of malbec cant support any sweetness whether its sugar or too much oak that gives the impression of sweetness and some of these proved that point too well others werent ripe enough or they lacked acidity leaving them fairly flat and a bit dull with a jumble of indistinguishable tastes but the overwhelming number of wines we tasted were winners whether they were among our very favorites or not wine after wine looked and tasted black with pepper spices earth and on occasion all sorts of other interesting tastes sometimes plums sometimes chocolate and sometimes chocolate covered plums because they were easy to drink and often quite smooth some reminded us why people first fell in love with merlot but these generally offered far more character than todays merlot with juicy fruit an earthy underpinning and a clean finish the very best of these were excellent wines offering the kind of structure layers of flavors and focused tastes we associate with bordeaux our best of tasting from felipe rutini was outstanding with the kind of character that announced itself with every sip it had good herbal qualities and hints of cedar combined in an earthy rich package the importer pasternak wine imports of harrison n y says cases were made and were imported and distributed nationwide these wines are meant for food especially meat but flavorful vegetable dishes like ratatouille as well even though theyre dark and have intense tastes they have lively acidity and real vitality so theyre not at all too heavy for summer while its impossible to know which one you might see at your store chances are there will be at least a few so pick one up or maybe two to get a sense of what different winemakers are doing with this grape chances are they will have many similar characteristics but taste different and good you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones malbec index in a broad blind tasting of malbec from argentina these were our favorites as it turned out all of our favorites are from the mendoza
