day sign up for the e mail here add to the list of global leaders intractable problems in this fractious era the doha round of world trade talks following yesterdays bitter breakup of the latest negotiations aimed at salvaging the effort the u s european union brazil and india were meeting in potsdam germany the two biggest industrialized nation participants working with two of the biggest developing markets to overcome obstacles that have hobbled doha since its qatar debut in in a bid to expand the global economy with billions of dollars in added trade the doha rounds goals include easing the cross border sale of services strengthening intellectual property rights increasing foreign direct investment and leveling the playing field internationally for government contracts but the so called g was convened in potsdam to talk about dohas most contentious issues rich nations agricultural subsidies and tariffs blamed for pricing african and asian farmers out of the international markets and some poorer countries tariffs on industrial imports each side accused the other of bringing nothing constructive to the table "what we have here today was not going to generate new trade " u s trade representative susan schwab told reporters as womens wear daily reports "there were more barriers put up to dialogue than the talks could sustain " she said accusing brazil and india of wanting to maintain tariffs that would harm "the dozens and dozens of developing countries who need to be exporting not just to the mature markets of the developed world but also to the markets of the advanced developing countries" like brazil india and china brazilian foreign minister celso amorim and indian commerce minister kamal nath countered that american and eu offers for agricultural concessions were far short of their expectations mr nath said the u s offered to cap domestic farm aid at &# billion which is lower than its last offer of &# billion but still well above the roughly &# billion u s farmers currently get the international herald tribune reports "it was useless to continue the discussion on the basis of the numbers put on the table " mr amorim said mr nath echoed the complaints heard from developing nations each time the broader doha talks have broken down telling the financial times that "it is not just a question of figures it is a question of attitude the u s does not realize that the world has changed " the u s and the eu defended their positions as the ft reports by saying brazil and india offered "no serious access to manufactured goods markets in return" for proposed farm aid and farm tariff reductions several ambassadors tell wwd the atmosphere in potsdam was marked by "a lot of brinksmanship and a lot of pretty cold shouldering " the results are only likely to damp expectations that some kind of deal could be reached this year before elections in the u s india and elsewhere in make it that much harder to sell sacrifice to domestic constituencies talking to the ft manuel teehankee the philippine ambassador to the wto blames the g members for failing to act multilaterally "this is not statesmanlike " that could be said of several hot global issues lately where international cooperation has foundered u s optimism follows pyongyang trip christopher hill the u s assistant secretary of state for east asian affairs and bush administration point man for north korea said his first visit to pyongyang was a fruitful one and that north korea is ready to soon close down its yongbyon nuclear reactor and take other steps promised in the february denuclearization agreement "the talks were very detailed very substantive and i believe they were also very useful and positive " mr hill said at a news conference today in seoul "i sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives that is complete denuclearization but also burdened by the realization of the fact that we are going to have to spend a great deal of time a great deal of effort a lot of work in achieving these " still it wasnt clear from mr hills comments when or how north koreas first concrete response sharing information about its activities allowing the return of international atomic energy agency inspectors or perhaps actually shutting down yongbyon would take place cheneys non executive security privilege the national archives unit charged with monitoring the executive branchs use of classified documents has been repeatedly rebuffed by vice president dick cheneys office for the past four years according to documents released yesterday by the house oversight committee while mr cheney has run up against congress advocacy groups and news media seeking information about people and events in his office the dispute with the information security oversight office suggests such conflicts have taken place within the executive branch as well according to a committee letter to mr cheney his staff hasnt cooperated with the archival watchdog since as the washington post reports and when the monitors objected to that lack of cooperation mr cheneys office suggested that the oversight unit be abolished as the new york times adds at least one of the units proposed inspections was refused by mr cheneys office at what the los angeles times notes was "a particularly delicate time when cheneys former chief of staff i lewis scooter libby and other aides were under criminal investigation for their suspected roles in leaking the identity" of a cia operative one puzzling aspect of the dispute is the argument mr cheney has made in claiming that his office is exempt from the executive order regulating executive branch handling of classified national security information as the l a times explains he says his office isnt fully a part of the bush administration that as some legal scholars and government secrecy experts note is ironic given how strongly the vice president has insisted on the importance of executive privilege when refusing to provide information to congress bp may relinquish russian gas holding under kremlin pressure to give up its stake in a &# billion russian natural gas project bp is nearing a deal to cede those holdings to state monopoly gazprom people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal "if sealed the deal would mark the kremlins latest move to
