defense mechanism hard case when academics double as expert witnesses a maker of sirens sued over hearing loss gets help from a researcher racing to a blaze chicago firefighter larry lempa usually stood toward the rear of the truck next to a wailing siren after three decades on the job he says he needs a hearing aid to understand his grandchildren he is one of thousands of firefighters whove sued the maker of the sirens contending they caused hearing loss not likely according to william w clark a hearing scientist at washington university medical school in st louis a study he published in concluded that "firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise induced hearing loss even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise " the siren manufacturer federal signal corp told a court the study "directly refutes plaintiffs argument that siren noise exposure causes hearing loss in firefighters " what the study didnt mention was that dr clark was a paid expert for the company helping it with its litigation at the same time as he was doing his research not only that but the company gathered data that were the basis of the study the case offers a look inside the world of academic researchers who boost their pay with outside work for litigants as expert witnesses and consultants the practice is common but its one that can easily produce conflicts of interest especially when the expert is simultaneously filling the dual roles of researcher and paid litigation consultant for dr clark it wasnt the first time he has prepared hearing loss studies relating to an industry at the same time as industry interests were paying for his help prior cases involved railroads and mining dr clark says none of his published work has been influenced by his financial relationships with industry some conflicts stay hidden because scientific journals fail to insist that researchers disclose their litigation ties or a disclosure may be so vague that someone reading it wouldnt necessarily discern a study authors expert witness role readers of dr clarks study which ran in ear &amp hearing journal were told only that the researcher "has provided consulting services for manufacturers of emergency firefighting equipment " there was no mention that such a manufacturer was being sued for causing hearing loss dr clark a ph d who directs his medical schools audiology and communication sciences program says he complied with all disclosure requirements of the ear &amp hearing journal its editor brenda ryals says the journal "takes the issue of full disclosure very seriously " she said that dr clarks disclosure "is currently under review at the journal " in the late s dr clark was serving as a consultant to union pacific railroad as it was defending a slew of suits claiming trainmen were losing their hearing from noise he also ran a "hearing hotline" for union pacific workers that among other things counseled them on results of their hearing tests in the midst of this in he published a peer reviewed article concluding that "trainmen are not typically exposed to hazardous occupational noise " after its publication cases began to be settled on less generous terms according to affidavits from rail workers and the railroad they were settled for less on average than before the clark study appeared the journal that published the trainmen report called laryngoscope didnt disclose that dr clark was consulting for union pacific dr clark says it didnt require such disclosure laryngoscope says it doesnt know what its disclosure policy was in the late s to run the railroads hearing hotline union pacific paid &# to a partnership of dr clark and his co author of the railroad hearing loss study according to a deposition dr clark gave in cook county ill circuit court dr clark said in an interview that there were no published rebuttals of his study saying trainmen arent typically exposed to hazardous occupational noise but a lengthy critique of his article in letter form ran in the same medical journal the next year stating that "there were some serious flaws in the analyses of the data and the conclusions reached " when asked about this dr clark acknowledged it but reiterated that his own studys conclusions were valid the writer of the critique was karl kryter then a scientific consultant at stanford research institute now called sri international he couldnt be reached for comment in the u s mine safety and health administration was considering tougher noise guidelines an industry group called the national mining association hired dr clark to do a critical analysis of another federal bodys noise data he testified before the mine agency against tougher guidelines two years later dr clark published a study concluding that miners did not have significant occupational hearing loss the study was done "at the request of the national mining association " he acknowledged in the article he didnt mention that the association had paid him as a consultant in an interview dr clark said the mining trade group didnt provide funds for the study itself which ran in a now defunct publication called the journal of occupational hearing loss at the national institute of occupational safety whose data dr clark analyzed at the behest of the trade association a former bioacoustics expert said that his own research found elevated hearing loss among coal miners "i dont think dr clark has been good for the science " said the former niosh official john r franks asked about this dr clark contended niosh researchers are "biased" because "their jobs depend on hearing loss being a problem " dr franks denied that saying that niosh has sometimes investigated industries and found no increased hearing loss on the matter of his own reputation dr clark said someone at a conference once asked him "how come you never report that people do have hearing loss " dr clark says he told the person that "what creates the reputation is partly due to the reluctance of anybody who has data that shows hearing loss to disclose it find it for me i will study it i will publish it and i will nail that company there is just not that opportunity " federal signal the siren maker first worked with dr clark in the late s when he helped it defend some earlier hearing loss lawsuits the first chicago firefighter suit was filed in by early the next year plans were in the works for a study by dr clark of hearing among firefighters in a deposition in cook county circuit court federal signals general counsel jennifer sherman was asked whether doing such a study was her idea or dr clarks she said she wasnt sure dr clark testified it was his in any case the siren maker did the spade work through its sales force it tapped contacts at fire departments to see if they would share employee hearing test data a letter ms sherman addressed to the fire department of fort worth texas suggested the city might face hearing loss litigation itself if federal signal failed to mount a vigorous defense of the suits the jan letter said ms sherman was enclosing "two similar studies" dr clarks work downplaying any noise or hearing issue for railroad workers and miners she added "we may want to consider a similar article for firefighters " she promised to share results with the city in an interview ms sherman said she wasnt certain that the letter which surfaced during legal discovery in the chicago litigation was ever sent in any case the fort worth and phoenix fire departments provided hearing test data for a study dr clark said he welcomed the companys help "i did not have the time or the energy or the resources to try and talk every fire company in the country into participating in a study " he said in a deposition in an interview dr clark said he suggested to federal signal early on in the firefighter case that it hire thomas jayne a lawyer he had worked with while serving as a consultant to union pacific railroad federal signal did retain mr jayne he helped gather the data for dr clarks study according to the lawyers invoices the invoices show that from at least through the lawyer and dr clark frequently discussed the hearing study in progress in august and september of mr jayne billed federal signal for eight sessions with dr clark the invoices for several indicate the lawyer was reviewing a draft of dr clarks proposed research article in mr jayne billed for time to "review comments of reviews re clark article " in mr jaynes office a paralegal and a computer technician did their own analysis of the cities firefighter hearing test records according to invoices comparing them to hearing data for the general population dr clark says he never saw the work and that he and his co author washington university colleague carl bohl did their own analysis when dr clark submitted the manuscript to ear &amp hearing journal he suggested four possible peer reviewers one was robert dobie a longtime friend of dr clarks ear &amp hearing selected him its records show dr clark also asked that two other hearing experts not be selected as peer reviewers one was randall tubbs of niosh who had done several studies reporting elevated hearing loss among firefighters dr tubbs says he wasnt selected the person whose job was to find reviewers judith widen a professor at the university of kansas says it isnt unusual for authors to suggest reviewers but its less common to ask that certain people be excluded dr clarks peer review recommendations came to light through the legal discovery process dr clark complained that matters meant to be confidential became public and said he is "passionately committed to the integrity of the scientific peer review process " during the peer review dr clark says he provided reviewer comments to federal signals lawyer mr jayne after revising the manuscript based on reviewer comments dr clark sent the final manuscript to the medical journal a week before christmas in learning it had been sent mr jayne emailed the companys general counsel "there is a santa clause " a month later dr clark billed mr jayne for hours of consulting work on the firefighter litigation at &# an hour dating to mid dr clark says he was billing for tasks other than his research the lawyer billed federal signal for parts of days in which he worked on matters related to the firefighter research study in june ear &amp hearing published the study saying firefighters werent at risk for hearing loss four months later federal signal paid dr clark a &# retainer for hours of future work as an expert witness at trials ms sherman says the company wanted to make sure he was available at trials that have since been delayed in all the siren maker has paid dr clark at least &# for his help invoices show he and the company say none of this was related to his work on the study of firefighters hearing the study became a prominent part of federal signals planned legal defense "this study the only such paper published in a peer reviewed journal concluded that firefighters do not experience excessive hearing loss " company lawyers told cook county circuit court in a filing in january an attorney for the firefighters then sought records from federal signal related to the study a plaintiffs lawyer asserted last spring that the company was withholding some such records a claim the company called "ridiculous " several month later however federal signal said its lawyers office had discovered more records related to the study the company then turned over more pages consisting of data analysis done by associates in mr jaynes law office cook county circuit judge robert e gordon reacted harshly to the disclosure this february he barred dr clark and his hearing loss study from trials of the firefighter cases to be held in his court the judge wrote that the company and its attorneys "withheld hundreds of pages of documents used in this study and may have been an integral part of its creation " he ordered the federal signal side to pay the firefighters &# in attorneys fees the siren maker says it may still try to use dr clarks study in other jurisdictions where it faces suits from firefighters holding it responsible for hearing loss it faces cases in other states involving some firefighters in all federal signal also says that the chicago firefighters attorney jordan margolis never challenged the clark studys scientific validity mr margolis says he would have had the study had been allowed in even with the study excluded judge gordon warned that the firefighters case "is a difficult rope to climb " he didnt elaborate federal signal maintains the firefighters lawyers are encouraging large numbers of people to bring "baseless claims" to extract a large settlement as for dr clark washington university medical school released a letter saying that he hadnt violated any university policies
