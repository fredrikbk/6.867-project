bracero immigration plan worked can similar plan work today in regard to your june editorial "immigration plan b" you seem to present the bracero program as historical evidence that a guest worker program "filled gaps in the labor market " and that "illegal border crossings subsequently plummeted " philip martin cornell university press suggests that the program actually caused more gaps in the farm labor market than it filled by lowering the prevailing wage resulting in u s workers exiting to nonfarm jobs and thus led to more farm labor shortages and more braceros etc in addition the farmers were motivated to do more labor intensive cropping which required cheaper labor in turn creating more gaps and demanding more braceros your ins data on apprehensions of illegals if anything like the present may have represented only a fraction of the total illegal border crossings in any case the critical question becomes just how many of these braceros actually came into this country and stayed as illegals this is the relevant statistic important in deciding if this guest worker program actually deterred illegal immigration sherman b child minneapolis you are focusing on a plan braceros that worked very well when i was a youngster i am my aunt and uncle ran a large cattle ranch in west texas they routinely brought braceros in to do all the tough jobs that could not be filled during world war ii it worked well and when their time was up they always had a "cousin or uncle" who were ready to come up and take their place i know people who depend on annually hiring illegals to harvest their crops staff their landscaping businesses etc they all tell me that the majority have no intention of staying in the u s there isnt any recognition in the political establishment or the journal editorial page for that matter of the major financial impact the illegal population is having on our jails health care and schools ronald c stinson solana beach calif the journal wants more foreign workers arguing the bracero program worked splendidly and was only phased out in the early s "in response to complaints from labor unions " not really there were no bracero labor unions but repeated reports about rampant child labor nonpayment of pathetically low wages and sometimes slave like conditions just became too embarrassing thousands of now very old braceros to this day have never been paid the of their income withheld by the mexican government supposedly for retirement you want this again we actually have an ongoing guest program right now in the u s in the u s commonwealth of the northern mariana islands some young women invited mainly from china work as indentured labor in its sweatshops for subsistent wages on american soil we are a better people than that al meyerhoff studio city calif you editorial offers a sensible step in the right direction on immigration reform in fact with a grace period built in a "nuevo bracero" program would substantially erase the problem of the or or million illegal workers now residing in the u s heres how require all prospective guest workers to return to their home countries to obtain a work permit but give them three years to do it the illegals would return home at a time of their own choosing and at their own cost from employers will be permitted to hire only those workers with proper identification and permit the federal government will enforce this provision assisted by the creation of a worker id and database drawn from the permit authorization process there are many other issues to be resolved of course but offering a three year grace period to obtain proper documentation would establish a no cost mechanism for gaining control over the millions of undocumented workers currently residing in the u s richard c thornton professor of history george washington university washington
