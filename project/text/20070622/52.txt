mr franks class actions hear ye hear ye democrats are having a worthwhile debate on financial regulation to witness this marvel check out the partys current intramural dispute over the perils facing the u s capital markets in one corner is chuck schumer senator from new york the former financial capital of the world in the other is massachusettss barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee who next week will host a political spectacle er hearing on whether a gop led securities and exchange commission has slackened enforcement and investor protection all five sec commissioners have been "invited" to testify something that hasnt happened in a decade among mr franks "concerns" are reports that the sec might let shareholders decide to handle future investor complaints by arbitration rather than a class action lawsuit the trial lawyers who lavish campaign cash on democrats want mr frank to kill any possibility of this modest reform lest it curb their litigation machine enter mr schumer and his ally new york mayor mike bloomberg co sponsors of a report on the challenges facing u s capital markets they have offered grim news on the declining attractiveness of a u s stock listing for international companies citing excessive litigation in particular in alone u s companies shouldered &# billion in settlements of lawsuits brought in the name of shareholders though usually with a class action law firm as a chief beneficiary that same year wall street got only of all initial public offerings world wide down from in coincidence even scourge of wall street turned new york governor eliot spitzer is calling for reform meanwhile mr frank has cast himself as the defender of shareholder rights a peculiar notion in this context in shareholder lawsuits any verdict or settlement against a company ends up coming out of the pockets of shareholders if deterring or punishing management wrongdoing against shareholders is the goal why are investors being punished twice and few forms of litigation are more racket ready firms routinely settle out of necessity unwilling to litigate while their stock prices are held hostage to years of legal uncertainty but in a letter to sec chairman chris cox mr frank has objected to what he called the "drastic change" an arbitration allowance would create really one question here is whether the sec needs to "allow" anything at all the charter of a company is nothing more than a contract among its owners when companies go public they spell out the rights of shareholders in their charters and investors are free to buy or not companies cant make changes to their charters unless a majority of shareholders agree royal dutch shell recently amended its charter to provide for certain shareholder disputes to be handled outside of the court system raising little public alarm some litigation critics like harvards hal scott who wrote the recent committee on capital markets regulation report calling for tort reform still have doubts about whether new companies should be allowed to adopt an arbitration requirement when they go public better he argues for the sec to step aside and let shareholders vote on the matter after a few months the sec has also long blocked public offerings with arbitration provisions but wed argue that permitting them would be one of the best ways to test the markets acceptance of such charters ipos are deeply scrutinized by knowledgeable investors and fund managers as they decide whether to buy in by the way mr frank aided by democratic senators pat leahy and russ feingold is also using his new power to try to roll back an existing arbitration system that adjudicates disputes between brokerage firms and their clients thats a longtime dream of the trial bar which would have loved to bring a class action lawsuit against all of wall street after the dot com meltdown mr frank has said this experience was "instructive" regarding arbitration but theres really no connection investors ultimately would be in charge of whether listed companies adopt arbitration for shareholder complaints if such provisions were seen as shielding companies from costly shakedowns by the trial bar their value would be welcomed and popularized if arbitration ended up protecting corrupt management from accountability the opposite would occur corporate critics like to talk about "shareholder democracy " perhaps they should have the courage of their sloganeering and let the lawsuits versus arbitration issue be decided by the only people whose interests are legitimately implicated in the choice that means shareholders as for senator schumer were with you on this one sir if you meant what you said about excessive litigation now would be a good time to speak up
