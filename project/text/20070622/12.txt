civil war letters shed light on pain of troops families without word from kin parents turned to agency sons death at bull run when her fathers letters stopped coming six months after he went off to war emily tyrrell fell into a state of "anxious suffering " all she had was a rumor somewhere he was hospitalized and gravely ill so miss tyrrell wrote to a humanitarian agency known for finding missing union soldiers the u s sanitary commission "whatever his sad fate may have been " the seamstress from upstate new york wrote "our torturing suspense may soon be relieved " a grim response came quickly her father ira m tyrrell had died in city point va in late june the year old father of nine was among about fatalities on both sides in the american civil war miss tyrrells letter sat untouched for years until a fort wayne ind accountant named brian tyrrell recently ordered a copy from the new york public library he had googled his great great grandfather ira tyrrell and to his amazement stumbled on his name in a new online database "its another piece of the puzzle " says mr tyrrell he believes based on his research that ira tyrrell was accidentally buried under the name "j aurell" in city point presumably after an engraver misread someones handwriting he plans to use the letter to try to correct the tombstone the letter is one of thousands sitting at the library in a largely unexplored trove that sheds new light on the civil war after the war ended the sanitary commission a forerunner to the red cross gave all its records tens of thousands of letters logs and photos to the astor library a precursor to the new york public library but the library only recently began preparing the archives for public use bringing forth a haunting chorus of despair "my wife has given way under the burden of grief and is now in a most critical condition " wrote thomas york of allegheny pa seeking his year old son who apparently had run off to the war another father was so desperate to find his son charles o eastman that he wrote a letter with a pencil held between his teeth the father had lost his hands in an accident the documents suggest how an absence of information about soldiers compounded the suffering back home in the iraq war the u s government generally is quick to identify wounded soldiers and contact kin in the civil war families ran ads and offered rewards for information on loved ones the sanitary commission set out to help "the papers are an invaluable source about how voluntary agencies stepped in to bury the dead and provide information to families before the u s government recognized this as its responsibility " harvard university president drew gilpin faust said in an email she is among a handful of scholars aware of the documents which she came across while researching her forthcoming book "this republic of suffering death and the american civil war " the sanitary commission was formed in as a charitable agency providing aid to soldiers its first executive secretary was frederick law olmsted the famed landscape architect who designed new yorks central park following the disastrous first battle of bull run in virginia he interviewed soldiers and found out they were too fatigued and hungry to fight properly the organization dispatched nurses and doctors ran kitchens and made uniforms donations flooded in some &# million worth according to commission records so did letters "the boys mother and i are worn with anxiety " wrote aurelius bowen a surgeon in nebraska he offered &# "for every necessary hour" spent by a sanitary commission clerk to find his year old son marcellus in the margin he described the streets of nebraska city after president lincolns assassination "strong men broke down and cried like children " he wrote the sanitary commission tracked down mr bowens son and wrote back that he was safely with his camp the boy later died of tuberculosis records show while the surgeon became a state senator in the agency set up a separate operation to handle the growing stream of letters the hospital directory it was run by john bowne an accountant at his grandfathers new york printing company bowne &amp co the hospital directory received daily reports from hundreds of hospitals and in big brown leather books recorded information on more than one million soldiers it referred to these records and wrote to military surgeons when friends and families wrote or showed up at hospital directory offices in manhattan washington louisville ky and philadelphia more than inquiries streamed in one was from annie mecann of jenkintown pa who had traveled to newport news va to find a witness to her brothers last days "but the hospital and all connected with it had been removed from there " she wrote to mr olmsted mr bowne promptly put ms mecann in touch with her brothers deathbed nurse mr bowne also comforted cornelius howard a hospitalized soldier who feared the sister he left in a manhattan orphanage was dead mr bowne contacted the orphanage and replied that the girl was "in good health " some fates remained a mystery "john robinson was last seen in a saloon in detroit " one surgeon responded a few years ago with a &# matching federal grant the library began preserving the hospital directory inquiries with the help of a humidifier the staff began gingerly opening letters many wrapped in brown paper and tied with faded red string susan waide an archivist overseeing the project typed the names of everyone who was inquired about into a database and put it online now the library is seeking &# million in federal funding to "liberate the entire collection " says library president paul leclerc and create an online civil war correspondence center the massive collection sits in locked stacks at the librarys century old landmark in midtown manhattan one day recently ms waide pulled a large brown leather binder off a shelf a death report inside were long lists of names and cause of death "typhoid gunshot wounds diarrhea amputation " other boxes contained photos of sanitary workers in action the hospital directory inquiries now sit in manila folders labeled with soldiers names among the names is robert b wallace "an only son " who enlisted right after college "it is the last effort of a mothers affectionate love to relieve a breaking heart " said a letter written on behalf of lottie e wallace of manhattan she wanted index cards describing him to be placed at washington area hospitals to "catch the eye of someone who was present with our boy when he died if dead he is or who has been with him if he is living and a prisoner of the enemy " mr bowne replied with tragic news on aug mr wallace was shot in the right side of his abdomen during the second battle of bull run "our forces were in full retreat " a surgeon reported "he could not be removed "
