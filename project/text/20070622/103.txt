psychology at ucla and author of "the baby name report card " has conducted surveys of how people react to different names he found that more common names elicited positive reactions while unusual names typically brought negative responses to him giving children names that stand out may ultimately be no different than sending them to school with their hair dyed blue "yes you can have someone stand out by being bizarre but that doesnt mean its going to be good " he says for scott and katie keppler of rye n y the decision to seek help stemmed from a fundamental disagreement with their second child on the way mrs keppler an accountant wanted something traditional to match their first sons name liam her husband a software salesman preferred unique names like jolt for a boy or jilly for a girl "he was harassing me with some really strange names " mrs keppler says to break the deadlock mr keppler decided to spend &# for a service on babynames com that provides six options based on everything from a couples mothers maiden names to their general taste preferences traditional biblical trendy unique ethnic and wild among others when their son was born in march they tapped their favorite name from the list max phillip the web site was a truly impartial third party mr keppler says "it wasnt a grandmother it wasnt an aunt " madeline dziallo a beautician and mother of two in

about it with rather than driving my husband crazy " says mrs dziallo despite all of her planning mrs dziallo began to panic about the name natalie two weeks before her due date "i thought im going to be calling her from the delivery room " she says lisa and jon stone of lynnwood wash turned to a name consultant because they didnt want their son to be "one of five ashtons in the class " says mrs stone a graphic designer for mr stone a production director for a nonprofit arts organization the challenge was to find a "cool" name that would help his son stand out "an unusual name gets peoples attention when youre searching for a job or youre one in a field of many " he says at first they considered a family name greene but thought greene stone sounded like "some new age holistic product " mr stone liked finn stone and flynn stone but thought both sounded too much like the name of a cartoon family from the stone age after reading through eight baby name books the stones contacted laura wattenberg author of "the baby name wizard " for advice she suggested they avoid names that ended in "s " given their last name or names that seemed to create phrases her recommendations evander as a top choice with levi and vaughn close behind when the stones unveiled the name evander jet to family and friends three months ago mrs stone says they were surprised "everybody was like oh you named him after the boxer when actually its a really old name " even parents who are professional name consultants say the decision can be wrenching as one of the founders of catchword a corporate naming firm with offices in new york and oakland calif burt alper says he and his wife jennifer who also works in marketing felt "tons of pressure" to come up with something grabby although mr alper typically gives clients a list of names to mull over he says he kept the list of baby names to for simplicity in the end they named their daughter sheridan a family name mr alper liked because of its "nice crisp syllables " they chose beckett for their six month old son a name the alpers thought sounded reliable and stable "that c k sound is very well regarded in corporate circles " mr alper says giving kodak and coca cola as examples "the hard stop forces you to accentuate the syllable in a way that draws attention to it " name choices have long been agonizing for some parents in colonial times it was not uncommon for parents to open the bible and select a word at random a practice that created such gems as notwithstanding griswold and maybe barnes in some countries name choices are regulated by the government france passed a law in the early s that prohibited all names except those on a preapproved list the last of these laws was repealed in in germany the government still bans invented names and names that dont clearly designate a childs sex sweden and denmark forbid names that officials think might subject a child to ridicule swedish authorities have recently rejected such names as veranda ikea and metallica to capitalize on the confusion baby name consultants are opening for business whitney walker and eric reyes and who are based in san leandro calif began researching baby names when they had their first child in they chose the name gabriel rush reyes based on the vowel sounds and the way it flowed with the surname after hearing from other couples about their dilemmas ms walker saw an opportunity when she was pregnant with her second child she and her husband began writing a book that grouped baby names according to their sounds and rhythms and explained how to break a surname down to its phonetic parts and match it with a first name after publishing "the perfect baby name finding the name that sounds just right" in the pair started offering name

"j " none of the names they came up with jude julian jake jason or john jr seemed original enough they hired ms walker and mr reyes who produced an page list of possibilities including jackson in march the benthams welcomed little jackson dean into the world babynamesworld com an online database has drawn more than requests for free name advice in the last nine months a increase since the feature launched in says anabel conner the web sites administrator and a self described "name nerd " many of the advice seekers ask for alternative spellings of popular names those requests are fulfilled by volunteer advisers the site draws visitors a day up from three years ago says ms conner mrs wattenberg author of "the baby name wizard " has carved out another niche in the business parents who like statistics while searching for a name for her second child in the only reference guides she could find were dictionaries so mrs wattenberg a software designer created a database of thousands of names using social security data she hand coded each one to reflect its cultural associations and linguistic origins noting how often a name appeared in the bible soap operas or in the wedding or birth announcement sections of ivy league alumni magazines her daughters are named eve and nina the program inspired her book which spawned a web site featuring the name popularity tracker now thats given rise to a new baby naming program called nymbler which generates lists of similar names based on any name entered some advisers could use a good fact checker a few baby name web sites including babynamescountry com classify strom as derived from the greek word for bed when in fact it comes from the german word for stream the sites founder says names are submitted by users and are not researched on others megan is described as a derivation of the greek word for "great " but it actually originated in wales as a pet form of margaret most observers say the parental anxiety and the current interest in unusual names should continue to grow hitwise an internet traffic research firm says "baby names" was one of the top generic internet search terms in the first year the company tracked such data ranking it alongside "weather " "directions" and "maps " prof evans says he now gets regular calls from couples asking him for advice "maybe i should be charging people " he says others citing the rising popularity of names like sophie hannah violet and emma predict a return to the classics this month julia roberts who was considered slightly radical for naming her twins phinnaeus and hazel named her newborn son henry as for ms tiedens who saw her top baby name choice usurped by a british porn star shes since adopted a baby boy and named him jackson thomas a name that sailed through google without any complications jackson was the th most popular boy name last year as ranked by the social security administration still she says shes not completely free from worry "now we just need to be concerned about what other jackson thomases are going to do in or years " she says "and what they are going to put on their myspace pages "
