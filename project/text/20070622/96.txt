weekend journal review television entry to hell when it was painted around and for many centuries later hieronymus boschs "garden of earthly delights" triptych frightened all who saw it the images of wanton sensuality and the gruesome figures and beasts depicting the wages of sin were horrifying and all who saw them felt duly warned many of the same "delights" appear in the new showtime series "meadowlands" sundays p m et yet here they are offered as entertainment as a statement on the human condition cage fighting would be more illuminating although meadowlands appears to be a town in england it is different from any other in several respects the houses neatly arranged and nearly identical except for their colors are occupied by people who know nothing about their neighbors before their arrival in meadowlands everyone it turns out has a new name and identity because every resident is in a form of witness protection some are criminals and others perhaps merely gave testimony in criminal proceedings but no one can leave and the fate that awaits them on the outside acts as a natural barrier into this environment comes the central family of the story the brogans all we learn early on is that father danny david morrissey is the cause of their forced exile and only barely escaped with his family from a fire that burned their house down his wife evelyn lucy cohu can barely suppress her resentment then theres daughter zoe felicity jones a precocious year old flirt and her twin brother mark harry treadaway of all the brogans mark is the one who bears the outward scars of the emotionally wounded denizens of the entire town hes been diagnosed with add ocd and high functioning autism among other disorders hes also been mute since the house fire that badly burned his hands but his trauma is far from over as terrifying events unfold marks repeated agonies are the most excruciating to watch some of the awful moments involve bloody physical violence including a face stomping the torture and near asphyxiation of a prisoner an attempted rape and a graphic murder others spring from desperate needs that find their attempted satisfaction in scenes of masturbation voyeurism and other seductive moves that can only be described as uniquely revolting under the thinnest veneer of normality nearly everyone can be menacing one obviously demented resident is the cop wintersgill who looks like a throwback to the jack the ripper era also in the mix are the superficially perky samantha and her grossly overweight daughter jezebel a doctor who gives scary gynecological exams and jack the handyman with a rampant sexual disorder we arent told exactly who operates meadowlands or why its pretty clear that this is no ordinary witness protection program on one level it appears that most of the characters have made some sort of faustian bargain they can wipe their slate clean but theres a price to be paid there is also a price to be paid for watching "meadowlands " which for a viewer with intact sensibilities will mean almost unrelenting pain discomfort and disgust one could try to make the best of it by imaging that meadowlands is not so much hell as a kind of purgatory that by definition allows the possibility of release after punishment or one could save oneself the trouble as a murder victim expires here a smile comes over his face as with his last breath he utters "im leaving " lucky man theres something saddening about "hey paula " too but thats what makes bravos new reality series thursdays p m featuring singer choreographer paula abdul so unforgettably poignant ms abdul is best known for her role as the friendliest judge on "american idol " in this show we see what ms abdul does the rest of the time as well now that as she herself says she hasnt had a hit record in decades her activities in the first episode include getting ready to attend the grammys by picking out an evening dress that wont get savaged again as tasteless by red carpet critics and hawking her jewelry line mostly baubles in the &# range at a m on qvc throughout her personality seems to be what youd expect from watching "idol" naturally perky and endearingly unaffected for a celebrity choosing borrowed gems for the grammys she drapes one of her four chihuahuas in a diamond necklace pries a priceless ring from the mouth of another dog and gets licked on the mouth we see her wandering the streets of l a stumbling on her high heels looking for a lost limo and waving gamely to fans who constantly yell "hey paula " what comes across most strongly though is the downside of the fame to which ms abdul is clinging legions of fans she may have but her best friends seem to be her hair stylist and other employees she endures humiliations small and large the people making a movie shes producing wont even return her calls all the necessary primping and bouncing back after defeats is taking its toll in one future scene we see her in the back of a limo in tears "this business is all about perception so i am exhausted keeping it up " she whimpers you like her for saying that and you pity her as well confessions of a matchmaker" a&amp e saturdays p m is an unexpected delight in an age where we are told to love ourselves and not let anybody else tell us we arent perfect buffalo matchmaker patti slovak dishes out brutal truth most of her clients arent perfect or they wouldnt need her help getting dates and patti tells them exactly why they are not appealing whether they eat like a pig look like a prostitute or perhaps need to come out of the closet sometimes the advice even works
