to gauge recovery japan looks up airlines comeback path might help divine nations financial direction tokyo for years japans banks and investors coddled the nations struggling corporate giants the approach may have saved jobs and reputations but over the long term it led to bloated moribund companies that struggled to modernize and contributed to years of economic stagnation japan airlines corp which may soon embark on a major restructuring effort could present a test of whether times have changed japans biggest airline by revenue known as jal benefited for years from a highly protected aviation market competition from foreign airlines was limited even as the global airline industry slashed costs amid cutthroat price wars jal formerly government owned managed to retain highly paid pilots and a fleet of expensive planes now jal faces more hardship last month it announced a big net loss for the second year in a row hurt by higher oil prices and its expensive cost structure to improve its bottom line jal badly needs money to renew its fleet with more fuel efficient planes observers say but its banks are cautious about lending the carrier more because of its huge existing debt of trillion yen &# billion times the companys operating profit for the fiscal year ended march jal currently has no problem paying interest on its debt still in a sign of tough times last month it asked its banks to give up part of their debt in exchange for nonvoting shares in the company people close to the situation say the arrangement known as a debt for equity swap is a risky move for banks but it has nonetheless been a popular way to rehabilitate the most problematic companies in japan a country where it is still relatively rare for large companies to reorganize by filing for bankruptcy it is unclear how jals banks will respond the biggest lender is state owned development bank of japan which may be more willing to extend additional funding but other big creditors are private banks including mizuho financial group inc s mizuho corporate bank mitsubishi ufj financial group inc and sumitomo mitsui financial group inc these big banks like many japanese companies face increasingly demanding shareholders at a time when corporate governance is becoming hotly debated that is a big change from the past when banks were expected to rescue large companies facing woes no matter what the cost earlier this year banks with stakes in sanyo electric co got frustrated with its slow pace of restructuring and forced the resignation of its president daiei inc one of japans largest supermarket chains had to turn to a government sponsored corporate restructuring agency in late after its main banks refused to provide necessary funding to turn around the company that had been saddled with debts at that time "in the past a longstanding relationship or group affiliation were good enough reasons for financial aid " says katsuyuki nakai a corporate rating analyst at standard &amp poors "now shareholders demand something a lot more convincing " even if banks agree to a debt for equity swap people familiar with the matter say they are likely to ask for bold restructuring steps jal announced its own turnaround plan in february but its lenders dont think those measures are sufficient these people say a jal spokesman said the company is studying various options for obtaining funds and declined to discuss specific plans jal says it is currently considering moving foward the implementation of its own restructuring plan by one year so it is completed by march of this a spokesman said reflects the companys own desire to speed up restructuring and isnt the result of added pressure from the banks in mid february as the turnaround plan was announced shares of jal reached a peak of yen &# but they have skidded since then as investors have watched for specific restructuring steps yesterday the shares slipped one yen to close at yen below that peak while the government no longer owns shares it maintains close ties some analysts speculate the government may try to give jal more time to recover by delaying its plans to deregulate the countrys entire airline industry whatever the government might do analysts say jal may have to do more in february the airline said it would cut jobs in the next three years trimming its work force by but some lenders say they want to see a bigger reduction combined with pay cuts for employees including pilots who are among the best paid in the global industry jal may also sell off real estate holdings or noncore units already jal is considering putting its credit card operation on the block people in the industry say investment banks seeing a potential opportunity are lining up at jals door with offers to work on asset sales foreign private equity funds have also approached jal with offers to take it private people close to the situation say cost cutting wont be the end of jals restructuring analysts say jal must also upgrade its fleet by replacing many gas guzzling jumbo jets with smaller more fuel efficient aircraft an effort that would cost several billion dollars by jal wants to reduce the proportion of large jets in its nearly plane fleet to from which would cut annual fuel costs by about eight billion yen the company says it will be a big challenge for jal to take on costly projects while dealing with its giant debt last year debt servicing cost billion yen
