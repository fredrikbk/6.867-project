on pariss jet runways green is the new gray le bourget france with their ear splitting noise gloomy exhaust trails and thirsting need for thousands of gallons of fuel each hour jets have long been a gray smear on environmentalists blue skies but at the paris air show here this week aerospace executives have tried to repaint that image in pleasant shades of green the pastoral color is everywhere in sod rolled out on floors hung on walls and carpeting a man made hillside on the promotional dvds handed out in booths and the invitations to industry cocktail parties european plane maker airbus has even taken to calling its massive a superjumbo "the gentle green giant" because with people onboard it burns less fuel per passenger than a small car in promotional materials airbus shows a

of jet leasing giant international lease finance corp a unit of american international group inc airlines and their suppliers have a lot of baggage to overcome with environmentalists the outcry in europe has grown so intense that regulators are tightening rules on airport expansion and noise on wednesday the european commission set steep goals for plane makers to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by their nitrogen oxide emissions by and noise by half by in britain a few activists have suggested that flying away on holiday is immoral and should be stopped fearing a rising global tide of environmental taxes on airplane tickets and jet fuel aerospace companies are rushing to find a compelling way to tell their side of the story airlines and plane makers can demonstrate that they have dramatically improved their environmental performance over the past years each generation of airplanes and engines has polluted significantly less than its predecessors boeing co says that since the jet age began the industry has reduced engine noise by an average of decibels and fuel consumption by one problem the industry faces is its approach to the issue "weve always talked about it in the language of saving money but reducing the amount of fuel an engine uses also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide it creates by the same percentage " said scott donnelly president of general electric co s jet engine unit the need to reshape the message explains why jet engine maker cfm which is showcasing its latest titanium engine components has installed a faux hillside of freshly mowed grass in an exhibition hall here the display is meant to subtly underscore the companys view that its technology is contributing to a better environment cfm a joint venture of ge and frances safran sa

they need to do " scoffs mr gazzard aviation companies say their efforts are sincere both airbus a unit of eads and boeing are now designing new airplanes that will cut fuel consumption and emissions as much as rising fuel prices have helped spark a bonanza of orders for newer more fuel efficient planes such as boeings dreamliner and airbuss competing a jetliner but airlines are touting their purchases as environmental moves in announcing an order for boeing planes air france klm sa noted the cut in carbon dioxide emissions before pointing out fuel savings presenting plans for a new engine
