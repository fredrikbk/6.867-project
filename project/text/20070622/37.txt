for everquest dream team doomed an ipo when everquest financial ltd filed last month to offer stock to the public the company touted the expertise of ralph cioffi and his employer bear stearns cos in managing and investing in exotic financial instruments everquest specifically noted as "competitive advantages" in its prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission both mr cioffis and bear stearnss "expertise" and "strong track record" in dealing with funds that structure debt securities it also pointed out that the market surveillance systems used by bear would be available to everquest and would help the company "quickly identify and where possible sell" out of securities before losses could mount now the meltdown of mr cioffis hedge funds on the back of losses tied to bets on the subprime mortgage market have turned the fund manager and bear stearns into a big liability for everquest everquest has decided it will no longer go ahead with the planned public offering according to people familiar with the matter bear stearns declined to comment everquest was set up last fall to cash in on the booming market for structured financial products such as collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations the idea behind the public offering was to raise additional funds by giving individuals the ability to invest in everquest and get a piece of the growing market where banks pool debt securities and then slice them up based on differing risk and return profiles clos generally invest in securities that involve corporate debt cdos are composed of many different kinds of debt although in recent years many have heavily invested in mortgage backed securities particularly those underpinned by subprime loans shelving the offering leaves mr cioffis funds and wall streets bear stearns with a new headache together they own nearly of everquest but would themselves be unlikely to provide further funding for the company while everquest hasnt decided whether it will formally withdraw its listing prospectus from the sec or simply let the filing languish as is allowed executives at the company realize any sort of public share sale will be impossible for some time a person familiar with the matter said of the holdings mr cioffis funds own million shares a stake that at one point had an estimated value of about &# million according to per share values ascribed to everquest last fall bear stearns through affiliates owns one million shares which at one point had an estimated value of &# million additionally bear and some senior executives have &# million invested in mr cioffis two funds besides mr cioffis funds and bear stearns about of everquest is held by stone tower capital llc a money management firm that deals primarily in investment vehicles dealing in corporate debt the failed offering is another black mark for everquest which since filing its offering documents with the sec in early may has faced questions related to the value of its assets those assets were worth nearly &# million at the end of last year according to the companys prospectus doubts surfaced over the value of everquests assets because its not entirely clear how much is in bonds backed by risky subprime mortgages versus bonds backed by safer corporate debt but the prospectus notes holdings of bonds backed by subprime debt as a "risk factor" that would need to be weighed by investors additionally any valuation of the companys assets is colored by the fact that most were initially contributed last october to everquest by mr cioffis funds this brings into question any value assigned to both the assets and the amount everquest paid for them since mr cioffi and bear were essentially sitting on both sides of the table that coupled with inherent difficulties in valuing the types of securities held by the company made some observers wary from the get go "these things are extremely difficult to value theres no liquidity in them no market price and you have to rely on the manager for their value and the managers fees are dependent on the performance of these assets " said janet tavakoli president of tavakoli structured finance a consulting firm in chicago who early on criticized the deal as being unsuitable for average investors in a nod to the difficulty in pricing the kind of assets everquest deals in the companys prospectus noted that the value of assets contributed by mr cioffis funds "were determined based on certain models assumptions and methods and do not necessarily reflect the values that could have been achieved by us upon sale" of them in the open market even if the initial values of the assets held by the company were accurate they might have changed dramatically now given the problems experienced by the subprime mortgage sector and mr cioffis funds his efforts to unwind the funds which at one point had about &# billion in assets may force investors who have similar assets to mark down the price of their own holdings that could depress values across the board for these types of assets to form everquest mr cioffis funds last october transferred equity in cdos to the company according to its prospectus equity portions of cdos are the highest yielding but also riskiest part of these structures in exchange everquest issued the bear stearns funds million shares and paid it nearly &# million in cash other investors at the same time paid nearly &# million in cash for million shares in the company
