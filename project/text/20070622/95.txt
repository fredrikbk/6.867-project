weekend journal review film shattering story is told astutely in mighty heart jolie is fierce tender sappy biblical humor sinks evan almighty of the two powerful presences in "a mighty heart " only one gets star billing angelina jolie gives a fierce and astute performance as mariane pearl the wife of daniel pearl the wall street journal reporter who was abducted and murdered by al qaeda operatives in karachi five years ago the other presence is the city itself vast throbbing with life teeming with misery and as depicted here all but unfathomable to westerners seeking to penetrate its secrets this is a smart and serious film however much it may also function as a star vehicle the director michael winterbottom working from a script by john orloff has turned mariane pearls memoir into a relentlessly intense drama about the search for her husband as well as her search for meaning in his death and the immediacy of the setting heightened by documentary techniques makes this a chastening film a portrait of the explosive new world in which we live in her own portraiture ms jolie mixes tenderness with implacable toughness she plays mariane a journalist herself and six months pregnant at the time as a wife who loves her husband passionately but a woman with no time or inclination for the niceties of behavior once its clear he has been taken prisoner at that point she becomes an obsessive organizer of the search and a compulsive scourge of anyone who threatens to stand in her way one fatuous pakistani functionary insists that the abduction is an indian plot given angelina jolies celebrity the obvious danger in such a take no prisoners style of acting was imposing herself on the real life story but that hasnt happened to the contrary the actress enters the character and stays there even during her feral cries in the films most harrowing scene daniel pearl is played by dan futterman who oddly in this context may be best known as the oscar nominated screen writer of "capote" the reporter is seen fleetingly at first as he arrives in karachi from islamabad then goes to his fateful meeting with a supposedly legitimate source for a story he was doing on the shoe bomber richard reid i didnt know danny so all i can say about mr futtermans performance is that it and his physical resemblance to his character seem persuasive but dannys character seems persuasive too not a hero of the war on terror as some have sought to cast him and certainly not the incautious naif that others have thought him to be but a first rate reporter of maturity reflexive decency insatiable curiosity reasonable prudence and unreasonable dedication to finding the truth of whatever story he might have been working on against most hollywood odds danny pearls tragically truncated life story has fallen into good hands thanks to the films producers first among them brad pitt and to the filmmaker they entrusted with the production for much of the past decade michael winterbottom who was born in england has been refining his agile style in such extraordinary films as "welcome to sarajevo" and "in this world " and in last years "the road to guantanamo " its a style that integrates drama and documentary footage mixes professional with non professional actors and yields a sense of place thats as vivid as anything seen on tv news on one occasion the stylist stumbled "the road to guantanamo" was long on immediacy but short on factuality and one aspect of the technique here amounts to tacit editorial comment through the use of oppressive close ups quick cuts film noir peeks into labyrinthine neighborhoods and long lenses that compress the confusion of karachis streets into pandemonium the director and his danish born cameraman marcel zyskind have made the city seem endlessly menacing what would the same locales have looked like if theyd been shot by a third world filmmaker yet the films point of view is inevitably that of an outsider which danny pearl was and menace is the essence of this shattering story which has been told with skill and urgent conviction "a mighty heart" makes the terms of the terrorist threat palpable evan almighty when god commands a modern day noah to build an ark in "evan almighty " he gives him a book called "ark building for dummies " this is movie making by and for dummies a sappy little bible story blissed out on its own ineptitude thats full of birds plus their do that looks like "the birds" when it isnt aping "dr dolittle " and that is definitely though far from incidentally for the birds the evan of the title is evan baxter last seen in the jim carrey comedy "bruce almighty " evan played by steve carell was bruces rival the self satisfied tv newscaster who suddenly began to spout gibberish on the air more gibberish that is than tv newscasters usually spout mr carell plays evan again but this time in jim carreys absence his character has graduated from bit player to hero and from newscaster to a freshman congressman who got elected with the hollow campaign slogan change the world which is admittedly no more hollow than the gibberish that political candidates usually spout god is played once again by morgan freeman whose suave charm can sell all sorts of silliness but not the amiable imbecility peddled by this film none of it makes much sense gods commandment kicks in after evan proves himself a poor steward of the environment he drives a hummer and lends his name to a bill that will destroy the national parks but why would that make him a candidate for ark captain and why do people think hes crazy since hordes of animals as well as birds follow him wherever he goes though these are troubling questions their significance pales in comparison to the idiocy of evans itinerary his vessel travels only from suburban virginia to capitol hill on a flood tide thats mostly inside the beltway still thats far enough to be certified as a ride look for an ark sometime soon at a theme park near you dvd tip in a comic vein michael winterbottom has made such exhilarating intricate films as "tristram shandy a cock and bull story" a postmodern rendering of the th century novel by laurence sterne and " hour party people" a docudrama about the manchester music scene of the s and s both of them star the irrepressible english actor steve coogan
