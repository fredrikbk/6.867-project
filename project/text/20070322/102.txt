the daily fix ready your brackets america its time for the sweet online edition the ncaa mens tournament cranks back up tonight with four sweet matchups memphis texas a&amp m ohio state tennessee kansas southern illinois and ucla pitt time for a quick fix tour in the new york times pete thamel puts the spotlight on texas a&amp m coach billy gillispie a man for whom "basketball obsessed" might actually be an understatement mr gillispie isnt married "and some of his friends and family say that with his obsessive work habits that most likely will not change " mr thamel writes "gillispie openly refers to his life as unbalanced and his friends call his obsession with basketball unhealthy in a profession full of quirky workaholics gillispie is known as one of the most eccentric few have taken a more rigorous road to the top of the college coaching profession gillispie started as a team manager at sam houston state and taught history and geography for eight years while working as a high school assistant and head coach along the way to a&amp m he switched jobs times in years divorced and became one of the most beloved and respected coaches in texas " in the cincinnati enquirer paul daugherty joins many columnists in putting ohio states greg oden under the microscope no its not about whether hell stay in school or opt for the nba draft its about his game "at winning time against xavier oden was on the buckeyes bench fouled out " mr daugherty writes "the best player in college ought to dominate that game he ought to size up the desperate situation and make the stage his own especially when hes a head taller than anyone guarding him instead oden nearly cost his team the game had the referees made the gutty call and hit him with an intentional foul on justin cage with seconds left he would have as it was mike conley jr a freshman point guard came to the buckeyes rescue theres a fine line between unselfish and reluctant between wanting to be great and needing it maybe oden is that player its not always easy to see now " the word among kansas fans beware of the salukis southern illinois which is fun to say as "so ill" is an underdog with some serious bite "these tournament matches used to be easier to classify " muses mike lopresti in the indianapolis star "big name power and might against smaller fry who would have to get by on guile and charm forget it anyone who thinks that has never had to slice through the southern illinois defense trying to get open for a pass the salukis act like bar bouncers on a saturday night so this time the underdogs are bringing their defensive nightsticks you will find no more intriguing clash of style in the sweet sixteen the unstoppable force will be wearing white the immovable object maroon " ucla vs pitt will be a study in contrasting offenses ucla is guard oriented while pitt is all about foot pound center aaron gray but the favored storyline is the two coaches pitts jamie dixon got his job when ben howland his longtime mentor and friend left the panthers for ucla "at one end of the court aaron gray will see the coach who recruited him for pittsburgh a man prescient enough to see that a gawky foot teenager could become a pivotal figure for a powerhouse team " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times "at the other end gray will see the coach who has stood by him since his tentative freshman days and through his recent awful performance in pittsburghs loss to georgetown in the big east tournament championship game " in mr grays words "its going to be a little interesting you run down on one side of the court and you see coach dixon yelling about one thing and you run down the other side and you hear coach howland probably yelling about the same thing " if your team doesnt win well maybe you should blame the sports gods or more specifically your teams coach for not abiding by those gods terms and conditions on espn com pat forde writes about coaches superstitions from oregons ernie kent manager buys popcorn before games and uncs roy williams spits into the mississippi river to georgetowns john thompson iii yellow gatorade before boarding team bus rules about marker colors and butlers todd lickliter exercises outside and then theres ohio states thad matta whose rituals and quirks would take up the rest of the fix "it is one of the great inconsistencies in sports coaches are preparation freaks and slaves to superstition at the same time " mr forde writes "creatures of habit and cravers of control they want to influence every moment and mannerism that may or may not affect an outcome they draw up dozens of inbounds plays waiting for just the right time and the right defense to use each one yet if you look around this superstitious youll find coaches who can barely function without running a gauntlet of repetitive behavior up to tip off " the miami heralds dan le batard has had it with roger federer its not that mr le batard doesnt appreciate the tennis stars game in fact he writes that "it should be hanging on a museum wall somewhere in paris " its that nobody elses game can come close "somebody needs to unplug the closest thing we have in sports to a robot " he writes "snip the wires of bjorn cyborg spill some acid on his mainframe short circuit all this droning greatness because the tennis ator might very well be the best thing in the history of his sport but he is not at all good for his sport the beauty of games is in the unpredictability the drama the tension the suspense the possibility of surprise but federer keeps eliminating it all telling you how the story ends before you even pick up the book " its an entertaining read one the fix senses is designed to provoke those more inclined to agree with david foster wallace when it comes to federer but mr le batard saves his best material for the end writing that tennis "is a lonely game of repetitive sameness and solitary practice makes sense that federer and tiger woods would reach across all sorts of geographic and cultural boundaries to become friends an african american and a swiss gravitating toward each other because they might be the only two people in the world who really understand and respect what it is like to be the other in the individual sports lance armstrong made his matter to america and tiger woods because of the nature of golf can dominate like federer and still not win even the majority of the time jordan and armstrong and woods lifted their sports but isnt federer through the fault of nothing but his breathtaking dominance keeping his down " the los angeles kings season hasnt been one for the ages but dont tell that to year old gabe gauthier a speedy little forward called up from the teams ahl affiliate the manchester n h monarchs "hes still celebrating the little luxuries like being around nhl players skating in ice palaces wearing no playing cards with mike cammalleri flying the team charter and getting in flight meals of shrimp cocktail appetizers and a warm chocolate chip cookie and milk for dessert " writes marcia c smith in the orange county register ms smith tells the story of how a southern california boys dreams of hockey led him home home via massachusetts canada colorado and new hampshire stick with this one to the end for a gauthier family reunion to celebrate a dream made reality tip of the fix cap to
