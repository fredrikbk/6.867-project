the strange fate of good intentions mugged by reality by john agresto encounter pages &# john agresto arrived in iraq in september with the job of guiding the revitalization of iraqs universities and technical institutions he was filled with an earnest sense of purpose having left a life of semi retirement he had stepped down as president of st johns college in santa fe n m in to help with the american effort in iraq he believed in the project of bringing civic order to a country long oppressed by corruption and tyranny it was not a happy experience a lot of words have been written by now on the aftermath of the march invasion especially about the errors of l paul bremer the head of the coalition provisional authority which governed iraq until june too many members of cpa lived a bunkered existence in baghdads green zone ignorant of the details of daily iraqi experience and unaware of the facts on the ground rajiv chandrasekarans "imperial life in the emerald city" is perhaps the best account of this crippling isolation by contrast mr agresto went out on the road nearly every day often in a single vehicle with little protection he visited the institutions he was trying to help and he spoke with the teachers and administrators and students whose lives he was trying to improve yet very little came of it there was no reliable plan of action at the time the cpa had few funds of its own and had to depend on money from the u s agency for international development and from private contributors along with &# million in a supplemental appropriations bill usaid focused on giving american universities &# million to establish "partnerships" with iraqi universities which mr agresto generously labels "a nice idea " meanwhile criminals and insurgents intimidated the most honest and moderate officials threatening and sometimes carrying out assassinations and kidnappings religious extremism spread among the students woefully restricting freedom of thought and expression by the time mr agresto left iraq in june the attempt at creating a liberal educational system had failed moderate academics had fled the country and radical islamic strictures had been imposed throughout iraqi universities and technical institutions the purpose of "mugged by reality" is not merely to lament mr agrestos experience though but to make a point about american idealism mr agresto argues that americans too often underestimate the extent to which religious extremism can thwart pragmatic ideas demonize moderation and undermine stability he feels that the u s government then and now has put too much faith in iraqis who are culturally unaccustomed to standing up for themselves and taking responsibility for the society that they are a part of for mr agresto misguided expectations threaten to destroy much of what america hopes to accomplish in iraq an idealistic faith in the immediate cure all power of democracy has been part of the problem in mr agrestos view granting power to a shiite majority without developing moderate parties or setting up a mechanism to protect sunni interests he says merely exacerbated sectarian tensions mr agresto writes that it was those iraqis "who understood that democracy in essence means majority rule and not necessarily liberty for all who were the most concerned about the future " much of what mr agresto says conforms to my own experience in iraq in and unfortunately he overreaches when writing about iraqi culture yes some iraqis may be afflicted by a culture of dependency letting americans build their nation for them but mr agresto goes too far when he claims that arab iraqis are unwilling to fight for fear of death "it seems to me as a fairly careful observer that most of them have not died fighting but have died outside restaurants or died standing in line " i have often heard similar sentiments from americans in iraq and it puzzles me at least in anbar province the iraqi army and iraqi police are hardly waiting for the americans to defeat the insurgents in ramadi per capita the most violent city in iraq the iraqi army and police are fighting dying and capturing scores of insurgents i have spoken with policemen who want to crush al qaeda which dominates the city under the heel of their boots even though their friends families and fellow fighters are being intimidated and killed nearly every day mr agresto disregards such examples as mere exceptions to the rule but the evidence suggests otherwise there are now roughly as many iraqi soldiers and police operating in the streets of ramadi fallujah or al qaim as u s marines and soldiers they regularly stand and fight the best example of iraqi initiative is the insurgents themselves they are hardly passive and they are too numerous to be dismissed for the sake of an overbroad generalization about the character of iraqs citizenry despite such missteps "mugged by reality" has a powerful and sobering effect without pretending to be a foreign policy expert or a geopolitical strategist mr agresto shows that america has misunderstood iraq in a vast and tragic way our good intentions have run up against hard reality it has been a painful experience and mr agresto conveys it vividly with a tone of anger and regret mr malkasian directs the center on stability and development at the center for naval analyses based in alexandria va in and he served as an adviser on counterinsurgency to the i marine expeditionary force
