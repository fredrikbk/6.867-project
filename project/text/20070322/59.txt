industry splits over power play major utilities are divided over illinois effort to roll back rates many states moved to deregulate their power markets a decade ago in the hopes that competition would lead to greater efficiency and lower power bills but with electricity bills now surging an increasing number of those states are considering legislation that would reverse many elements of deregulation as a brewing fight in illinois shows that has created divisions among utilities on how to respond worried that the existing deregulated market wont deliver affordable prices to consumers illinois lawmakers are advancing legislation to roll back electricity rates and possibly set new controls a backlash against deregulation gained momentum in springfield the illinois capital after the state attorney general last week asserted that electricity generators manipulated the states wholesale energy auction contributing to a run up in prices that have raised retail rates by to this year state utility regulators found prices were mixed over the past decade when adjusted for inflation a new auction process introduced in september was supposed to hold the line on prices the names of those accused were redacted from public versions of the attorney generals complaint but the states two major utilities both of which have large unregulated generation companies exelon corp of chicago and ameren corp of st louis are facing an outcry they dispute the findings ameren the second biggest utility company by customers operating in illinois said this week it is willing to discuss a return to traditional rate regulation a decade after the illinois legislature passed its landmark deregulation law that law froze electricity prices during a year transition period but let utilities transfer their generating plants to affiliated companies or sell them to unrelated firms today generation owners are free to charge market prices for the bulk power they sell to illinois utilities and others amerens receptivity to greater regulation creates a rift with exelon the states biggest utility company which owns chicago utility commonwealth edison and the nations largest fleet of unregulated power plants exelon chief executive john rowe said that even though "open markets are on the defensive now " that doesnt mean producers like exelon should be expected to cede their ability to charge market based prices people are angry that rates have risen after so long a freeze mr rowe said but "thats the deal they struck in " mr rowe said he is willing to talk about a number of market changes including creating a new power procurement method but he opposes retail rate rollbacks that he says could push utilities into insolvency because they wouldnt collect enough money from customers to cover their electricity procurement costs ameren chief executive scott cisel warned that utility layoffs could follow rate rollbacks a similar situation pushed pg&amp e corp s california utility into bankruptcy protection in in general federal regulators have taken a dim view of efforts that block utilities from being reimbursed for costs they cant avoid the ruckus in illinois stems in part from consumers anger over the fact that rates increases took effect during an unusually cold winter and swept away special discounts that gave some consumers unusually low prices hardest hit were customers who heat their homes with space heaters a group of heavy users that make up roughly of customers at amerens biggest utility unit illinois power for these customers rates quadrupled to cents a kilowatt hour from cents a kilowatt hour before taxes and other costs were added the old rates were a relic of a time when the utilities had excess capacity and were trying to drum up new customers to shift to electric heat from propane or heating oil at commonwealth edison customers had the option of limiting price increases to for each of the next three years and paying off a deferred balance in future years only a minority have chosen that option rate increases typically are much lower for commonwealth edison customers whose rates already were higher than for ameren customers illinois attorney general lisa madigan said in a complaint filed at the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc late last week that generators practiced illegal "market allocation" when they bid resources into a state run auction in september and now are furnishing power to utilities at prices that are double or triple their underlying costs the generation market is concentrated in too few hands she said which gives the generators inordinate leverage exelons mr rowe said he believes "that we and the other bidders are clean" and will be exonerated by ferc meanwhile the legislature forged ahead on bills that would roll back rates to the level and freeze them a bill by democrat george scully jr chairman of the states house electric utility oversight committee passed a bill out of the illinois house on a to vote that would reduce rates and then freeze them for three years the state senates democratic leadership has opposed a rate freeze but a senate energy committee passed a bill out of committee by unanimous vote on march which would roll rates back for six months behind the attorney generals allegations the cheapest power producers are able to collect the same prices charged by producers relying on more costly sources of electricity under the auction suppliers agreed to furnish power to exelons chicago utility and amerens three electric utilities operating in central and southern illinois collectively they serve of state residents although the auction included bidders and emerged as winners of the power being furnished to small customers of commonwealth edison comes from exelons large fleet of nuclear plants which are among the lowest cost producers of electricity in the nation winning prices in the auction ranged from &# to &# a megawatt hour with big users paying the highest prices thats far above the cost to make electricity at existing coal or nuclear units and it is significantly higher than prices quoted on the bilateral market in which transactions between generators and industrial users take place the attorney general is asking ferc to cancel the auction results order refunds and force generators to sell electricity at prices tied to production costs the illinois commerce commission is exploring changes in rate designs to ease rate shocks as well as revisions to auction rules for the next round in spring mr rowe said the auction prices were based on complex calculations that took into account the cost of building new generating plants and the cost of fuels like coal and natural gas and future electricity prices see related letter
