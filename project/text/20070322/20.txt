chips security capabilities expand a global battle against computer attacks is gaining potent new weapons chips that offer built in protections against malicious activity intel corp advanced micro devices inc and others have been racing to add security enhancements to popular chips for personal computers and server systems when the chips are exploited by programmers hardware and software can work together in new ways against computer viruses and other problems that cost businesses billions of dollars annually in another development a start up called secure software corp is utilizing security features in intels itanium chips with new software for managing internet directories known by the abbreviation dns for domain name systems the &# product expected to run initially on hewlett packard co computers appears to completely block some of the most troublesome attacks say experts who have tested the product "nobody can get into this box " says daniel massey an assistant computer science professor at colorado state university who has been running the secure software for more than a year and has encouraged students to attack it itanium a chip line developed with help from h p is used mainly for high end servers few know its strengths better than secure a greenwood colo company whose chief technology officer is william worley a former h p chief scientist who helped develop the itanium design secure developed a specialized operating system as well as the dns software the combination can among other things operate at unusually high speed despite "denial of service" attacks in which a flood of network traffic from hijacked computers is sent to overwhelm servers says extremelabs inc an indianapolis based company that tested the technology for secure such attacks can clog a companys data network with so many messages that a server cant send or receive information notes tom henderson extremelabs managing director with the new protection however the attacks become less fruitful because attackers cant use the technique to break into the server he adds chips have an obvious advantage over security software alone they cant easily be modified by unscrupulous programmers such hardware based approaches have long been favored by intelligence agencies and others with extremely sensitive information the concept has been slower to take off in personal computers or the most widely used servers for one thing privacy advocates worry that built in features could include identifiers that make it harder to use computers anonymously businesses though tend to be eager for advancements that lower the costs of guarding networks against attacks "the hardware changes are going to be a huge benefit to security " predicts william arbaugh a national security agency veteran and university of maryland assistant computer science professor who is president of security start up komoku inc one technique backed by an organization called the trusted computing group uses a chip to store passwords and other digital identifiers the chip can help create a kind of digital fingerprint for a program unauthorized modifications are easy to spot by comparing the software to that original data pattern the chip called the trusted platform module or tpm now comes with many pcs microsoft corp s new vista operating system has a feature called bitlocker which uses the tpm to protect system files and prevent tampering with a computer while it is offline intel meanwhile last week discussed plans to exploit the tpm along with new security modifications to its own chips in the second half of this year the features will become part of vpro a collection of technologies for corporate pcs rival amd has already built a security feature into its microprocessors called enhanced virus protection the technology works with microsoft software to limit a type of attack known as a buffer overflow which is used in many viruses and other malicious programs buffer overflow attacks dropped about in although improved software rather than chips may have been the primary reason says alfred huger a vice president of engineering at the security response center of symantec corp which specializes in the field amd which also plans to make use of the tpm is blazing its own path with an effort called torrenza to help companies add specialized chips to pcs tarari inc a san diego start up plans to use torrenza to help popularize security chips that compare data arriving at a company with the digital profile of known viruses spam messages or other problems a helping hand from hardware examples of chips that are being enhanced to help improve computer security microprocessors intels itanium has features called hardware protection keys that safeguard portions of a computers memory from unauthorized software code microcontrollers a chip called the trusted platform module safeguards passwords and other digital identifiers which can help ensure software has not been modified flash memory intel has added instructions to these chips which store basic housekeeping software for pcs to help watch for data traffic that indicates a virus or other problems accelerators these custom chips can be used to speed up a particular security process such as comparing incoming data to patterns that indicate a virus or spam message
