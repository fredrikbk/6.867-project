the microbial threat for a physician there is nothing more heartbreaking and frustrating than being unable to save a patients life sadly with the explosion of life threatening antibiotic resistant "superbugs" and the simultaneous lack of new antibiotics to treat those bugs this is becoming an increasingly common reality during the christmas holidays i treated a gregarious student in his s who came to our facility to be treated for a blood condition called aplastic anemia he sailed through his stem cell transplant but soon developed severe pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa a highly resistant bug although originally sensitive to a powerful antibiotic the bug quickly developed resistance to it and there were no safe and effective options desperate to treat the progressing pneumonia we gave the patient an older antibiotic rarely used because there are safer and more effective options but which was the only option we could find that appeared to work unfortunately the drug did not work and the young man died of pneumonia and meningitis due to this highly resistant bug earlier this month i treated a middle age woman with a large extended family who while recovering from successful chest surgery developed a gallbladder infection caused by a bug called vancomycin resistant enterococcus vre a decade ago i would have treated her with one of several antibiotics such as ampicillin or vancomycin and she would most likely have recovered but over the years this bug has become increasingly resistant to treatment today only three antibiotics are typically effective against it and one was too toxic for her bone marrow one had an incompatible safety profile for this patient while the third failed to eradicate the infection we had no other options for treatment and she died of vre sepsis both of these people died not of the conditions that sent them to the hospital but of secondary infections caused by antibiotic resistant "superbugs " despite intensive efforts to prevent infections these frightening stories are becoming increasingly common and unfortunately there are perilously few antibiotics currently being tested that are likely to extricate us from the danger unless we develop more incentives for drug development we will soon return to the pre antibiotic era when acquiring a bacterial infection was often a death sentence in the coming weeks congress has a momentous opportunity as it reauthorizes the prescription drug user fee act pdufa to address this public health crisis and increase the number of new antibiotics in the research and development pipeline the looming antibiotic crisis is laid out in a report "bad bugs no drugs" published by the infectious diseases society of america idsa congress must not miss this chance to provide solutions do i sound alarmist consider antibiotic resistant bacterial infections kill tens of thousands of americans every year and can strike anyone young or old healthy or chronically ill annually nearly two million u s patients acquire infections in the hospital and nearly one in of these infected patients die more than of those infections are resistant to at least one of the drugs used to treat them in the last decade antibiotic resistant bacteria have become a serious problem outside of the hospital including among our soldiers returning from iraq and the number of infections caused by these bugs has skyrocketed among healthy people the media regularly report horrifying stories of otherwise healthy children and adults felled by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and of u s soldiers infected with acinetobacter baumanni during the last two decades the number of antibiotics approved by the fda has steadily dropped while were approved between and only four were approved between and and only one of those was truly novel of the more than drugs in research and development in only five were antibiotics last fall the fda rejected two new antibiotics sponsored by oscient pharmaceuticals and replidyne inc in the final stage of the approval process it appears that fda has changed the types of clinical trials it will accept to show safety and efficacy for certain infections although the fdas change in standards may be appropriate assuring that our medications are safe and highly effective is after all one of fdas major responsibilities the agency has not publicly communicated what those new standards are leaving pharmaceutical companies unsure oscient and replidyne had invested considerable time and resources in trials that they believed would be in compliance with fda requirements due to the ongoing regulatory uncertainty forrest laboratories replidynes commercialization partner has terminated their collaboration guidance from fda would be a key means to remove the chilling uncertainty faced by industry bacteria can grow quickly in order to survive these bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics our best hope is to keep pace by developing a steady stream of new antibiotics and to implement new strategies to limit and control antibiotic resistance by and large pharmaceutical companies are abandoning antibiotic research and development in favor of more profitable drugs that treat chronic conditions in the current environment thats understandable the development of any new drug is expensive risky and time consuming but antibiotic approval includes significant additional challenges unlike drugs for chronic lifetime conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes antibiotics are only taken for short courses typically no more than two weeks because bacteria develop resistance and drugs become less effective demand decreases over time further in an effort to slow the development of resistance infectious diseases physicians have long campaigned against the inappropriate use of antibiotics for instance antibiotics treat bacterial infections and should not be used to treat colds which are caused by viruses this is an important and appropriate public health platform but it also results in limiting antibiotic usage and sales admittedly the problem is even more complicated and multi faceted but addressing the lack of market incentives and regulatory uncertainty will go a long way toward correcting the problem as it reauthorizes pdufa congress has an important opportunity to begin to reverse the decline in antibiotic discovery and to strengthen the fdas leadership and response to antibacterial resistance pdufa provides a chance to expand existing incentives for so called orphan drugs and specifically target antibiotics orphan incentives should include more generous and numerous research grants and tax credits and the adoption of targeted patent extensions that prompt antibiotic research and development a task force on antimicrobial resistance should be created within the fda commissioners office to focus on preventing drug resistance and reducing barriers to new antibiotic development finally congress should remove the regulatory uncertainty overshadowing antibiotic research and development by requiring the fda to publish the long overdue clinical trials guidelines that the industry needs to move forward i strongly believe these approaches will go a long way toward averting this looming health crisis a compelling case in point is the surge of approved human immunodeficiency virus hiv medications during the last years the fda has approved approximately the same number of new antiviral medications that target hiv as it has antibiotics to treat all bacterial infections combined this suggests that pharmaceutical companies will invest in research and development of anti infective drugs as long as there is a financial motivation to do so with antibiotic research however market forces alone arent enough to fix the problem the lack of new antibiotics is a big problem that is getting worse our antibiotics need to be safe yes but without significant changes to clarify the drug approval process and incentives to encourage research and development safety will be a moot issue effective medications will cease to exist in the time it took to read this article many types of bacteria have already undergone multiple rounds of replication theyre on to us the question is are we committed to being on to them dr masur is president of the
