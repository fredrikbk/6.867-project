proposed barclays abn amro merger poses three way oversight scramble u s netherlands u k weigh broad holdings continuing legal action bank regulators in the u s britain and the netherlands will need to determine who would oversee a combined abn amro holding nv and barclays plc the issue is particularly sensitive because abn amro has faced investigations in the u s over transferring money into the u s for iran and libya including a new legal complaint from former employees alleging that top management was more involved in the transactions than the bank has said u s law enforcement officials have an ongoing money laundering probe of abn according to a person familiar with the situation authorities in the netherlands britain and the u s all are expected to have a say in determining who regulates the combined bank people familiar with the situation say among their reasons the bank would have a head office in amsterdam its stock is traded in london and it would have extensive operations in the u s an inability to reach a common ground could slow signing the prospective &# billion deal opening the door for other bidders only one regulator can oversee the entire bank though other regulators would monitor its operations in their home countries barclays and abn amro have proposed that the dutch regulator oversee them people familiar with the matter say both banks are in discussions with the regulators they say regulators of the combined institution would have to monitor a difficult issue money transfers from iran and libya in abn amro agreed to pay &# million to u s bank regulators to settle charges that it improperly disguised billions of dollars in transfers through new york for iran and libya in order to avoid u s regulatory scrutiny the u s has sanctions forbidding business with both countries the bank admitted weak controls but denied any intentional wrongdoing by top management the issue is outstanding because a page civil lawsuit filed in new york state supreme court in january by five former abn amro employees alleges that the banks top management was more deeply involved in the iran libya transactions than the bank told u s regulators or has stated publicly the five employees who allege that they were made scapegoats in the affair and fired in are seeking some &# million in damages abn amro chief executive rijkman groenink is among the named defendants abn amro hasnt yet filed a response to the suit court records state a spokesman for the bank said that abn amro "vigorously denies" the allegations by its former employees "the claims are without merit given that litigation is continuing we cannot comment any further " he said if the regulatory question slows the deal that leaves time for others to assemble their own bids for abn amro one possible curveball the potential for a rare counterbid by a consortium where banks such as bank of america corp spains banco santander central hispano sa and dutch belgian bank and insurance company fortis nv join together to buy and then split up abn amro sole bidders could enter too including citigroup inc and royal bank of scotland group plc spokespeople for the banks declined to comment a santander spokesman referred to chairman emilio botins comments in february that santander doesnt have large acquisitions in sight regulator shopping is becoming a critical issue as more industries consolidate and operate globally the dutch have a reputation for relatively less stringent regulation and they havent really needed it because there are only three big banks in the country abn amro rabobank and ing group barclays said this week that it and abn amro have begun discussions with the british dutch and "other relevant regulators" about whether the dutch would act as lead regulator a spokesman for the dutch bank regulator said it is monitoring the situation behind the idea of establishing a single regulator is a european union directive that consolidated oversight over a financial institutions operations britains financial services authority is unlikely to drop oversight over one of the countrys largest lenders despite the requests of the two companies people familiar with the matter say a spokesman for the fsa said the agency has requested details about the proposed transaction including the legal and management structure in a statement it said that the fsa "remains in close contact with the dutch central bank " there are also tax implications for the governments that would oversee a combined bank in the u s barclays is using sullivan &amp cromwell lawyer rodgin cohen considered one of the top u s bank lawyers for counsel mr cohen declined to comment a spokeswoman for the federal reserve also declined to comment "i dont blame the fed and fsa for wanting to maintain some oversight " said jonathan winer a former u s state department money laundering expert and lawyer at alston &amp bird in washington "you should never forget iran in particular because other countries dont have sanctions on iran " indeed apart from possible financial exposure the pending lawsuit against abn amro in new york could cause problems for abn amro and any bank that buys it because of the intense political sensitivity regarding european banks dealings with iran beginning around the suit alleges top abn amro management created a program to secretly process huge volumes of u s dollar denominated transactions for libya and iran through the banks branch in dubai united arab emirates the funds were processed through the banks new york office subjecting them to u s sanctions laws the practice involved mislabeling the origin or destination of the funds to hide any reference to iran or libya which were on a u s list of countries accused of supporting terrorism
