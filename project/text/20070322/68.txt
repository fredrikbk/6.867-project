lending oversight regulators scrutinized in mortgage meltdown states federal agencies clashed on subprimes as market ballooned the well publicized woes in the business of subprime mortgages a surge in foreclosures turmoil in the stock market are raising a big question are regulators partly to blame federal regulators over the past decade issued rules to tighten standards for making loans to borrowers with blemished credit or low incomes yet standards still declined and the volume of loans surged in the past two years one reason changes in the lending business and financial markets have moved large swaths of subprime lending from traditional banks to companies outside the jurisdiction of federal banking regulators in of subprime mortgages were originated by companies with no federal supervision primarily mortgage brokers and stand alone finance companies another were made by finance companies that are units of bank holding companies and thus indirectly supervised by the federal reserve and by regulated banks and thrifts "what is really frustrating about this is federal regulators dont have enforcement authority to do anything with these state licensed stand alone mortgage lenders " says fed reserve governor susan bies yet even where federal regulators have jurisdiction they sometimes have been slow to grapple with the explosive growth in especially risky practices and quick to shield federally regulated banks from states and private litigants the underlying belief shared by the bush administration is that too much regulation would stifle credit for low income families and that capital markets and well educated consumers are the best way to curb unscrupulous lending the industry argues the system is working "market discipline in this industry is swift can be severe and is more effective in changing lending practices than any potential changes in regulation " says doug duncan chief economist at the mortgage bankers association the rate of new foreclosures on subprime loans hit a three year high late last year but is well below levels of the recession and the vast majority of subprime borrowers are paying on time consumer advocates counter that families have been losing their homes and savings to excessively burdensome loans for years "only when the market experienced losses and lenders started to shut their doors did real attention start to be paid to the issue " says allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy at the consumer federation of america "perhaps we all should have done something earlier and faster " says sheila bair who became chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp last june "early on regulators didnt see extensive consumer complaints and credit distress " she adds noting that rising home prices masked some of the problems "regulators tend to devote their finite resources to where they see current pronounced problems " regulators record will face scrutiny at a senate hearing today and a house hearing next week "it has taken far too long for the regulators to act " senate banking committee chairman chris dodd a connecticut democrat said in a letter to regulators there is widespread agreement that the biggest shortcoming in the regulation of mortgages is the patchwork of state and federal oversight amid rapid evolution in industry practice the system leaves many market segments barely supervised and some supervised by multiple regulators lenders that arent federally regulated are generally state licensed but many state regulators lack the resources and mandates of their federal counterparts some of the biggest subprime blowups have happened in california the home state regulator the california department of corporations has examiners to oversee more than state licensed lenders including many of the countrys largest subprime companies by comparison san francisco based wells fargo &amp co alone has examiners from the federal office of the comptroller of the currency and the equivalent of fed examiners assigned to it federal regulators meanwhile have tended to focus more on the solvency of the institutions they oversee and less on individual consumer complaints the case of dorothy smith a year old from east st louis ill illustrates how hard it was for individuals to get regulators help in ms smith living on &# a month in government benefits was encouraged by a contractor to apply for a loan to finance home repairs after two loan applications were rejected a broker submitted a third showing that she had monthly income of &# and was employed at a senior citizens home though she had actually retired years before she said the &# mortgage that first union national bank now part of wachovia corp approved for her required a monthly payment of &# for years followed by a "balloon" payment when she would be over of &# fees and closing costs came to &# when the contractor left work unfinished ms smith sought help from land of lincoln legal assistance foundation which complained to illinois bank regulators the legal aid lawyers say the loan required unreasonably high payments given ms smiths income and a balloon payment when she would be over years old the state forwarded her complaint to the occ first unions regulator which responded in "we cannot intercede in a private party situation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of her contract the occ can provide no further assistance " ms smith sued first union in a st clair county ill court for among other things extending credit beyond her ability to pay last year the bank settled without admitting any violations forgiving her remaining loan balance and paying her &# "it is extremely rare for individual matters to get relief from either the state or the federal regulators " says diane thompson her attorney a wachovia spokeswoman declined to comment on the settlement but noted the bank has very little subprime business until the s most homeowners got fixed rate mortgages from banks and thrifts which financed those loans with low cost federally insured deposits those lenders were watched over by several federal regulators whose principal duty was to protect the deposit insurance fund from reckless lending the occ regulated nationally chartered banks whats now the office of thrift supervision regulated savings and loans or thrifts the federal reserve regulated bank holding companies and along with the fdic and state regulators state chartered banks the mortgage business changed in the s with the spread of "securitization " in which wall street firms take loans off a lenders books and package them as securities for sale to investors initially conventional loans dominated securitization because that was the type that mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac preferred to buy and securitize in recent years low interest rates world wide have increased investors appetite for riskier investments and even exotic and risky subprime mortgages are now routinely securitized securitization weakened the link between the lender and the borrower lenders relying on third parties frequently had less interaction with the customer and they also bore less of the risk of default to the extent that they sold off their loans to the capital markets the door swung open to a panoply of new lenders beyond the conventional banks and thrifts countrywide financial corp which originates mortgages both through brokers and its own storefronts became the largest home mortgage lender in the country others were units of larger companies such as general electric co and h&amp r block irvine calif based new century financial corp founded in was the second largest subprime lender by the end of and originated most of its loans though independent brokers californias last examination of new centurys activities in that state in august found no violation of state laws says andrew roth a spokesman for the california department of corporations last month new century said rising defaults would result in a fourth quarter loss and that it would restate results for the previous three quarters in the following weeks wall street firms cut off the companys credit last friday the state ordered new century to cease making loans in california a week after the company itself said it would stop accepting loan applications new century declined to comment state regulators defend their record noting they secured multimillion dollar settlements in january with ameriquest mortgage co a unit of acc capital holdings corp and in october with household international inc which hsbc holdings acquired in they also say federal regulators fostered an environment in which wall street and other secondary market players were permitted to fund loans made without regard for a borrowers ability to repay both ots and occ said banks they regulate dont have to comply with state lending laws which were frequently tougher on lending standards than federal statutes a policy called "pre emption " "the occs pre emption policy really neutered the states ability to really aggressively address predatory lending issues " says john ryan executive vice president of the conference of state bank supervisors in georgia passed one of the countrys toughest antipredatory lending laws among other things it would have made not just the originator of a loan liable for abusive practices but any investor who purchased the loan in the secondary market numerous lenders threatened to stop doing business in georgia shortly afterward both the ots and the occ said that georgias law didnt apply to their regulated institutions the state later weakened the laws most contentious provisions the otss current director john reich says "we will see to it that the institutions that we supervise abide by the consumer protection laws and regulations " in april eliot spitzer then new yorks attorney general asked j p morgan chase &amp co wells fargo &amp co and other nationally chartered banks to provide him with information about minority borrowers to see if they were charged unfair interest rates the banking industry and the occ successfully blocked mr spitzers move in court on the grounds that new york didnt have jurisdiction over these lenders public disciplinary actions by federal bank regulators are rare in the past two years the fdic has issued four cease and desist orders against subprime lenders that required the companies to change their practices the fed has issued just one and the ots none the fdic said the occ said it has sanctioned one subprime lender in that time federal regulators say they spot and correct problems quietly during the examination process before they reach the point where public enforcement action is needed regulators appointed by president bush often have been more sympathetic to industry concerns about red tape than their clinton administration predecessors when james gilleran a former california banker and bank supervisor took over the ots in december he became known for his deregulatory zeal at one press event in several bank regulators held gardening shears to represent their commitment to cut red tape for the industry mr gilleran brought a chain saw he also early on announced plans to slash expenses to resolve the agencys deficit of its work force eventually left when he left in mr gilleran declared that the ots had "exercised increased diligence in its review of abusive consumer practices" while reducing thrifts regulatory burden but his successor mr reich a former community banker has reversed many of mr gillerans cuts citing "understaffing " he hired examiners last year and plans to add more this year a spokeswoman for mr gilleran now chief executive of the federal home loan bank of seattle said he wasnt available to comment regulators note that in recent years not one of the banks they regulate has failed or come close to failing because of subprime lending occ head john dugan says "national banks tend to be more heavily regulated and their underwriting standards tend to be more conservative its not surprising to me that these industry problems weve seen have been in these specialist lenders not federally regulated banks " they also aim for a balance between consumer protection and the benefits that even consumer advocates agree the growth of the subprime market brought to low income families "if you overregulate you wont get innovation " says the feds ms bies "a lot of the people who got subprime mortgages today would never have gotten those mortgages years ago " but when washington tightened laws often in the face of industry opposition the industry often evolved making the new rules less effective than contemplated in congress passed the home ownership and equity protection act or hoepa which imposes strict requirements on loans defined as "high cost " generally those that charge more than percentage points above the comparable treasury security in the fed which interprets the law even though it applies to lenders who arent regulated by the federal government proposed tightening the rules to cover more loans and exclude more practices the national consumer law center drew attention to the growth of "teaser" loans that after a low introductory rate lasting two or three years jump to a higher rate it cited the example of loans recently securitized by new century whose average loan rate would jump from to after a few years the fed it said should require lenders to base loan approvals on the borrowers ability to pay the maximum rate not the teaser rate effective in the fed lowered hoepas trigger point to eight from percentage points above treasury rates and among other things required lenders to ensure that consumers could pay the highest rate on an adjustable rate hoepa loan in response many lenders altered their underwriting criteria to avoid having any of their loans fall under the revamped law new century said in a securities filing in it does not make hoepa loans because of "the higher legal risks as well as the potential negative perception " the new hoepa criteria it said "may prevent us from making a small number of loans " but that year new centurys mortgage volume almost doubled to &# billion from &# billion in "the industry came up with a way of avoiding hoepa while maintaining high costs " says margo saunders an attorney who has worked with the national consumer law center she says there are almost no hoepa loans being written nowadays new century has previously said it implements policies to avoid predatory lending only approves subprime loan applications that "evidence a borrowers ability to repay" and considers whether "loan terms are in the borrowers best interests " last fall federal bank regulators at the urging of consumer groups and after extensive debate proposed standards on "nontraditional mortgages" that they thought would compel banks to make "teaser" loans only to consumers who could pay the highest interest ms bies was surprised to learn that banks didnt agree under pressure from congress regulators proposed new guidance this month however with the subprime market already imploding some bankers and regulators worry the new guidance could boost defaults by making it harder for strapped borrowers to refinance recent events have prompted regulators to join the industry and some legislators in calling for national laws to oversee the mortgage market "congress needs to seriously consider a national antipredatory lending law that would apply to all mortgage lenders " said ms bair ms bies shares that view but also warns enforcement powers are needed "if a federal statute is put out there with little inspection its only going to fall on the regulated entities at the unregulated entities where theres a problem there will be little enforcement "
