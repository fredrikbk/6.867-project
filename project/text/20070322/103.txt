the evening wrap safety in numbers online edition youtube has been eating the lunch of traditional media companies ever since it popped onto the scene but today some media titans bit back and their counterattack doesnt involve sending subpoenas to silicon valley general electrics nbc universal and news corp announced today that they plan to launch a video sharing platform to compete with the immensely popular youtube which was snapped up by google last year amid its rapid climb from obscurity teaming up would seem to make strategic sense for the media giants given that duking it out mano a mano with youtube hasnt gone all that well for any of them viacom which isnt a part of the deal became so frustrated trying to negotiate some kind of revenue sharing with youtube that it decided to file a &# billion copyright infringement lawsuit against the company instead other networks have achieved some measure of peace with google mostly by swallowing their objections that the internet sensation is enriching itself at the expense of their intellectual property and deciding to settle for whatever scraps they can get unfortunately letting a rival no matter how formidable flip you upside down to shake the change out of your pockets and then taking back your pocket lint once youre upright again isnt a sustainable business model and media companies knew they needed to compete more forcefully nbc and news corp aim to gain the upper hand against youtube in part by setting up a video sharing site where the companies will offer clips and full episodes of hit television shows like "my name is earl" and "" as well as films like "borat" and "little miss sunshine " but they also hope that through a broad distribution network that will spread their content more widely around the internet the venture which doesnt have a name yet will distribute videos by way of a special video player via top portals like aol microsofts msn yahoo and myspace analysts deemed that part of the ventures strategy as critical james mcquivey a media and technology analyst at forrester research told dow jones newswires that to succeed "a media owned site has to share and share alike with as many distribution partners as it can " youtube puts video in front of an enormous number of eyeballs and indeed it would be very difficult for any site to dive in and compete with youtube on equal footing right away what remains to be seen is whether traditional big media rivals can play nicely in the same sandbox a number of media companies were exploring a joint venture to rival youtube for some time but the negotiations inevitably faltered as networks clashed over what shape the business should take the new venture also is notable for the media companies that arent participating viacom of course isnt in the picture and neither is walt disney those companies could decide to set up ventures of their own or maybe join up forces in a similar way in a development that would certainly spice up the competitive broth some analysts meanwhile are far from convinced that the thing will get off the ground "the plan is cumbersome and complex making it unlikely to work " bloggers at wall street wrote others think it will deliver but blogger paul kedrosky wonders whether consumers will care or even know the difference between the new network and youtube "there is room for both of course and both were inevitable " he wrote "the only surprise is that it took so long " oil surge limits stocks crude oil prices surged by today to &# and that helped to keep a lid on stocks one day after markets
