maine chance the u s and canada enjoy a recent history of interdependence in the natural gas markets it would not be to canadas credit if its newfound and contrived energy protectionism disrupted this relationship we refer to an emerging trade dispute involving maine and the canadian province of new brunswick maine is looking to install two liquefied natural gas lng import terminals on passamaquoddy bay an inlet of the bay of fundy whose western shore is u s soil the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is expected to approve the proposals by the fall but last month canadas ambassador to the u s michael wilson intervened in a formal letter of disapproval to ferc he raised environmental safety and navigational concerns about the lng tankers that would enter passamaquoddy through the canadian territorial waters of head harbor passage he added that canada is "prepared to use domestic legal means" to "prevent such passage from occurring " what this kind of swashbuckling might mean in practice is an open question ottawa argues it can prohibit entry under the u n convention on the law of the sea but vessels of any flag are granted by international law the right of "innocent passage " which seems to apply here put another way canadas protests dont hold water the navigational hazards of the head harbor passage can be overcome with safety measures like tugboats and trained pilots besides canada has no objections to regular shipments of dynamite and ammonium nitrate some tons per year through the same channel to a quarry on the canadian side of the quoddy without the same precautions while not without risk lng transportation and storage are subject to stringent ferc and coast guard regulations in years of shipping there has never been a major lng incident most likely canadas belligerence is trade protectionism under another guise new brunswick is positioning itself as an energy distribution hub a major import facility canaport lng a joint venture between irving oil and repsol is set to open in at saint john some miles up the coast from quoddy bay the project will hook into the maritimes &amp northeast pipeline which now gets most of its gas from fields offshore nova scotia and runs down through atlantic canada into massachusetts the maine lng terminals would also link with the same pipeline all parties to this dispute are competing to supply the northeastern u s unlike global oil natural gas markets are regional limited by pipeline infrastructure by pressuring ferc into suspending its regulatory review or else tying up the u s projects for years in a u n court or nafta arbitration panel canada would preserve supply and pricing advantages for its own companies theres not much sense in such a short sighted maneuver particularly since the maritimes &amp northeast pipeline is currently running below capacity and the productivity of canadian natural gas wells continues to drop the u s meanwhile has an enormous appetite for natural gas particularly in the northeast and supply has not kept up leading to unstable and spiking prices lng is expected to supply of global gas by if not more building more import terminals in either the u s or canada will aid in mitigating american shortfalls natural gas from canada accounted for of total u s imports in evidence of an increasingly integrated and mutually beneficial north american energy market but certainly canada cant expect or demand a market without competition see related letter "letters to the editor why canada opposes two u s lng plants" wsj april
