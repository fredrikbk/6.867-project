state spending spree the democrats on capitol hill are promising a new ethic of fiscal responsibility as the party desperately tries to shed its tax and spend label of recent decades but if spending restraint and balanced budgets are the new democratic rallying cry someone forgot to alert the governors after the november elections democrats now control governorships and a majority of state legislatures but they are celebrating their return to power by spending tax dollars like every day is christmas some republican governors including arnold schwarzenegger of california and jodi rell of connecticut are also joining in the fun last year states cashed in on the boom times by hiking expenditures by almost according to the national association of state budget officers or three times the

with &# billion in new taxes and &# billion in new debt what the chicago sun times calls "the largest tax increase and biggest borrowing spree in state history " mr blagojevich intends to reward nearly every democratic special interest group that helped elect him the teachers unions the school budget would rise by a whopping in one year public transit employees health care providers and the poverty industry he calls his fiscal time bomb of debt and taxes "a moral imperative " almost all the new costs of the social welfare pyramids he wants to fund would fall on businesses which are likely to feel their own "moral imperative" to flee if the legislature in springfield is foolhardy enough to pass this plan jennifer granholm the democratic governor of another declining midwestern industrial state is also seeking a &# billion plus tax business tax increase to fund what shes calling her "invest in michigan" budget the state with more last jobs than any except hurricane ravaged

that has been adopted by her and fellow spendthrift governors by stating "these are good times these are exciting times " yes but the "good" and "exciting times" dont last forever four years ago states hit the bottom of a revenue drought and were forced to make tortuous spending cuts while hiking fees and taxes "states that are the most gluttonous spenders during the fat years invariably have to make the deepest cuts during the downturns " says economist arthur laffer who is advising several states to cut taxes this year this years fad "investments" teachers pay raises expanded medicaid
