recognizing the face of fraud video tool hyped for antiterrorism may help curb bogus checks banks are starting to apply a high tech solution to the low tech crime of passing bad checks video face recognition systems to help catch the scamsters face recognition technology has generally produced disappointing results in other applications despite previous hype but people who have looked at systems tailored for banks say there is potential for them to be effective against check fraud brian ishikawa vice president of corporate security for bank of hawaii in honolulu says that when he first heard about the face recognition system developed by vr security inc a closely held san francisco video security firm "it seemed too good to be true " but since being installed at bank branches in december it has "reduced our surveillance time " and "its especially useful in tracking multiple transactions by an id thief " he says mr ishikawa declined to say whether the system has caught any fraudsters yet "as a pure technology face recognition has been overhyped " says gavin long who follows the security industry for usbx advisory services an investment bank in mclean va however he adds the bank application "creates a context where the application makes sense " the vr system is part of an emerging type of security technology that combines video surveillance with computer databases of transactions to automate the viewing of security cameras international business machines corp for instance plans to unveil next week a new video system for retailers and governments that it says can spot suspicious behavior and tie it to shoplifting or casing a facility ibm says its technology which includes both face and license plate recognition is being investigated by banks too another small company bringing face recognition to bank frauds is dragnet solutions inc burlingame calif check fraud victimizes more customers than internet fraud and bank robberies combined last year banks reported cases of check fraud to the treasury department up from the year before many more cases were likely missed those who pass bad checks tend to be repeat offenders which is where the vr system kicks in vrs system takes advantage of the digital video recorders that many banks have installed to replace older video tape systems when a customer reports that someone cashed a bad check on his or her account the vr system can use the information about the teller station and time that the check was cashed to retrieve digital pictures of the check casher at the teller window then it automatically searches video from the branch at that time to get additional pictures of the person in case another camera got a better likeness the next time the fraudster shows up at a teller window a video camera captures his or her likeness the system matches it to the likeness captured from the earlier incident and sends the previous image to the tellers video screen if the teller believes the picture from the previous incident matches the customer security guards are notified the system can also compare the picture of the bad check passer to every other person who cashed checks in person at the bank if it finds other instances of the same suspect passing a check it can determine the time and account involved and notify either security or a bank manager to contact the other customers involved to see whether they had authorized such checks "its usually not a one time thing they have several different victims in several different accounts " says mike shepard vice president of security for metropolitan national bank in little rock ark "unfortunately the courts dont hit them as hard as they do violent offenders some of them do more check fraud to pay their costs while theyre on probation " "its an unbelievable program " says mr shepard who has seen demonstrations of the vr system says his bank plans to test it in a few branches and is aiming to deploy it throughout its branch network tim ross executive vice president of vr says his company has signed up one "top five" bank he declined to name and is "piloting or evaluating" many other banks face recognition technology got a lot of attention after the terrorist attacks of as system vendors urged the government to install systems in airports to watch for known terrorists but tests were disappointing because the systems usually couldnt match pictures in their databases with real life images of people moving along in crowds "the problem is its wildly dependent on lighting conditions and whether the person is wearing a beard or a hat says mike redding director of development for accenture ltd s technology labs mr redding says that other biometrics such as fingerprint readers work better to allow banks to verify a persons identity but he says face recognition techniques can narrow down to a few people the most likely suspects among thousands of pictures criminals have devised a number of ways to manipulate the bank system into issuing them cash when they pass bad checks sometimes criminals can get checks for a real depositors account by claiming to have moved and asking the bank to mail them new checks then they can write checks to themselves and ask the teller to cash them the real depositor may not realize the money is missing until the bank statement arrives at the end of the month ibm says its technology in retail stores can prevent a common fraud of fake returns stephen russo director of security and privacy technology in ibms global services group says that someone may buy a product in a store and then come back the next day with the receipt pick the identical product off the shelf and then walk to the returns department and demand a refund using the face recognition system a returns clerk can call up a picture of the person entering the store to see whether they were carrying the item
