stockman may take another hit collins &amp aikman ex ceo could face federal charges after bankruptcy fallout federal prosecutors are poised to file criminal charges against david stockman the former reagan white house budget director turned deal maker stemming from his tenure running a big auto parts maker people familiar with the situation said mr stockman was one of the earliest private equity players to set his sights on profiting from the restructuring of the u s auto industry though he lost millions of dollars in his detroit foray in an interview yesterday mr stockman said he will "vigorously fight" any federal criminal charges filed against him related to his leadership of auto supplier collins &amp aikman which he left shortly before it filed for chapter bankruptcy protection mr stockman is expected to be indicted within days in the southern district of new york on federal charges of improper accounting bank fraud and misleading investors people familiar with the case said prosecutors accuse mr stockman and other company officials of improperly accounting for rebate transactions with vendors and misleading investors about the companys cash situation in a conference call two months before its may bankruptcy filing these people said other charges likely would be tied to how collins &amp aikman accounted for transactions with a company it had purchased and an accounts receivable line on tooling it had with general electric co s ge capital the expected charges were reported earlier by the washington post mr stockman said any charges would amount to "a crimeless prosecution " he called the prospect of charges an example of how the sarbanes oxley corporate governance law encouraged the "flyspecking of every word in a ceos earnings call in the midst of an auto industry meltdown where every investor knew there was high risk " attorneys for mr stockman also will argue that an indictment is an example of sarbanes oxley "running wild " because collins &amp aikman disclosed many of the disputed transactions underlying the charges after its own internal investigation said a person familiar with mr stockmans defense strategy "if this happens its a miscarriage of justice " mr stockman said "this was a self evident struggle for survival not some economic joyride like enron " mr stockman said he collected no salary as chief executive he added that he and his private equity fund which controlled collins &amp aikman "bought stock on trading days and sold none we werent lining our pockets and in fact took the biggest loss" when the supplier filed for bankruptcy mr stockman estimated he personally lost &# million when collins &amp aikman filed for chapter and said he lost millions more covering company expenses the securities and exchange commission also is expected to issue civil charges against mr stockman and several other senior officers and lower level managers people familiar with the matter said neither the company nor mr stockmans fund are expected to be charged by the u s attorneys office or the sec which conducted a parallel investigation of the case a spokeswoman for the u s attorneys office declined to comment mr stockman came to wall street following his tenure as the youngest budget director in u s history the former two term michigan congressman made millions in the s as a founding member of blackstone partners which had success investing in the creation of auto supplier american axle &amp manufacturing holdings inc as head of heartland industrial partners an investment fund based in greenwich conn that he and several partners launched with &# billion in mr stockman cut a swath through detroits auto establishment rattling rivals and customers with sharp criticism of business practices there heartland acquired controlling interest of collins &amp aikman in february for about &# million and built it up through a series of heavily leveraged acquisitions in total heartland invested about &# million in the company nearly all of which has been wiped out by the bankruptcy heartland did receive &# million a year as an advisory fee plus of the value of acquisitions heartland continues to hold stakes in smaller auto suppliers and manufacturers mr stockman left the fund in mid but mr stockman may have made his move on detroit too soon heartland made big acquisitions in the early years of this decade when detroit and its suppliers were still relatively profitable only to have profits and sales volumes plunge during the past two years as gas prices rose and detroits big three stumbled moreover mr stockman angered key customers through several highly publicized speeches around detroit where he laid out his strategy and urged suppliers to push back against cost cutting demands from general motors corp and other auto makers one irony of mr stockmans situation is that while collins &amp aikman didnt have the power to hold its prices and protect profits a growing number of auto suppliers are gaining this power today the indictments are looming as collins &amp aikman southfield mich is being sold off in chunks with other parts liquidated symbolizing mr stockmans tumble from
