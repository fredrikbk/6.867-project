fashion journal wall street women dress code of silence workplace fashion revolution has yet to reach finance not ready for business casual in her corporate bio photo karen firestones dark blue akris suit is trim but not snug her dark sweater displays her collar bones but no decolletage she is the image of a successful woman in finance whose clothes venture neither too far nor too near ms firestone is one of the chief rainmakers for aureus asset management an independent boston money manager that is responsible for investing &# million of other peoples cash so when she steps out in public she knows that what she wears becomes the embodiment of her company "i feel that i have a responsibility to project the right image " ms firestone says in an age where the rules of professional dressing are constantly shifting and women have much more freedom than in decades past there is still one area where there are more unspoken rules than ever finance while their male counterparts may sport "business casual" khakis many women on wall street feel they must toe a careful and conservative line they often feel obliged to dress up in order to command authority these women still struggle not to be defined by traditionally feminine pastimes like dressing well the result they dont talk about fashion openly for fear of appearing frivolous ms firestone for instance was nervous about discussing her wardrobe because it might distract attention from her firms accomplishments several women in financial services flatly declined to discuss what they wear to work its worth noting though that all of the men i approached spoke eagerly about their wardrobes these women have leapt many hurdles the least of which is getting dressed in the morning but the old scripted uniform of dark suits and high collars isnt quite sufficient for handling todays wide range of clients in far flung locales on any given day of the week its tricky to adopt a varied wardrobe while still commanding the respect of hedge fund managers and major investors just try shopping for a power evening gown casual events often call for chinos and an izod for men but women who arrive in golf clothes are likely to strike the wrong note this came home for lisa tames a banker at citigroup in new york who favors practical looks from ellen tracy and ann taylor when she recently attended a conference the dress code was casual but a female colleague raised a few eyebrows by wearing slim green capri pants "it wasnt projecting her ability in her field " recalls ms tames who says she rarely dresses down it isnt clear to me that a guy in khakis looks any more accomplished than a woman in capri pants but i understand as ms tames did the unspoken rule that a woman in finance should be more dressed up than the men she works with especially when those men report to her such caution is understandable after all the fashion industry failed these women for decades remember the "ladies ties" of the s silk neck bows that were a feminine interpretation of the mens cravat in the s women in a range of fields were able to move beyond that ditching the awkward briefcases donning pants designers like elie tahari began offering suits that actually looked feminine yet professional and it went on first came the red suit then the pink one thanks to executive trendsetters like jill barrad former mattel chief executive whose career flourished then floundered on the barbie doll by the turn of the millennium some people began hopefully to speak of "girl power" but probably none of them worked on wall street on wall street its still baby steps as women like leslie rahl can attest ms rahl president of capital market risk advisors in new york ran the derivatives business for citibank for years in the s it was she and her colleagues who called in the sec when orange county calif was going under and she recalls the old standard mannish suit with a bow "many of my colleagues wore those stupid little womens ties " says ms rahl who says she never owned one today she says she has carved out a look that is careful and correct yet still feminine "its very important for women to be women and not little men " she says but she doesnt trust the vagaries of designer labels she relies on the advice of her favorite upper east side boutique miriam rigler which provides her staple of pant suits for board meetings sweaters and jackets for hedge fund clients even for women who sought safety in high collars and sober suits the waters are tricky to navigate heather hay murren started working at salomon brothers as a research associate in wearing a dowdy double breasted brooks brothers suit and a white blouse buttoned to the neck her female boss suggested she wear a "lower cut shirt" so she wouldnt seem uptight to salomons sales force the lesson drove home how loudly our wardrobes speak for us "i hadnt realized people were looking at my clothes " says ms murren who is now chief executive of the nevada cancer institute "it was like an epiphany " at aureus asset management karen firestones aplomb is illustrated subtly in a photo stripped across a page on the firms web site www aureus asset com
