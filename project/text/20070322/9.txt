ahead of the tape is deciphering jobs report worth the work among economic reports the monthly tally of jobs created is wall streets main event with billions of dollars riding on it every time it comes around for investors interested in knowing whats happening in the job market rather than just plunking money down on the streets roulette table watching the far less closely followed initial jobless claims report that comes out every thursday might be a better bet claims measure the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits giving a real time picture of layoff activity since claims come out every week theyre considered "high frequency data" a nearly derogatory term among economists because the more frequently an economic report comes out the more misleading statistical noise it tends to invite when it comes to noise claims may need to take a back seat to the monthly jobs report economists spent much of last year wondering how consumer spending could hold up so well when the monthly jobs numbers looked so lackluster they got their answer last month when the labor department said the economy created or about more jobs in than estimated the labor department revision showed according to lehman brothers economist ethan harris that job forecasting models based on weekly claims reports which had been pointing to higher numbers had been doing a good job "if you look back its the claims numbers that were right all along " he says he doesnt advocate not paying attention to the report but he thinks investors are foolish to put so much stock in the numbers an average of jobless claims have been filed each week in the past month suggesting that despite the trouble in housing the job market is in good shape anything over is considered high unless jobless claims hook higher it may be too early to call it quits on the economy merger could be next chapter for borders barnes &amp noble deal rumors have swirled around barnes &amp noble and borders group ever since activist hedge fund pershing square capital management took large stakes in the two booksellers late last year a merger is one of the more daring notions afloat and perhaps the most likely outcome both companies report earnings today and borders is expected to announce restructuring plans that could ignite more deal chatter hurt by competition from discounters such as wal mart stores and online retailers like amazon com the companies have struggled to increase profits in one of their biggest businesses best selling hardcover books barnes &amp noble slashed fiscal year earnings targets and said "harry potter and the deathly hallows " set for release in july will produce little profit because the company will have to offer it at a steep discount to compete with rivals goldman sachs analysts are skeptical about a buyout of either company due in part to their soft earnings growth goldman thinks a merger makes more sense while a combination will face antitrust scrutiny that didnt stop appliance rivals whirlpool and maytag from linking up last year so theres precedent to suggest that a barnes and borders merger could win approval a good deal for buyers of bookseller shares perhaps not so great for book buyers scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
