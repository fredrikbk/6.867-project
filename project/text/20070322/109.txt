these u s raids in iraq look real but they arent the purpose is to check up on aid to small business help must be invisible near tikrit iraq in one of the oddest raids of the war in iraq a convoy of u s humvees rolled to a stop outside a small printing plant here one afternoon late last month twenty u s soldiers in dark goggles moved through the two story building with assault rifles forcing the plants workers against an outside wall for questioning then conducting a room by room search because an office door was locked the soldiers radioed army capt dan cederman who was leading the raid to ask whether they should knock it down "i told them that would kind of defeat the purpose " capt cederman recalls "wed have just had to come back out the next day to fix it " the strike after all wasnt meant to find insurgents or weapons its real purpose was to covertly measure the progress of u s financed renovations to the companys offices the u s is spending tens of millions of dollars to reopen state run factories that have been shut down since the invasion and to create new businesses military civil affairs teams throughout the country are helping the iraqi companies draft business plans and modernize their equipment and many businesses are back in operation providing much needed jobs and boosting the fragile iraqi economy officials hope they will also keep otherwise idle men from joining the insurgency but given the hostility toward the u s officials arent advertising their role "the only way things will work is if the u s contribution is totally invisible " says maj christina nagy a civil affairs officer from the nd airborne division "i have people with higher ranks than me always wanting to have a ribbon cutting i just listen and think sure if you want the companies to get immediately shot or blown up " the raids are the brainchild of capt cederman an nd airborne reservist from upstate new york who studied robotic engineering in college and works in target corp s logistics department when he isnt deployed overseas this is his second tour in iraq and many of the contractors he worked with during his first tour in have since been killed by insurgents he says the idea for the raids sprang from another contorted economic revival scheme launched when capt cederman and maj nagy arrived here last year and found themselves charged with reopening a vocational school damaged by an errant u s bomb amid the invasion the iraqi side of the project was led by a mechanical engineer named dr noori a stocky fellow with buzz cut hair who had taught at the school in the years before the war and is running it now dr noori who brings his teenage son to meetings on the massive american military base here asked that his full name not be used for safety reasons the u s allocated nearly &# million to renovate the school and buy new furniture and machines but the military balked at providing funds for salaries and other operating expenses last summer dr noori approached the americans with a creative alternative he was planning to offer courses in fashion design and tailoring and asked the americans to help him establish a small textile factory where students from the vocational school could help design and manufacture items for sale a portion of the profit from the clothes would then be used to offset the costs of running the school he said the americans liked the idea and agreed to give dr noori more than &# to renovate an abandoned building and purchase new equipment and supplies the u s officers say with the work well under way last fall dr noori asked capt cederman to see the renovations for himself both men say but the iraqi stressed the importance of keeping the u s role secret "can you come in without anyone seeing you come in " dr noori remembers asking that didnt seem possible another option hide in plain sight "i thought why dont we just raid the place " capt cederman recalls dr noori agreed to that asking only that the u s forces make sure that no one was hurt during the sweep and that no damage was done to the factory the u s raid took place last september dr noori who had been alerted to the timing stayed home the day of the strike to prevent his workers from finding out that he knew many of the soldiers the american soldiers took all the employees into one room and told them they were looking for a specific iraqi suspected of ties to the insurgency during the mock interrogations a second team of soldiers quietly made its way through the plant to take photographs and check the pace and quality of renovations dr noori says several workers told him after the raid how frightened they had been that convinced him that it had come off as authentic the soldiers meanwhile say they were able to verify that the u s money had been used appropriately the ruse worked so well that capt cederman decided to carry out a similar raid last month at the printing plant here that had been fixed up with u s funds the iraqi assistant director of the plant requested the strike telling the americans it would help persuade the insurgents to leave him and his workers alone capt cederman says the company prints recruiting posters for the iraqi military and police as well as an independent daily newspaper u s forces had spent several days preparing for the raid studying satellite photographs of the factory grounds and floor plans of the interior of the building the strike began shortly after p m on feb the security guard recognized capt cedermans humvees as the vehicles drove into the compound and came over to greet the troops the soldiers responded by ordering him to put his hands in the air and then lie flat on the ground participants in the raid say "he kept saying welcome welcome " master sgt john craig recalls "i was like get the f down on the floor it had to look real " after the guard was disarmed and searched the soldiers ordered the four workers who were in the building to come out and line up against an outside wall speaking through a female translator dressed in military fatigues capt cederman and his soldiers told the workers that they were looking for an insurgent rumored to be in the plant the soldiers took each workers id card and compared it to a fake photo sheet they had brought along a second team of u s soldiers had made its way through each office to verify that the work in the u s funded contract had been completed the raid lasted about minutes capt cederman says u s forces are likely to employ similar methods in coming weeks to check on other projects the u s is paying for in recent days meanwhile u s forces staged a raid to solve a nettlesome and potentially life threatening problem in the nearby city of bayji an iraqi who worked as a translator for u s forces there was getting death threats from insurgents and asked the u s for help the americans responded by raiding his house publicly arresting him and holding him in jail for two days "a lot of people there now think hes a bad guy " capt cederman says "it bought him a lot of street cred "
