borders business plan gets a rewrite it will reopen web site give up most stores abroad close many waldenbooks for six years borders group inc has pursued a distinctly unfashionable strategy betting big on bricks and mortar while paying little attention to the online world now with online sales capturing an ever increasing share of the book business the no book retailer is reversing course today borders plans to announce its intention to reopen its own branded e commerce web site in early ending an alliance with amazon com inc that had been the core of its online strategy at the same time it will announce it is giving up on a decade long effort to expand its own book superstore concept internationally and will sell or franchise most of its overseas borders stores the company also plans to close nearly half the waldenbooks outlets it owns throughout the u s additionally in a move mirroring a similar venture by its larger rival barnes &amp noble inc borders plans to build a much bigger proprietary publishing operation by striking deals with hollywood writers celebrities and best selling authors the moves are a striking change in strategy for borders and reflect the difficult choices facing book retailers as they confront a sluggish book market and competition from discounters on and off the web including amazon and warehouse chains like costco wholesale corp because those outlets sell an array of goods in addition to books they are able to offer books at cut rate prices offsetting the thin margins with fatter profits on other goods for borders and barnes &amp noble both of which revolutionized book retailing in the s by building vast stores the new competition is putting immense stress on their business barnes &amp noble which has long operated its own web site has struggled to compete with amazon unwilling to compete aggressively on price the company reported revenue at its online unit fell to &# million for the fiscal year ended feb in recent years such sales have been flat at about of total revenue borders transferred its online business to amazon com in shortly after the dot com bust amazon was to operate a new borders web site keeping all the revenue

overall book market up from in according to r r bowker llc which tracks the book industry borders has been hit hard the retailer which is based in ann arbor mich warned in january that fiscal fourth quarter earnings would be below its previous forecast of between &# and &# a share borders said at the time that holiday season sales at superstores open at least a year fell while "same store" sales at its waldenbooks division fell borders will report its fourth quarter earnings and year end totals this morning as a result george jones borders recently named ceo now declares online to be "a necessary component of our business " he says that launching the business "wont be a slam dunk" but that it will complement the companys bricks and mortar stores and will enable borders to partner with a variety of companies in addition the nearly million readers who now participate in the borders rewards program will be able to earn customer benefits through online purchases something they cant do currently with amazon also working in favor of borders mr jones says will be improvements in online e commerce technology since that make it cheaper to run a web site but the retailer wont focus on providing the lowest prices on the web "sales and profit are important but they are not our only reason for wanting to be on the web " says borders spokeswoman anne roman "we intend to use our site for all kinds of benefits to our customers " she adds that borders will price "competitively " borders was founded by two brothers tom and louis borders in as a used bookstore in ann arbor eventually the store moved into new books and that business was acquired in by kmart corp which married borders to its waldenbooks unit three years later kmart took the two book chains public as borders group kmart is no longer a shareholder waldenbooks smaller stores operated mainly in malls has been particularly affected by the downturn in the book market as a result borders plans to close nearly half of its waldenbooks outlets over the next months by the end of it expects to be operating only waldenbooks down from at the end of more dramatic is the borders decision to disengage from most of its superstores overseas including all in the united kingdom the restructuring marks a stunning about face for borders which under earlier management had expanded aggressively into such markets as australia and new zealand with the exception of stores in singapore and puerto rico borders intends to focus on franchising its brand abroad there are currently three franchised stores in malaysia and one in the united arab emirates "its a question of where we put our capital of where we can get the highest return on investment " mr jones says "right now wed rather put our money in the u s superstores " borders group expects to generate consolidated profit margins of to by up from in to make its u s stores more attractive borders is working on a prototype of a new superstore design that will include a digital center the centers will enable customers to purchase a variety of digital products including music and audiobooks and provide such services as personal publishing the first of the new concept stores will open next year borders is also expected to reduce the number of cds it stocks reflecting a gradual decline in cd sales as more people get their music from the web mr jones isnt backing away from music completely though noting that music is central to the borders shopping experience he says "we are looking to get into the downloading business " to distinguish borders from rivals mr jones also intends to strengthen the companys publishing business mr jones who once served as president of world wide licensing and studio stores at time warner inc s warner bros says he has met with the heads of various hollywood talent agencies in hopes of striking publishing deals as a result of those talks borders will publish on june "slip and fall " a debut thriller by nick santora a seasoned tv writer whose credits include episodes of "the sopranos " "law and order" and "prison break " "there are a lot of great writers writing for motion pictures and tv " mr jones says "why not take the concepts offered in good scripts and make them into a novel " borders will not make any of its proprietary hardcovers available to other retailers yet it is confident it will be able to place some of its titles on the national best seller lists with help from its database of nearly million borders rewards members
