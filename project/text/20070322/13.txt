bear stearns joins the line to launch etf exchange traded fund would seek higher yields in exchange for some risk bear stearns cos money management group is joining the list of firms trying to launch an actively managed exchange traded fund a kind of mutual fund that to date has been limited to just index funds etfs resemble index oriented mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock etf managers have expressed interest in creating actively managed etfs in which a manager would pick securities in an effort to beat the market rather than tracking index returns but technical elements in how etfs function make it difficult to construct actively managed etfs bear has filed with the securities and exchange commission to launch a current yield fund an exchange traded fundlike investment that would be actively managed the fund if approved by the sec will invest in money market and short term fixed income obligations including u s government securities bank obligations u s dollar denominated foreign bank obligations corporate debt obligations and other income instruments the new fund would seek to fill the same role in investors portfolios as a money market fund but will aim to offer higher yields in exchange for risk to investors principal the bear stearns filing states "unlike an index fund which seeks to achieve as closely as practicable the total return of the securities comprising a specified market index the fund will be actively managed by its portfolio manager in other words the portfolio manager will have discretion to choose securities for the funds portfolio consistent with the funds investment objective " a bear stearns spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the prospectus although a number of companies have asked the sec to approve actively managed etfs so far the sec has yet to clear any to market one main sticking point has been that etfs require fund managers to publish the funds holdings on a regular basis something stock pickers are loath to do feeling it would tip off the market to their investment ideas portfolio disclosure is less of an issue for the short term fixed income instruments that the bear stearns fund will hold says joe keenan managing director at bank of new york which is listed in the filing as the proposed funds administrator the value of these fixed income securities tends to reflect interest rates and events in the treasury market rather than individual corporate events therefore substituting individual securities will have less of an effect on the value of the portfolio that it might for a stock fund making it less troublesome for the manager to reveal investment decisions mr keenan says in addition unlike other etfs the proposed bear stearns fund would not redeem fund shares from market makers in exchange for blocks of the funds underlying securities but rather for cash that is because individual bond issues can be more difficult for market makers to buy than individual stocks still if successful bear stearns new etf structure may not always be limited to bonds "if bear stearns is effective at managing the fund i think you have to assume they would take the structure into other asset classes " mr keenan adds bear stearns asset management manages more than &# billion in separate accounts hedge and private equity funds and funds of funds but sold its mutual fund business to dreyfus in the firm doesnt currently offer etfs
