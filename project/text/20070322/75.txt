politics &amp economics fda proposes tighter rules on panelists washington the food and drug administration proposed tightening rules to minimize conflicts of interest among outside medical experts who serve on agency advisory committees the panels of scientific experts are important because the fda tends to follow their recommendations on key matters including when drugs should be approved and how to deal with emerging safety questions about medications medical devices and other products the agency has come under pressure to cut back on members ties to companies the moves were to ensure that "the public has confidence in the integrity of the advisory committee process " said randall lutter fdas acting deputy commissioner for policy he said the agency tried to strike a balance between limiting conflicts of interest and securing the most qualified experts who are frequently involved in industry funded research under the new draft rules panelists would not be allowed to vote if they had direct financial conflicts of interest such as holding the stocks of individual drug companies affected by the matter being considered by the committee in most cases those who hold &# or more in financial interests wouldnt be allowed to participate in a particular meeting the fda also said that it intends to "generally limit" participation" by experts "in certain cases where there may be a perception of a conflict of interest " the draft guidelines are the latest of several recent moves by fda to head off criticism from members of congress who are now considering various bills that would affect how the agency handles drug safety and other matters rep maurice hinchey a new york democrat who has pushed for a change in the law to limit conflicts on fda committees said the new proposal "is a major step in the right direction " but he doesnt think it goes far enough the &# threshold was "a little high " he said panelists are screened before each meeting under two sets of federal regulations that are designed to limit conflicts of interest however the laws have conflicting standards and the agency said in a statement its "staff found it difficult to achieve consistent results that the public could readily understand "
