wonder land bong hits jesus explained in a better world the phrase "bong hits jesus" would take its place in the library of eternal mysteries alongside "bye bye miss american pie " "i am the walrus" and "its alright ma im only bleeding " instead it fell monday to the nine interpreters of the u s supreme court to deconstruct "bong hits jesus" and decide for the rest of us whether it falls inside the protections of the american constitution perhaps an explanation is in order morse v fredericks aka bong hits jesus is a first amendment free speech case the phrase "bong hits jesus" came to life as a foot banner which joseph fredericks a senior at the high school in juneau alaska unfurled directly across from the school entrance as a parade passed by bearing the olympic torch for the olympics whereupon the schools principal deborah morse ordered mr fredericks to take down his banner and later suspended him some definitions as defined by the online encyclopedia wikipedia "a bong also commonly known as a water pipe is a smoking device generally used to smoke cannabis aka marijuana but also other substances " the entry also explains a "hit " "the user places his her lips on the mouth piece forming a seal and inhales an inhalation is known as a hit " for the still curious the wikipedia entry is long and lovingly prepared with beautiful color photos of bongs and explanations of "bong water" and "health benefits " principal morse who had had other run ins with mr fredericks believed his sign was undermining the school systems anti drug policy and so took action within months mr fredericks sued assisted by the alaska civil liberties union claiming violation of his free speech rights some history lawsuits over the free speech rights of schoolchildren exist because the supreme court legitimized them in several years earlier a year old girl and year old boy decided to wear black armbands to their schools in des moines iowa to protest the vietnam war the schools had a policy against wearing symbolic armbands at school and warned theyd be suspended they showed up with the anti vietnam armbands were suspended and in what today is the landmark tinker case for school "speech " justice abe fortas famously wrote that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate " two later cases fraser and kuhlmeier refined tinkers scope which well see shortly is the background to one of the most hilarious and revealing exchanges at oral argument ever in a school free speech case in the years since school officials and lower courts have struggled with tinker the massachusetts supreme court said a t shirt "coed naked band do it to the rhythm " was protected speech but schools in several states have banned a t shirt with "abortion is homicide you will not mock my god " religious groups filed amicus briefs for the juneau "bong" banner because they want similar protections to wear anti abortion shirts and the like a federal appeals court in california said schools could ban a t shirt calling homosexuality shameful because it was "injurious to gay and lesbian students and interfered with their right to learn " but a federal court in ohio conferred constitutional protection on a shirt with "homosexuality is a sin islam is a lie abortion is murder " all these cases involve public schools there are legal blogs on the web which try to predict supreme court rulings many say the result in the "bong" case is a close call should we care are we past caring here is chief justice roberts monday on applying the first amendment in juneau "you think the law was so clearly established when this happened that the principal that the instant that the banner was unfurled snowballs are flying around the torch is coming should have said oh i remember under tinker i can only take the sign down if its disruptive but then under fraser i can do something if it interferes with the basic mission and under kuhlmeier ive got this other thing so she should have known " the lawyer for "bong" replied that the principal took a course in school law and so had studied kuhlmeier fraser and tinker chief justice roberts replied "so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldnt do " the lawyer "yes " justice scalia "as it is to us right " laughter in the court the nine interpreters know that tinker has produced a morass since justice roberts said "i thought we wanted our schools to teach something " a school isnt an "open forum " remarked justice scalia "its there for the teachers to instruct " justice ginsburg wondered about "reasonable rules of decorum " justice breyer ridiculed case law standards in these fights "i dont think the principal has to be able to read content discrimination viewpoint discrimination time place he doesnt know the law the principal his job is to run the school " well it used to be we live in hyperpoliticized times with the web drawing ever greater numbers into the daily game no political offense is too slight to raise waves of high dudgeon and they roll into the schools justice breyer worries about "people testing limits all over the place in the high schools " i worry about dumbing down the schools to the current level of politics in the adult world rather than just fiddle with the dials on the school speech contraption the solution would be to take tinker and throw it out the window but they wont theyll tinker telling us what to do but unable to give coherent reasons why we should do it the pious extension of first amendment speech rights amid vietnam from adults to students prior to college was a mistake the bong case may be another nail in the coffin of public schools parents including liberals who can afford it will quicken the trend to sending their children to private schools whose principals can exercise real discretion and in loco parentis one argument for the say it loud status quo is that kids should be free in school to learn how "to deal" with different viewpoints id bet all nine justices went to high schools with principals who put learning first and tinkered "speech" in its place it doesnt seem to have stopped them from growing up to drive people nuts with their opinions write to henninger wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor court decisions
