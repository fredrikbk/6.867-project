the morning brief an ambiguous bottom line from the federal reserve online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here financial markets may have seen a kinder gentler view for interest rates in the federal reserves policy statement yesterday but the feds unequivocal reiteration of inflation concerns suggests the new language is less about policy intent and more a hedging of bets in uncertain times the federal open market committee as expected kept its benchmark overnight lending rate between banks at imposing no direct change on the cost of borrowed money but the fomc significantly altered its post meeting message with fodder for both hawks and doves in its assessment of the economy at the last meeting on jan the fed saw "somewhat firmer economic growth" in the data it reviews yesterday it called the indicators "mixed " and the past interpretation of apparent stabilization in the housing market morphed into a view of ongoing "adjustment" of that all important sector despite the less rosy reading on growth the fed reported "elevated" readings on core inflation reversing its january report of modest improvement and while the fed still sees a likely moderation of inflation pressures over time it also still views the current high level of resource utilization the share of facilities and workers employed by american industry as a potential threat to prices "in these circumstances the committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected " it said that seems more explicit than januarys statement which said "the committee judges that some inflation risks remain " but then the fomc made what was arguably the most substantive modification of policy instead of describing conditions for the "extent and timing of any additional firming" a de facto assertion that the next interest rate adjustment would most likely be up the fomc was more neutral "future policy adjustments " it said will depend on how the inflation and economic growth pictures evolve its not so surprising then that "markets immediately concluded that chances had increased for a rate cut in coming months " as the wall street journal reports "futures markets raised the odds of a quarter point rate cut by midyear to from before the meeting bond prices rose and yields which move in the opposite direction fell stocks soared as the dow jones industrial average rose points or " the fed linguistic change "adjustment" in place of "additional firming" wasnt anticipated economists had only expected a tweaking of the fomcs description of the economy the journal notes but how does one square the stricter vigilance against inflation in yesterdays statement with what seemed a more ambiguous policy stance ambiguity itself may be the goal fed chairman ben bernanke and his colleagues are piloting the economy through a turbulent era when despite some moderately positive economic indicators his own respected predecessor alan greenspan is warning about possible recession when the extent of damage from a hurting subprime loan sector increases worries across the credit and housing markets when a host of geopolitical uncertainties is also keeping investors and governments on edge one secret to mr greenspans success was a respect for uncertainty and while his apparent love for a resulting policy ambiguity was often mocked it also served him well the mixed messages in yesterdays fed statement may be the product of similar sentiments held by mr bernanke a trans american fight over broadband emmys for once an old media new media flap isnt about the migration of audience and ad dollars from

the other and now atas is suing natas in federal court accusing the latter of "trying to launch a massive roster of broadband emmy awards without proper approval " variety reports still atas might have started the fight when it began to hand out broadband emmys last year reasoning that a cellphone version of the hit tv show "" was still prime time natass response how do you define prime time on the internet the spat "highlights the confusion faced by the old media as it faces the digital future with excitement and dread " the wall street journal says "as online video becomes increasingly
