home &amp family cranky consumer turning to outside help to organize a baby album services produce nice keepsakes hours of culling special to the wsj like many new parents we snapped away with a digital camera to document our daughters many firsts still despite our best intentions the pictures piled up in the house becoming more like clutter than keepsakes this sparked us to seek professional help to create an album to mark her first year many businesses have cropped up to help disorganized shutterbugs like us from photo web sites that are do it yourself easy to one person companies that will take charge for our project we tried two internet based photo sites a scrapbooking pro a photographer web designer and photopia a web based company that restores old photos and can also transform them into paintings and mini movies each service created beautiful albums but we still had to devote a couple of hours to culling through photos and in some cases drawing up directions yet the results deserved to be handed down since most of our photos were on our computer we first turned to snapfish com a popular photo web site after spending an hour winnowing hundreds of photos down to we completed the free registration and uploaded the photos to snapfish com after uploading pictures requiring seven minutes for each we designed our memorybook from the cover choices from linen to leather to the captions we loved that the layouts werent boring squares on a page but the hourlong design process could have gone smoother if the dragging technique worked as well as intended and previewing the album hadnt been so slow that we took a leap of faith and ordered the &# book anyway three days later a fun looking album in which some photos overlapped arrived but the images werent as sharp as we had hoped we next tried kodakgallery com once we signed up for a free account uploading the pictures was a cinch we selected all photos hit start uploading and kodakgallery com finished within minutes for faster uploading mac users can download ofoto express designing the photo book was just as easy you can use the sites auto fill function or design each page by dragging the desired photo into the selected layout but we could have cut the three hour process in half if we had known to hold off on writing the captions until we got to the photo book part of the site a week later we received a boxy but professional looking album in which pictures were sharper than those in the snapfish album but we were unpleasantly surprised to see that some peoples heads were cropped off and how did that mistake on the first page get there when we had previewed the &# album before purchasing attracted by photopias claim to be more than a photo web site and the gushing testimonials we emailed the media company after several quick replies to our many questions from the friendly customer service we opted for the basic package a " x " album with captions and a custom cover for &# a week later after we mailed in a cd with the images burned on it a letter detailing which captions were to accompany which pictures and the check we received an email confirming the packages arrival but we were annoyed to learn that we had not nor we were advised to order a proof &# after a couple of emails and a phone call that received no response we gave up and directed them to go ahead with the printing eight days later we received an album in which the layouts creatively mixed circle and square shaped photos offering something very different from the photo web sites in addition the pictures were sharp in some cases brighter than on the computer too bad one of the captions was misplaced and the custom cover we paid for was forgotten finding someone in our hometown of new york city to create an album proved trickier a meeting with one consultant from the scrapbooking web site creative memories went nowhere as her calendar filled up with other commitments fortunately another creative memories consultant my lan tran who recently became a professional scrapbooker after years of social work took on our project by the end of a free one hour consultation she persuaded us to add more expressive pictures of our daughter to round out our " x " ruby leather album &# and advised us to order the prints ourselves to save money big mistake as ordering from snapfish added another two weeks to the process still within three days of getting our photos my lan delivered a pretty album that was unfortunately too crafty for our tastes we realized were not scrapbookers at heart after receiving no responses from three other scrapbooking companies with fancy web sites promising personalized attention we posted an ad on craigslist and decided to work with maria mayer because of her background in photography and web design despite being the most expensive of the services at &# an hour maria produced the most beautiful album in our test one that resembled a photography book that was still warm and inviting after only one week the layouts were thought out with personal touches like a scanned sonogram birthday card wishes and captions written in classic typewriter font we didnt have any changes when she sent us a computer document for approval the finished book which came a week later will become a family heirloom write to cranky wsj com company web site snapfish com cost &#
