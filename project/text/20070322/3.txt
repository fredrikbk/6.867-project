a new force in advertising protest by email ads for luxury goods brands including dolce &amp gabbana and giorgio armani are increasingly under fire in europe from groups as diverse as suburban mothers catholic bishops and factory workers the latest target a dolce &amp gabbana print ad created by the fashion house showing a bare chested man pinning a glamorously dressed woman to the ground by her wrists as three other men look on the ad which started in february drew widespread criticism from consumers in spain italy and the u s and the privately held italian fashion house decided this month to drop the image the ad "trivialized violence against women " says maria jesus ortiz director of communications at the spanish labor ministrys womens institute in spain "every ad has to be read in the context where it runs and in spain gender violence is a huge and deadly problem " ms ortiz said the organization had received dozens of complaints from consumers many by email faced with growing pressure from the spanish government and the womens institute dolce &amp gabbana last week withdrew all its ads from spain it accompanied the move with a statement citing the need "to protect the creative freedom which has always been its signature " the brouhaha spread to other countries an italian textile workers union called for a boycott of dolce &amp gabbana because of the ad the fashion house decided to pull the offending image which had run in newspapers and fashion magazines including esquire world wide even deleting it from its own web site susana martinez vidal editor of elle espana says the explosion of internet email and blogs means "every complaint gets magnified and gets spread much more quickly they can make a lot more noise than before even if it isnt the prevailing view " she admits the ad boycott is a blow to the magazine but hopes it blows over "soon " spanish activists have since turned their attention to other fashion targets including an ad that ran in newspaper el pais for armani junior the childrens label of italian fashion house giorgio armani showing two little girls dressed in midriff baring armani fashions and wearing lipstick a governmental office to defend childrens rights said in a statement that the ad was an incitement to sexual tourism "we would never have imagined that one could have interpreted any malice in this photo " armani said in a statement adding that it didnt have plans to run the image again in spain in the fickle and often prickly world of advertising protests have long been part of doing business still the internet giving consumers and advocacy groups greater ability to mobilize has magnified their impact "in the past we didnt know the extent of reaction for weeks but with the web its easier for people and special interest groups to mobilize people and get their voices heard " says brad brinegar chief executive officer of mckinney+silver a unit of havas "what might have taken weeks to hear through the mail can now happen within seconds of an ad program breaking " earlier this week a campaign for "captivity " a horror film starring elisha cuthbert was quickly withdrawn ads for the film appearing on new york city taxis and on billboards in the los angeles area offended so many people that the producer said they would be withdrawn after complaints were lodged via e mail messages and telephone calls following complaints from consumers and suicide prevention groups many of them by email general motors corp re edited a u s ad that came out during the super bowl showing a robot from one of its factories contemplating suicide after it makes a mistake on the production line the suicide scenes were cut advertising executives say that in many cases advocacy groups or interest groups have become experts at using the web to mobilize consumers or group members into action as a way to promote their issues or point of view "various interest groups that have a platform they want to promote are always looking for springboards to make their promotions so when a brand does something that feeds the issue they are trying to promote they will use the ad as a springboard to get their cause publicity " mr brinegar adds most fashion houses dont use ad agencies instead producing their campaigns in house a policy that takes away some checks and balances of the advertising world and leads to them being more provocative ad executives say britains advertising standards authority logged complaints overall in up from the previous year in part it says because of the ease of lodging an objection via the internet two groups that regularly weigh in with the asa the authority says are mothers against murder and aggression and mediamarch a conservative organization last fall the asa received complaints about a dolce &amp gabbana ad created around a napoleonic theme the ads which drew on empire waist dresses and capes unveiled on the fashion houses catwalk featured two dramatic images of foppish men threatening each other with daggers at the time dolce &amp gabbana defended the ads saying they were inspired by paintings by th century french artists such as eugene delacroix and hadnt drawn criticism in other european countries the u s or asia nonetheless the asa concluded after an official inquiry that dolce &amp gabbana had "breached social responsibility" because the ads could be interpreted as "condoning and glorifying knife related violence " the asa says it doesnt ban ads but puts pressure on newspapers and magazines to not accept them by the time the report was out the campaign was ending a print ad by french designers marithe et francois girbaud depicting leonardo da vincis painting "the last supper" reinterpreted with women was banned by a french court when it came out two years ago after the conference of bishops of france called it blasphemous that ruling was recently overturned by frances highest court of course controversial images in fashion advertising are nothing new ads in the s and s by italian fashion house benetton for example included images of an aids victim and a nun kissing a priest that stirred outrage and debate but advertising executives say fashions provocative messages are gaining more attention as advertising for other products has become more politically correct at the same time fashion ads are pushing into ever racier territory "fashion advertising conveys its message through images of attraction " says herve brossard president of frances association des agences conseils en communication an industry group and vice chairman of ddb worldwide a unit of omnicom group inc "but when its sick or perceived badly people now have the means to react "
