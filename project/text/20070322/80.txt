politics &amp economics how the conflict over attorney firings provides latest test of executive privilege washington unless congressional democrats find evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the firing of eight u s attorneys any court challenge seeking to force bush aides to testify under oath could be an uphill battle democrats have threatened to subpoena white house aides including karl rove and former counsel harriet miers to question them over the firings which the democrats allege were politically motivated earlier this week president bush offered to allow the aides to speak privately with lawmakers but not under oath and without a transcript yesterday a house subcommittee authorized judiciary committee chairman john conyers d mich to issue subpoenas for mr rove ms miers their deputies and kyle sampson former chief of staff to attorney general alberto gonzales the senate judiciary committee is scheduled to vote today on whether to authorize issuing its own subpoenas at the heart of the conflict is a murky legal concept executive privilege a power claimed by the president and other members of the executive branch to resist certain subpoenas and or other legal demands from congress and the courts the constitution doesnt mention it but presidents have invoked the privilege since the administration of george washington most cases have resulted in the white house compromising and giving in to some extent to such requests rather than risk having a court define the limits of executive privilege but if the bush administration were to stand firm and if there remains no sign of criminal wrongdoing precedent appears to be on its side executive privilege has "been upheld on the basis that presidents need to have the unvarnished advice of their advisers and public disclosures of confidential advice would deter advisers from being forthright " said paul rothstein a constitutional law professor at georgetown university and author of "federal testimonial privileges " over the years courts have held that the privilege may encompass military and diplomatic secrets as well as communications with the president house democrats have scheduled a hearing today with witnesses including the justice departments civil rights division chief wan kim among other issues the hearing will focus on a new report by the citizens commission on civil rights that alleges that the department has used political aims to weaken its enforcement of voting rights cases such cases most often benefit african americans who tend to vote democratic in a letter to several members of congress tuesday white house counsel fred fielding raised the possibility of claiming executive privilege "in the midst of this current debate the president must remain faithful to the fundamental interests of the presidency and the requirements of the constitutional separation of powers " he said white house spokesman tony snow said that if congress were to issue the subpoenas the administrations offer to allow the aides to speak privately with lawmakers would be "mooted by the action of congress " mr gonzales has spent recent days trying to limit the fallout from the firings and ease calls for his resignation he reached out to all u s attorneys on a conference call last week to explain the departments actions and will be meeting in person with regional groups of u s attorneys in the coming days starting with st louis today the justice department also plans to engage each u s attorney on how to balance the departments priorities with local challenges despite the flap over the issue the white house plans to emphasize in coming days that its legislative agenda remains intact "were not approaching this from the standpoint that were looking for a showdown " mr snow said "i think theres plenty of room to operate" on other issues such as energy and education initiatives if the white house declines to relent and congress issues the subpoenas the case would be referred to the u s attorney for the district of columbia jeffrey taylor mr taylor previously served as counselor to mr gonzales and to former attorney general john ashcroft john d mckinnon contributed to this article
