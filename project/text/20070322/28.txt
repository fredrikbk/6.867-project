court reverses perelman award on point of law a win looks possible for morgan stanley in high profile case for years wall street giant morgan stanley lost nearly every battle in a high profile case against billionaire financier ronald perelman now the firm could win the war on a narrow point of law in a reversal an appellate court panel in florida yesterday overturned a &# billion award won in by mr perelman against the securities firm and denied a retrial in the case mr perelman plans to appeal the decision to the full member florida court of appeal the development came as morgan stanley reported a jump in its first quarter earnings to a record &# billion or &# a share amid the double barreled good news and an up market morgan stanley shares rose &# or to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange morgan stanleys earnings were aided by the tumult in the mortgage market for borrowers with weak credit histories rising defaults in the "subprime" market have stung other firms but morgan stanley using its own to cash to make "proprietary" bets correctly wagered on a decline in an index reflecting the subprime markets health according to a person familiar with the firm the appellate panel decision for morgan stanley doesnt guarantee that the firm will win the case but some legal specialists say it now will be an uphill climb for mr perelman chairman of new york based cosmetics maker revlon inc "the bottom line is it is relatively rare to get a hearing of the full court " said larry dimatteo huber hurst professor of legal studies at the university of florida mr perelman is disappointed in the "temporary setback " said his spokeswoman chris taylor but she said mr perelman believes his company will "prevail on rehearing before the full florida court of appeal or ultimately the florida supreme court " one upside for mr perelman is that the judge who wrote the dissenting view in the appellate panel decision is the chief judge of the full appeals court at issue in the legal decision was a jury trial in a west palm beach fla state court the case initially centered on morgan stanleys role in advising florida based appliance maker sunbeam corp in its purchase of mr perelmans camping goods company coleman co mr perelman says he was duped by morgan stanley sunbeams financial adviser into accepting sunbeam shares in exchange for selling coleman not long after the deal the appliance maker became engulfed in an accounting scandal and its shares tanked but the jury never heard morgan stanleys side of that case the wall street firm repeatedly said it was unable to produce documents so angering the lower court judge that she told the jury to assume morgan defrauded mr perelman and coleman that decision led to the large verdict without ruling directly on the judges decision to punish morgan stanley for failing to produce documents the appeals court ruled that mr perelman never showed at trial exactly how much in damages he suffered from his sale of coleman to sunbeam "because there was no proof presented at trial on the correct measure of damages the trial court should have granted morgan stanleys motion" for an immediate victory wrote judge carole y taylor in a decision concurred by judge george a shahood morgan stanley has been working to put behind it the legal troubles it had under former chief executive officer philip purcell many of which stemmed from the companys inability to produce emails mr purcell resigned from the firm in amid an executive civil war over his leadership and john mack who took over has been trying to get the firms house in order "we are gratified with the decision " said morgan stanley spokeswoman jeanmarie mcfadden the firm has &# million reserved to cover an adverse outcome if morgan stanley ultimately wins the case that money would revert to earnings potentially lifting profit though some or all of that money could be used for a settlement if the two sides decided to stop fighting in court to put the matter to rest the appellate court decision didnt address whether sanctions were justified against morgan stanley for document production rather the panel said mr perelman failed to demonstrate the actual value of sunbeams stock when the financier bought them judge taylor said establishing a "fraud free" price for sunbeam stock was "a necessary element" of the case "instead he treated the stock as though it had no value when the transaction occurred in " the judge wrote during the trial mr perelmans legal team which sought &# billion in damages from the wall street firm argued the sunbeam stock was worthless at the time of purchase because the shares were subject to a lockup meaning he couldnt sell for a set period of time by the time the lockup had expired sunbeam shares had crashed amid the accounting scandal and were worthless judge taylor overturned both the lower court jurys &# million award meant to compensate mr perelman for his loss and the &# million punitive award florida court of appeal chief judge gary m farmer in a dissenting opinion said he would have upheld the compensatory or actual damages award and ordered a new trial on punitive damages which are intended to punish a defendant found to have acted with malice "i see no legal reason why the deceiver should be benefited in the measurement of damages by the mere fact that coleman held onto the stock and refrained from selling it in market when it might have done so " he wrote randall smith contributed to this article
