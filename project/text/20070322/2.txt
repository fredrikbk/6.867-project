a museum sanctuary for synagogue interiors jerusalem it is not easy to find the work of eliezer sussmann the th century painter from the lvov region who decorated the interiors of synagogues from germany to the ukraine none of those wooden structures survived the holocaust but a vaulted synagogue space adorned with animal figures that sussmann interlaced with floral patterns can be seen at its original scale in jerusalem inside the israel museum the interior from horb am main germany is one of three now housed inside the museum next year their number will rise to four with the installation of zedek ve shalom the spacious sand floored sephardic synagogue from panamaribo suriname by mid the interiors all of which were in disuse abandoned or already dismantled will form a "synagogue path" of jewish architectural spaces installing original synagogue interiors at their original proportions is unique to the israel museum which also has an th century french rococo room donated by the rothschild family these spaces address a dilemma facing museums exhibiting judaica which normally hold only fragments from places where jewish life once flourished the synagogue interiors also solve a perennial problem for museums exhibiting architecture which rely on models photographs and drawings but fall short of presenting architectural space "you are not only looking at the object you are in the object " says curator tania cohen who notes that unlike facsimile rooms "this is the true object this is the real thing " it is a serene harmony of decoration and contemplation a noahs ark for abandoned synagogues not quite says the secular museums american director of years james snyder who notes that part of the mission of its department of judaica and jewish ethnography is "to salvage and preserve artifacts of jewish life from the places where that life no longer exists thats where salvage comes in " mr snyder stresses that these are no longer sacred spaces but visitors have been seen praying there these are not the only synagogues that were transported to jerusalem and reinstalled in the early s when an interior from the northern italian town of vittorio veneto went to the israel museum another abandoned synagogue in nearby conegliano was dismantled and reinstalled as the italian synagogue on hillel street not far from the israel museum this second ornate baroque interior is principally a house of prayer with its interior altered to fit the dimensions of the new site which is a religious museum exhibiting entire synagogue interiors in jerusalem began with the idea of the museum itself after the nazis emptied huge regions of jews jewish buildings that remained were either also empty or in ruins or abandoned to banal or profane functions like storing crops the post shoah priority of jewish charities was to ship furniture ceremonial objects and other fragments to places where jews were living especially israel the long abandoned vittorio veneto interior an august th century paneled space with silver lamps a carved loggia and a gleaming baroque torah ark was installed for the museums opening in with the help of italian architects and the italian government visitors inside its walls will hear another dimension of jewish life from an earlier time the music of salamone rossi said to be the first jewish composer of polyphony in the horb synagogue an animal feed depot after its congregation departed in the s the vaulted interior is adorned with eliezer sussmanns floral decorations when given to the israel museum by the bamberg museum in the panels had been in storage unseen for years such was also the case with the cochin synagogue from the s a place of worship in the kerala state in southern india the interior from one of seven standing in the s in kerala was sold to a german antiques dealer when its indian landlord became convinced that the building carried a curse the congregation had already migrated en masse to israel with its torah ark members visit the museum regularly curators say only after the museum bought it from the dealer in preparation for an exhibition on the jews of india did curators strip off multiple layers of paint to discover that its walls were decorated with tropical floral motifs that were hidden for centuries curators found a curious resemblance to sussmanns work but no evidence connects the two synagogues if the suriname synagogue is installed by it will complete a year process that began with the transport of the interior in and a two year acclimation to jerusalems dry climate since then the wooden barrel vault of zedek ve shalom has been restored the synagogues sand floor comes with a range of explanations theories hold that iberian worshippers praying in secret under the inquisition used sand to muffle any noise or that the sand may have been an aide memoire of the years jews wandered in the desert before reaching the land of israel another explanation for which there is some documentation is that the floor contains some sand that was actually brought from palestine easy maintenance in swampy suriname may be a practical reason for the floor the museums chief judaica curator daisy raccah djivre sees a bold diaspora statement of hope in the structure built by families of portuguese jews who fled the inquisition in brazil "its big full of light not hidden in a small building because the jews were afraid of anti semitism theres almost a pride of being jews in a new america " zedek ve shalom was one of two th century synagogues in panamaribo by the mid s with only jews left there the sephardic synagogue was unused and its roof leaked the community fearing rotting and collapse arranged with the israel museum to remove transport restore and eventually display the interior as a permanent loan the community now rents the buildings shell to an internet cafe the project cost the museum some &# million funded largely by the son of a curacao businessman who prayed at zedek ve shalom on trips to suriname the museum also funded the preservation of panamaribos remaining ashkenazi synagogue what seems like a mutual success with income for the panamaribo community and a restored interior going on view at the israel museum has its critics "site matters " insists rachel frankel a new york architect in restoring earlier th century jewish sites in suriname who believes zedek ve shalom should have been preserved where it was sam gruber who heads the international survey of jewish monuments says other solutions could have kept the interior from being shipped to jerusalem which has plenty of synagogues and plenty that need urgent conservation at the israel museum mr snyder disputes any notion that his institution has brought coals back to newcastle for now his ark will hold only four "we dont go around looking for synagogues " he said stressing that the suriname community approached the museum in despair "the world is full of synagogues that should be restored in situ and no one restores them our enterprise is not about going around collecting them and taking them out of their original sites " mr darcy is a correspondent for the art newspaper london
