emmy caught in web war over new media old media has been fighting for years over how to compete with new media now its battling over how best to honor it the organizations that hand out the emmy awards are locked in an ugly family squabble over programming made for cellphones and the web the academy of television arts &amp sciences based in los angeles bestows the glitzy prime time emmy awards in late summer every year the new york based national academy of television arts &amp sciences handles the awards for news sports daytime tv and local broadcasts now its atas vs natas west coast atas is seeking to prevent the new york group from giving out emmy awards for online and cellphone videos claiming that the awards could dilute the emmy brand the spat between the two television academies highlights the confusion faced by the old media as it faces the digital future with excitement and dread as online video becomes increasingly popular on web sites such as google inc s youtube and news corp s myspace establishment media companies are trying to maintain control of their video assets and the old guard desperately doesnt want to get left behind earlier this week online video giant youtube announced it would give out its own video award ceremony next week the fight began to brew last year when the west coast atas began handing out "broadband emmys " the los angeles group objected that one nominee was a version of the prime time show "" made for cellphones called a "mobisode " thats a prime time show atas argued east coast natas retorted on the internet whats prime time at first the two groups agreed to work things out and a joint committee was formed last month the committee recommended that the two groups collaborate on developing a new broadband award ceremony the two sides were scheduled to present the proposals to their respective boards in the coming weeks but last week atas in los angeles appeared to have an abrupt change of heart prompted in part by the january announcement that the social networking web site myspace com had agreed to sponsor natass broadband awards a person familiar with the situation says that the los angeles group was concerned that the new york chapter could cheapen the emmys by handing large numbers of the awards to amateurs who submitted user generated videos the new york group says it is using myspace as a promotional tool and that the broadband emmys will be judged by professionals on march atas submitted a request for arbitration to the american arbitration association seeking to prevent the new york group from creating any new emmy awards contests particularly in the realm of new media on friday march the los angeles groups attorney george hedges sent an email proposing that the two groups should agree to a "mutual standstill" on any new emmy award ceremonies "the proposed standstill would apply to any ongoing or new projects involving new media content including myspace etc " wrote mr hedges of quinn emanuel urquhart oliver &amp hedges llp in los angeles then yesterday the new york group responded that it wouldnt agree to a standstill and that it would like to continue discussions peter wedprice president and chief executive officer of the new york academy says he still doesnt understand how the collaboration reports suddenly dissolved into acrimony "i think its bizarre we have had disputes over the years but never to this degree " he says mr price says that as online video becomes more prevalent "we really look at this as an important thing to do to let experts decide what is the best of the videos on the internet " the two television academies were two chapters of the same entity until when they split up after a nasty legal fight over who was eligible to vote for the awards the new york chapter wanted full voting rights for members of all the national chapters the los angeles chapter wanted only members who participated in national television to be able to vote so in the two agreed to separate but share the emmy trademark the winged statuettes each group also kept the power to veto the other groups right to add a new emmy telecast it also gave each group a share of the revenues of the others emmy broadcast licensing fee the los angeles group generates most of the revenue its prime time awards currently rake in &# million per year under an agreement with the broadcast networks the new york organization says its licensing fees are a "modest fraction" of its sister organization "theyve got this very valuable beachfront real estate in hollywood " says mr price "we have this prestigious but modest beachfront on the hudson river " "both organizations have as a goal the working out a system to give emmy awards for appropriate broadband programming " dixon dern general counsel for the academy of television arts &amp science "but for the west coast to agree to that we have to know that the emmy will be protected " this isnt the first dispute between the two groups in the new york group asked for permission to host an award ceremony for spanish language television programming the los angeles group rejected the request and the two spent a year in arbitration before finally agreeing to table the dispute
