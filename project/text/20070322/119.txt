where deborah voigt has met her match in diana damrau die agyptische helena the metropolitan opera through april new york the metropolitan opera mounted strausss "die agyptische helena" a new production that opened on march for deborah voigt its reigning strauss soprano splendid though she was in the richly scored title role helen of troy the worlds most beautiful woman ms voigt had serious competition from diana damrau as the sorceress aithra ms damrau demonstrated not only the silvery high notes and flexibility required for a strauss seconda donna she made a stunning met debut as zerbinetta in "ariadne" in but also ringing power total commitment and even some martha graham like moves these two ladies and volcanic insightful conducting from fabio luisi made the evening "helena" is a tough opera to stage the hugo von hofmannsthal libretto inspired by a euripides play in which helen didnt actually elope with paris but was in egypt the whole time works on multiple levels following the trojan war menelas bringing his wife home is so furious at her infidelity that he tries to kill her the sorceress aithra in a burst of feminine solidarity gives him a potion of forgetfulness and persuades him that the real helena awaits him innocently on mount atlas the faithless helena is merely an apparition however helena realizes that true forgiveness must come from understanding not ignorance and manages their reconciliation on those terms the opera is thus mythic domestic and freudian at the same time director and designer david fielding making his met debut tried to explore all those levels his raked set a vast empty room with tipped walls oversized doors and beds intense lighting by mimi jordan sherin and various heavenly bodies suggested the painful uncertainties of its characters inner and outer lives less clear was the purpose of "shadow" figures black in the first act white in the second who mirrored the singers each characters costume was a single color except for helenas shimmery blue green mermaid gown a reminder that there is more to even the most beautiful woman than meets the eye however mr fieldings direction like his set was also more about abstraction than human interaction and ms damraus aithra despite her graham like undulations linda dobell was the choreographer seemed more real than the unhappy couple perhaps she dreamed the whole thing the super caloric strauss score reminiscent of act ii of "ariadne " filled in the blanks with seething orchestration and ecstatic vocal writing ms voigts creamy radiant soprano fortified with some necessary steel made for a potent helena her first menelas torsten kerl withdrew due to illness after the first act and was replaced by michael hendrick who acquitted himself honorably if not beautifully in this punishingly high role mezzo jill grove was warm and intense as the omniscent mussel yes really wolfgang brendel was properly menacing as a prince who courts and then threatens helena garrett sorenson was fine as his son whom menelas kills by mistake a dozen female elves all in white with silvery wigs and sunglasses conjured by aithra to confuse menelas lightened the tone in act i omaha neb anthony daviss "wakondas dream " given its world premiere by opera omaha a week earlier at the orpheum theater here was more a meditation than an opera there were characters and they sang but our information came from the orchestra which created an undulating tapestry of tone clusters and unresolved harmonies rhoda levines spare production in which past and present existed simultaneously and especially stephen strawbridges predominantly blue lighting reinforced the mood there are several layers of dreaming in the story there are the broken dreams of justin labelle eugene perry a modern day ponca indian frustrated by his life as a mechanic and alienated from his history there are the spirit dreams of his son jason william ferguson who has visitations from standing bear arnold rawls the famous chief forced to lead his tribe on a "trail of tears" following their expulsion from his home territory and whose trial for returning resulted in a landmark judgment declaring that indians are people and entitled to live where they wish finally there is the dream of the title wakonda is the indian creator whose dreams make the world mr davis and his librettist yusef komunyakaa are to be commended for creating an original story in this era of opera adaptations of famous novels but their characters remained underdeveloped against the thematic and historical background the vocal writing was prosaic and the history actual text from the trial is intoned during act ii occasionally turned the opera into a lesson we never really felt justins anger or understood why it was centered on the indian figure of the trickster coyote that appears to exist only in his imagination the final plot twist jason hoping to exorcise this demon puts on a coyote skin and confronts his drunken father who shoots him felt calculated rather than organic it also didnt help that the strongest singer was mezzo phyllis pancella as delores justins wife and jasons mother who had a supporting rather than a central role the orchestration the strongest musical aspect of the piece included an improvising jazz ensemble of reeds drum and bass embedded in the orchestra jazz rhythms and colors also illustrated justins restlessness and dissatisfaction mr davis incorporated natural forest and animal noises and synthesized recorded sounds which were most effective when they bled into the live action especially the singing of the onstage chorus a multidirectional acoustic environment would have been more effective all the sound effects came from the proscenium area stewart robertson was the capable conductor the chorus sat onstage throughout the evening as a shadowy presence of indians from the past wrapped in blankets and perched on rocks peter harrison and paul tazewell designed the low key set and costumes it was an affecting device maintaining the sense of past and present coexisting especially when they came to life and sang and at the end led by members of the american indian dance theatre surrounded justin and delores in a traditional dance and absorbed them into the tribe and its stoic history of endurance ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
