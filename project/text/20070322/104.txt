the feds cloudy skies theres nothing like a little federal reserve pessimism to make markets cheer or so it seemed yesterday the fed held the federal funds rate at for its sixth straight meeting amid some new and more downbeat rhetoric about slower growth and "somewhat elevated" inflation investors seemed to conclude that this means the fed will begin cutting rates again soon and so they bid up stocks and bonds wed note however that they also bid up gold and foreign currencies against the dollar suggesting that some buyers see more inflation ahead our own take is that the fed hasnt advanced much beyond its self made conundrum of the past year or so chairman ben bernanke is trying to navigate between on the one hand a housing bust after the boom created by the feds easy money extravagance circa and on the other hand signs of persistent inflationary pressures to put it less charitably the fed doesnt know what to do so its standing pat and hoping things work out after a pause last year the feds favorite inflation measures have been rising again even as the dollar weakens against the euro and especially against gold this doesnt leave the fed much running room to ease if the housing and subprime credit problems do start to spread to the larger economy so fasten your seat belts and get ready for more bumpy flying in the feds cloudy skies
