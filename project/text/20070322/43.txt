gourmet coffee becomes the latest office perk but many workers cherish regular walks to starbucks rage against latte machines the coffee break refuses to die as more workers flee their cubicles to get a latte fix the office coffee machine has become a forgotten stepchild of people who drink coffee at work the percentage that drink the in house brew dropped to last year from in according to the national coffee association an industry group now in hopes of keeping their employees on the premises and sparing them the pain of a &# a day habit some companies are trying new measures first and foremost upgrading the java employers ranging from microsoft corp to law firms and plumbing contractors are ditching their old suppliers and hot plates and switching to starbucks corp and its competitors green mountain coffee roasters inc a wholesaler based in waterbury vt says it saw a increase in its office coffee sales in in the past year offices have surpassed supermarkets and convenience stores as the companys largest customer type many employers are also investing in single serve machines that make everything from coffee and specialty espresso drinks to hot chocolate and allow employees to brew one fresh cup at a time some employers say they are upgrading their coffee as an added perk for employees who are spending long hours at the office "the people who love their starbucks or dunkin donuts are going to go no matter what but when people are working around the clock its important to have coffee that they like and that tastes good and is convenient for them " says norma hanson a business manager in the boston office of the law firm holland &amp knight llp which recently installed machines by flavia a division of mars inc on every floor last summer microsoft upgraded from automatic drip coffee to the starbucks interactive cup brewer which brews single cups on each floor of every one of its buildings nationwide "its made coffee a topic of conversation " says john montgomery a group program manager on the companys redmond wash campus especially among the "coffee snobs " or those who attend coffee tastings "i learned a huge amount about coffee " mr montgomery conducted a personal taste test comparing the farmer brothers co coffee the company previously offered the starbucks blend in the new machines and the allegro french roast he bought at a whole foods store and uses in the coffee maker he keeps in his office he preferred the whole foods coffee "what it came down to was the allegro french roast had a nice nutty smooth finish " says mr montgomery who drinks to cups per day paul flaherty plumbing and heating co in framingham mass now offers employees different flavors of green mountain coffee ranging from the nantucket blend to hazelnut made with a keurig machine plumbers used to relax and have a couple of beers after work in the office break room now some employees kick back with a cup of coffee instead it also helps increase worker productivity by keeping employees from making too many coffee runs says paul flaherty the companys president before the company upgraded to specialty coffee a few months ago two cup coffee makers filled with bitter tasting sludge were set up in the kitchen "it was gross " says jody white a year old plumber "you didnt know how long it had been sitting there " five years ago "office coffee was definitely the ugly stepchild in the coffee industry " says mike ferguson spokesman for the specialty coffee association of america a trade group with about member companies now he says specialty roasters are increasingly selling their coffees to employers either directly or through office coffee services the trend first surfaced at larger corporations but has now trickled down to a variety of industries a result of the rising availability of single serve coffee machines more suitable for smaller employers some offices use flavias single serve drink machines up from in keurig has seen sales of its single serve machine to offices increase from in to in while starbucks doesnt break out sales of its office coffee segment the company says of its interactive single cup brewers which were introduced in are being used in offices yet many employees who prefer to go off premises say a quick trip to the coffee shop gives them a much needed break from work "its a simple pleasure " says matt stitzer a lawyer at cleary gottlieb steen &amp hamilton llp in new york who leaves his office every day after lunch to take a walk and buy coffee at the starbucks in the lobby "a lot of people go downstairs to the starbucks partners included " says mr stitzer years old even though the company sells starbucks coffee in its cafeteria and has coffee machines in its offices indeed mr stitzers colleague abby gordon who was drinking a vanilla latte at a starbucks on a recent monday morning says she rarely sees anyone get coffee out of the office machine it makes an obnoxious rumbling noise while dispensing anything but hot water "its so loud " she says "i dont want to disrupt people sitting around me " another factor coffee bars with their huge drink selections servers and trendy accouterments have an allure an office cafeteria or machine no matter how sophisticated cant match "i prefer to go to the starbucks for the bourgeois snobbery " says michael corbett a sales assistant at new york based modern publishing a division of unisystems inc who visits the coffee shop down the block from his office regularly he says he has opted to shell out for a coffee drink at the seattle based chain since his days as a teenage mall rat in dublin ohio his current favorite a tall skim chai latte mr corbett used to take minute coffee breaks at the nearby starbucks in the mornings until his boss asked him to stop "it was more or less a mini vacation " he says "i try not to do that anymore " higher level managers such as joe garber also say they enjoy getting out of the building though they may take their work along with them mr garber the year old president of woodrow funding &amp management corp a financial services firm in new york likes to go to a nearby coffee shop and spend or minutes working there instead of in the office "i can disappear amongst the crowds sit at a table and make calls on the phone " he says he occasionally takes a newspaper with him to peruse the sports section some bosses who have upgraded their office system have found that higher end coffee makers can bring their own set of problems late last year spineuniverse llc a wheaton ill medical education company purchased a starbucks barista machine which can make lattes cappuccino and espresso so that people could save money on going outside for coffee unfortunately the machine turned out to be too complicated for jeremy longhurst the companys president although he has stuck post its on the kitchen walls to help remember how to use it he continues to have accidents he has had hot water shoot onto his pants three times while he has tried to brew a cup now while the rest of the employees use the machine he still goes to the starbucks around the corner he says "if i look pitiful enough employees will take pity on me and make me a cup " recently the machine got clogged with too many coffee grinds and was plastered with an "out of order" sign until an employee cleaned it with lemon juice water and a paper clip "im beginning to hate the thing " mr longhurst says
