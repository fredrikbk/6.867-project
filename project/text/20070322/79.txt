politics &amp economics a risky fight over war funding democrats press iraq agenda in face of bush veto other issues washington an iraq war spending bill headed to the house floor poses the most severe test of wills yet for the democratic majority and could define president bushs relations with congress for the rest of his presidency the white house fired off a double barreled veto threat this week promising to kill the &# billion measure because of domestic spending added by lawmakers as well as provisions calling for withdrawal of u s forces next year but democrats showed no signs of retreat and even gained a vote in the senate where the appropriations committee yesterday unveiled its own version of the bill that added billions for nonwar items and pressed for withdrawal house speaker nancy pelosi d calif still unsure of a solid majority for passage will likely stretch todays debate into tomorrow before risking a final vote but she and fellow democrats feel compelled to plunge ahead even if it means exposing the partys divisions and postponing action on their own priorities such as health care "this issue is going to dominate virtually everything that happens in congress this year " said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis "its the big gorilla in the room every day " the confrontation is also a window into how the election elevated the war issue and changed congress "these are the big issues that gave us the election victory " says house majority whip james clyburn d s c "as big as it is as difficult as it is its the hand we have been dealt we asked for the cards and now we have to play them " the showdown also comes as the white house and congress are squaring off over the firings of eight u s attorneys and over democratic budget plans calling for more domestic spending white house congressional relations always testy with divided government are growing more so as mr bush pushes back asserting his prerogatives on the war and the fight over prosecutors one such case is the president ordering more troops to iraq since january as a result democrats are tackling a more difficult task than past congresses in the vietnam war debates of the s lawmakers didnt cut off funds for the invasion of cambodia in april ordered by president nixon instead a provision was enacted months after the american units had departed to prevent the white house from sending troops back by the time congress cut off funds for combat operations in vietnam and its neighbors in indochina in mr nixon had pulled down troop levels dramatically from the peak in and a cease fire agreement had been reached with hanoi the real intent of the legislation was to bar the reintroduction of troops or bombing if the north vietnamese violated the cease fire by comparison congress now is trying to cut back the war effort as the president is sending in more troops the house and senate bills both provide billions of dollars to help pay for new army and marine units which are part of the "surge" ordered by mr bush in january the democrats challenge is to meet these needs yet also calibrate a bill that presses for withdrawal while highlighting the strain on american forces as a result of the troop increases the house bill adds billions of dollars for military readiness at home even as democrats appear comfortable with establishing a month to month window for withdrawal "the surge was always designed to break the momentum of the election to break the momentum of the people speaking saying get out of iraq " said rep george miller d calif a close adviser to ms pelosi "all of a sudden were fighting over the surge and taking our eye off getting out of iraq which the nation wanted us to do she never took her eye off the message of the election now people see this is a very serious vote its about an exit strategy to get out of iraq " sen ben nelson d neb who had opposed a withdrawal resolution last week will now back the senates iraq spending package now that language was added to set military and political benchmarks for the iraqi government that means senate democrats could have votes for their position on the floor thats short of a majority but enough to put pressure on wavering republicans unhappy with mr bushs iraq policy raising the stakes republicans are vowing to vote as a bloc against the funding bill holding democrats in line is the challenge now for ms pelosi ms pelosi has experience on such issues as a longtime member of the house intelligence committee but she risks being undercut by her liberal allies who would prefer the bill go further in its opposition to the war "this is the debate we have come here to engage in and however it turns out everyone will have had a chance to share his or her views " she said
