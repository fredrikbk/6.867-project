shelf life as its brands lag at home unilever makes a risky bet ceo shifts resources to poorer countries the making of cubitos struggling to sell its laundry detergent margarine and soups to americans and europeans unilever is shifting its focus to markets it considers more promising countries in the developing world many companies are now seriously looking at places like india and china but chief executive patrick cescau is going further actually taking resources people and projects away from unilevers home base of western europe and shifting them to less mature markets that means brands like bertolli olive oil once a jewel in the consumer giants italian pantry have seen their budgets slashed while basics like sunlight laundry detergent popular in south africa are getting new attention after years of defending its bouillon cubes soap and shampoo against cheaper generics it is pushing them to a new wave of consumers in india brazil and vietnam unilever faces big pressure to change the companys annual sales growth slowed from in to just in the lowest growth since the mid s and has since remained in the low single digits it has also strained to raise profit margins which were in last year they stood at for years unilever has been losing consumers to rivals like procter &amp gamble co which have proved more creative in introducing new products such as gillette razors with built in shaving gel and &# teeth whitening kits the company is also getting squeezed by giant retailers like wal mart stores inc which sets exacting standards for suppliers to land and keep their products on its shelves p&amp gs sales have been growing twice as fast as unilevers and its profit margins of about last year were much higher than unilevers in the food market with brands like lipton tea hellmanns mayonnaise and ben &amp jerrys ice cream unilever occupies the no spot behind nestle sa and kraft foods inc its products such as margarine and pasta sauce face heavy competition from supermarkets private label goods which typically cost less if mr cescau fails to jumpstart sales at unilever the company could become a target for hungry private equity firms several london buyout firms have expressed an interest in bidding for unilever in recent months they havent moved beyond the exploratory phase because many shareholders want to give the companys new leadership a chance to turn the company around say people close to the matter last year marked the first time that unilever generated more sales from developing countries than from its home market of western europe about of its &# billion in global sales came from the developing world up from about in in developing world sales grew over the previous year while european sales inched up just and u s sales grew at p&amp g by comparison lower income countries represented of sales last year up from in should growth continue apace poor countries could make up more than half of unilevers sales within five years according to mr cescau "when i visit consumers in their homes in these countries you can smell the growth opportunity " the ceo said in a recent interview for unilever emerging markets offer young populations with fast growing incomes new media outlets have made it easier to advertise while western retailers are expanding globally unilever figures that billion consumers will buy packaged goods for the first time by most of them in the developing world detergent sales for example are soaring as shoppers use powders to clean their clothes upgrading from bar soap each week people in asia use a washing machine for the first time presenting a big opportunity unilever says the strategy plunges unilever into more volatile economies where some big competitors are also moving fast in february nestle opened a new plant in brazil dedicated to producing products for consumers earning as little as &# a day it is also setting up new distribution networks to sell its products to small stores in shantytowns in latin america in many parts of the world unilever got there first with headquarters in london and rotterdam it was formed from the merger of a dutch food maker and british soap maker both expanded by selling products in countries that were once ruled by their respective empires it has been selling its bar soaps and cooking oils in countries such as india indonesia and south africa since the s in late mr cescau ordered a review of the companys entire portfolio and established a pecking order it assigned one of three colors to each brand and product category to reflect growth potential "green" brands or categories were deemed to have the most promise and would receive the most marketing support and funding "yellow" brands were expected to simply hold their market share and would receive less money "red" was designated for slow growth brands in italy for instance bertolli olive oil received the "red" designation since unilever was prepared to lose market share and provide only minimal funding as part of the companys new mission brand managers are now required to dream up products for lower income shoppers rather than simply modify existing ones "traditionally we would have taken existing products and then tried to fathom how to adapt them for the developing world " says steph carter packaging director for deodorant "our thinking has changed " consumers in poor nations for instance tend to buy deodorant for special occasions and otherwise use cheaper substitutes such as talc or lemon juice two years ago unilever started selling a mini deodorant stick in parts of asia unilever also makes inexpensive sachets of deodorant paste that consumers can apply with their fingertips two years ago wien sao hong moved to bangkok from a small town in northeast thailand and began experimenting with unilever products ms sao hong who earns about &# a month as a street vendor got a television set in january and one of her favorite ads is for unilevers lux soap which she says she always uses another recent ad also spurred her to try a unilever vaseline sunblock "it made me go to a shop and buy the product immediately " she says "it said it will protect my skin from the sun and my skin will get brighter " unilevers efforts to innovate are also on display in its huge cooking aids division which racks up annual sales of about &# billion in unilever put together a team of researchers production managers and marketers to create a product called cubitos miniature bouillon cubes that would appeal to as many poor countries as possible unlike the companys popular knorr bouillon cubes mainly used for soups and stocks the cubitos were designed to be crumbled over a dish for extra flavor an early problem lay in the recipe for the cubes with the original formula the cube was a bit too hard and didnt crumble so easily researchers needed to find the right dose of fat so that it stuck together but crumbled quickly and the price of the cubes had to be as little as cents apiece with those kinks worked out the team held a two day meeting in january in moscow to determine which cubitos flavors would work in the most poor countries it came up with meat garlic and onion the marketers also settled on an advertising theme "tiny but mighty" that resonated across different cultures unilever is now in the process of rolling cubitos out to more than developing markets in south africa where more than of unilevers portfolio is made up of brands priced for low income consumers it has raised its budget for in store promotions by as much as about months ago a local detergent rival started to discount its brand heavily threatening sunlight a low priced unilever laundry powder popular with poor shoppers in response unilever introduced in store radio ads touting its new formulation with extra stain removers unilever also showed executives at pick n pay a major retailer an analysis of how much the chain stood to lose in profits if it discounted unilevers brands as a result sales of unilevers laundry detergents at pick n pay are up so far this year meanwhile over the past decade unilever has shed hundreds of brands that it decided were no longer strategic and reorganized management ranks numerous times more recently mr cescau has cut hundreds of senior jobs and appointed new executives to top positions in marketing research and human resources while the changes have helped unilever stabilize its market shares over the past year the companys brands are still growing slowly particularly in europe to add researchers on laundry detergent in countries like india unilever cut back on researchers in europe the company has already pared its european work force by to about from with senior management ranks down in recent years unilever also plans to consolidate food research centers in europe into just six cutting out of jobs in a major show of faith the ceo has rewarded successful brand managers of large developing markets by making them the global stewards of six of unilevers biggest products those with &# billion or more in annual sales including dove and sunsilk shampoo long time employees in europe say the changes as well as the job cuts have created tensions unilever is merging its three italian subsidiaries into one eliminating hundreds of overlapping jobs and requiring managers from its milan office to move to its newly designated headquarters in rome when unilever announced job cuts in december employees at a bertolli r&amp d center outside milan hung a banner on the front gates reading "thanks for the christmas gift " "people in europe and the u s feel like theyve been kicked around for the last few years " says sandy ogg head of human resources meanwhile unilevers human resource department asked the vietnamese government for lists of emigres overseas and has hired headhunters to look in places such as the u s for native candidates who might be willing to move back home other promising managers from the developing world are being groomed with short term assignments in the u s or europe last july unilever sent adarsh k menon from his native bombay to bentonville ark headquarters of wal mart stores mr menon who sold unilever soaps and shampoos in india will spend one year filling a diary with selling techniques he learns from working with unilevers team pitching its slim fast diet foods to wal mart the year old has so far recorded about ideas that he could use once he returns to india later this year he learned wal marts "five by five" rule which says a shopper should be able to identify a brand in five seconds standing five feet from the shelf another lesson arranging products on the shelf by color going from dark packages to light better catches consumers eyes "taking these skills back to india means well be years ahead of the curve " mr menon says "its a phenomenal opportunity " a decade ago "just getting our products onto the shelves was good enough "
