mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q what is the best antispam system out there today spam filters dont seem to work well for me a spammers change tactics so frequently that even the best most adaptive filtering systems have a tough time coping in my view the strongest antispam approach isnt filtering at all but is called a challenge response system with this approach you set up a "white list" of approved senders it could be your address book or some other list and every email you get from anyone who isnt on the list gets challenged what this means is that the incoming email is intercepted and that the sender receives a message asking him or her to enter a constantly changing code number to prove that the message originated with a human the computer programs that blast out millions of spam messages usually cant type in such a number because it is presented as a graphic and in a wavy or faint typeface and computers typically cant copy and paste such graphical numerals automatically messages that pass the challenge are delivered to you those that dont including nearly all spam arent examples of such services are choicemail at digiportal com and earthlink antispam at earthlink net the downside of this approach is that legitimate senders not on your list may find it a hassle to fill out the challenge and give up on emailing you this is a problem mainly for business users who get desired emails from people they dont know such as prospective customers q i would like to transfer files onto a new pc from my ipod are there any programs that do this a there are multiple inexpensive programs designed to do exactly that some work with windows computers some with apple macintosh computers and some have versions for both one that i have found reliable is a british made program called music rescue formerly known as podutil and can be found at www kennettnet co uk musicrescue it comes in both windows and mac versions and costs gbp or about &# q ever since i changed batteries days ago in the wireless keyboard for my apple ibook g there has been a voice that seems to be issuing commands to the computer or at least is speaking what is happening when i do things i must have done something wrong how can i stop it a i assume that while fumbling with the keyboard to change the batteries you accidentally turned on a feature called voiceover in apples mac os x operating system that speaks aloud various alerts and actions this feature is intended for certain disabled users who have difficulty seeing the screen or otherwise could benefit from spoken feedback when navigating their computers interface to turn voiceover off you can just press the command apple key and the f key simultaneously though on a laptop such as yours you may have to also hold down the function fn key at the same time or you can launch system preferences select universal access and then select the tab labeled "seeing" and click the off button under voiceover
