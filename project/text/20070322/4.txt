abstraction warmed by deep humanity the geometry of hope blanton museum through april austin texas the latest addition to the lone star states art firmament is the blanton museum on the university of texas campus in austin now the largest university art museum in the country designed by kallmann mckinnell &amp wood and opened to the public last april it contains more than objects including some interesting old master paintings and an encyclopedic compilation of prints and drawings it also contains the collection of the late james michener who with his wife mari left the blanton a massive group of th century american work although whole periods and continents are unrepresented at the museum its resources as a teaching tool are equaled only by those at harvard and yale for more than four decades the works were mounted inhospitably in buildings not designed for them the university has remedied the situation the mari and james a michener gallery now houses the art an adjacent building will open next year and contain offices shop restaurant and meeting rooms architecturally the museum is serviceable but little more the university mandated that the museum stick to the campuss generic style limestone and granite porticos and overhangs terra cotta spanish tile roof indoors however the museum has two great assets the collections are beautifully displayed in the second floor galleries paintings in outside rooms bathed in diffused natural light from without or above and works on paper in interior rooms out of the dangerous sun the long gallery housing the "america americas" installation intelligently mixes south american artists with representative works by philip guston hans hoffmann joan mitchell morris louis louise nevelson et al pieces from the william j battle collection of plaster casts acquired at the turn of the th century for classroom instruction before the invention of the slide projector and for many years hidden away have been restored thereby offering todays students at least an idea of the apollo belvedere the dying gaul and the elgin marbles as well as reminding us of what art education used to require the second glory of the michener building is the versatile ground floor temporary exhibition space right now what is on show is pretty spectacular "the geometry of hope latin american abstract art from the patricia phelps de cisneros collection" here through april a reduced version will appear at new york universitys grey art gallery from sept to dec features artists most north americans know little about various but not overwhelming objects by artists the show spotlights geometric abstraction as it developed from the s to the s the gallery is divided into six large virtual "rooms " each devoted to an important city montevideo uruguay buenos aires rio de janeiro and sao paolo brazil paris because so many south american artists kept going back and forth and caracas venezuela space flows seamlessly between the individual areas the movable walls of the standard white gallery cube accommodate the objects generously in addition the ceiling is high enough that three dimensional pieces hang freely with plenty of room to breathe the spatial reliefs of helio oiticica industrial paint on particle board and the delicate metal sculptures of "gego" the german born gertrud goldschmidt glisten in the air what is most moving about these works is the way their makers took what they wanted from the european masters and made it new the venezuelan painter alejandro otero studied in paris and was overwhelmed first by cezanne and then by picasso "blue coffeepot" is the single representative of his pseudo cubist phase shuttling between caracas and paris learning from mondrian a major european presence here like paul klee otero perfected the principle of coloring lines a pair of works "colored lines on white ground" and "colored lines on white ground ii" epitomizes the phenomenon of difference in sameness in the first larger picture the thickness of white background paint competes with five delicate lines which seem to struggle to escape in the second nine diagonal lines of different lengths and different colors but all at the same angle have managed to emerge and now float effortlessly across a gentler ground a whiter shade of pale the best of these artists are playful while at the same time alerting us to the materiality of their work in carlos cruz diezs "addictive yellow" acrylic on paper we have a field of deep black in the middle of which float ultra thin lines one green one red two pick up sticks that cross delicately at an infinitesimal angle when you step back you have the optical illusion of a yellow band on the canvas there is none only this addictive magic the same magic appears in cruz diezs "physichromie number " a three dimensional work of metal on cardboard with acrylic and plastic hundreds of razor thin slats all painted differently on both sides stick out from the background so that not only does the work exist in both two and three dimensions but it also changes completely when viewed at any new angle you might think that looking exclusively at geometric abstraction would leave you with an empty cold feeling but you walk away from this show warmed enriched indeed educated by the sheer pleasure of color line and spatial rearrangements in painting and sculpture its deep humanity is life affirming even in the absence of the human figure the didactic mission of the university has never been so easy to accept mr spiegelman writes about the arts for the journal
