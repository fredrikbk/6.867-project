moving the market commodities report chinas big oil shows reserve beijing conventional wisdom says chinese oil companies are buying every oil barrel in sight no matter where no matter the cost mr conventional is sometimes wrong the parent company of hong kong listed petrochina china national petroleum corp turned down a chance to buy a stake in the south american assets of spanish oil company repsol ypf sa people familiar with the proposed deal said cnpc chinas leading oil and gas producer by output feared the wave of nationalization spreading across south america could imperil the return on investment "in terms of the chinese the name surfaced amongst many others " says william gartland a spokesman for repsol confirming that repsol had talked to cnpc instead enrique eskenazi an argentine banker with close ties to the government is likely to win the stake to some analysts and industry consultants the only way for chinese oil companies to grow significantly is to buy overseas firms any gains at home are quickly gobbled up by chinas fast growing economy but chinese oil companies despite backing from the state and access to lots of cash are finding their choices abroad limited often for political reasons two years ago chinas no oil and gas producer cnooc ltd withdrew an &# billion bid for california based unocal corp after a protectionist backlash in congress since then the three chinese oil giants including china petroleum &amp chemical corp the countrys no company commonly known as sinopec have made more modest ventures abroad a move some analysts fear could stunt their growth potential even as global oil prices near records international oil companies are finding it harder to bring more production on stream the majority of the worlds reserves are either controlled by the national oil companies of the middle east or extremely expensive to develop chinese oil companies have in some cases helped the global energy balance as they were willing to go places westerners couldnt such as sudan against which the u s government has imposed sanctions the chinese now appear to be making more tempered bets in recent years chinas companies have spent more time and money investing at home than abroad according to oil consultancy wood mackenzie chinas three biggest oil and gas companies spent &# billion last year on domestic exploration and development compared with &# billion in by comparison the total spent overseas in and combined was &# billion the results on the domestic front have been impressive with some major discoveries of oil and gas fields helping to boost reserve replacement ratios a measure of how much oil is found to replace each barrel pumped out and sold that may not be enough for longer term growth some analysts fear "theyre running to stand still " says bradley way beijing based analyst for bnp paribas "they have lots of cash but they will need new reserves to balance volume and margin declines in their domestic fields " mr way has a month target of hong kong dollars us&# for petrochina shares which he downgraded to "hold" from "buy" earlier this month many oil industry analysts argue the only way for chinas oil companies to really grow is through overseas acquisitions thats where a repsol deal would have come in on offer a stake in repsols argentina based ypf unit whose collection of aging oil and gas fields has been valued from &# billion to &# billion repsol acquired ypf in facing shareholder pressure to reverse underperformance the spanish company is looking to sell a stake in ypf and then list in the argentine stock market to raise cash the deal could have played to cnpcs strengths cnpc engineers have a reputation for being able to squeeze supply out of old fields an expertise that dates from long practice on the companys flagship daqing oil field a nearly year old find in northeastern china as well as substantially increasing oil reserves and aiding chinas energy security the ypf stake also would have offered cnpc access to argentinas growing domestic market say people familiar with the proposed deal cnpc and petrochina declined to comment it is surprising cnpc didnt buy chinese oil and gas companies have no shortage of cash by some estimates cnpc has the capacity to make a &# billion acquisition on top of that it has access to cheap loans from chinas state owned banks chinas leaders have also suggested using some of the nations trillion dollar foreign reserves to buy overseas energy assets there is also apparently a high tolerance for risk cnpc continues to develop fields in sudan venezuela and other places where western oil companies have had less than a warm welcome yet in argentina cnpc has passed up what people familiar with the proposal believed would have been a good deal in part its hesitation is tied to the wave of nationalizations sweeping south america spearheaded by venezuela where last month exxon mobil corp and conocophillips walked away from their multibillion dollar investments after refusing to sign over majority stakes to the government controlled oil company another factor that may be keeping petrochina and its parent away from a big acquisition now is that its forecasts for long term oil prices remain very conservative oil futures in traded in new york have breached &# a barrel and some analysts are predicting that prices wont fall below &# anytime soon that could also be a factor in cnpcs reluctance to invest more in canadas tar sands a costly to develop oil that needs to be processed before it can be refined into fuel on friday cnpc issued a statement denying it was scaling back in canada the statement appears to be an attempt to deflect comments widely reported in the canadian press from a cnpc official saying the company would reduce its presence in canada because of rising production costs and tougher regulations in the background in china is the communist party congress in the fall a meeting held every five years at which big leadership changes and policy initiatives are announced the heads of top state owned companies including cnpc and its listed unit are appointed by the government which is essentially the same as the party that has quashed any ambitious plans some industry observers say jason singer in london and kate linebaugh in hong kong contributed to this article
