the san francisco biotechnology company could languish for months as sales growth slows for its key cancer drug avastin and new revenue opportunities for its existing stable of medicines likely wont materialize until at least the end of the year what investors once viewed as a potential catalyst genentechs first acquisition also has turned out to be more of a pain than a salve stumbles over

having traded in at more than times earnings genentech whose majority owner is swiss drug maker roche holding ag is now priced at about times estimated per share earnings for while the broader biotechnology sector is trading at times according to thomson financial while genentech is inexpensive on a historical basis "a cheap looking valuation can be a trap before new growth drivers emerge " warns jim reddoch an analyst at friedman billings ramsey &amp co which doesnt provide banking services for genentech mr reddoch has a "hold" rating on the stock in investing parlance a "value trap" is a stock that has gotten cheap but will languish at that valuation high biotech stock valuations are "like a fire that needs more wood to keep it going " says tom vandeventer portfolio manager at tocqueville asset management lp which manages about &# billion tocqueville recently sold some genentech shares which mr vandeventer bought a few years ago "a lot of the catalysts that might move the stock higher are visible but arent close at hand before years end " avastins second quarter sales in the u s were flat from the previous quarter for its approved treatment for colon cancer but

stock and his firm doesnt have a banking relationship with genentech one concern for investors is a study last month that indicated avastin works marginally better when used in half the standard dose expecting that doctors will prescribe lower doses investors bet sales would slow within three weeks of the studys disclosure genentech shares had fallen meanwhile results of trials for genentechs lymphoma drug rituxan for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases arent due until the end of or later even genentechs first acquisition since it was founded years ago has failed to inspire investors save for short sellers betting that its stock price would decline and merger traders focused more on the target tanox the november announcement that genentech would buy houston based tanox for &# a share caps an year collaboration on xolair an injectible asthma drug last year genentech paid &# million in royalties for xolair mostly to tanox and recorded xolair sales in the u s of &# million in january genentech said the review of the deal by the federal trade commission would take longer and delay its closing date then in february the food and drug administration said xolair required a "black box warning " the industrys most stringent because it found xolair caused a severe allergic reaction and even death in some patients which could occur hours after an injection this month genentech said the strengthened warning label leaves the length of post injection observation time to the discretion of doctors rather than mandating it which could have been an inconvenient put off for doctors and patients still sales growth of xolair which costs as much as &# a year had already been slowing sales grew in the second quarter compared with in the same period in "a lot of physicians and primary care specialists arent so comfortable administering it " says jonathan field director of pediatric allergy &amp immunology clinic at new york university medical center he adds however that he has patients on the drug with no sign of any problems other doctors and investors in genentech and tanox say the label issue was a temporary setback and that it will continue to be profitable for genentech by applying the new label and addressing the fdas concerns "we expect continued good growth in xolair use " david ebersman chief financial officer of genentech said in an emailed response to questions with &# billion in cash on its balance sheet in the second quarter when it generated &# million in cash from operations genentech wont be burdened by the financial cost of buying tanox nor however would it necessarily hurt to walk away since genentech would only have to pay a relatively small &# million break up fee to tanox to do so last month about of tanoxs shares were sold short genentechs mr ebersman said the company still expects the deal to close in the third quarter subject to customary closing conditions ftc approval and "the absence of a material adverse event " which the company defines as something that could hurt the sales future value or revenue of xolair a caveat so vaguely worded that it leaves both short sellers and long term investors feeling queasy corrections &amp amplifications the food and drug administration found that asthma drug xolair caused a severe allergic reaction which can result in death in a small number of cases a july
