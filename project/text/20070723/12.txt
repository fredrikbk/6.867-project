chinas space weapons on jan a chinese medium range ballistic missile slammed into an aging weather satellite in space the resulting collision not only marked beijings first successful anti satellite asat test but in the eyes of many also a head on collision with the bush administrations space policies as one analyst phrased it u s policy has compelled chinas leaders to conclude "that only a display of beijings power to launch an arms race would bring washington to the table to hear their concerns " this view which is widespread in the u s and elsewhere misses the point chinas asat demonstration was not a protest against the bush administration but rather part of a maturing strategy designed to counter the overall military superiority of the u s since the end of the cold war chinese strategists have been cognizant of the fact that the u s is the only country in the world with the capacity and possibly the intention to thwart chinas rise to great power status they also recognize that beijing will be weak militarily for some time to come yet must be prepared for a possible war with america over taiwan or in the longer term over what aaron friedberg once called "the struggle for mastery in asia " how the weaker can defeat the stronger therefore becomes the central problem facing chinas military strategy chinese strategists have struggled to find ways of solving this conundrum ever since the dramatic demonstration of american prowess in operation desert storm and after carefully analyzing u s operations in the persian gulf kosovo and afghanistan they believe they have uncovered a significant weakness the advanced military might of the u s is inordinately dependent on a complex network of space based command control communications and computer driven intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that enables american forces to detect different kinds of targets and exchange militarily relevant information this network is key to the success of american combat operations these assets however are soft and defenseless while they bestow on the american military definite asymmetric advantages they are also the source of deep vulnerability consequently chinese strategists concluded that any effort to defeat the u s should aim not at its fundamental strength its capacity to deliver overwhelming conventional firepower precisely from long distances but rather at its achilles heel namely its satellites and their related ground installations consistent with this calculus china has pursued for over a decade now a variety of space warfare programs which include direct attack and directed energy weapons electronic attack and computer network and ground attack systems these efforts are aimed at giving china the capacity to attack u s space systems comprehensively because in chinese calculations this represents the best way of "leveling the playing field" in the event of a future conflict the importance of space denial for chinas operational success implies that its counterspace investments far from being bargaining chips aimed at creating a peaceful space regime in fact represent its best hope for prevailing against superior american military power because having this capacity is critical to chinese security beijing will not entertain any arms control regime that requires it to trade away its space denial capabilities this would only further accentuate the military advantages of its competitors for china to do otherwise would be to condemn its armed forces to inevitable defeat in any encounter with american power this is why arms control advocates are wrong even when they are right any "weaponization" of space will indeed be costly and especially dangerous to the u s which relies heavily on space for military superiority economic growth and strategic stability space arms control advocates are correct when they emphasize that advanced powers stand to gain disproportionately from any global regime that protects their space assets yet they are wrong when they insist that such a regime is attainable and therefore ought to be pursued weaker but significant challengers like china simply cannot permit the creation of such a space sanctuary because of its deleterious consequences for their particular interests consequently even though a treaty protecting space assets would be beneficial to washington its specific costs to beijing in the context of executing chinas national military strategy would be remarkably high beijings attitude toward space arms control will change only given a few particular developments china might acquire the capacity to defeat the u s despite americas privileged access to space or chinas investments in counterspace technology might begin to yield diminishing returns because the u s consistently nullifies these capabilities through superior technology and operational practices or chinas own dependence on space for strategic and economic reasons might intensify to the point where the threat posed by any american offensive counterspace programs exceed the benefits accruing to beijings own comparable efforts or the risk of conflict between a weaker china and any other superior military power such as the u s disappears entirely since these conditions will not be realized anytime soon washington should certainly discuss space security with beijing but for now it should not expect that negotiation will yield any successful agreements instead the u s should accelerate investments in solutions that enhance the security of its space assets in addition to developing its own offensive counterspace capabilities these avenues as the bush administration has correctly recognized offer the promise of protecting american interests in space and averting more serious threats to its global primacy mr tellis is a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace
