moving the market world stock markets europes telecom shares look set to rally offer of new services amid consolidation talks could provide investors plenty of upside european telecom shares appear primed to rise higher in the second half as companies unroll new services and consolidation talk accelerates after languishing in the doldrums for the past year stock prices for some of the sectors key players could be turning positive again as near term factors come to bear with earnings season approaching the ever present allure of industry consolidation and a host of new bells and whistles to attract customers select european telecom companies could be poised to rebound including giants like vodafone group plc and smaller players like tele ab to be sure while european telecom firms have solid cash flow and limited exposure to the weak u s dollar a salient point with the greenback at multiyear lows versus the euro and the pound the marketplace remains highly competitive further consolidation is no certainty and growth prospects can be patchy and unlike in the u s where there are only a handful of major players the european market is fragmented with old guard state monopolies competing against younger more internet services driven upstarts "the sector is looking a lot better than it has done in a long time " says craig harper of societe generale sa who manages the sg european special opportunities fund in london "i see a possible upside in some stocks " mr harper says "people think its a telecom stock so theres no growth but were starting to see changes " he believes french mobile operator bouygues telecom part of the bouygues sa group is a likely takeover target and also favors greek hellenic telecommunications organization sa or ote for its earnings growth and vodafone for its emerging market exposure there is market speculation that bouygues could be open to offers for its telecom unit ote has expanded its mobile and broadband business and analysts expect it to make an offer for compatriot cosmote mobile telecommunications sa ote is down so far this year in athens compared with the athens stock exchange composites gain bouygues is up in paris compared with the cac s gain stephen parr manager of credit suisses global telecommunications fund is perhaps not surprisingly sanguine on the sectors prospects during june mr parrs fund increased its holding in vodafone bouygues and deutsche telekom ag and decreased its stake in telefonica sa and bt group plc most of the funds exposure is in telecommunications services and wireless telecom services "we feel the sector was at record lows in the first half but can now see double digit upside " mr parr says "the sector has lagged the market this year with a relatively late recovery valuation is also attractive " mr parr sees a "reasonable quarter ahead with modest improvement " propelled by the continued growth in broadband internet demand and mobile data as well as consolidation "theres also a lot of potential restructuring to come in the sector " he adds despite growing optimism there are a number of industry observers who arent as excited on the overall prospects of european telecom companies david moss director of pan european equities for f&amp c asset management is one such naysayer though even he sees long term positives mr moss notes that although he expects telecom stock prices to steady over the next year opportunity for significant upside stock movement is limited "market penetration in the majority of western europe is over " says mr moss thus forming a market environment where growth opportunities are limited this ultracompetitive market has resulted in far less profitable phone service packages and the reduction in roaming and contract rates although this is of course good for the consumer it holds little in the way of upside for investors nevertheless mr moss believes a select few companies have potential for significant growth over coming years as a result of emerging markets emerging markets such as eastern europe and much of asia have relatively little market penetration and growing vast populations resulting in the potential for significant growth opportunity mr moss favors the growth potential of tele over the past few years tele has established significant operations in the growing russian telecom market which has yet to be fully reflected in the stock price teles russian and baltic operating revenues rose in and accounted for of the companys earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a common industry profit metric another telecom company with similar potential is vodafone the united kingdom company has recently invested heavily in the largely untapped indian telecom market where cellphone penetration remains below last week vodafone reported first quarter revenue growth of in its indian market although mr moss believes this investment makes vodafone look favorable he notes to not expect significant returns for four or five years tele is up in stockholm in contrast to the omx stockholm all share which is up so far this year vodafone is up so far this year in london compared to the ftse s climb mr moss is also less optimistic about the immediate impetus to be provided by mergers and acquisitions in the sector he expects the "tidying up" of divisions of smaller companies but believes major consolidation isnt likely in the near future as companies are more focused on emerging markets however despite this short term stability mr moss foresees major telecom mergers as inevitable "in the long run i see around three major players in european telecoms much like what has already happened in the u s " daniel thomas and lilly vitorovich
