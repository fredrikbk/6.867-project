the daily fix harrington holds claret jug after garcia loses his grip online edition padraig harrington had for all intents and purposes just squandered the british open title by double bogeying the th hole on sunday yet as he sat in the recorders hut afterwards he didnt let that thought cross his mind his positive thinking was rewarded moments later when his would be vanquisher sergio garcia missed a potentially title clinching foot putt carnousties final hole claiming another victim rejuvenated mr harrington won the four hole playoff by a stroke to become europes first major winner since and irelands first since "an outstanding amateur in ireland he turned pro only because the guys he was beating did so and hoped for a journeymans career at best " paul kelso writes in the guardian "last night in the most dramatic circumstances he surpassed himself " mr garcia meanwhile had imploded squandered his lead after three rounds and his chance at his first major "the impact on garcia must now be a matter of pessimistic speculation " james lawton writes in the independent "in the more critical corners of his sport the conviction was absolute it was that winning yesterday was something he just had to do if he didnt the chances were his morale would be left in permanent wreckage " the climax was missing the man who makes up golfs "one man game " as some have taken to grumbling about the tiger woods phenomenon steve bierley writes in the guardian woods finished tied for th five strokes back "here was a man used to being at the top of every peak finding himself scuffling about in some gravel filled corrie sliding two steps back for every one he took forward " mr bierley writes "hard as he struggled his game would not knit together its horrible he said and it was impossible not to share his frustration the tournament was poorer for it it would not have mattered if he had not been quite good enough to win what would have been his fourth open and th major but everyone wanted him to be in the shake up no matter that it was a dramatic climax yesterday evening with a european winner at last " the report friday that nba ref tim donaghy was suspected of fixing games was resigning from the league and would cooperate with government investigators lends some credence to the full range of conspiracy theories entertained by legions of aggrieved fans mr donaghy is not only nba commissioner david sterns "nightmare come to life " washington post columnist mike wise writes "donaghy is the smoking gun for every fan who ever wondered if the fix was in if the outcomes of nba games were ever decided by the sinister motives working to undermine the values and integrity of the game and it will not matter one bit to the nba consumer if he acted alone most fans have had their hunches about certain referees for some time and one possible crooked cop among them opens up a pandoras box to question an entire leagues credibility " the news got worse over the weekend as unnamed law enforcement officials told the new york daily news that mr donaghy might implicate players or other refs in a separate article the daily news reported that the league had hired a private investigator to examine mr donaghys alleged gambling habits more than a year ago then let the ref call games throughout the season that ended last month the officiating in one of those games the third in the western conference semifinals between san antonio and phoenix smelled funny to espn com columnist bill simmons at the time "if david stern wants to do right by the fans then he should order nba tv to rerun the tape of game " mr simmons writes "we need answers we need to know for sure hell they can start a series called nba hardwood classics the tim donaghy collection and well spend the rest of the summer combing through games and figuring out how many donaghy could have fixed " bloomberg columnist scott soshnick has a different pr idea for the league let fans get to know the rest of the refs for once only its too late now not much the commish can do will inspire confidence in any officials he might trot out for a reactionary press conference "stern will tell you that the honest folks behind him dont deserve to pay for the actions of another " mr soshnick writes "one bad apple and all that he will say the nba will spare nothing not time or money to make sure that this never happens again and in closing he will ask you to trust people you dont know you wont how can you " between the donaghy scandal home run no for a suspected steroids user barry bonds and the indictment of nfl quarterback michael vick for alleged involvement in a dogfighting ring last week was not a pretty one for the big three leagues "how sad was this week in sports " ethan j skolnick asks in the south florida sun sentinel "three sports commissioners are envying the nhls gary bettman " but washington times columnist tom knott says the donaghy scandal wont leave lasting damage if it imparts lasting lessons "the quality of nba officiating is unexplainably mysterious too much of the time and everyone loses because of it the players coaches teams and fans " mr knott writes "that is the principal issue before stern and the nba the donaghy mess will pass just as the point shaving scandals of yesteryear in college basketball have passed what stern truly needs to address is the lackluster officiating that prompts the conspiracy theorists to see a donaghy on the floor of every nba game " more than a week before david beckhams debut with the los angeles galaxy the high priced midfielder already had bored los angeles times columnist bill plaschke "he is clearly showing up not as an athlete but a celebrity " mr plaschke wrote "he is being chatted up not in sports bars but star blogs folks are viewing him not as a leader of men but as the husband of posh " but after watching beckham play for minutes in the galaxys exhibition loss to chelsea on saturday mr plaschke has reconsidered "the soul of sport in this town is entertainment and for on saturday night i was thoroughly entertained turns out even on a bum ankle david beckham is a blast he plays to the crowd he plays above his teammates he plays from sideline to sideline he limps and lunges and falls and writhes on the ground then he gets up and gives a clapping standing ovation to those who have been cheering him and yeah on a game ending corner kick he even kind of sort of bended it " englands soccer writers many of them skeptical since the start of beckhams l a story in january werent as enthralled as mr plaschke "a sell out crowd at the capacity stadium in carson had turned up to watch a barely fit footballer play a friendly for a below average team in a second rate league " sam wallace writes in the independent mr wallace caustically adds "in the stands were the self styled la riot squad a rather tragic looking bunch of middle aged men who have adopted the customs of english football fan culture and applied them to la galaxy with mixed results their repertoire of songs leaves something to be desired the chant that ended with the line chelsea sucks will never be a terrace classic although they were the only part of the stadium that made any real kind of noise " in their online forum members of the l a riot squad didnt take kindly nor with language entirely appropriate to a family newspaper to this characterization the new york suns john moretti writes that france is no longer embracing the cycling race that bears its name "even when the tour passed through this corner of the hexagon last week " mr moretti writes from antibes "tvs in a few bars were tuned in to game shows yesterday during one of the tours most critical stages the natives were gathered in the park across the street playing a game of petanque without even a radio to be heard " tip of the fix cap to don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
