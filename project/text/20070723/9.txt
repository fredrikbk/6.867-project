boss talk at ford the outsider is optimistic in a town of pessimists ceo mulally tells everyone its going to be ok detroit when former boeing co executive alan mulally took over as ford motor co s chief executive officer last september ford was on the way to losing &# billion for it doesnt project a return to profitability until high gasoline prices are hammering sales of the sport utility vehicles that once drove fords u s profit the new ceo also confronted the complexity of running a family controlled company that had long operated as a collection of fiefdoms mr mulally is trying to make the most of his outsider status as he tackles fords troubles in a town gripped by pessimism mr mulally is unflaggingly upbeat he insists ford can achieve "profitable growth" in the u s "its going to be ok " he tells employees and dealers worried by fords huge debts and continuing losses he points to his experience piloting boeing co s commercial airplane business through a crisis after the sept terror attacks and to how boeing has rallied since behind the scenes mr mulally is starting to make tough decisions to focus fords diminished resources among them putting up for sale fords once prized stable of european luxury brands including volvo land rover and jaguar he spoke recently to the wall street journal about the challenges of running a troubled company in a new industry excerpts wsj what did you decide was critical to learn about ford mr mulally when you look at the business environment and the risks and opportunities in the auto industry a couple things really stand out clearly our strategy of focusing on large suvs and trucks needed to be reconsidered because fuel prices were going up in the big scheme of things over the years we have lost market share and so we have extensive overcapacity right away that tells you that the most important thing to do is to deal with that reality and to aggressively restructure so we are operating profitably wsj were there people who tried to tell you there were things you really needed to do but you did it your way mr mulally i listened to everybody you use facts and data and must demand and have high expectations for absolute clarity around the business environment you talk to all the stakeholders starting with the customers you also look at the macro economics the economy you talk to customers dealers ford employees uaw your suppliers your investors everybody see all those books over there he points to a shelf full of large three ring binders those are all outside studies on us all those big binders are consultant studies the ones over there marked personal and internal those are ford employees that i talked to i kept all that i gathered everyones thoughts studied those for a long time talked to the board when you get that much input from that many stakeholders you get really good robust feedback about the way it is so you take that and you develop a strategy and a plan to deal with that reality wsj it cant have been that easy you had to have people come in and say youve got to pay attention to this detail or this decision made by engineering mr mulally everything that comes to me has to be put in the context of the business business is about profitable growth and creating value so everything every input that you get the filter that it goes through is whats the plan to profitably grow the business then no matter what you decide its ok because you are going to be going over it every week you can fine tune your strategy and you can fine tune your plan based on how its going wsj what motivates you to get out and talk to all these people mr mulally i know thats what i have to do i need to network with these groups i saw dealers two weeks ago i talked to them i met them every night they were in detroit i know exactly what the dealers think because i asked them youve got to ask them wsj how do you evaluate people at ford part of your learning curve has to be deciding whether the people at the top with you got there because they were good at their job or were just politically savvy did you come in assuming everyone was competent until proven otherwise mr mulally the first thing youve got to do is get all the players at the table then you need to start working together and then youll see the depth and the breadth of the talent that you have i just use the business plan review every thursday morning they have to be there they have to be responsible for their area of the business and every week we have to see their status against the plan you see i didnt come in and get rid of a bunch of people what i did was elevate people to the table to the team that need to be there now they are all at the table you have a plan youve agreed on it youve agreed on the business environment so each of them goes through all of the businesses and each one has a few charts that capture their contribution to the plan their responsibility their accountability their authority there are about people plus me you want to see everyone work the institution has lots of data about every leader it took me a couple hours to go through all of that on the senior team so i had a pretty good inventory on the talent we had but what i want to see is their professional skill and their working together skills because this is a team sport wsj have there been some surprises some things that were worse than you thought some things better mr mulally the biggest learning was the fact of how all our customers are aware of the brand but over the years on the car side their consideration of us is much less than the competition we hadnt been concentrating on the smaller cars like we had on the big suvs and trucks now the question is how do you get the consideration on cars to get customers back in the showroom the biggest aha was on cafe federal corporate average fuel economy regulations and what a market distorting policy that is what a failed policy that has been in reducing our dependence on foreign oil i learned about it from the team you have these charts with the critical issues and boom on three or four of them is a question about "where are we going to go with cafe " so all of a sudden one of the biggest issues on everyones mind is cafe in these to hour meetings the first time i heard about it was about two weeks into the job its on everyones mind wsj so your strategy is allowing people to tell you bad news without coming down too hard on them mr mulally absolutely one of the first meetings we had i asked how its going and most of it was all green and a little yellow i said "hey we lost like &# billion it cant all be green " the next week ford executive vice president mark fields was launching the edge fords new small sport utility vehicle up at oakville ontario he had a technical issue so he chose not to deliver the car because we wanted to start off with the highest quality in the weekly review he presents the chart with all the launches it has all the greens yellows and this one big red box the place goes silent i started to clap i said "mark that is great visibility and i am glad you understand that is there any help you need other resources you could get from technical or product development " so within a couple weeks it went from red to yellow to green and we had a great launch its not a warm and fuzzy thing its relentless focus on your area the expectation is we will portray it exactly as it is and thats ok what will not be ok is not dealing with it our job is to create a viable business for profitable growth sometimes you have to go deep underwater to get straightened out before you can start to grow so in the near term we will go down in market share and down in volume to get to a place where we operate profitably
