bipartisan trade harmony imperiled by new demand washington souring relations between the white house and capitol hill are threatening one of the few modest accomplishments that once seemed possible this year passage of free trade pacts with a handful of neighboring countries just six weeks ago market opening deals with peru and panama appeared to have a clear path toward passage that was because of an agreement between the white house and congress to incorporate democratic priorities including enhanced labor rights protections into the pending trade treaties but now democrats have raised a new hurdle insisting peru and panama enact the promised labor law changes before congress acts the reason says house ways and means chairman charles rangel d n y is that rank and file democrats dont trust the white house to enforce the labor commitments once congress approves the deals "thats the bone of contention " says mr rangel whose panel is the starting point for trade initiatives in the house "you take me and the democrats to the mat how do you think youre going to win " he says in an interview "the politics are on our side " for their part bush administration officials say it is the democrats acting in bad faith violating the spirit of the new bipartisan agreement on trade "now it is time for congress to fulfill its side of the deal " says susan schwab president bushs trade envoy similar disputes are clouding other issues that once seemed to offer the potential for bipartisan cooperation at the end of mr bushs term such as immigration and energy even seemingly simple goals like expanding a childrens health insurance program are caught in the growing tensions between congress and mr bush the issue of trade offers the potential for white house congressional conflict on a number of fronts with lawmakers increasingly wary of globalization and its impact on living standards one continuing area of dispute is how much washington should pay to cushion the blow to workers a question that will get new attention today when two senators introduce a bill to expand a program aimed at helping workers displaced by trade senate finance committee chairman max baucus a montana democrat and republican sen olympia snowe of maine will seek to fix shortcomings in the trade adjustment assistance program which expires this fall by expanding it beyond manufacturing workers to include service workers and improve some of the cash health and training benefits available to those who qualify for taa the bush administration is likely to oppose the pricey proposal while the white house agrees the current program is flawed officials say they are opposed to any high cost expansion and prefer to focus on new incentives to get people back to work the new trade fight over panama and peru involves a disagreement on how best to ensure those two countries follow through on promised improvements to labor conditions those improvements were part of an agreement between the white house and congress unveiled may that purported to retool trade policy to better reflect democratic priorities orchestrated by ms schwab the commitments also applied to deals with colombia and south korea and were supposed to hasten their passage but the washington deal didnt produce the flurry of activity the white house wanted in fact at the end of june house democratic leaders issued a statement declaring the south korea and colombia treaties would have to wait under the democratic plan the peru and panama pacts would move forward though on a slow timetable in issuing the statement democrats also made clear they wanted peru and panama to move on promised labor law changes before congress considers the pacts in a scalding letter to house speaker nancy pelosi a california democrat ms schwab insisted the latest demand overreached treading on the legal authority of another country "unilaterally requiring another sovereign country to change its domestic laws before the u s congress approves a trade agreement would be a fundamental break with u s law policy and practice " she wrote democrats counter that there are plenty of examples of the u s pressuring countries to take action before congress votes on a trade deal ahead of a vote in congress two years ago on a trade deal with central america and the dominican republic known as cafta the administration demanded that guatemala repeal a data protection law of concern to u s drug makers the white house also insisted the dominican republic overturn a tax on corn syrup opposed by republican sen charles grassley whose home state of iowa is a major corn producer "its total hypocrisy " lori wallach who heads public citizens global trade watch an influential lobbying organization that opposes many bush free trade pacts says of the administrations latest trade rhetoric administration officials say those cases are different in the cases of guatemala and the dominican republic they say the administration was pressuring those countries to roll back laws that violated a "standstill" commitment under which the u s and its prospective cafta partners agreed not to make any changes in trade related laws until after the broader pact was ratified "those involved an entirely different situation " a senior administration official says deborah solomon contributed to this article
