echostar targets middlemen in piracy suit company alleges distributors enable theft of its signals satellite television broadcaster echostar communications corp estimating that its signals are pirated at two million residences across north america has gone on the offensive by filing suit against a southern california distributor of set top boxes and others it accuses of masterminding such schemes the suit filed in federal district court in san diego accuses the defendants of selling equipment and software designed to circumvent the companys security systems the filing presents a glimpse into the latest twists in the shadowy world of stolen satellite tv programming which industry analysts estimate may result in lost revenue of more than &# billion annually for echostar the englewood colo company has million paid subscribers in the u s while another million canadian homes served by another company use similar receivers access cards and related antipiracy measures the new signal theft techniques come amid indications that echostar may be particularly prone to piracy partly because larger rival directv group inc seems to have developed access codes and other protections more resistant to hackers starting in late "pirate resources were consequently shifted from directv" to echostars "more vulnerable dish network " according to the carmel group a monterey calif consulting concern that has examined piracy issues for years and has worked for echostar and other broadcasters the suit alleges that certain middlemen and internet entrepreneurs have been peddling a new generation of home receiving equipment and separately distributing software on the web that can negate techniques "traditionally used to combat satellite piracy " it says viewtech inc an oceanside calif distributor of set top boxes and a number of unnamed defendants effectively acted as wholesalers and "sold thousands of receivers to consumer pirates for the sole purpose of circumventing" echostars security systems the court filing also contends that jung kwak the founder of viewtech used several code names on the web to "offer provide and traffic in updated pirate software " and that consumers tend to move among web sites as the sites release updated software capable of snaring satellite signals without paying for them echostar and viewtech declined to comment mr kwak couldnt be reached for comment previous lawsuits by echostar and directv have tended to target individual customers or rings that allegedly trafficked in stolen access cards rather than equipment suppliers or distributors echostar and directv remain embroiled in a separate long running civil suit in which each side has accused affiliates of the other of improperly obtaining antipiracy secrets an analysis released by the carmel group over the weekend estimates that signal theft rings primarily targeting echostar "have now distributed their illegal services and products to an estimated two million" u s and canadian households the report goes on to say that so far eight distributors or marketers of suspect set top boxes have sold a total of nearly million of the consumer devices with a combined retail value of nearly &# million with the market estimated to increase about in the first quarter alone the top three shippers historically have accounted for roughly of total revenue according to the analysis according to the study mr kwaks company is "one of the top four" marketers of such set top boxes which often retail for less than &# each and the report concludes such sales volume isnt justified by any conceivable legitimate uses the consulting companys analysis says that in north america so called free to air consumer receiving devices are intended to receive ethnic and religious programming free of charge but such programming tends to be marginal and "of interest to only very limited audiences " based on its research the carmel group concludes "such limited programming sources are not capable of justifying" the more than two million such devices sold in north america the analysis also says that the suspect set top boxes generally are manufactured in china or south korea and that the success of the alleged pirating rings "depends substantially on the support they provide customers" by quickly supplying illicit access codes and then coming up with variations able to defeat echostars enforcement efforts
