politics &amp economics mccain manager roils campaign davis returns after ouster amid questions on spending ties washington for friends and foes of sen john mccain a mystery lingers nearly two weeks after his campaign shake up given the budgetary crisis that triggered the upheaval why did he choose the adviser formerly most responsible for campaign finances to right the ship rick davis a lobbyist mccain confidant and now the arizona republicans campaign manager had more to do with budgeting fund raising and spending than any individual in his prior role as chief executive officer current and former mccain advisers say moreover they say mr davis stood to benefit from campaign expenditures to an internet services company he formed with lobbying partner paul manafort and he steered campaign funds to another company owned by a lobbyist friends client an indian casino developer in that case campaign colleagues objected about what they saw as an unorthodox arrangement potentially embarrassing to mr mccain who had been a senate investigator of scandals involving indian casinos the campaign ended its relationships with both companies in past months though it still owes money to each say people familiar with the arrangements against this backdrop the controversy within the campaign over mr daviss ascent to manager a job he held in the senators campaign reinforces questions of whether the one time republican front runner can recover mr davis had been sidelined in recent months after fighting with now departed advisers campaign manager terry nelson and chief strategist john weaver and with his return and their departures more than a dozen senior staffers have left in protest mr davis defended his actions in emailed responses to written questions a mccain adviser said the senator wouldnt comment davis allies describe him as a good manager unfailingly loyal to mr mccain and close to the senators wife cindy once paid &# a month in salary mr davis now is unpaid consultants self dealing and favors for friends are fairly common in campaigns but current and former mccain advisers say they saw mr daviss dealings and potential conflicts of interest as particularly troubling both companies in question they say were start ups with one customer the campaign the davis manafort firms lobbying work was a source of tension before the campaign insiders say given that the senators image as a crusader against special interests made him vulnerable to critics looking for hypocrisy a sore point was the work the firm did for a pro kremlin politician opposed by mr mccain and the u s government current ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovich a national security council official brought it to mccain aides attention last year they say with mr mccain still high in the polls last year mr davis wrote the original &# million budget for the republican primary campaign officials say based on the bush model that budget proved unrealistic mr mccain couldnt raise the expected donations as his stances on iraq and immigration took a toll also last year mr davis and his lobbying partner formed edc which soon would oversee the campaigns web site and online fund raising it received &# before the contracts cancellation in april and billed more than &# million the campaigns single biggest debt is the remaining &# according to its recent report to the federal election commission mr davis wrote in an email that he and mr manafort "started an internet services company to be in the internet business " he declined to name other clients he said he is recused from campaign decisions about edc but hopes it will be paid the amount owed "as the campaigns cash position allows " last summer mr davis helped arrange for the emerging campaign to work with management alliance realty inc after discussions with a close friend scott reed who lobbies for the new firms owner prominent indian casino developer richard fields mr reed who managed robert doles presidential campaign with mr davis as his deputy declined to comment campaign officials say management alliance offered itself as a full service nationwide property manager to meet a front runners needs in multiple states providing not only office space but computers phones furnishings and even staples at a markup typically state campaign offices deal directly with multiple local vendors without the markup last fall management alliance was securing space in virginia los angeles manhattan and iowa though it had no contract and received no payments according to mr davis and other staffers in december soon after mr nelson was hired as campaign manager he raised questions about both management alliance and edc mr nelson concluded the management alliance arrangement was "a sweetheart deal for ricks buddies " and a bad deal for the campaign he told others who agreed the mccain advisers had no evidence that mr davis had a financial interest in management alliance they said they argued to him only that publicity tying mr mccain to indian casino interests could be an embarrassment mr fields the casino developer declined to be interviewed but said through a spokeswoman that it was he who walked away from the campaign due to "philosophical differences" with the senator the internal controversy remained under wraps because management alliance never showed up on fec reports current and former mccain advisers say that is because management alliance is paid through charles e smith real estate services lp the landlord for mccain headquarters in northern virginia the smith firm is listed in mr mccains fec reports mccain advisers determined that the campaign owed management alliance about &# million for office improvements mr davis disputed that sum but didnt provide another the debt was pro rated and is paid through an additional premium on rent to charles e smith it was at this time last december that mr mccain first learned about management alliance edc and a third issue involving mr davis his and his firms work for the ukrainian party headed by mr yanukovich mr weaver confirmed that he raised them backed by mr nelson and mark salter mr mccains closest aide mr weaver said he recommended mr davis be removed mr mccain agreed then later changed his mind mr davis says "john mccain was aware of my involvement in edc from the beginning of the campaign " last may however a campaign spokesman was quoted in u s news &amp world report which first reported mr daviss co ownership of edc saying that mr davis "did not disclose his interest in edc to senator mccain " as for the other issues mr davis wrote "i have no involvement in management alliance" and regarding ukraine "i do not discuss my firms clients with senator mccain unless asked " the contract with edc remained for several months its terms anticipated the internet companys broader commercial potential stipulating it would develop "mccain content " but also "general content" and technologies it could market to others the firms web site lists five firms as "strategic partners " including campaign solutions owned by becki donatelli who headed the mccain campaigns internet operations current and former advisers say it was understood that the partner firms did the main work in april mr nelson threatened to resign unless he dropped edc mr davis and finance director carla eudy a davis ally the senator agreed to his demands this month mr davis and ms eudy rejoined the campaign
