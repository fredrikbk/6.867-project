politics &amp economics democrats divisions weigh on energy bill washington big divisions in democratic ranks are complicating efforts of house leaders to put together the final pieces of an energy bill intended to limit the nations dependence on foreign oil the disputes threaten party unity on what is a signature issue for house speaker nancy pelosi of california and could delay the legislation until the fall when it may be more vulnerable to election season politics the sharpest differences are over whether the house will take up the issue of fuel economy standards which arent in the democratic backed energy bill more than house democrats have signed onto an auto industry backed fuel economy measure that is far less stringent than that favored by ms pelosi at the same time more than two dozen democrats many from energy producing states are resisting provisions of the legislation that they say would slow the pace of oil and gas development on public land "its a complicated issue with a lot of moving parts " rep jim matheson a utah democrat who opposes the oil and gas provisions said of the energy package any prospect of defections in democratic ranks on the issue would be problematic the house package is designed to limit dependence on foreign oil through a combination of conservation measures and those fostering development of alternative fuels among other proposals eleven house committees led by energy and commerce have produced legislation that democratic leaders are trying to weave into a bill for now ms pelosi is tamping down talk of any delay "were hopeful that wont happen " a pelosi spokesman said but odds are increasing the energy bill wont be ready for floor consideration in the house before the august recess that begins in two weeks and runs through labor day one potential hurdle is the full calendar for floor action the house is slated to consider several spending bills including measures on transportation and housing programs democratic leaders also want to move on legislation to boost antiterror programs expand support for childrens health care and overhaul farm assistance ms pelosi also must balance competing democratic pressures over how aggressively the house should pursue energy independence and policies to address climate change last week she tentatively agreed to allow a vote on an amendment that would require electric utilities to widen use of renewable fuels ms pelosi has endorsed a measure passed by the senate that would raise standards to miles per gallon for cars and light trucks she is under pressure from liberals and environmentalists to take up the issue on the floor but an auto industry backed alternative sponsored by rep baron hill d ind is attracting support among democrats many of them moderates who make up roughly half of the bills co sponsors the measure would raise fuel economy standards but on a slower timetable and with a lower average mileage than the senate bill the strong support among democrats for the industry backed bill presents ms pelosi with a dilemma of whether to compromise or to push forward with the senate approach and risk a loss
