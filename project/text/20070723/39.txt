japanese companies woo women back to work tokyo the experience of kayoko mura illustrates a big shift in the attitudes of japanese companies toward women workers when ms mura quit her accounting job years ago her employer food giant kagome co did little to stop her as in many japanese companies women at kagome mostly played a supportive role and many women quit when they got married or had a child ms mura who was getting married and moving from central japan to tokyo wished she could continue working but couldnt see a way to make that happen "the atmosphere was such that i wouldnt dare ask for a transfer to tokyo " says ms mura who became a full time homemaker to raise two daughters but last summer kagomes tokyo office sought out ms mura now years old and wooed her back to the same kind of job she had had before it also assigned a system engineer to work with her until she got up to speed with the computer system kagome even accepted her request to work part time just three days a week six hours a day "there are many women who quit after we had spent time and money in training " says tomoko sone a kagome spokeswoman "for the company not hiring them back is such a waste " kagome is one of a growing number of japanese companies that are pursuing women workers with new vigor thats a big change from the past when many companies viewed women primarily as a temporary source of labor though rarely an official rule it used to be customary at many companies for women to leave when they got married or had children during the decade plus economic slump in japan that began in the s women were the first to be cut in corporate restructurings now a growing labor shortage is spurring a change in attitude the worlds second biggest economy is continuing to expand and last year there were more jobs than job seekers for the first time in years the labor crunch is expected to get worse in the next few years as japans baby boomers start to retire the boomers who number about million were mostly born in a concentrated three year period between and then legalized abortion and birth control began to reduce the birth rate as a result longer term the situation is unlikely to improve in japans aging society its working age population is expected to fall between and "management knows about the tightening labor market " says naoki atsumi a researcher at fujitsu research institute in terms of expanding the work force the "priority is this order women the elderly and foreigners " and companies cant count too much on foreigners because of japans strict immigration laws companies are showering women with perks and benefits in an effort to retain them a unit of apparel company world co for years relied on salespeople on a contract basis and most were women but last year it turned of its contract workers into staff employees while their health insurance and pension benefits remain the same the new status frees them from having to renew their contracts each year "we wanted talented women to continue working with us " says masako wakimoto a company spokeswoman "we dont want rivals to take them away " mizuho financial group one of japans major banks recently opened a day care center for employees in its tokyo training center an extremely rare move for a japanese company nihon unisys ltd last year started allowing women to work shorter hours until their youngest child finishes high school others are offering extended maternity leave and discount coupons for babysitting and house cleaning services kagome where female workers account for only of the employees says it doesnt face a serious labor shortage yet but it knows that it will eventually it decided to target former employees because they were already familiar with the corporate culture and most had left for family reasons last year it sent letters to former employees mostly women alerting them to its new program to hire them back on a flexible schedule so far it has hired back four people including ms mura and three of the four are women of course japanese companies still have a long way to go in catching up with other nations in making full use of women workers even though japan passed a law in to forbid sex discrimination in the workplace advancement for women has been slow women in japan hold only of managerial posts and japanese companies still tend to demand that workers put in long hours if they are to be taken seriously discouraging women who want to balance work and family life only of women who had a job a year before having a child were employed months after giving birth according to a recent government study it doesnt help that japanese men are notorious for not helping with the housework and while women are supposed to receive equal pay under the law in reality they earn only of what men earn "its not difficult to set up a female friendly system " says shoko kobayashi manager of a division promoting women at mizuhos corporate banking unit "the hardest part is changing peoples mentality it takes a long time " the company has recently extended child care leave to two years from one and it exempts women from having to work overtime until their youngest child enters elementary school but it doesnt have any data to show whether these measures have succeeded in retaining women still the change in corporate attitudes is welcome news to many japanese women especially those who have dropped out of the work force to care for their families the lifestyle of a full time homemaker long seen as a privilege is losing its allure as more women seek a sense of accomplishment outside the home but until recently once women quit their jobs their opportunities were usually limited to a handful of low paying positions at retailers and restaurants ms mura says she longed to go back to work but didnt feel confident enough to start something completely new she contacted a friend at kagome last year to inquire about job opportunities and found out about the hire back program shortly afterward she received the letter about the new program and quickly called her old employer "i thought this cant be real " says ms mura recalling how the company agreed to her short work hours without flinching "i had a gap of years "
