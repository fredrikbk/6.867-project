harrys spell most of the country saw glorious summer weather this weekend yet many playgrounds and backyards were silent call it the sound of children reading pity the poor boys and girls who were confined to overnight camp and unable to pick up their copies of "harry potter and the deathly hallows" at saturday morning for this reading frenzy alone author j k rowling deserves acclaim not since when americans mobbed new york docks waiting for a ship to arrive from london carrying the latest installment of charles dickenss "the old curiosity shop" and word of what happened to little nell have readers been more obsessed with the fate of a fictional character like little nell about whose death oscar wilde famously observed that no one could read without laughing harry potter too has his detractors not all readers are charmed and theres a longstanding debate about whether the books encourage children to read despite the phenomenal sales of the seven volume saga million copies of "deathly hallows" were printed naysayers were predicting in advance of saturdays release that harry fans would soon return to video games and tv shows we dont know whether children with the harry habit will grow into adults with a life long reading habit but being exposed to the reading bug at an early age is surely a good thing and if kids see that reading harry potter is cool it just might encourage them to pick up more books now or as they get older ms rowlings accomplishment has already led to a flowering of childrens literature as many authors try to replicate her success it also doesnt hurt that the harry potter books carry a strong moral message of bravery honesty and loyalty of the difference between good and evil and the need sometimes for difficult choices and painful sacrifices in the service of something bigger than oneself these are virtues that apply not just to wizards and witches but to ordinary muggles if that message stays with harry fans as they grow older that will be truly magic
