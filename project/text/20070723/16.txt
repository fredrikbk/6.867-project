contempt and congress republicans arent exactly racing to defend president bushs assertion of executive privilege against congresss investigation of his firing of nine u s attorneys this leaves former political director sara taylor and harriet miers former white house counsel facing possible contempt sanctions if this sword of damocles drops an important constitutional showdown between the branches might well reach the supreme court rather than run from this fight supporters of the constitutional system ought to stand firm with the president presidents congresses and the courts have long accepted a presidents right to keep internal executive discussions confidential even when the supreme court ordered richard nixon to hand over the watergate tapes it recognized "the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid objective and even blunt or harsh opinions in presidential decisionmaking " without secrecy the government cant function no one thinks conversations between federal judges and their clerks or members of congress and their staff ought to be aired publicly without good reason the same goes for presidents even if their poll ratings are low presidents washington jefferson madison jackson polk lincoln both roosevelts truman eisenhower whose administration invented the phrase "executive privilege" kennedy and reagan among others have kept executive deliberations secret from congressional inquiries usually over matters of diplomacy national security and law enforcement courts have recognized that discussions among their senior advisors not just meetings when presidents are in the room also receive protection so why arent republicans fighting to defend executive privilege now those who made their bones investigating the clinton administrations misdeeds might squirm over mr bushs assertion of privilege today but then democrats who supported president bill clintons assertions of executive privilege in the s are being hypocritical by jumping all over mr bush now too the issues at stake are light years from those of the clinton years mr clinton was fighting claims of sexual harassment brought by arkansas state employee paula jones an independent counsel corruption investigation into whitewater and his extracurricular relationship with white house intern monica lewinsky mr clinton asserted executive secrecy to protect his personal affairs this is legally important because the federal courts of appeals have held that the privilege only applies to communications between the president and his advisers on "official government matters " mr clintons personal recklessness undermined executive privilege for all future presidents at worst todays flap might ultimately show some lax management or partisanship but the hiring or firing of u s attorneys for any or no reason is squarely within a presidents constitutional prerogative mr clintons groundless claims of privilege dont invalidate assertions of executive privilege for all time pundits who imply otherwise are just blowing partisan smoke some senate democrats say mr bush is just "stonewalling" and insinuate that he must be trying to hide something as judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy d vt has darkly intoned but as he well knows executive privilege traces its lineage to george washington in the house of representatives demanded all his papers related to the controversial jay treaty with great britain washington refused saying that the constitution barred the house from the making of treaties firing u s attorneys and any other executive officers including those requiring senate approval rests beyond the constitutional powers of congress and totally within those of the presidency this has been true since the first cabinet departments were established in the supreme court held in that "since congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate or appropriate it cannot inquire into matters which are within the exclusive province of one or the other branches of the government " in the watergate tapes case the supreme court said that the presidents right to protect information is strongest when law enforcement national security or his other constitutional powers are involved under that rule mr leahy has no right to see the presidents communications about the firing of federal attorneys the nomination of john roberts or samuel alito to the supreme court or the reduction of scooter libbys sentence that doesnt mean the presidents power is limitless congress can conduct oversight needed to pass legislation on the fig leaf that congress is superintending the justice departments funding or statutory authorities doj has accommodatingly turned over thousands of documents and made its senior staff available for testimony congress can always engage in good old fashioned horse trading to get its way if senate democrats really cared to see any of mr bushs communications as opposed to lobbing allegations of "scandal" endlessly on the front pages they could refuse to confirm any new u s attorneys high officials or judges until they got what they wanted not bothering suggests that there is no real wrongdoing here just an intent to keep the scandal machine running presidents cant invoke executive privilege to protect information needed for a criminal investigation except perhaps if national security is at stake kenneth starr pursued mr clinton not for harassing paula jones or having a relationship with monica lewinsky but because mr clinton apparently committed perjury and obstructed criminal investigations senate democrats have yet to show that the firings have arguably violated a single law dumb and bad politics maybe criminal no if senate democrats really thought there was any crime here then they ought to find somebody maliciously or politically prosecuted by a new u s attorney or an fbi agent forced to drop a good case because of a new u s attorneys partisan agenda there is nothing criminal about a presidents changing law enforcement priorities or replacing his political appointees with new blood republicans unhappy with mr bush for one reason or another dont care to use up their own political capital for an unpopular president others expect the administration to crumble at the end of the face off and who wants to be stuck defending a loser just because its the principled thing to do but the odds are that mr bush will win this fight even if a few republicans defect he has the constitution on his side his poll numbers may be low but congresss are even lower congressional democrats have failed to follow through on the reforms promised in the campaign theyre too preoccupied with investigating rather than legislating if the house or senate vote contempt motions against ms taylor or ms miers a u s attorney must enforce them and since theyre all bush appointees nothing should come of it the president has every right to order his prosecutors not to bring charges against officials who defend his legitimate constitutional claims and what if the case gets to court vice president dick cheney prevailed in before the supreme court against efforts to learn the workings of his energy task force with his domestic agenda exhausted mr bush has nothing to lose defending the rights of future presidents under the constitution mr yoo is
