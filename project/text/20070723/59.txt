politics &amp economics turkish vote may pull at diversitys divide projected election victories could inflame sensitive issues of language and nationalism sur turkey the day he was fired early this month mayor abdullah demirbas faced a rapturous crowd by the ancient city wall here the reason for his rock star reception was the same reason he lost his job an attempt to undercut the monopoly of the turkish language in the official business of this ethnically mixed municipality "multilingualism means democracy " placards hoisted above the noisy crowd read in kurdish "a single language means fascism " riot police kept an eye on the peaceful rally projected victories yesterday for turkish and kurdish nationalists the first time in five years both will be in parliament at the same time will probably add momentum to the debate over turkeys ethnic minorities especially the restive and mostly poor kurds who make up of the countrys million citizens mr demirbass small rebellion provides a glimpse of just how contentious the issue can be mr demirbas a stocky year old ethnic kurd has made a career out of challenging the turkish states discomfort with diversity earlier this year he ordered the printing of glossy leaflets about sur the old quarter of a provincial capital diyarbakir sur packs more than years of history into a crowded area ringed by an imposing wall over the years this gateway to mesopotamia has been home to armenians assyrians chaldeans jews arabs turks and kurds today surs population of is predominantly kurdish in homage to that history mr demirbas had the leaflets printed not only in turkish but also in kurdish aramaic and armenian then he commissioned the translation of a linux based computer operating system called ubuntu into kurdish for future use by his municipality soon after that he had a multilingual childrens magazine published as a result of this linguistic frenzy a turkish high court in may ruled that mr demirbas violated the constitutions stipulation that turkish is the only official language as punishment the maverick mayor and his entire municipal council of were forced to step down from their elected positions newly unemployed mr demirbas rode a wave of public support at breakfast in a local cafe strangers picked up his check they greeted him as "mayor " nearby in the shade of a restored third century assyrian church efen sitci reminisced about surs armenian community which has dwindled from a few hundred years ago to just two aging couples today the armenian church where mr sitci used to pray has fallen into such disrepair that rows of interlocking arches in its prayer hall prop up nothing but sky so now he and his wife come to the assyrian church though over the years he has forgotten armenian mr sitci says he was happy about mr demirbass attempt to use the language of his ancestors again "it means we are not forgotten " he says turkey is fighting growing international pressure to classify the massacres of its armenian citizens during world war i as genocide instead the turkish government says they were killed during vicious fighting in which thousands of turks also were killed early this year a prominent armenian newspaper editor long hounded by nationalists for his pursuit of the armenian issue was murdered in istanbul mr demirbass childhood spent among the narrow alleyways of sur planted the early seeds for his multicultural project as a teenager mr demirbas who is muslim worked for an armenian tailor and he remembers eating dyed easter eggs he had jewish neighbors most jews have left sur and the towns only synagogue has become a pile of boulders in an overgrown lot mr demirbas wants to restore it after getting a college degree in sociology mr demirbas taught high school in turkish and says he angered his superiors by advocating greater use of kurdish in the past five years turkey has allowed limited use of kurdish in broadcasting but attempts to push linguistic limits have been unsuccessful violence by a kurdish separatist group here has made linguistic rights tightly bound up with what turkey sees as its own war on terror mr demirbas along with scores of other kurdish elected officials faces frequent charges of sympathizing with the outlawed guerrillas mr demirbas who once named a sur park after an alleged separatist fighter says the armed kurdish revolt is "the reality of this region " the kurdish language has become a potent symbol of kurdish nationalism both of the benign and of the violent kind other languages face restrictions too on a recent visit to his small sur parish turkeys assyrian metropolitan saliba ozmen said the use of aramaic is also restricted the ancient language is still spoken in small communities in turkey and abroad and in sur it is kept alive by four families "its very important to have diversity " the cleric said clad in his church attire of a red shirt and a black and white hood "we shouldnt be afraid of this as a country " mr demirbas conducted detailed surveys of surs population when he was elected mayor three years ago and found surs ethnic makeup had changed since his childhood over the past two decades thousands of kurdish peasants displaced from their villages by fighting between kurdish separatists and the turkish army flocked to sur they built tenements in between historical buildings sometimes using rocks dislodged from the city wall the surveys showed that of sur dwellers spoke kurdish as their primary language spoke turkish spoke arabic and spoke other languages were illiterate mr demirbas decided it would make sense to reach out to his constituents in their primary language which would be kurdish in january turkeys interior ministry asked a court to dismiss mr demirbas in may the judges agreed giving the mayor and his council a couple of weeks to wrap up mr demirbas says he may run for his old office again now that mr demirbas has been cast as a linguistic martyr his popularity has risen a point conceded even by his opponents "ill find a job " he said as his mobile phone rang with yet another call from a supporter
