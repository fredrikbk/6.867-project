americas train wreck in guatemala henry posner iii is an american entrepreneur who has revitalized rail systems in peru argentina mozambique and malawi he also has been working since to revive rail service in guatemala but now mr posners pittsburgh based company railroad development corp is suspending operations in the central american country charging that the government has violated rdcs year concession contract and refused to enforce the companys property rights "because of the governments action and the lack of the rule of law in guatemala we have no other alternative " mr posner wrote in a letter to customers investors and employees on july for guatemala the matter is more serious than a simple dispute about a state concession mr posner who is chairman of rdc is taking his beef to international arbitration under the central america free trade agreement cafta and asking for &# million in lost revenues and investments in its complaint to the cafta panel the company also charges that there is method to the governments maddening mistreatment of the company it wants to "redistribute to certain guatemalan private sector companies the benefits of the right of way without compensation " if the american businessman prevails the case will reinforce the countrys traditional image as a banana republic uninterested in equality under the law and ready to trample property rights whenever it is politically expedient what else are investors to conclude if it turns out that president oscar bergers "right of center" government which pays lip service to property rights has unilaterally abrogated a lawful contract this would be a blow to all guatemalans who need investment in their country if they are to benefit from and compete within cafta transportation infrastructure is crucial to economic development in any country and guatemala is no exception in the early part of the th century the country had a national railway that was largely the product of investment by an affiliate of united fruit it was nationalized in the s and over three decades run into the ground by it was completely defunct that left the countrys distribution system entirely reliant on a costly polluting highway system subject to congestion accidents and rampant hijacking in guatemala held a world bank style sealed bid tender process for the concession that was to restart the dead railroad rdc won in december ferrovias guatemalas first train chugged out of the atlantic coastal city of puerto barrios on its maiden journey to the capital mr posner says that the concession included the right of way on the old rail line that runs out to the pacific at puerto quetzal north to mexico and south to el salvador as well and that rdc promised "best efforts" to get the pacific side going in the railroad shipped some tons of traffic mostly steel as well as containers on the atlantic route but it was having a lot of trouble with the government mr posner says the terms of the concession included a government pledge to remove squatters from the railroad right of way and to redirect half of the lease payments from railroad owned assets toward track maintenance and improvements the squatters were never resettled elsewhere photographs support this claim and he says the lease revenue "disappeared and we had to replace it " in rdc tried to get guatemala to go to binding arbitration as provided for under the concession but the government refused arguing that it was not bound to do so the government also says that the company has not kept up its side of the agreement by investing in the country while mr posner says his company has invested &# million in the railroad president berger has said that the concessionaires "have not invested one cent " in august the government declared the concession "harmful" to the interests of guatemala and moved to confiscate the railroads rolling stock and equipment the company says this inflicted further damage on it as investor confidence plummeted and its ability to access credit markets was strained still mr posner says the railroad could have continued to operate were it not for guatemalas indifference toward another of its property rights the companys business plan had included charging for use of the right of way for electricity distribution pipelines fiber optics and the like this was stipulated in the concession and would have subsidized rail operations but while some local companies paid for that use others began free riding along the right of way when rdc appealed through the guatemalan legal system for protection in the matter the courts sided with the commercial squatters this signaled the market that what is essentially theft would be tolerated and rdc lost an important source of revenue the world bank hasnt been much help either it declared ferrovias guatemalas property a "category a environmental problem" because of the squatters and refused to lend to it mr posner says the banks position was that he had to prove to the satisfaction of the squatters that rdc has done no harm "thats like handing someone a loaded gun while you open your wallet and negotiating from there " mr posner says no wonder no one takes the bank seriously it lends to mexican billionaire carlos slim but when it comes to defending property rights it runs for cover most troubling in all of this is the charge in rdcs cafta complaint that in driving the company out of the country the government seeks to satisfy special interests there is talk that a cross country rail system designed to compete with the panama canal would be a big money maker as asia booms and while mr posner dismisses that idea he notes that the rail right of way is immensely valuable for more than simply hauling freight whatever the reason for breaking the concession its hard to see how it wont harm guatemalas image with foreign investors at a time when the country ought to be courting them
