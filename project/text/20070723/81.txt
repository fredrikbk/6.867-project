va a social net of a compassionate society for its veterans in his july letter to the editor uwe reinhardt states that "he has never heard a republican candidate or the editorial page of the journal openly advocate the abolition and privatization of the va health system " as prof reinhardt knows quite well the va health system is not a form of health care insurance in order for insurance to exist there must be a spread of risk over the healthy as well as those in poor health by definition almost everyone entering the va system is in need of health care because of an impairment that the veteran is well aware of this is known in the insurance vernacular as adverse selection which will cause any true insurance system to fail the va health care system is a social net that a compassionate society willingly funds to care for veterans who deserve health care that they probably couldnt receive elsewhere many of their needs are service related this is why he will never hear any rational opponent of socialized medicine call for the abolition or privatization of the va health care system william stephenson princeton n j prof reinhardt wonders what makes americans accept the va health system while being ambivalent about other forms of socialized medicine brushing aside the political cobwebs theres a simple answer the va system is part of the pay package for the dedicated men and women who risk life and limb to protect our country we understand theyve earned this continuing compensation an adequate pay package and socialized medicine are two different subjects thomas e mullen san diego in response to prof reinhardts "life long quest" to understand the continued existence of the va system i once had the opportunity to put that question to one of our states esteemed senators having done some of my training as a physician in the va system i recognized it as a totally dysfunctional bureaucratic civil service wasteland the care delivered was poor at extreme costs to the taxpayer i asked the senator why we could not give a "veteran health credit card" to every veteran so that they could get first dollar health care anywhere anytime they wished and completely shut down the antiquated va system i felt that their health care prospects would improve dramatically and it would still save the taxpayer millions he most candidly answered it would be political suicide to any congressman that proposed such heresy since the va bureaucracy is so powerful and entrenched and that they would be there long after he was gone bill cramer arlington texas i would like to help prof reinhardt understand the complex cerebral processes of americans who are skeptical of government run medical care yet support a well funded government program for veterans we are so grateful to our young men and women who risk their lives for our safety and liberty that cost and efficiency are secondary in our minds in ensuring that these fine people have access to exceptionally good medical care however because we do not feel the same obligation to the general public we are unwilling to support a broad based va style medical system instead we support policies that encourage individual choice and provide for market incentives to restrict the demand for medical services we have a long way to go in devising policies to reach these objectives but the alternatives socialized medicine medicare medicaid the massachusetts experiment etc are driving us away from these goals steven r weisbrod washington
