"siemens cant afford to have it in the press six months from now that trw or continental is shutting down vdo plants " said one german investment banker public scrutiny will be higher if siemens sells vdo to trw because of the latters foreign address and because blackstone controls a bit less than half of the company senior german politicians have in the past referred to private equity firms as "locusts " christian wulff the premier of lower saxony told a local radio station last week that continental should merge with vdo to create a german auto parts titan and that employees would suffer "if international financial investors got their hands on technology jobs and plants here " continental is based in lower saxony german chancellor angela merkel typically doesnt try to influence financial markets still she is closely observing the negotiations over the future of vdo said a person close to the chancellor many in berlin prefer to see vdo remain in german hands this person added

and workers deteriorated earlier this year following allegations that the company secretly bankrolled a business friendly workers group to try to undermine germanys main industrial union german prosecutors are investigating the allegations which have resulted in the imprisonment of one senior siemens manager a labor representative on the supervisory board told the wall street journal that workers are pushing hard in favor of an ipo but didnt rule out a sale if it is accompanied by strong job guarantees
