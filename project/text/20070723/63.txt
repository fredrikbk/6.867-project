real time the paradox of ease the net has cut big tasks down to size so why do we have trouble doing them online edition last week the proceedings of the national academy of sciences announced the results of an experiment aimed at shedding light on why we evolved to walk upright previous hypotheses have been that bipedalism evolved because we needed our arms to gather food give food to mates or to cool off by catching breezes the nas scientists findings which involved a lot of watching chimpanzees walk on treadmills suggest we evolved that way because walking upright uses less energy score one for laziness and what natural selection started the internet continues the net is a marvel whether its remaking commerce unleashing a world of self publishers or letting you watch all those videos you dimly remember from a generation ago mtv who out there thought the replacement for mtv would be youtube but as the example of music videos indicates for every net wonder that increases our productivity theres another one that saps it and oddly sometimes its those very productivity gains that do us in take online banking when it arrived i rejected it because it was saddled with additional fees last year i finally shifted over not surprisingly i loved it and wondered what had taken me so long online banking was fast easy and did away with the rigamarole of stamps and envelopes and worrying about mail arriving late or not at all but then a couple of months ago i started noticing something odd late fees on credit card statements it wasnt my banks fault the electronic payments were getting out on time and going to the right places no it was mine id let my obsessive compulsive habit of paying bills on sunday night slip and slip and slip until those payments were being sent after their due dates they were getting there electronically in a day instead of physically in three or four but by then it didnt matter im not blaming my bank for my credit card late fees that would be like blaming black &amp decker because i put my hand in front of the circular saw but i let myself slide into bad habits because online banking was so easy when bill paying was a chore id minimized its impact by blocking off a chunk of sunday night now i was free to do my bill paying any time and so i put it off until i was out of time why is the net such an engine of distraction one answer naturally is that were curious a trait we share with our chimpanzee cousins even though weve parted ways where knuckle walking is concerned finding out stuff is more interesting than paying bills even if were just finding out what our fantasy baseball team has done in the odd seconds since we last checked yes the net is awash in gossip misinformation snarkiness and trivia but as long as we bring our horse sense its also an awesome repository of knowledge a science fiction genie that decants itself from a spookily self assembled bottle to answer our idlest question on that subject dont miss last weeks reply all for a fascinating back and forth between authors andrew keen and david weinberger ultimately im on mr weinbergers side a generation ago most parents asked why the sky is blue would probably have had to defer the question pending a trip to the library today google will give you a brace of pretty decent answers by the way to test this idea years too late i called my poor mother whos on vacation and asked her her google free answer was a bit short on specifics but nailed the general principles my mom rocks the net has turbocharged our curiosity and with good reason the computer is simultaneously the machine on which we work and the one on which we play people have been procrastinating and goofing off at work and at home forever but goofing off with a typewriter takes a lot of doing with a pc keyboard youre just one alt tab away from doing something other than whatever it is you know you should be doing hey an email oh look an im my friend sent me a link why is the sky blue anyway the computer is an odd hybrid of work and leisure and so too are our lives the boundary between work and non work is becoming blurry and the social contract governing this new mixture is still being sorted out thats caused no end of hand wringing about what are ultimately different aspects of the same problem for every study finding an alarmingly high percentage of office workers admitting to surfing the net at work youll find an anguished discussion of how were working more and more those two particular blind men are trying to describe the same elephant as i wrote last year the office worker shopping on amazon at p m on tuesday may also be slipping off to check his work email at p m on saturday but being only human were naturally more inclined to remember the half of this bargain that goes against us but its not just net enabled distraction and multitasking that trips us up theres also the paradox of ease online banking turned a big task into a small one which is great except for the fact that small tasks are easier to put off perhaps the paradox of ease is at work in another net mystery email im net telephony and a host of other services should let us communicate with family and old friends much more easily but it can be startling to realize how long its been since we last imed that pal whose name is waiting patiently in our buddy list or that family member whose email address will be automatically filled in by outlook how is it that the ability to communicate more can leave us communicating less blame the fact that keeping in touch is now a bite size anytime task getting out a pen and paper stamp and envelope takes planning so to a lesser extent does sitting down to call that old friend dropping a line via email piece of cake ill get to it any minute now or maybe im just a knuckle walker about these things have you been tripped up by the paradox of ease or cultivated other bad habits because of the web does the web makes us lazier than ever before or enable us to get more done or is it both join me and other online journal readers in the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com speaking of ease ill be on vacation until wednesday but will check in after that if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
