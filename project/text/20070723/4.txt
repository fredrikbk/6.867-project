after buying binge nestle goes on a diet departing ceo slashes slow sellers brands no to low carb rolo vevey switzerland nestle sa chief executive peter brabeck made two troubling discoveries last year the food maker was churning out variations of its brands and werent making money after years running the worlds largest food company mr brabeck worries that nestle has grown so big that it has become unwieldy and slow now in the final months before he steps down as ceo next april he is pushing an aggressive plan to jettison weaker brands and simplify the organization mr brabeck has eliminated thousands of items including failing ones like low carb kitkats and lemon cheesecake flavored chocolate and has plans to cut hundreds more by the end of the year he is demanding that managers fix factories that cost too much he has appointed a new head of innovation and has told him to be pickier about which new ideas nestle pursues mr brabeck now tracks nestles most promising innovations at monthly meetings with his top managers nestle faces a predicament that is increasingly common in the corporate world as a wave of consolidation creates megaliths that are bigger than ever and now need to be rationalized "i compare us to a supertanker " said mr brabeck in an interview adding that he worried the companys size could have started to weigh on its growth rates while mr brabeck has shed staples like frozen vegetables he has also overseen a shopping spree gobbling up premium brands such as ralston pet food dreyers ice cream and in april gerber baby foods this spring nestle resisted an approach by pepsico inc to merge because its portfolio of soft drinks and potato chips doesnt match nestles goal of growing in health and wellness products says a person familiar with the situation nestles sales have grown since mr brabeck became chief executive in last year nestle had sales of nearly &# billion about twice those of nearest rival kraft foods inc but nestles profit margins have long been much lower than its competitors the swiss retail investors who were nestles biggest shareholders rarely pushed for change last year u s shareholders edged out swiss shareholders as nestles single biggest group of investors with of the companys capital up from in they are now putting mr brabeck under greater pressure to raise margins a leaner nestle could also make it easier to absorb acquisitions down the road mr brabecks successor is likely to face a big decision whether to buy consumer products titan loreal sa nestle holds a stake in loreal putting it just behind the held by french billionaire liliane bettencourt nestle and ms bettencourt jointly control loreal through a shareholders agreement nestle has pledged not to launch a takeover as long as ms bettencourt now years old is alive but when she passes away or should she wish to sell during her lifetime nestle has the right of first refusal mr brabeck and other nestle executives are examining a number of scenarios including selling the stake retaining a minority stake or taking over the whole company they decline to say if they want to buy loreal a spokesman for the bettencourt family declined to comment as did a spokesman for loreal in the fall nestles board will choose a successor to mr brabeck who has spent his entire career at nestle since joining in as an ice cream salesman in austria he will remain as chairman nestle laid out this succession timing after mr brabeck took on the additional title of chairman in spring and some shareholders objected to his keeping both the chairman and ceo jobs indefinitely to show how massive nestle is mr brabeck points to the example of its purina pet food subsidiaries in scandinavia in each country where it operated purina was run separately from the other nestle businesses at an investor conference in june last year nestle chief financial officer paul polman a leading candidate to succeed mr brabeck illustrated the confused lines of reporting created by the subsidiaries he showed a slide picturing several dozen boxes and a thicket of arrows connecting them in dozens of directions "we said whoa wait a minute do we really need so many " said mr brabeck "its like a garden you have to weed all the time " last year nestle cut about of its subsidiaries world wide including purina in scandinavia mr brabeck says the company may eliminate more than longer term in accelerating these changes before he leaves office mr brabeck hopes to finish a project he regards as one of his biggest legacies in nestle began installing a new information technology system internally called globe which is now up and running using software from sap ag the system can determine right away for instance exactly how much raw cocoa nestle factories use and how many nestle crunch bars it churns out previously executives in switzerland could wait months for such information big manufacturing companies have used this system for years but nestle was late in adopting it nestle says installing it has taken a long time because of the companys massive size and complexity now its helping spur changes years overdue in monthly meetings mr brabeck and the rest of nestles executive committee review the number of stock keeping units or skus as tracked by globe slides show the current number of skus for each country color coded in red yellow and green to indicate whether the figure rose stayed flat or declined it is surprisingly easy for a food maker to come out with too many new products when sales are slow brand managers often think they can win back consumers with something new in spring nestles mr polman did a review of the total number of skus and found that for several years they had been growing faster than sales he ordered managers to cut in and a further this year the number of skus now losing money has fallen to of nestles total from last year the company says one area where nestle has trimmed significantly is candy sales in the united kingdom there sales of chocolate candy had been stagnant in the years leading up to and about of nestles candy products were either losing money or barely making a profit brand managers there responded by rolling out new products like kitkats in flavors such as red berry and strawberries and cream over the past year paul grimwood head of the u k candy business has changed course he began making brand managers supply chain executives and salespeople go before an eight person panel to defend why the company should keep their products the panel which includes marketing supply chain and production managers meets every two weeks at the nestle confectionery headquarters in york among the products the panel has cut are low carb versions of kitkat and rolo after failing to take off double cream chocolate bars a premium candy made with extra cream and high quality cocoa from ecuador also got the axe three different easter eggs containing plastic disney characters are no longer being sold and neither are individually wrapped chocolates in raspberry and coconut flavors in all mr grimwood cut the number of chocolates and candies in the u k by between and by the end of this year he hopes to trim a total of from to prevent the portfolio from growing unwieldy again he also cut the number of future innovations by more than half the company is courting customers like nicola ward a year old beautician in londons financial district she says shes rarely tempted by the new varieties of snacks she finds at her local newsstand buying chocolate as a break from work several afternoons a week she alternates between a couple of favorites like nestles kitkat chunky bar and cadbury dairy milk chocolate bars "i know what i like and i just stick with it " she says "i like the traditional types " as nestles new head of innovation werner bauer is responsible for making sure some of the less promising new products never make it past the idea phase since taking on the position last year he has slashed the number of new projects world wide by about half the number of ice cream projects alone has fallen to from several years ago mr bauer meets with marketing managers and researchers to choose the most promising innovations and puts them on a one page list for the executive committee to track monthly some of the other changes mr brabeck is pushing for are relatively basic the ceo says he was surprised to learn that it cost more to make flavored frozen treats in the u s than in europe so last year nestle retrained the u s factory workers to feed the machines faster by early the cost of producing the ice pops at the u s factories dropped by the company says to prod longtime weak divisions to improve mr brabeck and the executive committee name certain businesses to a list of "value destroyers " which they review at monthly meetings one business that made the list herta a german subsidiary that is one of the countrys leading makers of traditional ham salami and liverwurst herta with annual sales of &# million had barely broken even for several years its costs were high because it used expensive refrigerated delivery trucks and paid its factory workers more than its competitors did meanwhile sales were declining as germans switched to lighter and healthier food and supermarkets began selling their own less expensive packaged meat several years ago nestle tried to sell herta but didnt get the price it wanted early last year nestle sent in daniel meile a nestle veteran who had restructured other troubled businesses his assignment was to stop hertas losses by the fourth quarter or sell the business the executive committee in vevey demanded a progress report each month after months of negotiations mr meile squeezed workers pay and benefits to save about &# million he used the savings to launch new products including ham flavored with pepper asparagus and walnut new packages highlight that herta ham contains just fat nestle researchers found that germans were annoyed when hertas ham clumped together in the package so mr meile came up with a way to fold the ham slices over to make them easier to peel off "i called this my ham mission " mr meile says when mr brabeck came to the frankfurt headquarters in january mr meile laid out the new ham on a conference room table for the ceo to taste mr meile told mr brabeck that herta had broken even for the fourth quarter of sales in the first quarter of this year were about higher than the same period last year mr brabeck took herta off his value destroyer list in march mr meile celebrated by organizing a lunch with his team at the factory of the new herta meats
