numbers game why guidance may not matter issuing profit forecasts bears little on chances of an upside surprise fewer companies are issuing earnings guidance these days but investors may not be missing much according to thomson financial which tracks corporate profits companies stand about the same chance of beating wall streets profit expectations regardless of whether their executives issue guidance the financial industrys term for detailed in house forecasts of forthcoming quarters results between and standard &amp poors companies that issued guidance beat analysts expectations of the time while companies that didnt issue guidance beat them of the time according to a recent thomson report the research raises questions about the guessing game that plays out on wall street every earnings season conventional wisdom holds that executives "manage expectations " or try to keep analysts profit estimates low ahead of profit announcements so actual reports will appear more impressive earnings forecasts move stock prices although on average just of s&amp p companies issued quarterly guidance between and with nearly two thirds of companies beating expectations the practice of keeping estimates low seems alive and well forecasts may be more subtle than some investors realize companies can offer analysts significant hints about say the wonders of a new product or the difficulty of transporting goods comments that fall short of the hard numbers that wall street traditionally defines as "guidance" but still provide information "what guidance is supposed to tell you is the direction of how things are going not necessarily the exact number" where profits will come in said mike thompson research director at thomson financial "there are a few different ways you can do that using quantitative guidance or qualitative " among big companies that dont issue formal earnings projections coca cola beat analysts consensus estimate by three cents a share or in the second quarter according to thomson merrill lynch which falls into the same category beat expectations by cents a share or union pacific does issue guidance and beat expectations by three cents or

up in the practice of issuing quarterly guidance has been subject to criticism lately from some business and investor groups saying it encourages short term decisions by companies rather than long term strategic planning and investment big name market gurus who have lamented the ills of guidance include billionaire investor warren buffett and a former chairman of the securities and exchange commission william donaldson "the risk involved with all this noise about the short term estimates is that in pursuit of quarter to quarter management managers forgo important opportunities or worse that they spend time managing the numbers" through fraud said judith samuelson executive director of the business and society program at the aspen institute the think tank recently convened a panel of executives to study long term value creation at companies the panel issued a set of principles for long term management including a recommendation that companies not issue quarterly guidance data providers like thomson that sell subscriber based services to track profit expectations benefit from the quarterly hubbub over whether companies "make their numbers " thomsons database which offers a window into the predictions of competing wall street firms that otherwise wouldnt share information with one another also carries weight as a quasiofficial consensus prior to big announcements stephen biggar director of u s equity research at standard &amp poors wouldnt like to see the practice curtailed but he acknowledges his staff takes corporate guidance with a grain of salt and weighs guidance against other information gathered independently "we consider a company to have beaten expectations only if it exceeds the consensus number by or better " said mr biggar who said that even by that more stringent standard about half of companies beat wall street estimates "we have to be aware of the streets game the ways that a company will try to get estimates to the point where its easy enough to beat the number " although the proportion of companies that beat expectations was similar regardless of their guidance policies over the period that thomson studied companies that gave guidance were better at meeting expectations on the nose companies that issue guidance met expectations about of the time compared with of companies meeting expectations without guidance companies that dont issue guidance missed expectations of the time versus among companies issuing guidance energy analyst fadel gheit of oppenheimer &amp co said he would like to see two giants of the industry he covers exxon mobil and royal dutch shell begin to issue quarterly guidance but without that mr gheit has kept "buy" ratings all year on both companies he also owns their shares it helps that analysts who cover the energy industry can see one of the most important determinants of their companies success in real time the commodity prices of crude gasoline natural gas and other fuels "what we cant really know without the companies guidance is the effect of hedging programs and things like that " said mr gheit "but you have a sense of how theyre doing most of them dont miss the expectations by a mile "
