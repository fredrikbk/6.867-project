the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources primates bonobos genteel qualities may be overstated do bonobos really deserve their reputation in popular culture as a peaceful and loving primate in contrast to violence prone chimpanzees bonobos seem to organize themselves without the use of hierarchies have more sex than is necessary for reproduction and share food for many writes the new yorkers ian parker bonobos are a more palatable human ancestor than their close relatives the chimpanzees who struggle against each other for status and occasionally divide into civil war they have attained an image in the media and among conservationists that is "equal parts dolphin dalai lama and warren beatty " he writes however a large part of bonobos good reputation comes from their behavior in captivity indeed the bonobo expert most quoted in the media frans de waal a professor at atlantas emory university has never seen a bonobo in the wild mr de waal says that while captivity can change an animals behavior captive bonobos behavior can still be usefully compared to captive chimpanzeess behavior "the bonobo is female dominated doesnt have warfare doesnt have hunting " he says other scientists in the field arent so sure many facets of bonobo behavior in the wild remains a mystery bonobos are elusive and live in the hard to explore jungle of the democratic republic of congo some scientists have lured them into sight with food a practice others say might misleadingly alter their behavior there are also many anecdotes of violent bonobo behavior jeroen stevens has seen five females attack a male and gnaw off his toes while zoos keep bonobos in small groups they might behave more violently in larger groups during a recent experiment studying bonobo diet in frankfurt a male surprised researchers by becoming aggressive after his calorie intake was reduced successfully fighting against females who had dominated him gottfried hohmann who has studied bonobos in the congo since has seen a group of females attack a male for minutes straight "those who learn about bonobos fall too much in love " says prof de waal "all of a sudden here we have a politically correct primate at which point i have to calm them down bonobos are not always nice to each other " the new yorker july polls americans may be smarter than they appear in surveys americans arent as ignorant as portrayed in the host of polls showing many of them failing tests of general knowledge and history the tests have been a media staple since writes alexander burns in national journal when the new york times tested college students and discovered "a striking ignorance of even the most elementary aspects of u s history " in recent years similar polls have reported shocking ignorance along the lines of of respondents thinking that andrew jackson served as vice president or that of people surveyed could name two of snow whites dwarfs but not two supreme court justices such polls are too eager to make people look ignorant says mr burns often questions are poorly designed misleadingly tricky and contain errors for instance people who declared andrew jackson as a vice president in a recent newsweek poll did so in a multiple choice question that asked what he and al gore have in common they lost elections where they won the popular vote as such it was a better test of obscure trivia than fundamental facts of u s history writes mr burns the american council of trustees and alumni said of respondents in its poll were incorrect for saying the articles of confederation "established division of powers between the states and the federal government " even though the document did do that the question should have asked which document established todays balance of power the constitution some of these polls decrying ignorance make mistakes themselves a poll that found that of respondents couldnt name the author of "pride and prejudice" had incorrectly spelled jane austens name in the survey reporting on such polls generally concludes that americans have lost their grasp of history and current events but mr burns points to a pew research center survey this year that tested current events knowledge comparing the results with a similar survey from it found no slip in scores it didnt find any improvement either national journal july careers
