liberias tombs shelter much more than the dead cemetery is now a refuge for kids robbers and poor im expecting death monrovia liberia joseph memmeh weaves his way through palm grove cemetery leaping expertly from grave to grave before settling on top of his usual tomb its a concrete box covered in white faux marble bathroom tiles and containing the earthly remains of someones dear wife whose name the boy cannot read though he is years old joseph is there every day lying on his stomach in rubber flip flops his head up and eyes wary like a guilty dog who expects to be rousted from the sofa there are hundreds of tombs in palm grove almost acres of them fourteen years of death by machete civil war left no shortage of bodies to bury in liberia the white marble plaque "in evergreen memory" of macy f dogbeh the baby blue slab of robert b doe on top of which several grubby t shirts are drying slowly in the moist tropical heat the blue angel painted as if by a child on a grave of a mother or brother or other the weeds have obscured the first letters of the inscription but joseph always picks the same white tiled tomb to while away his days "this place " he explains "is clean " liberias largest graveyard has become a refuge for the poor and the bored the criminal and the incontinent the young and of course the dead the country is at peace but in palm grove cemetery one need not dig at all to reveal its unhealed wounds the tombs there are mostly above ground concrete boxes providing convenient cover for drug dealing sleeping or any activity where privacy is desirable some lie cracked open leg bones craniums and teeth visible in a sliver of sunlight the grass between them is chest high and everywhere are pungent piles of human excrement "if you have the money you go to the latrine " says cynthia garway emerging with two girlfriends from the weeds behind a green and white tomb "if you dont you come here " most of the city has been without electric lights or running water for years it costs five liberian dollars about eight cents to use the public outhouse a block away on center street cynthia doesnt have that kind of money she dropped out of school after fifth grade because she couldnt afford the fees the old timers say that most people here used to have a respectful fear of the dead but the war left corpses on the countrys streets beaches and jungles shot blown up or hacked to death now small children frolic and pose on palm groves tombs pretending to be ninjas or rap singers "im expecting death " says cynthia "im not scared of the dead " she is scared of the living though at night she wont enter the cemetery for fear of being raped if its urgent shell use a plastic bag and throw it in the street when nobodys looking the cemetery is an infamous haven for thieves thugs and drug addicts one of the guards year old johnson kollie says that on the night shift he and his colleagues carry machetes during the day sticks will do still everyone knows that criminals run into the cemetery to escape confident the police wont follow some do their stealing inside the cemetery strolling through the graveyard mr kollie points out where thieves have broken open the concrete slabs that cover tombs and pried out the steel bars to resell "dont step in the center " he advises as he jumps from tomb top to tomb top he stops to look at the large box that contains the remains of jallah k prall sr his name hand painted outside in dripping black paint thieves have chiseled away the marble facing and along with it any inscription that may once have summarized the familys feelings about the departed not far away stands a crypt the size of a small garage built of concrete blocks molded in geometric patterns that allow the light to pass inside where rufus dennis sleeps on top of the tomb mr dennis and his friend junior david have lived in this crypt for the past two years both men fought for charles taylor the u s educated rebel turned president who is now on trial in the hague for war crimes once they were done with liberia mr taylors men raped pillaged and slaughtered their way across neighboring sierra leone as well mr dennis joined mr taylor when he was years old now hes and has deep scars where a bullet tore through his right thigh hes unsure whose body lies beneath his bed "its a woman " suggests mr david who is years old it doesnt much matter to mr dennis "the dead wont do no harm to nobody " he shrugs messrs dennis and david own next to nothing a shirt some shorts and a pair of flip flops each some days they haul sand from the beach for local concrete brick makers earning liberian dollars or about &# on a good day its hard to see the future from inside the grave mr dennis "we want to achieve something but theres no way " mr david "no school no job " mr dennis "no home " the united nations sent blue helmeted peacekeepers to liberia in and put an end to the wars in liberians elected ellen johnson sirleaf a grandmotherly technocrat to be president an obvious rejection of the boys and their guns she became a dinner partner of laura bush billionaire financier george soros chinese president hu jintao and jordans queen noor wealthy nations and eager charities lined up to build roads stock clinics and staff schools the world bank offered tens of millions of dollars in grants to rebuild monrovia a decayed seaside city mrs johnson sirleaf put near the top of her wish list a high wall around palm grove cemetery and the world bank wrote a check for &# construction is well under way workers are plastering over the concrete blocks and in the coming weeks will add gates and coils of razor wire to complete the enclosure the impending encirclement already forced a year old former militiaman called jack the witch to move his drug gang the sicilian boys out of the graveyard and a block down center street where young men hawk limp hopeless baby crocodiles to passersby jack claims he rose to the rank of general in mr taylors army nobody around seems willing to dispute that "ive got men all over monrovia " he says "i can call and armed men come " jacks new lair is in a derelict metal roofed house down a narrow passage flooded by rainy season downpours someone has placed broken pieces of concrete in the puddles like lily pads in a pond allowing jack to pass dry inside his men use razor blades to cut up &# rocks of nigerian crack cocaine a drug their commanders once supplied to make them brave and cruel joseph memmeh worries that he too will be squeezed out of his cemetery once the wall is completed and the gates are locked josephs mother died when he was a small boy his fathers new wife wasnt interested in caring for a stepson in when liberia erupted in that final stuttering three month spasm of violence that locals call world wars i ii and iii josephs grandparents took him from his home village and fled to monrovia they walked when they had to and rode when they could in the backs of trucks amid plantains and palm oil at school the other students tease him for being a year old first grader it doesnt help that he has six fingers on each hand now he sleeps with three other boys on one foam mattress in the unlighted shed his older cousin rents across the street from the graveyard its a path he beats every day and his friends muhammed kamara and archieboy gaye know where to find him muhammed and archieboy are scrounging buddies and they have spent the morning sifting through the trash heap outside the cemetery muhammed who is years old collected several rubber bands when he gets he plans to sell them for five liberian dollars or about eight cents and buy some bread twelve year old archieboy whose single front tooth stands out like a domino has been looking for toys he found a bright blue broken computer mouse that advertises the shipping company maersk sealand a yellow cylinder that was once a pen and a can of raid insect killer with just a little bit left inside they bring their booty and join joseph on his tomb joseph craves the routine "i go to the toilet i sit and relax my friends come " joseph says later recounting his graveyard days "i dont like to be alone " see related letter "letters to the editor uncovering family history could bury an ugly past" wsj july
