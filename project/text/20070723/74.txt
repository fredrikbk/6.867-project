amros banking empire and the development suggests how the wealth of chinese foreign reserves may be used to fuel deal making at a time when some other prominent sources of liquidity are in doubt barclays announced this morning that the state owned china development bank and temasek holdings singapores state owned investment company plan to invest billion euros &# billion in the british bank allowing barclays to raise its offer for abn to billion euros and to make of that bid in cash barclays previous offer favored by abn management over the bigger rival offer from a consortium of european banks since the takeover battle began in march was all stock as it stands barclays new bid is still smaller than the billion euro counterbid which is led by the royal bank of scotland and includes banco santander of spain and dutch belgian lender fortis the rbs bid also offers a much larger portion in cash the wall street journal says barclays is hoping that an increase in its own share price to at least pence &# from fridays closing price of pence would close that gap the chinese development banks investment of billion euros and temaseks billion euros get barclays shares at pence apiece and barclays is buying back an equal amount of its own shares ostensibly to avoid diluting existing shareholdings the journal says the terms of this deal see it going through whether barclays prevails in the abn fight or not if it does potentially refashioning the european banking environment in the process another billion euros of chinese and singaporean cash will be invested in what the parties are calling a strategic partnership again most of this would come from the chinese development bank the announcement comes just a few months after the chinese government agreed to make a big investment in u s private equity powerhouse blackstone group whose blackstone advisory unit happened to provide financial and investment advice to the china development bank for todays deal as the barclays announcement notes china development bank is beijings main policy lender handling the likes of domestic infrastructure projects and economic assistance that coincides with chinese policy goals in africa as the financial times points out its an unlikely investor for a big commercial bank but beyond the abn deal barclays chief executive john varley said the investments will help "drive our future development in the rapidly growing asian markets" and give barclays "unprecedented access jointly to provide financial services to the rapidly growing chinese market and chinese companies trading internationally " in contrast with semi official queasiness over large chinese investment sometimes seen in the u s the new u k chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling and bank of england gov mervyn king have approved the deal the ft reports such deals may become more common at a time when the subprime loan meltdown and doubts about the ocean of lending already extended to private equity firms are provoking fears of a crunch in the credit markets reserve rich china may be offering itself as a lender investor of second resort an ever anxious time for globalization anxiety about globalization is being felt by large majorities in the u s and the biggest economies of western europe increasing support for raising taxes in the highest income brackets according to a financial times harris poll "viewing globalization as an overwhelmingly negative force citizens of rich countries are looking to governments to cushion the blows they perceive have come from the liberalization of their economies to trade with emerging countries " the ft says among the people surveyed online in britain france the u s and spain respondents were three times more likely to view globalizations effects on their country as negative than positive that majority was smaller in germany where the economy is more export focused the ft says in all five of those countries and in italy a majority of respondents favored increased taxation on those with the highest incomes and in the european countries large majorities expressed support for government imposed pay caps on corporate chief executives a similar populism can be seen at work in a bill set to be introduced today in the u s senate which would vastly expand federal aid to workers whose jobs have been moved abroad or lost because of imports the bill would offer what the washington post calls a "generous package of income health and retraining benefits" to computer programmers and other service sector workers the majority of the u s work force extending protections that for now are reserved for manufacturing workers democrats says expansion of the trade adjustment assistance program "would begin to reweave the social safety net for the st century as advances permit more industries to take advantage of cheap foreign labor even for skilled white collar work " the post says "by providing special compensation to more of globalizations losers and retraining them for stable jobs at home they say an expanded program could begin to ease the resentment and insecurity arising from the new economy " expanding heathrow fears big disruption the opening of a new terminal at the vastly overburdened heathrow airport outside london poses such a disruption to passenger and airline services that airport operator baa wants authorities to suspend penalties on service quality regulation in a move akin to "what happened after a terrorist attack " a baa spokesman tells the times of london heathrow currently processes million passengers a year despite its official capacity of million which is why its scheduled next march to open a fifth terminal that will bring together the currently divided operations of british airways the relocation of ba arrivals and departures of heathrows business is aimed at easing airport congestion which has been exacerbated by security crises and terror alerts that have led to new limits on carry on baggage and other rules baa now fears the wider reshuffling of airlines will prevent it from meeting the quality areas measured by the government which include the speed of passenger security checks and the provision of boarding piers to airlines "a move of airlines is a massive operation " baa said "we would hope that nothing goes wrong " also of note financial times
