q cells shines light on solaria start up germanys q cells ag the worlds second largest manufacturer of solar cells by volume is throwing funding as well as manufacturing muscle behind a california start ups new technology to lower the cost of generating electricity from the suns rays solaria corp a closely held company based in fremont calif is developing a solar panel that uses plastic lenses to concentrate sunlight on a cell that is specially treated to use far less of the silicon that drives up solar panel costs solaria says its approach allows its solar panels to be just as efficient as traditional ones but for a much lower cost solaria is one of several companies developing technologies aimed at reducing the cost of solar generated power so it can compete with electricity generated from coal or natural gas though there are numerous technologies being developed none of which has yet emerged as the clear front runner q cells backing is significant because it has the potential to give solarias technology an early leg up in the race q cells is increasing its stake in solaria to from by putting in an additional &# million of funding more importantly it is committing to provide the start up with enough solar cells to generate gigawatts over the next years the scale of the long term supply contract is considerable by comparison solar panels that can generate gigawatts were installed world wide last year according to market research firm solarbuzz q cells chief executive anton milner estimated that at todays prices the long term supply contract is valued at about billion euros &# billion although the actual value of the year contract will depend on a variety of factors being able to count on such a large supply of solar cells for years to come could help solaria ramp up production more easily acquiring or manufacturing solar cells which are often in short supply accounts for the bulk of the cost of producing solar panels "we believe only by investing in new technologies will we survive and stay leaders in the market " mr milner said despite decades of hype solar still provides less than of world wide electricity generation it costs to cents to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity from solar panels compared with about three to five cents from burning coal according to the international energy agency venture capitalists have been pouring money into solar start ups hoping for a big breakthrough in materials or methods that will solve the cost conundrum in addition large firms such as japans sharp corp have been working on developing new solar technologies solarias approach involves taking conventional solar cells slicing them into thin strips and spreading them out to double their surface area then a plastic lens is layered on top to concentrate the sunlight by a factor of two or three the company has already started pilot production and plans to ramp up to full scale manufacturing by the end of the year other start ups such as solfocus inc palo alto calif are experimenting with so called high concentrating techniques in which lenses magnify the sunlights intensity by as much as times still others are experimenting with so called thin film technologies that eliminate silicon altogether by replacing it with other materials that cost less "some of these companies will definitely fail " said george scott who worked at bp plcs solar unit for years before starting a renewable energy consulting firm in sussex england called technology leads ltd "but its encouraging that so many are trying to develop cheaper more efficient solar panels there is now scale and more investment in the effort " though q cells investment in solaria is significant the german company is also hedging its bet and continues to invest about million euros a year in other new solar technologies including techniques that dont use silicon the q cells solaria deal also reflects an important trend shaping the development of the booming &# billion solar market which is growing by more than a year the scarcity of silicon silicon is the ingredient in photovoltaic solar panels and is also used to make computer chips despite strong demand the supply of silicon is constrained there arent enough companies with refining capacity to turn sand and quartz into highly pure silicon needed for solar panels and computer chips "its rare for a young start up like ours to secure a steady supply " said solaria chief executive suvi sharma
