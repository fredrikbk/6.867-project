what leahy law means to human rights issues in "the democrats colombia agenda" americas july mary ogrady declares that the longstanding leahy law "mandates that any officer charged with credible allegations of human rights violations be relieved of his command lest the country lose its u s aid to the military " what the law actually says is that if the secretary of state has credible evidence that a member of a foreign security force unit has committed a gross violation of human rights e g intentional killing of a civilian or torture u s aid to that unit not to the country must cease unless the government takes effective measures to bring the responsible individual to justice this law which is supported by the bush administration helps to prevent u s weapons from ending up in the wrong hands ms ogrady also claims that "the countrys finest generals" were falsely accused under the law and that "careers were destroyed and the armed forces leadership gutted " i am not aware of a shred of evidence to support that novel assertion ms ogrady attacks democrats for blocking the free trade agreement with colombia "in the name of human rights " although i have not decided how i will vote on the fta it is regrettable that ms ogrady apparently believes that how colombia responds to the unsolved assassinations of hundreds of trade unionists is irrelevant finally ms ogrady implies that atrocities by the farc rebels are of no concern to democrats even though we have voted for more than &# billion in aid for colombias army and police with no change in the availability or price of cocaine on u s streets and the farc still a menace by now it is not only democrats who recognize that we need a more effective approach sen patrick leahy d vt chairman subcommittee on the department of state and foreign operations washington see related letter "letters to the editor leahy flaw judicial warfare in colombia" wsj august
