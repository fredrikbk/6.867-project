the southwick stonewall it isnt easy to get republican moderate senator arlen specter into a fighting partisan mood but democrats are achieving this rare feat as they continue to block nearly every nomination by president bush to the federal appeals courts after six months in charge of the senate democrats have approved exactly three appellate court judges last tuesday the white house announced four more appellate nominees taking to nine the number now in a senate holding pattern several circuits are in dire need of new judges to cover the work load but democrats are betting they can drag things out long enough so hillary rodham clinton or barack obama get to fill these posts its important to understand how unusual this is the senate and white house have often been run by different parties in the last two years of a presidency and at least some judicial nominees have been confirmed in the last two reagan years democrats confirmed and in the last two bill clinton years republicans confirmed during the clinton years then ranking minority member patrick leahy was the one deploring judicial vacancies in february he lamented that "the senate is back to a pace of confirming one judge a month that is not acceptable does not serve the interests of justice and does not fulfill our constitutional responsibilities " hmmm one a month sounds lightening quick compared to the pace under senator leahys own judiciary committee and that complaint of stalling tactics came seven months closer to a presidential election than we are today the current senate stonewall has been on particular display in the case of mississippi state judge leslie southwick to the fifth circuit court of appeals and thats what has mr specter the ranking republican on judiciary fired up recently he called some conservative activists into his office to disclose that after judge southwick was nominated in january mr specter received explicit promises from democrats that the nominee would get an up or down vote on the senate floor judge southwicks nomination was once considered a consensus choice no one disputes his qualifications and as a judicial moderate he had been unanimously approved by democrats for a seat on the federal district court but the judge has since run afoul of what appears to be a new democratic racial litmus test for judges from the south "mississippi has never had an african american on the circuit even though it has the largest african american population of any state " mr leahy remarked last month perhaps mr bush could nominate someone more racially suitable he suggested in case this racial quota idea didnt fly democrats have also played the familiar race card of particular "concern " they claimed was judge southwicks concurrence in a mississippi decision regarding an employee who wasnt fired after using a racial slur in comments about a co worker that case was one of more than opinions that judge southwick signed or joined but lets take a closer look shall we though the racial slur makes the headlines thats not what the courts ruling condoned the decision in richmond v mississippi dept of human services was narrow affirming the ruling of an employment board created by mississippi law and given broad latitude to set hiring and firing policies across the state in reviewing the boards decisions mississippi courts must follow specific parameters they can only overturn based on a finding of legal error or "arbitrary and capricious" judgment in other words by affirming the boards decision the courts ruling was not on whether it considered racial name calling grounds for firing but whether the state board had made distinct and material errors many from judge southwicks past have stepped forward to support him his former african american law clerk a laverne edney spoke with particular dismay at the racial charges "it did not matter the parties affiliation color or stature " she wrote about his judicial approach "what mattered was the law " now a partner in a mississippi law firm ms edney added "it is unfortunate that there are some who have made judge southwick the chosen sacrifice to promote agendas and have set out to taint all that he has worked so hard to accomplish " mr leahys posse maintains that the broader point is the need for more african americans on the bench but african american judicial nominees dont fare well at the hands of democrats either when president bush nominated janice rogers brown to the d c circuit court of appeals liberal activists called her nomination "window dressing " claude allens nomination to the fourth circuit was opposed by the naacp and justice clarence thomas is regularly denounced by those who claim to care about diversity on the bench its hard to get straight answers on this subject so we were glad for a recent article in the afro american newspapers that at least had the benefit of honesty "judge southwick " the paper noted "is considered by civil rights groups to be too conservative to serve on the fifth circuit " that breaks the democratic code and we hope mr specter and republicans are willing to make judicial nominations a very public brawl
