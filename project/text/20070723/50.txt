networking sites mattel inc s barbie has been under attack for six years from mga entertainment inc s bratz line which dazzled fashion savvy youngsters with splashy multi ethnic dolls sporting oversized features and undersized clothes and made barbie suddenly look dated but now mattel has struck back in cyberspace and this time its mga thats playing catch up on aug mga of van nuys calif is set to release be bratz com an online social networking site aimed at girls ages eight to and based on mgas popular doll clique but the move comes more than three months after mattel of el segundo calif launched a similar site barbiegirls com which the company says already has around three million users on the be bratz site accessible only after purchase of a special &# bratz doll that comes

of customizable avatars users are invited to decorate their rooms and save online dollars for purchases in a virtual store a movie theater plays a key role in mattels online world too with features including clips from barbie dvds unlike bratz the barbie site doesnt require buying anything to join in however it is necessary to buy a &# mp device that plugs into the computer via a usb port to get to special features including access to a "club beauty" where the avatars can get makeovers a pet adoption feature and the ability to use a greater range of hairstyles facial expressions skin tones and fashions the mp player is central to a key mission for mattel winning interest from older girls who have drifted away from barbie in recent years in favor of consumer electronics devices mattel says its again finding its voice with this crowd of registered users on barbiegirls com are and older mattel says the race to win over kiddie computer users is seen as a critical battlefront as the toy industry grapples with the digital age reyne rice a toy trends specialist with the toy industry association in new york touts social networking sites as "the new frontier of the playground " social networking sites online communities where users meet and greet over the internet have long become a staple of the teenage set with the soaring popularity of myspace and second life but little has emerged to serve their younger siblings a niche that some analysts have been surprised to see so long neglected and what could become a crucial venue for the two toymakers now that both have stepped up to the plate thats because for mattel and mga their signature doll lines have increasingly taken a backseat to a larger war of branding that has tagged the bratz and barbie logos onto everything from home appliances videogames and apparel to movies like "bratz " a live action theatrical release that wal mart stores inc has said it expects to trigger sales increases across the mga brand movies come and go but a long running turf war appears to be shaping up online though neither company would say how much it has spent on its new platforms both have invested in two year research and development timelines ramping up in house design operations hiring outside programmers and enlisting scores of girls in focus groups "our fans will want to have nothing to do with barbie " says isaac larian the mga chief executive officer who characterized his coming site as "a major push not a sideshow " mr larian adds that any similarities are only coincidence and that he has never visited the mattel site the fight between barbie and the bratz is already the subject of a legal tussle in which mattel has tried to lay legal claim to the bratz based in part on mattels assertion that carter bryant the designer of bratz was employed by mattel when he did initial drawings for the dolls mattels suit against mr bryant filed in u s district court in riverside calif is set to go to trial in april another suit filed in the same court by mga against mattel is scheduled to go to trial in july mga is accusing mattel of copying its product in mattels "myscene" barbie line among others mattel hopes the social networking platform will finally win over older preteen girls to barbie a group that has traditionally given the companys most famous doll the cold shoulder "unfortunately they havent engaged these girls " says chuck scothon the general manager of the mattel girls division on july mattel reported that u s barbie sales had dropped the second quarter of lower u s sales after four straight quarters of gains mga which is privately held says its dolls sales growth has remained in the double digits since it was first introduced barbies declines have been a wake up call for the buxom doll that had reigned over the market virtually untouched for generations mattel is also striking hard internationally with launches of the site set to occur in five languages including spanish and portuguese in late august about of its current users are outside the u s the company says mga which doesnt have the world wide presence that mattel boasts is nevertheless planning french and spanish launches in the fall both sites have taken into account dangers young users might face on the web restricting free chatting with a system of predetermined scripted messages and not allowing personal information such as names and addresses to be displayed despite the widening rivalry between the two companies on the web experts dont expect online portals to replace the playground anytime soon "its a new dimension of play other generations havent been exposed to " says ms rice at the toy industry association "but i would expect parents will keep their children in the real world too "
