pursuits food &amp drink wine notes when the issue is wine at restaurants our mantra is simple try new things try new things try new things there are more and more interesting wines out there often mainly available at restaurants and not just restaurants where youd expect interesting wines this summer we visited amber an indian restaurant near palo alto calif the wine list was fine but had one real surprise a syrah wed never seen from sawkar family vineyards in california sonoma mountain reserve that seemed like an interesting detour so we ordered it &# and it was excellent far more balanced and restrained than many of todays syrahs making it better with flavorful indian food unusual wines often have interesting stories this was no exception dr raghu sawkar a retired vascular surgeon who was born in bangalore established the case winery in he had developed a love of wine while doing his residency in england on thursdays he and other residents and doctors were treated to get togethers where "instead of soft drinks they gave us wine and cheese " he was so taken with wine he went to france and studied cooking while expanding his knowledge of wine "i fell in love with it " he told us after practicing medicine in cleveland for years he followed his passion to napa valley buying vineyards that had been owned by a grower hit by phylloxera a pest that had killed many of the vines after replanting the vineyards getting a degree in viticulture and enology in and retiring from medicine dr sawkar acting as assistant to winemaker kerry damskey is living his dream he says his wife sudha an anesthesiologist is "my social security she supports my hobby " sawkar family vineyards primarily makes cabernet sauvignon merlot and syrah getting his wine distributed is an uphill battle since distributors want to handle "only the big names " so he markets his wine himself at indian restaurants and wine stores a brother in new york does the same to his disappointment his wine is not available in india the governments taxes on it would be too high he says in the u s many indian restaurant owners and managers dont drink wine dr sawkar says so he wondered how his wine had been handled we said that it had been brought to our table by a very enthusiastic sommelier who had told us a little of dr sawkars story "thats terrific " he said and it was the guest list we were guests of a couple who knowing our fondness for wines handed me the wine list and asked me to make a selection this always raises the question of how much to spend after all it is somebody elses money how should we handle this michael shankman north potomac md this is a really good question and we wish we had a really good answer because the same thing has happened to us and its awkward saying "how much do you want to spend " would put our friend on the spot so we try to avoid the situation by saying "oh you know we like everything you choose " if we must make a choice we find an interesting wine among the less expensive on the list but in general try not to put your friends in mr shankmans position its uncomfortable if you feel you must give them a price range or at least a hint if you see a wine on the list for say &# and thats what youd like to spend say something like "hmm this looks interesting is there anything else you see here that we might like " you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to include your name city and state
