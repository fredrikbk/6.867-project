remembrances edward gramlich former fed governor foresaw subprime storm served in numerous influential policy posts former federal reserve board governor edward gramlich himself noted the grim irony of his last months he couldnt have picked a timelier moment than june to publish his book "subprime mortgages americas latest boom and bust " but as the subprime crisis dominated headlines and whipsawed markets mr gramlich was fighting for his life "the hottest thing i ever did was this subprime book and its going to get a lot of traction and im not in a position to push it " he said weeks before his death in an interview that looked back at his long career in and out of washington but "alls well that ends well " wednesday mr gramlich who had also taught economics and served in numerous policy making roles lost his battle with acute myeloid leukemia at the age of less than a week before he still managed to have a paper on the subprime crisis delivered in his name at the federal reserve bank of kansas citys annual symposium in jackson hole wyo though he was too ill to travel there the paper demonstrated mr gramlichs embrace of the free market combined with a desire to regulate its rougher edges he said that despite its problems the subprime market had been a force for good "a valid innovation" that enabled " million households to become homeowners a large majority of these who would have been denied mortgage credit in the early nineties " in his paper mr gramlich called the subprime market of lending to riskier homeowners a classic boom bust cycle "the predictable result was carnage " but abandoning the subprime market would he wrote be "exactly the wrong message to take from the experience " mr gramlich was a "committed policy person who really cared about borrowers and high quality standards " federal deposit insurance corp chairman sheila bair said "and we all should have listened to him more closely he saw the problems in subprime coming long before anyone else did perhaps the best way we can honor his legacy is to finally put in place the consumer protections he long advocated " the seven fed governors whom the president nominates and the senate confirms for year terms make up the majority of the policy making federal open market committee and are best known for voting on changes in interest rates but they also oversee the regulation of banks and consumer protection laws as head of the feds consumer affairs committee mr gramlich pushed through rules requiring banks to disclose when they required consumers to buy "single premium" credit insurance which critics called costly and of dubious value and made lenders report the rate charged on high priced loans in about mr gramlich concerned that states were letting questionable lending practices flourish proposed expanding the feds oversight to some mortgage lenders that werent banks but chairman alan greenspan rebuffed him mr greenspan has said he doesnt recall the exchange but doesnt dispute it in july the fed announced a joint pilot program with state supervisors to do just what mr gramlich had argued for still even mr gramlich was surprised by the eventual scale of the subprime crisis mr gramlichs father worked as an engineer at eastman kodak in rochester n y where he was born in at yale university from which he graduated with a doctorate in economics in his mentor was james tobin a leading liberal economist who would later win the nobel prize mr gramlich got a job at the fed where he helped develop some of its earliest estimates of how its interest rate actions affect housing during the nixon administration mr gramlich was director of policy research at the office of economic opportunity where he worked with dick cheney donald rumsfeld and paul oneill and helped test the "negative income tax " conceived by milton friedman and mr tobin which gave the working poor cash thus eliminating welfares disincentive to work "it became a laughingstock at the hands of hubert humphrey " mr gramlich said in late july "it was one of the few agencies that was no effective and no killed " mr gramlich moved on to the brookings institution and the university of michigan where he ultimately became dean of the school of public policy in mr gramlich argued in a provocative paper that the real cost of ronald reagans budget deficits wasnt higher rates but the transfer of money from future generations to the current generation the paper drew the attention of rudolph penner who became director of the congressional budget office in and made mr gramlich deputy director in mr gramlich criticized the deficit in dozens of appearances before congress but balanced that with an "immense intellect and also considerable diplomacy and charm " mr penner recalls in longtime detroit tigers fan mr gramlich got a chance to study baseball up close as staff director of the major league baseball economic study committee charged with finding a way to keep smaller city teams from losing money while the committee did recommend a luxury tax the committees work largely fell on deaf ears much the same thing happened after president clinton appointed him chairman of the advisory council in charged with shoring up the social security system the committee split into three camps backers of the old system who wanted to invest the social security trust fund in the stock market and those who wanted to replace it with private individual accounts "the dynamics were impossible because we met in open meetings nobody ever backed down from their initial plan " he recalled "it got a little testy we had real disagreements " mr gramlich took a third middle way a plan to raise the retirement age with life expectancy and to add supplementary individual accounts to government benefits his proposal got serious attention in the clinton treasury but then the monica lewinsky affair broke "the last thing mr clinton could do was come out with something that could be a wedge issue for democrats " mr gramlich said still parts of his plan continue to gain support david wilcox who served in the clinton treasury and is now the feds deputy research director delivered mr gramlichs remarks in jackson hole in his introduction he said "when the nation returns to social security reform as inevitably it will no one will be surprised if the plan that is ultimately adopted closely resembles the one that ned put forward in " mr clinton appointed mr gramlich to the fed in after mr bush took office in republican appointees who were less enthusiastic about advancing consumer protection laws outnumbered mr gramlich but while calling himself "the most liberal person on the board " he sought to forge consensus with his republican colleagues and sacrificed more ambitious goals after the sept attacks mr greenspan asked him to head the board set up to lend money to struggling airlines despite political pressure the board turned down numerous applicants including united airlines mr gramlich usually backed mr greenspan on rates but not in september the fed had already cut rates steeply the prior year but the economy still struggled to get traction that month he and one other policy maker cast dissenting votes in favor of lower rates mr greenspan didnt go along until two months later still the two got along well at one meeting mr gramlich joked that mr greenspan "could change long term interest rates by basis points if he wanted to by just frowning in a certain way " by mid with growth still moribund the fed cut rates again to mr gramlich said that low rate policy "made it very easy" for lenders to offer subprime mortgages "that would be absolutely misunderstood by borrowers " mr greenspan he recalled also worried that "with rates that low there would be some pretty weird things going on out there that we couldnt predict but that would cause problems " mr greenspan has confirmed that he had those concerns the chairman mr gramlich added "was very prescient about that and where it erupted was the subprime market " in mr gramlich was treated for a milder form of leukemia he resigned from the fed in earlier this year the disease returned in more virulent form an experimental treatment put it into remission long enough for him to finish his book about subprime lending while undergoing chemotherapy damian
