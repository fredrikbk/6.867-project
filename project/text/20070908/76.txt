the buzz nasdaq joins ranks with lse to sell a stake in exchange nasdaq stock market inc and the london stock exchange plc are used to clashing but now theyve been working together as nasdaq tries to offload a stake in the lse that it built up during the last of its two failed takeover attempts so far however no one has jumped up for the gbp million &# billion stake nasdaq extended its informal deadline which had been friday for suitors to indicate their interest nasdaq expects to receive several offers for its lse stake in the coming week but hasnt yet received official proposals one person familiar with the matter said representatives from both nasdaq and lse have been in contact with each other over the progress of the sale according to people familiar with the matter since lse shareholders overwhelmingly rejected nasdaqs last offer in december the two sides had rarely talked among the possible bidders for nasdaqs stake state affiliated investors in qatar dubai or singapore and major exchange players like new york stock exchange parent nyse euronext italian banks may also put in a bid to buy at least part of the stake in an effort to increase their ownership of the lse ahead of the completion of its merger with milan based borsa italiana one of the people said one state fund the qatar investment authority is considering buying the stake as a long term strategic investment rather than to build its position ahead of a bid but has yet to make up its mind another person familiar with the matter said nasdaqs bankers have also held talks with their lse counterparts in recent days in which the idea of an investment fund group was also discussed one of the people said it would suit the lse to see the stake go to a collection of funds rather than one large investor which would leave london wondering if it was contemplating a takeover attempt nasdaq likely needs the lse on board because prospective buyers of the stake have called the london exchange to see how their ownership would be received the lse has batted off four separate approaches to take it over in recent years given this exchange groups such as nyse euronext deutsche boerse ag and asx ltd owner of the australian stock exchange are less likely to become strong bidders if nasdaq has to sell the stake into the market that is likely to happen over a period of time and in which case the exchange may need to rely on the very lse executives it clashed with to go on the road and help sell it jason singer contributed to this article
