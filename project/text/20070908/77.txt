the factors that limit minority lawyers success in premier firms while interesting gail heriots "affirmative action backfires" editorial page aug makes one think that affirmative action is merely another government program that hurts those it is designed to help but affirmative action is more than ineffective it is perfectly orwellian in the name of civil rights affirmative action suspends the civil rights of those not in favored groups while mainly liberal affirmative action advocates think nothing of overt racial discrimination against "the advantaged " they bray incessantly about the civil rights of enemy combatants "detained" during a time of war that in and of itself says a lot about where the formerly inalienable rights of the culturally unclassified fall in liberals pantheon of just causes somewhere below those bent on slitting our throats and what the weather will be like years from now for more than years presumably intelligent jurists in the highest courts in the land have turned their otherwise sharp minds into blunt instruments when it comes to denying whites admission to college or graduate school because of their race the courts seemed to be saying that civil rights no longer pertain to individuals but rather are derived by virtue of group membership those supporting affirmative action appear to view civil rights as little more than compensatory privileges for the measurably less qualified university of california officials passionately argued that access to bar exam records should be denied for fear of stigmatizing african american attorneys can anything be more stigmatizing than affirmative action itself it is demeaning not to give adults credit for what they have or have not accomplished by the time they present their credentials to be weighed for admission to a graduate or professional school to try to fit academic outcomes into the procrustean bed of equal outcomes is morally wrong not because intended beneficiaries may not benefit but because individuals should be judged on their own merit as "groups of one " unencumbered by gratuitous attributes such as race and gender that they may bear bernard silverman naperville ill ms heriot restates law professor richard sanders hypothesis that black and latino attorneys fail disproportionately because of affirmative action the essence of the thesis is that when colleges and universities law schools and law firms "reach down" into the applicant pool until they have diversity in their incoming classes they are pulling in minorities who are not competitive doomed to be at the bottom of the performance curve and thus more likely to fail and leave when without affirmative action those minorities would attend lower ranked schools and do better prof heriot did not give a critical review of prof sanders papers nor did she offer solutions to the persistently low representation of african american and latino attorneys in the nations premier law firms and corporations while the sander argument has data and seemingly rational conclusions the set of assumptions it begins with pretty much determines the conclusions it suffers from a host of methodological shortcomings that compromise its findings there are forces and factors that discourage these minorities from pursuing legal careers and cause those who do to face additional barriers to success we know this from our own research and the published research by prof marjorie schultz at boalt hall and also studies described in the abas "miles to go progress of minorities in the legal profession" and in mccas "creating pathways to diversity" series of greater concern than methodological shortcomings is the implication that the best action for the lack of african american and latino attorneys is no action at all we do not accept this there are more reasoned approaches to creating diversity than arguing for or against affirmative action if affirmative action means bringing in people who are not capable of success then it is bad if it means finding enlightened approaches to bring under represented groups into the mainstream and enabling success it deserves our effort and support the argument should not be affirmative action good or bad but how to fashion a successful approach in a profession that is key to a functioning democracy african americans and latinos should be full participants in the profession that by the american bar associations motto is chartered to defend liberty and pursue justice robert major founding partner major lindsey &amp africa houston major lindsey &amp africa is the leading attorney search firm for law firms and corporate law departments in her commentary ms heriot wrote the following "take william kidder a university of california staff advisor and co author of a frequently cited attack of mr sanders study when mr sander and his co investigators sought bar passage data from the state bar of california that would allow analysis by race mr kidder passionately argued that access should be denied because disclosure risks stigmatizing african american attorneys " that statement grossly mischaracterizes my written views regarding richard sanders data request before the state bar of california first as i made clear at the time my comments to the state bar last january represented my personal views and not those of the university of california system second my key argument was that if the state bar provided the data to mr sanders team it was important that others have equal access to the same data a concern shared by several law school deans third while i also wrote about the dangers of "stigmatizing" black lawyers ms heriots lack of context is revealing i was calling for more specific assurances to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of a students identity since the numbers of blacks entering public law schools at uc berkeley and uc davis right after the ban of affirmative action were extremely small these views are hardly inconsistent with principles of transparency last summer richard lempert presented with my assistance written testimony before the u s commission on civil rights we reported that even if mr sander is right about affirmative action "mismatching" african american law students other data problems still skewed his results when we used the admissions model sander espoused rather than the short cut mr sander actually used we estimated declines in the number of black lawyers of to for the admission cycles that is a remarkable departure from mr sanders claim of an increase in black lawyers without affirmative action especially considering that it concedes for the sake of argument mr sanders core claim william kidder albany calif
