mr thompson in repeat citing federal requirements that force television broadcasters to give all political candidates equal exposure nbc has stopped airing reruns of "law &amp order" that feature fred thompson but we were glad to learn that the cable channel tnt which airs more than "law &amp order" episodes each week has no plans to follow suit why should l&amp o junkies have to suffer just because district attorney arthur branch er mr thompson is running for president cable stations dont operate under the same equal time rules though in the past some have voluntarily applied them when arnold schwarzenegger was running for governor of california in fx and the sci fi channel decided not to show his movies apparently watching arnold portray menacing cyborgs while he also ran for office threatened the democratic process theres a good argument for sending equal time regulations the way of the fairness doctrine which required "balanced" coverage of public interest issues before it was scrapped by federal communications commission years ago the ostensible justification for equal time provisions is that in a world of media scarcity broadcasters need to provide a political platform for everyone on an equal basis lest one candidate gain an unfair advantage through more exposure this might have made sense when these rules were written by congress in the s but its a hard policy to defend in todays media saturated world the sheer volume of media outlets today not only renders these regulations obsolete but also makes fair enforcement all but impossible should the fcc ban netflix and video stores from renting mr thompsons old films or how about monitoring youtube to make sure the number of barack obama video downloads matches hillary clintons as long as the equal time rules live so will the temptation to expand their scope to cable satellite television the internet and who knows where else congress should give them a proper burial
