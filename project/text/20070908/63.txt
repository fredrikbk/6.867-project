pursuits style designers tv parties and designing too for michael kors the rise of celebrity in fashion brings a tough juggling act cooking pasta with martha stewart by the end of new york fashion week which wraps up wednesday designer michael kors will have conducted at least interviews attended two book parties and appeared on stage at a "fashion rocks" pop concert in front of thousands at radio city music hall sandwiched in between all the publicity the designers spring fashion collection on sunday the job of a fashion designer used to be about designing clothes but lately its no longer enough for a designer to push high toned intellectual looks to get the attention of critics instead the most successful designers are those who are telegenic media savvy in short celebrities in their own right one of the masters of this game is the year old mr kors who has parlayed his role as a professional critic on tv reality fashion show "project runway" into a perch as one of fashions most successful media stars since he began the show in the platinum blond designer is often stopped on the street and in airports by fans brandishing cellphones to snap his picture on martha stewarts tv show in february he talked fashion and whipped up a spaghetti and meatballs dish in the kitchen editors from harpers bazaar and elle decor magazines ask about his favorite vacation spots his choice of flowers and "what i am going to serve at a summer barbecue " he says "its just crazy " the designer as star phenomenon has changed the business of fashion winning public attention has become an integral part of many designers business models its also raising questions about the kind of preparation needed for the next generation of designers indeed many designers are discovering that juggling public appearances with creative obligations can be difficult the reality of so many media obligations often means a grueling schedule for artistic people who never saw themselves as entering show business womens contemporary designer nanette lepore says that other than the backstage interviews she does after fashion shows she doesnt do too many media events "i dont have the infrastructure in my company to be out all the time " she says retailers are often pushing her to do more personal appearances "but i resist i get a little nervous " ms lepore says "i feel like its something i have to do more now to get my profile out there but it is not my favorite thing " mr kors a colorful speaker who is generally unflappable clearly enjoys his celebrity the new name recognition gained from "project runway" has helped fuel growth of his company which has sales of about &# million wholesale this year according to a michael kors spokesman the publicity from the tv show came just as the company was rolling out "lifestyle stores" in malls over the past three years the boutiques feature a range of michael kors clothes handbags and accessories and also includes items from his lower priced michael by michael kors line "tv has definitely spread the gospel " mr kors says he says that his name recognition has now spread beyond the major urban areas to reach consumers around the u s and the world the show has also helped position his brand which had targeted women in their late s to late s as more youthful "the show brought in an influx of teenagers who will grow with the brand " he says when he visits stores for scheduled appearances dozens of teenage girls line up for autographs and often splurge on a &# belt or a &# handbag from his michael line fame has engulfed many fashion designers in recent years isaac mizrahi for example sang on tv commercials for target stores helping to boost the cool factor for his &# sheath dresses the young design duo behind the proenza schouler label accomplished a similar feat last year starring in tv commercials for a one time guest collection they did for target designer vera wang who just launched a lower priced fashion line at kohls appears in ads for hewlett packard computers with the role of personality so important for designers today mr kors says they need to become more skilled at public speaking and other social skills "fashion schools should spend less time on working with them on doing sketches and more time on media training how to package themselves " he says steven kolb executive director of the council for fashion designers of america the industrys trade group says that in todays media obsessed society designers need to be personable and quotable in the annual design competition the cfda holds with vogue magazine "the judges are acutely aware of their personalities and social skills as well as how talented they are as designers " he says the typically reserved designer phillip lim who won the cfda award for best emerging womens wear designer has made "remarkable improvement" and "has become more comfortable in that public role " mr lim declined to comment through his publicist fashion has long had designers who attain household name status including halston valentino and bill blass beginning in the s but while their names were familiar their products were mostly beyond the reach of most consumers except for a handful of items like fragrances and bed linens whats different now is how mass market mr kors and many of the others have become theyre not just well known their wares are widely sold partly thanks to the rise of cheap chic retailers like target mr kors has had a number of incarnations during his three decades in the business starting in the s he mingled with the young society crowd and ventured to cities such as atlanta and san francisco doing trunk shows to meet clients later he weathered chapter bankruptcy proceedings and then was recruited by french luxury goods giant lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton to design the celine brand in lvmh chairman bernard arnault expressed his pleasure in saying that mr kors "is very interested in commercial success he goes to the celine shop to talk to the customers " also in mr kors discovered how powerful personal publicity could be to his brand e entertainment ran a documentary on him that year helping elevate his profile around that time lvmh bought a interest in mr korss eponymous high end collection and launched his signature fragrance which proved to be a hit "the exposure from that one program was bigger than any of us had realized " he says after his contract ended in mr kors parted ways with celine to return to new york to concentrate full time on his own label which was acquired by designer holdings the investor that masterminded the tommy hilfiger juggernaut in the s through the years mr korss designs have also evolved he made his name at upscale retailers creating sumptuous cashmere jackets turtlenecks and sporty slacks clothes that didnt generate much buzz for his brand but mr kors was attuned to the hollywood zeitgeist he has become fixated on dresses and now creates about five times as many as he did years ago dresses are particularly important to mr kors because movie stars wear them on the red carpet and on the covers of magazines the more arresting the dress the greater chance of publicity "you have a hot actress with this gorgeous face but maybe she is foot and has figure flaws " mr kors explains "so you put her in a dress that shows her bare arms and a bit of cleavage in a bright color in order to make noise on the newsstand you have to bang some pots " and therein comes the domino effect the more interest people have in celebrities the more they love fashion and the more they become aware of designers like mr kors celebrities like jessica simpson jennifer lopez fantasia jennifer hudson and debra messing have all helped draw attention to mr korss designs when mr kors showed up at a nordstrom store in suburban los angeles recently he spent two hours signing autographs on fragrance boxes and "on every piece of paper that wasnt nailed down " he says
