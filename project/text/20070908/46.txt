pursuits books battling times ravages a maverick biotech researchers goal perpetual youth ending aging by aubrey de grey with michael rae st martins pages &# fish oil pomegranate juice caloric restriction diets americans are obsessed with fending off old age by any means necessary but what if science could scrub away the damage and even make us young again iconoclastic researcher aubrey de grey maintains that within a few decades biotechnology will be able to accomplish just that in "ending aging " mr de grey has compiled a list of the seven deadly sins that our bodies commit against us as we grow old from free radical oxidation to cancer for each he proposes a biological engineering project to undo the damage most important his proposed solutions are crafted with an eye toward winning fda approval and venture capital funding mr de grey is hardly just another fountain of youth huckster he earned a ph d at cambridge university seven years ago for his puzzle cracking theory about how a few mutant mitochondria in our cells could cause our entire bodies to age since then he has waged a one man campaign to recruit others to his cause and it is a cause the book sandwiches a hefty portion of biotech between two slices of hard sell mr de grey opens by explaining his mission extending the human life span for hundreds of years if there is a war on drugs and a war on terror then why not a war on aging since these days aging kills just about everyone this idea he says draws irrational objections from otherwise smart people many believe that aging is not a disease but an inescapable aspect of life programmed into our bodies readers who make it through the books geeky midsection will come away with a workable understanding of mr de greys provocative view old age may be only the consequence of lax biological housecleaning take for example the mitochondria that first drew mr de greys attention as you probably learned in high school mitochondria are tiny biological factories inside your cells they convert the energy in glucose and other food molecules to atp the all purpose fuel that the cell uses to drive the biochemical reactions that keep you alive errors in the process create unbalanced molecules called free radicals which run amok through the body vandalizing whatever they touch this includes the tiny bits of dna inside each mitochondrion that contain some of the instructions for the mitochondrion to replicate itself mr de greys doctoral work explained how such mutated mitochondrial dna could lead through a complex chain of events to body wide aging anti oxidant compounds can buffer the assault but you cant introduce anti oxidants into your mitochondria by drinking them youd need gene therapy to spawn anti oxidant enzymes from the inside and such therapy would have unwanted side effects forget it mr de grey says instead of trying to stop the attack we should use techniques from existing genetic research to place backup copies of mitochondrial dna in the nucleus of our cells then we wouldnt care if free radicals destroyed the original for each of the other half dozen processes identified as part of aging cell loss and atrophy junk accumulation both inside and outside of cells the gradual caramelization of living tissue cells that dont die when theyre supposed to and cancerous mutations mr de grey likewise proposes a fix that either reverses the damage or renders it powerless crucially his proposals dont involve genetically engineering a new race of designer children these are after the fact rejuvenative therapies for adults a sort of super sports medicine by the most rigid definition this isnt science mr de grey spouts theories but doesnt perform controlled laboratory experiments to test them still his it might work ideas are based on existing published peer reviewed research he thinks more like an engineer than a scientist never mind how the body works can we fix it to keep it running longer in the books final section he decries the misplaced priorities that have hindered this kind of anti aging research scientists can get millions of dollars to seek cures for alzheimers disease that afflicts the elderly but hardly anyone gets paid to figure out how to keep people from growing old in the first place part of the problem is a complacent adherence to the status quo mr de grey says but he also thinks that scientists are afraid to encourage a revolutionary initiative such as rejuvenative biotech research if science is the new religion he writes then "public scientific consensus is gospel " mr de grey plans to tempt researchers with fortune and fame he now heads a nonprofit foundation that offers an "mprize " similar to the x prize for private spacecraft in hopes of luring scientists to create longer living lab mice through methods that might also work in humans to date private donors have pledged &# million to the mprize fund "ending aging" is just one part of aubrey de greys campaign to win public support for anti aging research whether the book succeeds or not will depend on the willingness of readers to get past the first pages of proselytizing and absorb the science that follows mr de grey is often his own worst enemy talking in circles about objections to his agenda while neglecting to explain important concepts like oxidative stress before using them yet if even one of his proposals works it could mean years of extended healthy living not only for unborn generations but also for those of us already casting an uneasy eye toward the mirror mr boutin is a
