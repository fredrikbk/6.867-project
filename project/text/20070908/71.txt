the buzz marketwatch weekend investor after drinking the good life the hangover may be here you will have to pardon paul kasriel chief of economic research at northern trust in chicago if he hasnt been the life of the party over the past seven or eight years the year old economist tapped in as the top economic forecaster by arizona state universitys w p carey school of business has spent a good deal of that time trying to warn anybody who would listen about such things as excessive household debt while taking a jab or two or three at then federal reserve chairman alan greenspan "illusory" is how in october mr kasriel described the wealth created by mr greenspans interest rate cuts in one of his edgy and somewhat irregular reports dubbed "the econtrarian " which are available on northern trusts web site a few months later as household spending continued to sizzle he wrote "todays partying in terms of a disproportionate share of national output being consumed by the household sector is a recipe for a hangover tomorrow " and in case you are wondering whether mr kasriel has any regrets about having provided less than rosy outlooks that challenged conventional wisdom while others were celebrating record home sales and soaring stock prices he doesnt "i look at the numbers and i have a sense of history " he says as the sound of wind causes his voice to fade in and out during a telephone interview while he was on a sailboat eight miles off the shore of lake michigan where he spent this past week sailing on that lake known for its unpredictable conditions is an appropriate hobby for an economist like mr kasriel he believes sailing makes him a better forecaster and as a forecaster he is concerned more than ever about the economy which he believes could be headed toward a "painful" recession his analysis confirms the anecdotal evidence presented in a recent column here "even the seemingly well off caught easy borrowing virus" april that suggested americans are living well beyond their means "i dont make up the numbers " mr kasriel says "and since the late s ive been seeing trends that are very disturbing " he is particularly alarmed at the relationship between personal disposable income and personal consumption expenditures and residential investment expenditures that is eco babble for the amount of money people take home after taxes minus the amount they are spending on everyday goods and services and what they spend on buying and fixing up their homes according to that calculation americans have been running deficits in six of the past seven years prior to the recent unprecedented string of deficits mr kasriel says there have been only seven other years american households have been so upside down in their finances since two of those were during the great depression three more were just after the end of world war ii another was in then again in that leads to an obvious question if they cant afford it how are people continuing to spend as thursdays report of retail sales suggested they are continuing to do as if all is well the answer which has become all too obvious in recent weeks and months mr kasriel says they appear in large part to be borrowing against their homes which will become less available as a piggy bank going forward "households are going into debt like never before " he says they also have been net sellers of stocks all of this means mr kasriel says that there will be less cash for things we like to buy as an economist however he is well aware that others might not agree with his interpretation of the numbers "there are people who deny man walked on the moon and there are people who will deny this too " he says "but the data are overwhelming that households are spending more than their income " and besides he says "if everybody else thinks the way i do i get nervous " needless to say he isnt which means maybe you should be herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
