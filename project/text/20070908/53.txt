pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations off to the races this week the republican candidates for the presidency tried to make it new again summers over autumns here theyre relaunching i think they pretty much succeeded their debate wednesday night had sparks and fire and a new candidate moved in so while barack obama struggles with a big question of his candidacy how to draw deep blood from hillary clinton without fatally endangering his future in the party and earning the enmity of its power brokers and mrs clinton figures out each day how to slow him and stop him but not right now squish him like a bug which would highlight a reputation for ruthlessness and embitter a portion of the base a look at the republicans in what was a republican week the debate was full of fireworks about iraq about its essentials the rightness of the endeavor and what should rightly be done now from the libertarian ron paul a blunt argument against the war we never should have gone in and we should get out "the people who say therell be a blood bath are the same ones who said it would be a cakewalk why believe them " his foreign policy "mind our own business bring our troops home defend our country defend our borders " after mr paul spoke it seemed half the room booed but the other applauded when a thousand republicans are in a room and one man of the eight on the stage takes a sharply minority viewpoint on a dramatic issue and half the room seems to cheer him somethings going on ron pauls support isnt based on his persona history or perceived power what support he has comes because of his views as he spoke you could hear other candidates laughing in the background they should stop giggling and engage in a serious way mike huckabee and for this i h huckabee shot back that history will judge whether we were right to go in but for now "were there " he echoed colin powell we broke it now we own it "congressman we are one nation we cant be divided if we make a mistake we make it as a single country the united states of america not the divided states of america " david brody of the christian broadcasting network says he doesnt know why mr huckabee isnt in the top tier i wonder too maybe he is and we dont know it john mccain seems liberated by loss once he was the front runner then he was over unburdened by the pressure to do well he has rediscovered the pleasures of the trail the other day when a student was impertinent he pleasantly responded "thanks for the question you little jerk " it reminded me of the time mayor rudy giuliani told an insistent radio caller who pressed for the legalization of ferrets that he probably cared about the issue because he was insane in the debate mr mccain was spirited we stay and fight in iraq "otherwise we face catastrophe and genocide in the region " fox newss focus group said he won as he retools he should speak of reagan in when he was washed up in south carolina and said "im taking this all the way to the convention and im going even if i lose every damn primary between now and then " mitt romney is well he continues to seem like someone whos stepped from the shower and been handed a dress shirt by his manservant george hes like a senior account executive on "mad men " still the most focused and disciplined of all the republicans he did fine the other night but he should get shirt sleeved dig deeper get to his purpose he had the best quips about fred thompsons decision to get in telling reporters "why the hurry why not take a little longer to think this over from my standpoint if he wants to wait until january or february that would be ideal " rudy giuliani proved it is possible to bang the gong too much on leading new york city enough already we heard you move on then come back to it in a few months and make it new again for now can he be thoughtful about foreign affairs not forceful not pugnacious not rote but thoughtful no one knows quite what he thinks as opposed to feels duncan hunter was there so was tom tancredo who shouldnt be when you cant compellingly break through with the issue that most roils the base and on which you were a leader and in agreement with the roiled then you should admit it didnt work and leave but whom he throws his support to who he decides has an immigration stand he can back might have some significant impact on primary voters for fred thompson spurning the debate and announcing on leno was rude and shrewd he loped on like a long tall folksy fella and got a good burst of applause from the audience when he said he was running the web video was fine the second commercial unveiled wednesday too self consciously presidential a young journalist brutally remarked to me of the makeup and lighting "he looks like a skull on a disney pirate ride " he faces three big challenges he has come in saying essentially im not the other guys thats good but raises the questions who are you and the reason youre running for president would be second challenge you can come to the rescue only when someone calls "help " you can save the drowning guy only when he falls through the ice you cant do it when hes skating by and giving you a friendly nod three and six months ago the republican party was looking at its slate of candidates and shouting "help " since then the candidates have been out there making an impression getting known declaring their stands theyve found supporters is the party still yelling "help " is it falling through the ice a third challenge i think is a certain dissonance in mr thompsons persona he seems preoccupied not full of delight that hes at the party john mccain has been having sly fun with the idea of mr thompsons sluggishness when asked why mr thompson didnt come to the debate mr mccain said "maybe were up past his bedtime " i felt this week and to my surprise that the campaign was focusing itself tightening in some way getting serious the next republican debate the first one with mr thompson is sept in new hampshire the first real voting in iowa and new hampshire is in only four months for all our complaints about the endless campaign this one may catch us short it may get decided when we arent watching knowing as everyone told us that we had plenty of time to start paying attention this could move quickly got to watch now
