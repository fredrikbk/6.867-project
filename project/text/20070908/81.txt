the week ahead our take on coming events automobiles latest concept for car makers being all things to all customers by stephen power the frankfurt auto show is normally a venue where german car makers show off their sportiest most technically sophisticated models but when this years show opens next week it will have a more schizophrenic character much like the industry itself manufacturers are torn between producing models that consume less fuel and those that deliver the most performance between serving their established customers in the western world and those in fast growing emerging markets like china and india among the new models expected at the show is a concept car from bmw ag that blends the sporty look of a coupe with the higher ride of a sport utility vehicle but with a hybrid engine that runs on both gasoline and electricity a few stands away rival mercedes benz a unit of daimlerchrysler ag better known for competing on comfort and safety will show off a range of new fuel saving technologies and porsche ag famous for its sports car is expected to present a hybrid version of its hulking cayenne suv the rush by german car makers to offer "greener" versions of their most politically incorrect models illustrates the bind many auto makers find themselves in they are skeptical of customers willingness to pay extra for fuel efficiency yet afraid of being left behind should demand for such vehicles take off theyre also concerned about policy makers in europe and the u s delivering on threats to impose new regulations on fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions stretching the car makers budgets even further is the challenge of selling more cars in china and india while holding on to their customers back home many of the qualities that sell cars in the u s japan and western europe safety comfort horsepower dont loom as large in asia and investments in new factories can cost billions forcing companies to get creative to that end volkswagen ag plans to show off a city car concept that its considering selling in western europe as well as in asia the car whose rear engine is already inviting comparisons to the iconic beetle would come in different body styles to appeal to regional tastes but be built on a common platform to minimize costs key details such as a production site and available features have yet to be announced recently renault sa and its japanese partner nissan motor co announced plans to invest as much as billion euros &# billion on a new factory in morocco that would feed low cost cars and trucks to showrooms in europe asia and north america "to make a cheap vehicle that is robust and reliable and able to turn a profit thats the future of the auto industry " renault chief executive carlos ghosn says of course auto makers arent giving up on sportiness as a selling point one of the most important launches at next weeks show is the new jaguar xf a sporty sedan that can go from to miles per hour in seconds and has a combined co of grams per kilometer well above the european industry average of grams the model with an aggressive looking front grille and curvaceous shape is intended to herald a more daring look for the brand following years of formal lines and huge losses under the ownership of ford motor co yet in another sign of the creeping threat europes auto makers face from low cost competitors one of the leading bidders to buy jaguar is a company from the developing world indias tata group ltd politics why giuliani tries to move beyond reflections of by mary jacoby as he runs for president rudy giuliani has been trying to convince voters that he is more than just the guy who led new york through the sept terrorist attacks but tuesday the former new york mayor will refocus on his role in the national tragedy that catapulted him to the top ranks of american politics and helped to make him a multimillionaire over protests of democrats and some sept families and firefighters he will read a short prepared text at ground zero in a ceremony marking the sixth anniversary of the attacks meanwhile a new video showing al qaeda leader osama bin laden boasting about the attacks is circulating on the internet underscoring the menace that mr giuliani warns of regularly on the campaign trail in his first appearance in three years bin laden lectured americans on their leaders failure to stop the war in iraq mr giuliani has been a regular at the memorial event but now that he is running for president "he has to be careful " said trevor parry giles a university of maryland political scientist "theres a fine line between exploitation and commemoration " on the basis of his sept reputation mr giuliani launched a career on the paid speaking circuit that earned him more than &# million in fees in and early according to financial disclosure reports he has earned millions more through his security consulting and investment group giuliani partners llc and his association with a texas law firm bracewell &amp giuliani llp on the stump mr giuliani embraces his sept persona but is trying not to be a one trick pony he talks about reducing taxes and strengthening the military in a republican debate last week mr giuliani described his term as mayor as "one of the most difficult jobs in the country " adding "im not talking about sept " he touts his record of reducing crime and trimming welfare rolls "it was described as an unmanageable city now theyre writing books about how well i managed it " he boasted but with the sept anniversary approaching mr giulianis critics are pouncing filmmaker robert greenwald best known for his attacks on fox news and retailer wal mart stores inc last week released the first of four planned online videos challenging mr giulianis sept mystique such attacks have done little to dint mr giulianis reputation with republican voters some of republicans view him favorably according to polling firm rassmussen reports which found mr giuliani leading the newest entrant to the race former sen fred thompson by three percentage points nationally among likely republican voters mr giulianis sept mystique is especially evident in south carolina the first southern state to hold its presidential primaries many south carolinians still refer to northerners as "yankees " a sign of mistrust yet polls show the fast talking new yorker to be a strong favorite there though none have been published since mr thompson entered the race "hes this italian guy from new york whos not a hard core conservative on social issues " said mr parry giles "the only explanation i can think that would be driving those folks to giuliani is security and " reinsurance putting a price on catastrophe by ian mcdonald executives who make their living wagering on risks are gathering in the european casino town of monte carlo on sunday at a big annual reinsurance conference there theyll help shape the cost of insurance next year for companies and individuals around the world reinsurers sell insurance coverage to insurers many of the bills from many of the worlds biggest risks hurricanes plane crashes terror attacks reside on their books the prices that insurers pay for reinsurance drive in part what they charge consumers and companies for coverage this years rendez vous de septembre conference held as usual during the atlantic hurricane season marks the start of conversations about reinsurance prices heading into the key policy renewal period it comes at an intriguing moment for the industry there have been few big claims for well over a year and as a result reinsurers like munich re group ag and swiss reinsurance co have pocketed hefty profits but underneath the good news insurance companies now expect to buy less reinsurance coverage and pay less for what they do buy the reinsurers are trying to fight this downward movement to keep up their profits premium levels are closely watched particularly nearing jan when insurers typically renew coverage because a slide can indicate big losses for insurers down the road when claims might exceed the premiums they collected market players say broadly that they see reinsurance as a buyers market with premiums overall expected to be down by high single to low double digit percentages from a year ago in an effort to keep prices up reinsurance executives say they arent going to sell cheap policies and will walk away from business where they dont see a good profit margin "there is no line of business that is not under pressure " says rolf tolle who monitors the business plans and risks of underwriters at lloyds as the london insurance markets franchise performance director "the big question for the conference and the whole industry is will reinsurers walk the talk " falling prices of course dont necessarily mean reinsurers cant still sell profitable policies current premiums for coastal natural catastrophe coverage in the u s remain high enough to be profitable according to most storm models says james veghte head of global reinsurance at xl capital ltd in the growing insurance hub of bermuda with so many participants seeing few ways to grow amid slipping premiums theres inevitable chatter about reinsurance companies merging as well the rocky credit markets globally will likely be a topic reinsurers have little direct exposure to the most distressed parts of the bond market but do have large bond portfolios so theyd be hurt by broad sustained problems in the credit markets at the conference held in monte carlo since the wild card that could change the tenor of the meetings banter would be a gulf coast hurricane this years storms havent driven major claims so far "weve been bloody lucky " mr tolle of lloyds says
