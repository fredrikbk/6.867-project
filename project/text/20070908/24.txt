hot topic listening in when the german government announced arrests this week in a terrorist plot against american and german targets inside germany one telling detail got little notice two of the suspects were identified in part based on telephone conversations intercepted by american intelligence lets replay that u s intelligence intercepted cell phone calls made by german nationals in pakistan the u s passed that information to the german government which proceeded to roll up a plot to blow up targets that may have included ramstein air base and the frankfurt airport this week by unhappy coincidence the house judiciary committee began hearings on the national security agencys al qaeda wiretapping program that program was given a six month reprieve last month but democrats in congress are trying to prevent a further extension if they can muster the votes to oppose a program that continues to protect american lives a la this week in germany if they lack the votes liberals are already working on a plan b which is to try to scare u s telecommunications companies from cooperating with the nsa this would be accomplished by denying them immunity from civil lawsuits verizon and at&amp t are among the companies already sued and they face billions of dollars in potential liability the protect america act that passed last month gave the phone companies protection from civil liability for the six month duration of the law but it offered no protection for their earlier cooperation in the aftermath of the white house requested such retrospective immunity but it was blocked by democrats a cynic might conclude this is one more example of democrats doing the bidding of their tort lawyer financiers but lets assume their motives arent that ugly that still leaves democrats tacitly endorsing a strategy of using lawsuits to gut the wiretapping program director of national intelligence mike mcconnell has said that the potential liabilities are of an order of magnitude sufficient to bankrupt some of our biggest telcos and even if the suits are ultimately deemed meritless in court they could well involve sufficient costs to make the companies wary of cooperating in the future it has already been reported that at least some phone companies are contemplating suing the government to block the enforcement of any wiretapping law that does not immunize them thats how seriously they take the liability risk in this context this weeks debate on capitol hill was often out of this world for example florida democrat debbie wasserman schultz took the mic to pose a hypothetical suppose her child was emailing with a child in iraq wouldnt current law allow the nsa to read those emails former congressman bob barr who was a witness allowed that this possibility "ought to be a very major concern for certainly all of us " university of virginia professor robert turner a rare voice of reason during the house hearing replied that that "if we say the nsa cant look at anything thats got a u s person involved without a warrant were going to give osama bin laden the easiest way to immunize his whole communication system " in other words all a terrorist would have to do to mask his communications would be to cc an american email address putting it off limits to american surveillance which brings us back to those germans and their cell phones in pakistan critics of the surveillance program will argue that they have no problem with america eavesdropping on germans making phone calls to terrorists so the example is irrelevant to the controversy but suppose those germans were calling their fellow travelers in america to plot an attack not against ramstein but against fort bragg does anyone really think that phone call would be less important to intercept than those in germany if democrats want to vote against warrantless wiretaps they should do so openly and accept the political consequences what they shouldnt be able to do is hide their opposition behind lawsuits or the judiciary in such a way that guts the program without having to take any responsibility for doing so
