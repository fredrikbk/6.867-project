weak jobs data boost likelihood of a rate cut housing slump dents builders manufacturers dow drops points the first employment drop in four years suggests damage from the severe housing slump is beginning to ripple through the u s economy and makes it all but certain the federal reserve will cut interest rates this month to try to avert a sharp slowdown the surprise disappearance of nonfarm jobs in august economists had expected would be created based on data such as jobless claims and private sector job estimates was driven by losses in construction and manufacturing the labor department said the jobs report stoked fears of recession sending shockwaves through financial markets as investors scrambled to sell stocks and buy longterm government securities as a safe haven the dow jones industrial average tumbled points or to adding to concerns employment numbers for june and july were revised sharply downward that means the job market was weakening even before financial turmoil erupted last month as long festering concerns about rising delinquencies on riskier loans known as subprime mortgages suddenly spread to other markets moreover some analysts said the jobs picture is likely to darken further yesterdays report covered employment activity only through mid august so it doesnt include subsequent job losses in the mortgage financing industry indeed countrywide financial corp one of the nations largest mortgage lenders on friday said it plans to cut as many as jobs which would be about a fifth of its work force the company has been forced to slash its lending and is expected to report a loss for the current quarter largely because it is no longer able to sell many types of loans now deemed too risky by investors who gobbled up such loans until recently and indymac bancorp inc another big home mortgage lender said it plans to eliminate about of its member work force over coming months the weak report raised immediate questions about the fate of consumer spending which has held up over the past year despite a slowing economy largely because of a strong job market the august figures represent "an ongoing weakening that became decidedly worse with the financial turbulence " said bank of america economist peter kretzmer "this is likely to signal a point at which consumer spending doesnt have the kind of resilience it had earlier " harley davidson inc the iconic motorcycle maker based in milwaukee announced yesterday that it is lowering its third quarter shipments to between and units from a previous projection of to units due to slumping domestic demand the companys stock price fell more than friday the nations unemployment rate remained at a historically low in august analysts said that some parts of the report appeared fluky and that the job market may not be as weak as it suggests for example public school employment fell sharply for the second straight month that might reflect problems making seasonal adjustments for teachers summer break which could start or end outside of a particular months survey period moreover other economic reports are more upbeat in recent days there have been several indications that the credit crisis isnt spreading to the wider economy a survey by the institute for supply management indicated manufacturing continued to expand last month for example and both retail sales and auto sales have been stronger than expected to wall street a softening job market is an especially troublesome sign during good times strong employment encourages consumption of goods and services which supports corporate profits making the profitable companies shares more attractive to buy any weakness in that chain can become a powerful reason to sell stocks the jobs report appears to seal the case for the fed to cut short term interest rates when policy makers meet sept but the size of any such cut remains up in the air on friday futures markets were expecting at least a quarter percentage point cut from the current federal funds target rate of and a high probability of a half point cut larry meyer vice chairman of forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers llc noted that prior to the jobs report "its not clear everyone at the fed was on board" with any cut on thursday federal reserve bank of dallas president richard fisher told reporters a rate cut "is a judgment call and that judgment is still being formed " fridays data are likely to mute many objections to some sort of cut combined with weak pending home sales data for july the jobs data suggest the economy had notably less momentum than fed officials had thought even before augusts markets turmoil but the fed faces a tough choice deciding what size favoring a quarter point cut is the fact that the fed prefers to move gradually so as to assess the results of early moves and to gather new information before moving again it would also assuage concerns by some fed officials principally reserve bank presidents about encouraging further speculative behavior in the future compromising the feds inflation fighting credibility moreover the anecdotal information is more upbeat than the jobs data that contrasts with early when the anecdotes were more "foreboding " recalls mr meyer a fed governor at the time on the other hand a situation in which the risks to economic growth have suddenly intensified and the potential spillover damage of slumping housing is more uncertain than ever argues in favor of a half percentage point cut as for the risk of appearing to bail out investors fed chairman ben bernanke while acknowleding that concern in a speech a week ago indicated it would be secondary to the feds principal mission of basing interest rates on inflation and the economic outlook fed officials had expected some of the employment declines construction related employment had fallen only modestly in recent months despite significant reductions in homebuilding in manufacturing the bulk of the job losses were concentrated in sectors linked to residential construction such as furniture and construction machines as well as the domestic auto industry "there are just not a lot of capital projects out there so we have to spend a lot of time looking at international markets to try to find work " says kim beck chief executive of automatic feed co a machinery maker in napoleon ohio automatic feed makes presses used to stamp metal into fenders and other shapes on auto assembly lines and there are very few new lines being built in the u s mr becks work force is down to about employees from a high of a few years ago as the company has steadily shed workers some manufacturing sectors continue to boom such as those that produce equipment for oil and gas exploration and some high tech items wayne fortun ceo of hutchinson technology inc a maker of suspension devices for computer disk drives laid off of his work force in june or about people since then he says business has accelerated steadily and the company has had to press its remaining employees to do lengthy overtime the overall economy picked up strongly in the second quarter after almost stalling early in the year now economists expect a growth rate of about through the rest of the year before it slows further in the first half of next year for now economists generally dont think the economy will slip into recession usually defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output accompanied by rising unemployment and shrinking profits but most believe the odds of one have risen on only five occasions since has payroll employment shown a monthly decline outside of a recession period said zoltan pozsar an economist at moodys economy com inc each of those was followed by a monthly gain averaging jobs that suggests businesses "seem to hire with a vengeance" after these midcycle slowdowns mr pozsar said "a loud and clear and simple signal from the fed" could help bring such a hiring surge about he added economists said additional layoffs are likely to depress payrolls and push the unemployment rate higher in coming months the subprime mortgage markets meltdown led to at least job cuts at mortgage finance firms last month half of which came after the labor departments survey period ended moreover the housing sectors troubles are far from over home sales were already tumbling even before last months credit crunch froze some buyers out of the market and raised mortgage rates falling home prices will add to the risk of lower household wealth depressing consumer spending conor dougherty peter a mckay and michael hudson contributed to this article
