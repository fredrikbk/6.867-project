pursuits travel asia bangkok inside out our writer calls the city home but finds surprising treasures using a tourists eye phra pradaeng thailand for anyone needing a break from the congestion noise and polluted air of bangkok this is the place in phra pradaeng there are miles of hiking paths crisscrossed by canals winding through mangrove forests tropical wildflowers colorful butterflies and intricate spider webs are everywhere the area is dotted with picturesque old wooden houses of the sort that have long ago been demolished in bangkok i can hardly believe that ive lived in bangkok for seven years and known about this green district for at least half that time yet ive never visited it until now this is despite the fact that phra pradaeng is only minutes from my bangkok apartment including the boat ride across the chao phraya river im a victim of empire state building syndrome the old cliche that most new yorkers have never been to the top of the empire state building can be applied all over the world even the most avid travelers who delight at peeking into every nook and cranny of every continent tend to ignore the delights of their home city if the phra pradaeng trip is any indication the syndrome is a strikingly pervasive phenomenon even thousands of miles from new york andre breuer managing director of recreational bangkok biking ltd the company through which i booked my tour estimates that only to of his phra pradaeng customers a year actually live in bangkok "thai people are not into cycling to start with " he explains "they use taxis as for expats living as an expat is living under pressure you have a job and you have responsibilities " i tend to skip spots like the grand palace and kaosan road because theyre too touristy i prefer the garden of the siam society for instance which has one of the finest existing examples of an old thai wooden house and since ive largely been led around bangkok by my stomach i spend a fair amount of time wandering the sidewalk food stalls lining convent road the stalls are filled with roast pork and barbecued chicken for a dollar or two as an experiment i took a vacation in my own home doing things id previously avoided like eating at busy tourist friendly restaurants and taking tours of the city much to my surprise i actually enjoyed the experience enough so that i went out and bought a popular city guide "nancy chandlers map of bangkok " to plan future trips when setting out to plan my itinerary for this home vacation i used ken kuiper as my model i had met mr kuiper a retired san francisco restaurateur two months ago in a wine store in south africa while on a reporting trip he astonished me by saying that he plays tourist in san francisco regularly "i started doing it three years ago after hearing people from new york telling me of all the new york places theyve never been " he says "ill take at least one day or a weekend every month and make it my tourist time " mr kuiper says his ventures have led to nights or weekends at six of san franciscos top hotels plus a couple of tiny bed and breakfasts hell eat in restaurants hes never tried before sometimes recommended by hotel bellboys as well as concierges "my favorite thing is to take the ferry across san francisco bay to sausalito and return at sunset " he says "its one of the best sights in the city " during my recent experiment i tried three restaurants that were popular with tourists and the trendy crowd usually a recipe for a culinary disaster in bangkok but at one of the three i discovered great food and it happens to be right around the corner from where i live its name is the bed supperclub and the fact that it looks like a spaceship hires muscular young men who wear t shirts saying "bouncer" and demands an id even to visit the restaurant which is separated from the adjacent disco bar were turnoffs to me over the years it turned out to be really fun almost all the seating more aptly lying is on two long beds stretching from one end of the restaurant to the other along each wall visitors plop down and spear food from a plastic table that rests on the bed while a disc jockey plays music and the inventive mediterranean cuisine like lamb loin with artichoke cream and goat cheese was superb even though the &# cost of the fixed price dinner plus wine would buy a week of meals at some of the thai restaurants on the same street at another restaurant i visited the deck the food was a bland and greasy version of thai cuisine but it was still a discovery the deck is in the five room arun residence hotel on the chao phraya river directly across from wat arun the temple of dawn one of bangkoks most beautiful temples from the open air bar above the restaurant you can have an unimpeded view of wat arun which is illuminated at night and of the boats coming up the river as for my three tours they were a complete success the first one a trip on a public river taxi set me back only cents ive long been a fan of the river taxis that ply the saen saeb canal which cuts through the heart of bangkok offering views of old canal side communities that have hardly changed in a century the canal ends in the heart of old bangkok at democracy monument but where it begins somewhere on the outskirts of the city i could never find out since bangkok maps dont extend that far so i hopped onto the boat for an unknown journey its a totally different view of bangkok tiny houses lush vegetation and lots of flowers i had no idea where i was when i stepped off at sri bung rueng temple which was the end of the line when i walked to the nearest main street i discovered i was just a five minute taxi ride from my favorite bangkok restaurant bahn pakwan for all these years ive been enduring traffic jams to eat there when i could have taken the boat the second tour was phra pradaeng to get to the boat pier we walked through a bangkok slum where people lived in corrugated iron shacks then after our hike we mounted a fleet of pedicabs and saw some of the more built up areas of phra pradaeng ending at a local restaurant for a traditional thai lunch the third tour had the satisfying one upmanship of the fact that its not listed in any guidebook i could find from a list of tours offered by purple dragon i picked "the temple of incarnations" wat pai rong wua which is also called "the temple of hell " we headed to suphanburi province a minute drive from bangkok after lunch at a shrimp farm and then a second meal in an old wooden market a thai tour isnt genuine unless its filled with food stops we came upon the year old temple whose grounds cover acres unlike the beautiful calm temples of bangkok this one aimed for the gut to show poorly educated rural thais what will happen to them if they dont lead honorable lives half the grounds of the temple were covered with buddha images some of them huge and the other half was covered literally with scenes from hell hundreds of statues depicting the tortures that come upon sinners i had managed to persuade douglas thompson purple dragons managing director to accompany me after he admitted that his hour workdays in the office prevented him from taking many of his own tours "you get all caught up in a cycle of working and surviving and never experience the things that make your city attractive " he says mr thompson was as open mouthed from his vacation at home as i was "because im in thailand all the time " he says "i dont even think of what actually might be here " trip planner bangkok what to do the half day trip to
