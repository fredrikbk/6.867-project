the weekend interview with bobby jindal in katrinas wake buras la a church is more than a building and faith temple ministries illustrates the point this non denominational congregation holds services in a large white tent behind the frame of its new structure which is under construction two years ago hurricane katrina destroyed the old one buras a community of about is in lower plaquemines parish the southeastern corner of louisiana this is where katrina first hit and the hurricanes effects are very much in evidence on the minute drive from new orleans along the mississippi rivers west bank partly completed new buildings stand alongside wrecked ones trailers sit on the footprints of houses blown away two years ago faith temple ministries is where bobby jindal the second term republican congressman seeking to become louisianas governor has decided to spend the evening of aug the anniversary of katrinas landfall "were here with a faith based community thats done an amazing job not only in rescue efforts but in rebuilding efforts " he tells me as we prepare to climb off the campaign bus mr jindal is an affable policy wonk with a quick mind and a fascination with the details of governance before our interview an aide emailed me a series of press releases announcing his point anticrime agenda his point anticorruption agenda and his point agenda to curb spending as we chat on the campaign bus rolling through plaquemines parish he is full of ideas he faults the states bureaucratic culture for the slow pace of rebuilding since katrina congress has allocated tens of billions of dollars he says but "a very small percentage" has reached struggling citizens and businesses "the federal governments got its own complicated set of paperwork but then after you finally navigate that for the first time ever the state created its own additional bureaucracy on top of that they created it after katrina and so a lot of these projects their fundings been approved and that moneys getting caught up in baton rouge " he vows to reduce this red tape and speed the rebuilding of hospitals schools and other infrastructure "i dont think theres been enough urgency theres not been a realization that the longer you wait the less likely people are to come back " post katrina new orleans has the nations highest per capita murder rate although dealing with crime is mostly the responsibility of local officials mr jindal says "there are tools you can give them for example crime labs arent up and running in full force they were releasing prisoners because of paperwork issues backlog issues we need to give the prosecutors that need it additional time to make their charges we need to make sure theres more protection for witnesses there was a huge problem with witnesses not coming forward weve got a sentencing guideline thats a maximum five year sentence for people who intimidate witnesses " mr jindals air of earnest proficiency makes for a sharp contrast with flamboyant past governors like huey and earl long and edwin edwards yet while louisiana has never had a reputation for good government neither has it always been known as a failed state decades ago mr jindal says "louisiana was ahead of the south if you go back to the early s if youd gone back then and said atlantas going to be the capital of the new south they would have laughed at you new orleans was bigger than miami it wasnt that long ago that we were the gateway to latin and central america " what went wrong mr jindal says is that louisiana got caught up in a boom and bust cycle "the state had all these surpluses had all this oil and gas revenues so there wasnt the fiscal constraint there wasnt the fiscal discipline weve used these dollars and created cycles for instant gratification " so the state was already distressed when the hurricane struck "even before katrina as a state we were th in health outcomes " mr jindal says "we were th in forbes as a place to do business now were th we were the only state in the south with people moving out faster than they were moving in " the influx of federal money after katrina coupled with recent increases in energy prices has produced a new boom and mr jindal hopes to seize the opportunity to avert the next bust "the real danger is youve got a false economy for a few years where everybodys building and youve got sales tax revenues increasing youve got temporary workers here but what that could mask is if youre not rebuilding a solid economic foundation and where i think the governments best role is there is setting the conditions for success then getting out of the way " that means changing the conditions that make louisiana an unattractive place to do business "within new orleans to be specific we can go in there and say now is the time to get rid of the taxes on debt new equipment and utilities our neighboring states dont have these taxes why in the world are we discouraging companies from job creation " piyush jindal was born in baton rouge just after his parents arrived from india in at age he took the nickname "bobby" from "the brady bunch " and it stuck his parents appreciated america as only immigrants can "every day when i was a kid my dad would tell me we live in the greatest country in the world we are so lucky to be americans " he says this sensibility resonated with the upbeat patriotism of ronald reagan who was elected when bobby was "reagan was the optimist the optimistic conservative who believed in the premise of america at a time when there was a malaise people were doubting the american ideals the american dream i grew up saying what are you crazy this is an incredible place " at brown university and later at oxford where he was a rhodes scholar mr jindals political views put him decidedly in the minority an experience he found exhilarating "it was great to be exposed to some very smart very articulate people that challenged my core beliefs every step of the way " in high school bobby aspired to be a doctor but he sought out a well rounded education and this eventually led to a change in plans as an undergraduate he served an internship in the office of rep jim mccrery a shreveport republican he earned a masters in political theory then went to work as a health care consultant at mckinsey &amp co while there he read an article in the washington post about louisianas troubled health care system "it seemed to me that they were going to make a bad problem worse they were going to have more government run health care more spending so i wrote up an analysis of what i thought they should do " it was and republican mike foster had just been elected governor rep mccrery and then sen john breaux were impressed with mr jindals report and recommended him to mr fosters transition team eventually he met the governor elect who proclaimed mr jindal a "genius" and offered him the top job in the states health and hospitals department he was "i realized well i guess im not going to medical school anymore " instead he spent the next eight years amassing the resume of a technocratic wunderkind he eliminated his departments &# million budget deficit by reducing the payroll and aggressively pursuing private hospitals that had overcharged for medicaid services later he served as executive director of a bipartisan medicare advisory commission sen breaux was a co chairman president of the university of louisiana system and an assistant secretary of health and human services in the bush administration four years ago at age he made his first foray into electoral politics running to succeed the term limited gov foster he finished first in louisianas open primary but narrowly lost the runoff to lt gov kathleen blanco a democrat in mr jindal sought and won an open house seat after her lackluster post katrina performance gov blanco announced that she would not seek re election and mr jindal jumped into the race to replace her one reason mr jindal believes he can accomplish his ambitious goals is that this years election will also bring big changes in the state legislature thanks to a measure limiting members to years in office his detailed proposals are part of a political strategy designed to hold the new legislators accountable "political experts would say youre ahead in the polls why do you give them ammunition to attack you with i want people to know exactly what were going to do "ive already said my first special session as governor will be devoted exclusively to ethics itll be an up or down vote on my points " in the last session he says the legislature approved new disclosure requirements but "they killed it in conference committee so they all go home and say i voted for it dont get mad at me those other guys killed it well im not going to give them anywhere to hide " mr jindal says louisianians understand the gravity of the situation "i tell people its our second chance and they tell me no its our last chance theres a nervous optimism in this state theres an optimism that yeah we can change but theres an anxiety that if we blow this in our adult lifetimes this will be the last chance " he is the prohibitive favorite in the oct primary a poll last month gave him of the vote to just for his nearest rival democratic state sen walter boasso if mr jindal gets more than in the primary he wins outright the louisiana democratic party in a desperate attempt to halt the jindal juggernaut last month made an ugly appeal to religious prejudice mr jindal raised in his parents hindu faith is a convert to catholicism although southern louisiana with its french and spanish heritage is heavily catholic protestants outnumber catholics statewide the democratic attack ad claims that mr jindal "has referred to protestant religions sic as scandalous depraved selfish and heretical" and that he "doubts the morals and questions the beliefs of baptists methodists episcopalians pentacostals and other protestant religions " in fact these are wild mischaracterizations of articles mr jindal wrote for a catholic publication including one in which he praised aspects of various protestant denominations worship and suggested that the catholic church could learn from their example the campaign asked television stations to stop airing the ad on the ground that it is defamatory it was soon off the air anyway for it had the opposite of its intended effect "every phone call every email every letter weve gotten has been angry at their ad and supporting us " mr jindal says "weve literally had hundreds of democratic elected officials pastors and others publicly and privately saying they condemn the ad and calling on the party to stop this usually with an attack ad somebody will come up to you and say hey is this really true i have not had one person question me " if the ad was helping him i ask why did he ask to have it pulled my cynical question draws a high minded answer "it coarsens what i think should be a very important election its beneath our state its beneath our voters i think its insulting to our voters " if there is sectarian strife in louisiana it is not evident in buras this is a protestant crowd mr jindal is preceded on the altar by nearly a dozen pastors from baptist methodist and unaffiliated congregations around the state when it is mr jindals turn to speak he delivers a half hour oration that is as much sermon as campaign speech the parishioners respond warmly to his story of becoming a christian a seven year spiritual quest that began in high school when his best friend gave him a bible as a gift "there are people who lost loved ones in this room " mr jindal tells the worshippers "there are people who lost their life savings in this room and i cant imagine having to walk in the footsteps of so many of our fellow residents of this state as they had to live their faith through the toughest times but they were comforted by a god that says you keep an eternal perspective " it is a perspective that may serve mr jindal well come oct mr taranto editor of opinionjournal com is a member of the wall street journals editorial board
