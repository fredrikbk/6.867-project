hot topic debate turns to telecom immunity congress faces a looming debate as it returns from recess should the government grant immunity retroactively to u s telecom companies that participated in government surveillance conducted without warrants while congress under heavy pressure from the white house quickly approved a temporary expansion of domestic surveillance laws before leaving for summer vacation last month it balked at the provision providing retroactive immunity that expansion expires in february and the white house is likely to push for immunity for telecom providers along with a long term extension of the new surveillance laws the bush administration wants to shield telecom providers from lawsuits faced as a result of participation in the presidents warrantless wiretapping program and says the provision is needed to ensure future cooperation from the companies civil libertarians argue that granting immunity sets a dangerous precedent for other companies to violate their customers privacy ultimately the debate centers on what role private companies should play in checking the government heres a closer look why are telecom companies being sued at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc both face suits from dozens of plaintiffs in the wake of the disclosure of the governments highly classified surveillance program plaintiffs allege that the companies broke the law by giving customers call detail records to the government without legal authorization federal law bars the government from obtaining such information without a warrant or other authorization the companies have remained largely silent about their involvement and have been reluctant to testify before congress for fear of violating part of the patriot act the government has already sought to dismiss the cases by arguing that at&amp t and verizon cant defend themselves because they will be forced to divulge state secrets what penalties could the companies face telecom providers could be liable for civil penalties of at least &# per customer for total damages that could reach well into the billions said kevin bankston an attorney for the electronic frontier foundation which sued at&amp t why didnt the bush administration use legal avenues to eavesdrop in order to monitor communications on u s soil the national security agency must obtain a special warrant as part of the federal intelligence surveillance act or fisa after the sept attacks the president authorized a program that bypassed the fisa process because it would have hampered the nsas widespread "data mining" effort it used to identify phones that may have frequently been in contact with lines used by suspected terrorists what changes did congress make to wiretapping restrictions last months bill grants immunity to telecom providers who cooperate with future government intelligence surveillance orders the law also eases restrictions on how often the nsa must gain approvals for surveillance that takes place on u s soil republicans and the white house argued that the changes were needed to update a law that predated cellphones or the internet why is immunity needed the white house argues that private business particularly telecom companies wont cooperate with intelligence gathering if they face the threat of legal liability "allowing foreign terrorists the aclu or anyone else to sue telecom companies because they cooperated with our government in an effort to stop enemy attacks during a congressionally authorized period of war makes absolutely no sense " says robert turner a university of virginia law professor who testified wednesday before the house judiciary committee national intelligence director mike mcconnell confirmed for the first time last month in an interview with the el paso times that the private sector cooperated in the surveillance program what repercussions could immunity have civil libertarians and consumer advocates have decried immunity provisions as an end run around the legal system they argue that companies have a responsibility to protect their customers privacy and warn that the provision sets a dangerous precedent if granted immunity "these telecom companies will have absolutely no future incentive to perform that independent objective of being a privacy guarantor for their customers " says timothy sparapani senior legislative counsel for the american civil liberties union at least one telecom provider qwest communications international inc rejected the nsas request for access to customers private telephone records nick timiraos points of view do we expect private industry and in particular telecommunications companies to serve as protectors of civil liberties against the government " david kris former justice department official facts congress enacted the foreign intelligence surveillance act in after an investigation revealed that the national security agency had been intercepting telegram
