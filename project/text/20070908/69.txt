talent scouts for cirque du soleil walk a tightrope ms giassons tiny acrobat just might be too unique losing the irreplaceable montreal the first time line giasson saw the tiny brazilian she thought "this is something special " not quite four feet tall he had a square jaw the skills and build of a gymnast and the stage presence of a matinee idol he was she realized perfect material for cirque du soleil but as director of the companys casting department ms giasson faced an unusual personnel problem what if the circus invested millions of dollars and years of preparation incorporating him into a show and then he had to be replaced "let me tell you this is our nightmare " says ms giasson who came to cirque du soleil years ago "its quite possible there isnt another person on the planet quite like him " as cirque du soleil rolls through its rd year and prepares to expand to shows by the end of from today it has become one of canadas marquee cultural exports and a &# million a year business cirque du soleil shows will appear in countries this year drawing nearly million people scouts like ms giasson will travel the world scour the internet and vet thousands of unsolicited applications to fill new roles in their quest they have created a database of potential performers among them giants including a ukrainian who is foot whistlers contortionists pickpockets skateboarders clowns eight dislocation artists and people classified simply as small but a problem arises when talent is truly unique and either difficult or impossible to replace if for example one enters the words "giant" and "opera" into the database only one name pops up victorino antonio lujan a year old argentinian who stands just shy of seven feet and weighs about pounds benoit laroche a casting adviser in montreal ran across mr lujan taking up two seats at a circus in buenos aires in mr laroche asked him whether he was an artist thinking he might be a circus performer "he said yes i am an opera singer " recalls mr laroche who knew instantly he had found a potential star still it took six years before mr lujan ended up in a show paired with a diminutive soprano working with such singular talent forces cirque to walk a tightrope the artistic side is always looking for new acts the business side wants to make sure they arent irreplaceable so it was with both excitement and some trepidation that celine lavallee the head talent scout sent out an email six years ago to hundreds of contacts all over the world seeking "unusual acts " among the thousands of tapes she received in response was a danish husband and wife acrobatic team then both in their mid seventies in the five minute dance routine ms lavallee watched the man lifted his gray haired leotard clad wife with one hand above his head until she stood on his shoulder one leg extended above her then balanced on his raised arm she held herself in an arrow straight handstand "i was watching the tape and i called all my colleagues in i said look look this is amazing " ms lavallee says for two years the couples performance was worked into a story line under the theme of enduring love then the womans hip began to hurt and ms lavallee received the inevitable call from the shows director find a replacement telling the story in a tiny conference room on the third floor of the companys sprawling square foot training center ms lavallee cradled her face in her hand at the memory the challenge she said seemed next to impossible "there are not several artists like this in the world " said ms lavallee who as a dancer in a world traveling troupe built up significant contacts before joining cirque seven years ago "but we are like a store we receive casting calls and we do our best " as a temporary fix she went to a waltz competition in ontario where she saw a particularly graceful and charismatic elderly canadian couple with no professional experience "i walked up to them and said i am from cirque du soleil would you like to be in our show " ms lavallee said within hours they were dancing before people in las vegas a few months later ms lavallee found a septuagenarian couple from florida who had once performed on the "ed sullivan show" and worked in vegas when frank sinatra was performing there when they were brought in to audition the couple could still do some of their more physically demanding moves they performed for two years when they retired cirque officials decided to kill the act a cirque du soleil performance does not fall neatly into any single category it is theater circus and spectacle the shows follow a narrative develop sometimes surreal characters and insert them into scenarios filled with implausible physical feats contortionists bend their legs over their heads and stack themselves on top of one another teams of trampolinists bounce off multisided nets and fly feet through the air tiny women float through the arena on helium balloons to find performers of such feats scouts frequently cast accomplished athletes twenty one of the approximately cirque du soleil performers are former olympians two won gold medals in synchronized swimming the majority have backgrounds in acrobatics or traditional circus arts last week in one of the dance studios in the training facility on the outskirts of montreal two dozen european gymnasts in shorts and leotards swayed and leapt as an instructor shouted directions in english while a russian interpreter translated each performer invited to this general training was trying to learn the theatrical grace necessary to earn a spot in a show after three or four months they will perform for cirque employees derek stangel a year old trampolinist from mason city iowa recently made it through to the next stage and signed a contract a cirque scout spotted mr stangel at a trampoline competition last year and urged him to apply for a role his days are now filled with dance and pilates classes and tutorials on the teeterboard which resembles a seesaw and the chinese ropes a sticky rope that hangs down from above the stage allowing the performer to do various gymnastic stunts "some of the skills transfer " he says "but a lot of this is pretty new to me " while good trampolinists are rare handsome dwarfs who can pull off complex moves with subtle grace are even more so one is year old alan j silva the acrobat from brazil who stands feet inches tall mr silva first came to the attention of cirque scouts in december at an audition in sao paulo "he walked as if were a prime minister or the president of the united states " ms giasson said at the time there was no immediate need for a performer with mr silvas characteristics but ms giasson entered his profile into the casting database three years later a director developed a show called "zumanity" that incorporated performers able to challenge the audiences notions about traditional love and sexuality a role was created especially for mr silva who now appears regularly in las vegas mr silva performs bare chested wearing a white cape blue contact lenses and leather slippers he appears throughout the show dancing and flying through the air with a nearly foot tall female gymnast two years ago when mr silva hurt his shoulder and underwent surgery another little person was brought in from brazil to play his part "it just didnt work out " said ms giasson the act was made into a solo until mr silva was able to return "a few days ago after a show a group of little people wanted to meet me " says mr silva "even they said they had never met anyone like me "
