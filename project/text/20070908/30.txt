landmark patent bill gains house approval washington the house approved legislation that would overhaul the nations patent system setting aside concerns that the measure could weaken intellectual property protections and expose american businesses to greater foreign competition the initiative which is backed by a coalition dominated by major technology and financial services firms is designed to make the u s patent system more compatible with todays modern economy advocates of the legislation say the current system stifles innovation by encouraging litigation and costly judgments against infringers under the legislation patents for as long as years would still be granted by the government but the legislation would introduce fundamental changes to the system making patents harder to get and easier to challenge the legislation is also intended to limit big damage payments by violators a companion bill is moving through the senate and fridays vote in the house is expected to give added momentum to that measure democratic leaders hope to bring the senate bill to the floor by mid october before the legislative calendar becomes ensnarled in partisan fights over iraq and the federal budget in debate friday house judiciary chairman john conyers a michigan democrat said the legislation is needed to ensure that the nations patent rules remain a "driving force for competitiveness " opponents contended the measure goes too far and would weaken the value of patents "foreign and domestic technology thieves are licking their chops " said republican rep dana rohrabacher of california he argued that companies in india china south korea and japan would have new advantages over u s firms "it will destroy american competitiveness " among other things the legislation would make it easier to challenge a patent already approved by the u s patent and trademark office in addition to the existing methods of challenging a patent such as through litigation the legislation would create a process overseen by a panel of administrative judges designed to test the validity of already granted patents the legislation would also create a "first to file" system for granting patents bringing u s rules in line with those used widely in the developed world under the current u s system patents typically go to the first inventor under the "first to file" system the patent would go to the first individual or entity that files a claim with the government supporters said such a change would streamline the patent approval process by eliminating debates over who came up with an idea first critics worry that smaller companies and individual inventers would be put at a disadvantage while companies such apple inc and bank of america corp have put their weight behind the broad and complicated bill many others have opposed it a coalition of pharmaceutical and biotech companies have voiced concern as have many heavy manufacturers including caterpillar inc and dow chemical co the divisions within american business have created some discomfort among lawmakers "why should we place ourselves in the situation of picking winners and losers " said rep don manzullo an illinois republican who opposes the measure
