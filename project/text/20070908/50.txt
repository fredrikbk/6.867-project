pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink in a league of their own the ivy league that is in the late s the san francisco waterfront was still a pretty rough and tumble place with a scrum of scruffy warehouses crowded along the wrong side of the railroad tracks but in came a wave of gentrification driven by importers eager to turn those warehouses into direct selling showrooms catering to the "mink and cadillac trade " the transformation there where longshoremen had taken to the ramparts in the labor wars of the s was felt most acutely by the men tending bar in the neighborhoods saloons "i hadda go out and buy a bartenders guide " the man behind the stick in one joint complained to newspaper columnist stanton delaplane before the carriage trade turned up he said "the only orders i had in here for years is just two either single or double shots " the longshoremen and sailors slugged their gin straight free from vermouth the bartender knew the times were changing when some ivy league toffs wandered in "youll think im kidding " the saloon keeper told delaplane "but i got an order couple nights for a yale cocktail " yale wasnt the only ivy with a cocktail to its name depending on the bartenders guide the saloon keeper bought he likely would also have found cocktail recipes immortalizing harvard princeton cornell columbia and brown dartmouth and the university of pennsylvania seem to have missed out when the collegiate cocktails were being named sadly these drinks have been all but forgotten and in the rare instance where one persists the yale the cocktail has become a parody of its former self cocktail books of the s and s record many variations on the yale theme theres a yale cocktail made of gin orange bitters and angostura theres one that calls for gin dry vermouth orange bitters and a dash of the sweet colorless cherry liqueur called maraschino another uses sweet old tom gin and sweet vermouth but go to the yale club in new york these days and ask for a yale cocktail and you will get a drink of gin dry vermouth and in honor of the universitys colors blue curacao im not a fan of curacao that is blue an unnatural hue for an orange liqueur and as it turns out the blue curacao is just an unfortunate substitute for a long defunct ingredient the bluish yale cocktail once got its color from creme yvette a liqueur flavored with violet petals vanilla and spices happily there is at last an acceptable substitute among the austrian liqueurs being imported by haus alpenz is a creme de violette that restores the yale cocktail to a place of subtle taste and elegant dignity a status impossible for any drink that relies on blue curacao lets hope they lay in a bottle at the yale club and what of the bulldogs rivals i asked bartenders at the harvard clubs in new york and boston whether they had ever been asked for a harvard cocktail none even knew such a drink existed which is a shame because the harvard is a fine sophisticated drink that should have a wide following among alums the drink was once well enough established to be honored with its own entry in the "standard encyclopedia of the alcohol problem " made with equal parts cognac and sweet vermouth with a dash of angostura bitters the drink is a sort of brandy manhattan increase the cognac quotient to three times the vermouth and you have a drink also known over the years as a metropolitan cocktail it is as delicious as it is aristocratic the harvard faculty club in cambridge has created a drink worthy of longshoremen a glass of straight iced gin they call a harvard yard for traditions sake they might want to consider instead another drink named after the university a tasty refresher called the harvard cooler apple brandy lime juice sugar and soda water on the rocks in a highball glass sebastian serino has been tending bar for years at new yorks princeton club asked about the princeton cocktail he laughs "last time i can remember making one i didnt have gray hair " no wonder a dry gin martini with a squeeze of lime juice it is one of the most appalling concoctions ever devised a close competitor is the cornell special gin benedictine and lemon juice but the good news for princetonians is that the other cocktail named after the school is a mix of gin port and orange bitters and it is surprisingly good the gin leavens the sweetness of the port letting the signature nuttiness of the fortified wine come through you can shake all the ingredients together but i think the best way the drink has been made is the two tone approach shake the gin and bitters with ice and strain into a cocktail glass then gently pour in the port allowing it to settle in the bottom of the glass on top goes a twist of lemon peel with football season upon us one has to admit the ivies are unlikely to ever regain their gridiron bona fides p j orourke watched the harvard football team in action a few years ago and wondered if the radcliffe womens chorus had found its way onto the field but when it comes to drinks the alumni have a taste of those glory days within their grasp ten thousand men of harvard may want victry today but theyll have to settle for a decent
