pursuits books writers block the ecstatic storyteller descents of memory by morine krissdottir overlook duckworth pages &# porius by john cowper powys overlook duckworth pages &# almost years ago george steiner made an arresting admission in a new yorker essay having "stumbled across" john cowper powyss novel "wolf solent" in late adolescence mr steiner wrote "i felt my inward existence to be changed felt myself to be in the intoxicating grip of a master " mr steiner isnt the only distinguished powys admirer henry miller iris murdoch martin amis and margaret drabble have all praised his work writing last year ms drabble compared powyss fictional world to j r r tolkiens calling it "less visited than tolkiens" but "as compelling and it has more air " a descendant of john donne and the poet william cowper john cowper powys certainly had a distinguished literary pedigree still his books remain little known the canadian novelist robertson davies blamed powyss low profile on the fact that he was never welcomed by the academic world which scorned his fervent literary lectures as "un scholarly " powys the son of a vicar was born at shirley in derbyshire england he wrote novels and many works of criticism and philosophy and he spent more than years on the lecture circuit in the u s winning a reputation as a brilliant interpreter of western literature and culture he died at age in the welsh village of blaenau ffestiniog powys didnt really hit his stride as a writer until he was almost in when he published "wolf solent " the story of a young mans rebellion against the modern world set in a rural english town its an indication of powyss vigor that he was still writing about a young mans travails when he finished "porius" in at age morine krissdottirs biography of powys "descents of memory " offers invaluable keys to understanding the man and his work ms krissdottir admits to being both drawn to and repulsed by powys yet she writes "the greatness of this wayward writer i have never questioned " one anecdote which powys recalled in his "autobiography " gives an indication of his hyper sensitivity and inescapable sense of guilt it was a boyhood memory of transferring tadpoles from a pond to puddles where they would eventually die "powys remembered this scene all his life " writes ms krissdottir "and it marked the beginning of what he called his diseased conscience he came to believe that this childish diversion was not an innocent game but a deliberately sadistic act for which he had to atone his expiation was to reverse the crime by rescuing young fish from shallow ponds and putting them into safer waters he was still carrying out this self imposed penance sixty years later " powys married in but lived separately from his wife and son born in for most of his life steadfastly supporting them nonetheless in when one of his lecture tours took him to joplin mo powys met phyllis playter he was years old she was for the next years until his death playter would be his companion copy editor and the incarnation of a "sylph like" feminine ideal that powys celebrated in his fiction according to ms krissdottir most of powyss fictional characters are based on family members and friends and aspects of his own personality appear in each of his heroes powys inhabited an enchanted world of his own imagination guided by private eccentric rituals it was a life beset by acute physical ailments and nagging financial problems aggravated by his almost irresponsible generosity he was also a maverick intellectual a kind of autodidact known for his erudition his passion for literature and spiritual truths his loathing of modernity and the machine age and his deep understanding of myths and the questions that have absorbed philosophers throughout the ages all these qualities are at play in "porius " the novel that powys regarded as his masterpiece abridged in earlier editions "porius" has just been published for the first time as the author intended according to the editors ms krissdottir and judith bond this story set in the year covers one week in the life of porius the son of the prince of edeyrnion in north wales edeyrnion is one of the kingdoms that the romans have recently given to the celts on the condition that they remain loyal to rome and keep the indigenous population under control but these forest people as they are called are threatening to rebel against the celts and have formed an alliance with the saxons who are converging on edeyrnion with violence in mind powys who was fond of paradox presents his hero as a man of herculean strength who nonetheless lacks confidence and is given to introspection and brooding poriuss quest to save edeyrnion is hampered by the competing designs of two women his mother and morfydd his betrothed "porius" is a complex epic in which passages of galloping action contend with long metaphysical digressions the novel is electrifying at times plodding at others though faced with danger porius is often distracted by some feature of his surroundings that launches him into abstract musings and launches powyss florid quirky style into high gear "his thoughts renewed themselves " powys writes of porius "expanded their cramped tendrils glowed richly coral red in their ancient sun spawned freshness while a spiritual bubble of interior excitement drawn from the pool of his nethermost being that had been gathering in his soul all that day floated off into the twilight " powys called the novel a "fairy tale " and it is certainly filled with magic and enchantments among them an owl that turns into a beautiful girl "porius" can also be read as a historical romance a war novel and a veiled portrait of powys himself and his relationships with others and then theres the sensuality which suffuses powyss work in one scene the sorceress nineue helps porius decipher his mothers handwriting "touching his shoulders with the tips of her fingers and whispering suggestions in his ear " with just a few brush stokes powys creates more sensual power than the anatomical boilerplate that passes for erotic today not that he is demure about sex oedipal and incestuous threads run through the story there is an instance of necrophilia and a fertility rite fiction also seems to have given powys a vehicle for working out the torments of his lifelong struggle to make peace between his powerful sometimes "auto sadistic" urges and his overwhelming sexual guilt the pages of "porius" are geysers of words sometimes poetic and profound sometimes awkward and far fetched ideas perch "like moulting birds in the threshold" of poriuss brain powys also cant resist unloading the full cargo of welsh names of which the heros full name porius ab einion ab iddawc ab edeyrn ap cunedda is one of the more concise but powys also creates many scenes of memorable power and beauty all of nature seemed to speak to his febrile sensibility even stones and fungi and his descriptions combine a naturalists eye for detail with a poets haunting vision "this spectral light of dawn with its phantom sense of drowned populations rising and falling on the grey waves of oceanic floods " in many ways "porius" is a great exhilarating work it might depict a magical world but it is one that addresses one of everyday lifes essential challenges reconciling the inevitability of death with an ecstatic embrace of the present mr gurley lives in vinland kan he is a retired columnist and book review editor for the kansas city star
