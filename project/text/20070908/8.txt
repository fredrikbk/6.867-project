chrysler looks abroad for revival former gm china chief to lead asia operations nardelli shows some cards chrysler llc chief executive robert nardelli said he hopes to expand the u s auto makers presence overseas a point underlined by the hiring friday of another prominent auto industry veteran this time to run chryslers asian operations chrysler said it hired phil murtaugh who served as chief of general motors corp s china operations before becoming an executive vice president at a unit of one of chinas largest state owned auto manufacturers shanghai automotive industry corp mr murtaugh is the third senior executive that chrysler and majority owner cerberus capital management llp have lured away from a rival company within the past month in a speech to the automotive press association in detroit mr nardelli said he has been on a "vertical learning curve" since taking over as chrysler ceo last month he outlined general goals for the company including boosting quality improving fuel economy and increasing its presence overseas but he steered clear of specific targets notably on quality he said in response to a question about former chrysler ceo dieter zetsches pledge to match toyota motor corp quality levels by this year "youre not the first person whos mentioned that im not making a commitment " but from behind the careful words mr nardelli let peek an ambition to expand chrysler not just cut its costs "we have to right size the revenue " mr nardelli said mr murtaugh who is widely credited with building gms successful business in china will leave his post at shanghai automotive to join chrysler as ceo of its asia operations he will remain in china and report to michael manley executive vice president of international sales chrysler is looking to expand overseas sales and recently signed a deal with chinas chery automobile co under which chrysler will export chery cars around the world under its dodge brand "it is an offer i just cannot turn down " mr murtaugh said in a prepared statement about his new job on thursday chrysler said it had hired jim press the top american executive at toyota mr press will join tom lasorda in reporting to mr nardelli both mr press and mr lasorda chryslers former ceo will each have the titles of president and vice chairman and split duties a person familiar with the matter said chrysler doesnt have immediate plans to announce additional hires but said it is looking in areas of product development design and quality mr nardelli said he is looking at ways to retrain employees chrysler already has in leadership practices and other areas like mr nardelli and other chrysler executives compensation for mr murtaugh and mr press will be tied to the performance of the company because they will receive equity in chrysler people familiar with the matter said details of their compensation havent been disclosed but people familiar with the matter say cerberus has been offering packages well above the industry norm cerberus has offered top executives in the range of to equity stakes in their operations depending on the size of the company the price cerberus paid for the operation and other factors at some small to medium size companies it has bought cerberus has offered the management team a total of to in equity in the form of regular stock options stock appreciation rights or restricted stock ceos typically get about in equity while chief executives at larger firms might get about that doesnt include lucrative signing bonuses and other perks people familiar with the matter said for cerberus owned aegis mortgage corp which filed for bankruptcy court protection in august the company has come up with an incentive plan for top executives that is tied to performance goals such as getting debtors to sell a or return at least of mortgage loans closing branches and other benchmarks according to court documents the incentive plan gives executives a maximum of &# million in incentives on top of their salaries if they meet those performance goals specific base salary information bonus offers and other information was sealed in court in the meantime aegis has laid off a substantial number of its employees and cut off their health insurance including temporary benefits extended to former employees under cobra or the federal consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act chryslers new private equity owner can afford to offer pay packages that exceed the industry standard in part because chrysler now a private company no longer needs to publicly disclose executive compensation or fear a shareholder revolt over it moreover much of the compensation is tied to equity so executives will reap their biggest rewards only if chrysler manages a turnaround mr nardelli also reiterated his desire to speed up chryslers recovery using the restructuring plan laid out in february that calls for job cuts and a &# billion investment in engine systems aimed at improving fuel economy he said decisions would be made with a quick "yes" or "no" instead of a "slow maybe "
