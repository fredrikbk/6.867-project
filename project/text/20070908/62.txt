pursuits sports youth athletics these kids are a kick for sons a fathers coaching creates a dynasty making yard field goals at age upland calif less than two weeks into his freshman year of high school jake van ginkel is already something of a football legend a youtube video of his feats has been viewed well over a thousand times and last year the varsity team stopped practice to watch his training routine jake is considered by some to be one of the most promising placekickers in the country he can kick a field goal from yards a distance that would give many pro kickers trouble the year old is also part of one of the more unusual sports experiments in the country his father pete has five sons and has set out to turn each of them into college kickers using an elaborate regimen of physical and mental exercises jake made his high school debut earlier this week on a field nestled at the foot of the san gabriel mountains here converting his first field goal attempt a yarder a crowd of several hundred upland high school fans cheerleaders and players erupted and jakes father declared from the sidelines that the kick would have been successful even from another yards farther away "i just want to be consistent with my field goals and try to make all of them " jake said after the game the sports world is rife with athletes earmarked for stardom as toddlers and parents who become their self styled coaches earl woods famously had his son tiger studying the basic elements of a golf swing from his high chair most of these prodigies grow up with dreams of hogging the spotlight mr van ginkel is part of a different world a subculture of young athletes who aspire to star in much less glamorous functions in a game marked by outlandish displays of muscle and speed as well as thunderous collisions placekickers dont exactly stand out yet a growing number of kids are paying hundreds of dollars to train at special kicking schools where a strong showing can boost their standing on kicking web sites that cater to college coaches the ray guy kicking camps attract some young kickers and punters per year double what the camps drew in says camp director rick sang one draw for families the ability to kick a ball far and accurately is increasingly a meal ticket to college coaches these days prize kickers who can pin an opposing team deep in their own territory forcing them to march farther down the field to score as many as kickers and punters a year now receive full scholarships from a division i football program up from about a decade ago says chris sailer a former ucla kicker who now runs a chain of kicking camps the mastermind behind jake whose best kick is just yards shy of the nfl record is pete his year old father several nights a week during the summer mr van ginkel who owns a welding business packs dinner and his boys ranging in age from to into his ford pickup and drives to a field at a small nearby college there the van ginkel boys spend minutes at dusk pounding kicks through the uprights and running up and down the bleachers wearing weighted backpacks to improve their mental toughness mr van ginkel built a deliberately narrow goal post on the practice field outside of the high school stadium mr van ginkel who is thickly built with a graying goatee grew up in nearby chino calif he played running back and kicker in high school then spent a year at azusa pacific university in azusa calif where he was the starting placekicker for one game now a volunteer coach mr van ginkel is known to approach head coaches on the sidelines to urge them to let kickers including his sons attempt long field goals on fourth downs the van ginkels kicking experiment began around with the eldest son peter a skilled soccer player mr van ginkel decided he had football kicking potential and began working on his technique the younger boys tagged along for these practice sessions and before long mr van ginkel was running an unofficial kicking academy "they all wanted to kick " he said at jakes game earlier this week jakes mom and all four of his brothers were also at the game so far mr van ginkel has yet to produce a division i kicker in peters second season he could kick the ball yards but poor grades prevented him from getting a scholarship he and his father say mr van ginkels second son matt preferred kicking the ball off the front of his foot instead of the traditional soccer style recommended by coaches as a result says mr van ginkel matt a senior doesnt have the leg strength of his older brother he has since stopped playing peter says he tired of the endless practice which involved kicking hundreds of balls a day but he also wishes he had gotten started even earlier and worked harder academically "i should have worked my butt off " says peter now an electrician jake by contrast is getting attention from coaches at a young age he is a serious student who doesnt have a steady girlfriend although the high pitched screams of "jake" throughout his recent game suggest he has some options in that department for now jake is kicking for the freshman team because the varsity kicker a senior is one of the best in the state jake still suits up for the varsity games which is highly unusual for a freshman jake who has a wiry but muscular frame says ultimately hed like to get a scholarship to the university of southern california and kick in the nfl "i dont care what team " he says he says he realizes kicking isnt as glamorous as some other positions but its what comes most naturally to him "im going to pursue it because im good at it " he says top placekickers in the u s tend to crop up in clusters knoxville tenn has become a fertile breeding ground for kickers because a number of kickers who made it to the pros including fuad reveiz and chuck ramsey played at area high schools and colleges and then settled there as instructors the area around upland calif the city east of los angeles where the van ginkels live has also become something of a hotbed for kicking in the s the zendejas family produced three future nfl kickers out of chino and upland high school itself has already sent one kicker james tuthill to the nfl a big reason why upland has so many kickers is that the city has one of the most competitive youth soccer programs in the state right now though all eyes are on the van ginkels tim salter uplands varsity coach for the past years says when he first heard the "pop" caused by the impact of jakes foot with the ball he recognized it as the same sound he heard when mr tuthill used to return to upland and help coach the kickers the youngest van ginkel josh joins his brothers for their kicking drills but doesnt yet have the leg strength to get a ball through the uprights his father says ten year old luke though has already kicked a yard field goal and his was the only pop warner team in its division to make its extra points
