pursuits food the search for the perfect steak aging your own beef secret spices from the supermarket our reporters quest for a steakhouse quality meal at home im standing in the kitchen of brooklyn n y s peter luger steak house inches from a wall of broilers fearing that i like the flintstone size porterhouses sizzling behind me might be developing a heavy char waiters rush to pick up hissing plates of beef while cooks spear steaks onto huge pointy forks and in a flash dissect them into chunks after five years of attempting to perfect a method for cooking steak at home ive come to one of the most renowned steakhouses in the country to learn how to make meat like a pro the mission is personal for all the hundreds of steaks ive set under my broiler throughout the years ive never yet managed to duplicate that most irresistible of meals the steakhouse steak so over the past three months ive taken a journey into the world of steak i encountered a passionate subculture of foodies who risk microbial armageddon and turn their refrigerators into makeshift aging caves i hung out in busy steakhouse kitchens where one false step can send a person tumbling onto the business end of a inch chefs knife and while practicing one pros shopping techniques at my neighborhood costco i studied the lines of marbling in a pack of t bones as if i were reading tea leaves even as the price of prime beef skyrockets partially an odd side effect of the nations new love of ethanol which is driving up the price of corn used to feed cattle i discovered theres a trick to making cheaper choice cuts nearly as flavorful and tender as prime and i learned why the most critical gadgets in the pro steak chefs grilling arsenal are a humble cast iron pan and tongs americans have grown accustomed to the taste of top drawer steak since the steakhouse industry began to boom in the early s but for years there was a still a difference between the beef served up at these pricey restaurants and the best cuts sold in most stores that began to change toward the end of the s when more retailers started carrying usda prime sometimes dry aged the "prime" label is the highest grade assigned to beef by the agriculture department based on the amount of marbling or lines of fat it contains lesser grades such as choice and select have less marbling whole foods market has built dry aging caves in its stores since and wegmans an east coast supermarket chain started selling prime dry aged beef in all of its stores three years ago donald trump now hawks fancy beef through the sharper image catalog and mail order company allen brothers says business was up last year from the year prior but the good stuff doesnt come cheap at peter luger for example a porterhouse for two costs &# or roughly &# an ounce you can cook a similar steak at home by buying a porterhouse package through the restaurants online butcher shop for &# or about &# an ounce though you get steak sauce chocolate coins and shipping too whereas restaurants might eat margin losses or rejigger the rest of the menu to offset losses retailers set their prices high partly as a hedge against market fluctuations this year for example wholesale prices for usda prime steaks have jumped to from the same period last year and thats on top of a increase from to these are historically large jumps according to market analyst cattle fax reflecting the high demand for prime fueling the increase are corn prices that have risen by this year compared with last year partly a result of rising ethanol demand ethanol uses up of the total u s corn crop up from five years ago according to usda numbers in response the beef industry is cutting the number of days it feeds cattle grain which translates into fewer cattle developing the marbling that merits a prime grade my personal steak life can be divided into the years before and after i met my husband raised in uruguay where cattle outnumber people by nearly to he grew up steeped in a cuisine that can be basically summed up in two words grilled beef before we met i considered steak beneath my culinary aspirations and on the rare occasions i did cook it i usually picked it up at the local grocery store at most stores meat doesnt tout any grade a pretty good sign that its usda select a tougher less flavorful grade a notch below usda choice after my husband came into the picture i started buying usda choice beef at costco for biweekly steak dinners as it happens thats exactly where the pros told me to shop to find great beef the first step in my steak cooking quest elias iglesias the year veteran executive chef at the new york branch of mortons says though he uses prime at the restaurant he happily cooks choice meat at home often buying whole loins at big box stores such as bjs or costco if you like filet mignon look for a cut labeled "beef tenderloin" for strip steaks buy "strip loin " mr iglesias then cuts them into even to inch steaks himself filet should be cut inches thick the year old recommends examining packages of precut steaks closely for the degree of marbling in my experience well marbled choice steaks can taste as good as prime if they are properly aged and cooked while prime beef is slightly scarcer than usual right now accounting for about to of all beef on the market down from last year choice beef is plentiful at roughly of all beef compared with last year beef grade is largely determined by nature though the industry tries through genetics and feeding practices to raise cattle so that they will earn a choice grade though shopping turned out to be fairly simple the next step was complex arduous and even a bit scary one of the most passionate debates among steak lovers has to do with the aging process wet aging which is how mortons handles its beef involves vacuum packing the meat in a bag for several weeks after it is slaughtered the technique allows enzymes in the beef time to break down and tenderize muscle tissue at peter luger where the tin ceilings and beer hall style decor hark back to its year history they go a step further and dry age the meat there several tons of beef sit on wooden racks in a huge dry aging room that has a distinctly pungent nutty somewhat sour odor this arcane and expensive technique what one beef expert described to me as "a process of controlled rotting" is what gives peter luger beef its signature flavor to my mind dry aged beef is the best there is because its not only tenderized but much of the liquid evaporates leaving behind a smaller but more intensely flavored piece of meat trolling through meat threads on food web sites chowhound and egullet i discovered a whole subculture of people who forgo buying dry aged beef and prefer to do it themselves despite warnings from health experts cooks illustrated the cooking magazine that rigorously tests recipes and the food networks alton brown have also both published recipes for home aging beef jack bishop editorial director of americas test kitchen which owns cooks illustrated says "if safety is your no concern you probably dont want to go down the road of aging your beef " but that he believes it is fairly safe if cooks observe strict hygiene and limit the aging to four days alton brown also says aging can be safe if properly done but everyone from food scientists to butchers to cooking schools say aging beef at home is a huge risk "the dangers outweigh the benefits " says brian buckley who specializes in food safety at the institute of culinary education unless its possible to achieve a consistent meat temperature below degrees a controlled humidity level constant air flow strict sanitation and expert butchering says mr buckley bacteria yeasts and mold can easily develop both within a vacuum sealed pack or outside of it any of these can easily lead to food borne illness cooking the meat to degrees would kill off pathogens but the meat would be like shoe leather by then for medium rare most chefs cook steak until the interior is to degrees it will continue to rise in temperature by a further five to degrees as it rests and has a rosy but not blood red hue none of this stops david farbman an investment banker in boston from dry aging the sirloins he buys from a butcher shop he leaves roasts in the fridge for up to days then carefully trims away the desiccated parts before slicing steaks melanie wong in san francisco wet ages hanger steak by leaving it in vacuum sealed bags for up to a week beyond the "consume by" date as far as food safety goes ms wong a pharmaceutical consultant says her meat passes "a sniff test " not to be outdone i turned my own kitchen into a laboratory i spent more than &# for wire racks baking trays ice packs plus at costco two beef tenderloins and two whole top loins around &# each my plan was to dry age half the beef then compare it to the other meat which was essentially wet aging in vacuum sealed bags i started by cleaning all my equipment mr buckley recommends diluted bleach then laid a tenderloin and a strip loin on baking racks set into baking sheets lined with paper towels i put them into the lower half of the refrigerator which i lined with ice packs because tenderloin is already tender i aged it for only two days but the strip got a week i tried to create air flow by installing a hand held fan in the fridge but the battery gave out in a couple of hours so i just hoped for the best before slicing the meat into steaks i trimmed every last exterior scrap of dry meat a series of blind taste tests with my husband and my parents revealed that even this limited amount of dry aging steakhouses age meat for strip steaks three weeks or more was highly effective everyone preferred the richer more toothsome dry aged meat over the blander wet aged filet while both strip steaks were yummy the wet aged tasted hammy compared with the beefier more intense dry aged still even my dry aged meat didnt have the flavorful crust of steakhouse steak so my next challenge was figuring out a better way of cooking the meat to show off its taste i turned to the professionals requesting one on one instruction from the chefs at mortons and peter luger to my surprise i found that beyond cooking in broilers cranked up to at least degrees which sears the exterior of the meat the two steakhouses did about everything else differently at mortons i saw large trays of raw meat sitting out beside the stove mr iglesias explained that the restaurant lets steak sit outside the refrigerator for about an hour as much as the health code allows but "at home i let them sit for two hours " he admitted the purpose to raise the internal temperature slightly so that the center doesnt stay cold while the exterior burns this turned out to be a key technique for cooking the perfect steak to imitate the golden crust the steakhouse broiler provides mr iglesias suggests searing steaks in an extremely hot cast iron pan coated with a little oil and flipping them with tongs never a fork which releases juices then the steaks should be moved to the center rack of a degree oven to finish cooking of course its wonderful to use an outdoor grill searing first over high heat and then moving the steaks to a cooler part of the grill to finish cooking though not practical in winter mortons also seasons steak with a secret salt and spice blend mr iglesias says lawrys seasoned salt is a perfectly good alternative though i a purist just use kosher salt after cooking he says its critical to let the meat rest for a few minutes before eating it to allow the juices to reabsorb into the meat over at peter luger i was in for a shock chef maciej truskolaski and third generation co owner jody storch both seemed sheepish as i positioned myself in front of a row of hot ovens notebook in hand ready to soak in their genius when i saw the technique i understood why mr truskolaski grabbed a cold porterhouse placed it on the grill rack of the broiler and sprinkled it with some salt he then removed it while it was still raw inside cut it into piece put it on a plate and broiled it to medium rare "dont tell people to do this at home all the juices will run out " ms storch said acknowledging that cutting a piece of steak into chunks before it has been fully cooked is a notorious no no in steak cookery as is using forks to flip meat as is starting with cold steak "we just do it this way because its what weve always done " ms storch said once back in my home kitchen i began to do things as id never done using my hand cut usda choice dry aged strip steak i applied the cast iron pan sear and finished the steaks in the oven while i wouldnt say that my steaks are an exact replica of steakhouse beef for a fraction of the price they get darn close lessons from the pros master recipe  steaks cut strip steaks or rib eyes about inches thick filet mignon inches  teaspoons grapeseed or canola oil kosher salt remove steaks from refrigerator hours before cooking time dry them with a paper towel preheat oven to degrees with a rack set in the middle heat a heavy cast iron skillet over medium high heat until a few drops of water sprinkled in the hot pan evaporate within seconds coat the bottom of the pan with teaspoons of grapeseed or canola oil liberally salt the steaks with kosher salt about teaspoon for each steak place steaks in pan and sear for minutes on each side flipping only once with tongs transfer the steaks still in the pan to the oven and roast for roughly to minutes for inch steaks to achieve medium rare an instant read thermometer should register between and degrees let the steaks rest under a tent of aluminum foil for minutes before serving two ways to dress it up sauce bearnaise for filet mignon active prep time minutes cooking time minutes makes cup for the hollandaise sauce  large egg yolks  tablespoons sticks unsalted butter melted and cooled  teaspoon fresh lemon juice

that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water whisk continuously until the mixture is pale yellow and foamy and just begins to thicken about minute take care not to overcook the eggs or they will curdle remove the bowl from the pot of simmering water and slowly pour the melted butter the butter should be warm if its too hot the sauce will break into the eggs while continuing to whisk the

small saucepan over medium high heat combine the vinegar wine tarragon and shallot bring to a simmer and cook until enough liquid evaporates so that it barely coats the bottom of the pan about minutes to finish the sauce whisk the tarragon reduction into the hollandaise sauce return the sauce to the warm area until ready to use works with any steak but is best with filet mignon cooked according to the master recipe bobby flays coffee spice rub for strip steaks makes cup  cup ancho chile powder  cup finely ground espresso roast coffee beans  tablespoons sweet paprika  tablespoons dark brown

or cayenne optional combine all the ingredients in a bowl or a jar with a tight fitting lid and mix well store in a cool place omit the chile de arbol if you want a milder rub to use proceed with the master recipe replacing the kosher salt with a coating of tablespoon of spice rub on each steak plus salt to taste during searing there will be a bit of smoke but the steaks are not burning it is just smoke from the spices in the rub works on all steaks but is best on strip steaks or rib eyes dry aging at home this is the method we used to dry age strip steaks food safety experts do not recommend any type of aging at home because of the risk of food borne illness  buy a whole usda choice strip loin available at big box stores such as b j s or costco  clean the kitchen and refrigerator with a solution of diluted bleach run all equipment through a hot dishwasher cycle wash hands  line a baking pan with paper towels and place a baking rack into the pan remove the strip loin from the vacuum pack and place it fat side down onto the baking rack  place the baking pan onto the bottom level of an empty or fairly empty refrigerator place ice packs around the refrigerator to make sure the temperature stays below degrees avoid opening the door frequently  leave the loin aging for to days maximum  with clean hands and equipment and using a very sharp knife slice off every piece of exterior meat making sure no hard desiccated tissue is left on any part of the loin  slice the loin into to inch steaks freeze unused portions
