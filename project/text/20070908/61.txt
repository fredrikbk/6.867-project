pursuits sports golf journal when millionaires moan the new pga playoffs are turning a genteel sport a little warlike pga tour commissioner tim finchem has been saying for months that pro golfs new fedex cup playoffs system would probably need tweaking after the first run through now its clear why with two of the four tournaments in the series complete flashes of rancor broke out in the ranks this week in chicago the site of the third event much of the hubbub is petty and can be dismissed as growing pains but one problem is fundamental too many big golf tournaments in too short a period of time first up was phil mickelson who after winning last weeks event in boston to take the lead in the points race to win the cup announced he would skip this weeks tournament the bmw championship part of the reason was that he had requested that certain changes be made to the playoffs the details werent publicized and mr finchem didnt fulfill those wishes next tiger woods who skipped the first event said in a news conference that he "and a lot of the players" didnt like the way the money was being paid out and complained that "for a lot of guys" four events in a row was simply too much golf then most surprisingly ernie els the worlds fourth ranked player known for his easygoing personality fussed to the media that the tour failed to consult with him and other pros sufficiently before finalizing the fedex cup system "i just feel in certain ways weve kind of grown apart a little bit especially the players and the commissioners office " said mr els who skipped the second event the stars werent the only ones carping many in the media having themselves spent the last few weeks picking apart the details of the fedex cup system this week turned to griping about the tours new gripers usually following a "pampered millionaires" theme at a press conference mr finchem said the playoffs are a work in progress "all of these things are open to discussion as we go forward " he said he added that golf fans dont care about these kinds of details as much as simply seeing the top players go head to head as happened last week in an exciting woods mickelson duel to the finish the playoffs which have been in the works for several years are designed to bring the best players together in a season ending grand finale players are given points based on their performance during the year that they can then add to during the four playoff events over that month the field is whittled down from to one of the most common complaints from the troops in recent days has been that the bonus pool money awarded at the end of the playoffs &# million total with &# million going to the winner isnt paid in cash but rather as tax deferred deposits into the players retirement accounts both mr woods and mr mickelson noted how "cool" it is the way the world series of poker does things rolling out a cart piled high with the cash the players will be competing for putting aside the practical limitations of this approach especially on a breezy day it strikes me as shockingly short sighted for players whose sponsors include big name financial and management consulting companies to criticize what the tour has pulled off here the tour a nonprofit organization came up with a way to give the players a huge financial windfall the prize money isnt an annuity to be doled out in old age in small checks as some players seem to imagine the full amount of each players fedex winnings untaxed will go immediately into a k type account most people can make only limited deposits each year into their tax deferred retirement funds where it can grow compounded and untaxed until withdrawal true the players cant get their hands on that money until after they turn and they have quit playing regularly on either the pga or champions tour but by then that &# million first prize could be worth many times more for young players as much as &# million or more they should be able to make it financially until then helped in part by a cash purse at each of the playoff events separate from the bonus pool worth &# million as for player grousing that they werent brought into the loop enough during the fedex cup planning process maybe they were and maybe they werent at least one tour member arron oberholser was honest enough to acknowledge that the players often live in their "own cocoons" and probably werent paying much attention to what the tour was telling them a third line of discontent in this case mostly from the media is that the playoffs are not really playoffs in the bracket elimination sense that football basketball and baseball playoffs are but that is just semantics although the players are seeded for the series based on their earlier season performance it isnt intended to be the one single summing up event that the playoffs in other sports are the matter of schedule however is more than semantic starting with the world golf championships event in early august and including the pga championship the four fedex cup events and the presidents cup in late september the top players are expected to compete in seven important tournaments in nine weeks fans can joke that theyd like to have such problems but playing at peak intensity for that many weeks is genuinely fatiguing one solution might be to reduce the fedex cup to three events and build in a buffer week both before and after but even this wouldnt guarantee that all the top players would show up for every fedex cup event part of privilege of earning a high seed for the cup will probably always be the ability to take a personal bye week for elite golfers that may be the ultimate act of conspicuous consumption email golfjournal wsj com corrections &amp amplifications adding a second buffer week before and after the fedex cup golf tournaments is a potential solution to players complaints about the events scheduling the golf journal column in saturdays pursuits incorrectly suggested there was no buffer week currently wsj sept
