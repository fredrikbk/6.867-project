cross country a raw deal for california sacramento calif republican gov arnold schwarzenegger is barred from running for re election and will be leaving office in three years but the big question in california right now is whether before leaving hell cut a deal to allow his political opponents to bypass their term limits and hold onto entrenched positions of power for years after hes gone term limits are something of a third rail in california politics voters approved them back in limiting members of the assembly to three consecutive two year terms and state senators to two four year terms in voters rejected a measure that would have watered down these restrictions and anyone who attempts to upend these restrictions knows they would risk angering voters but this year democrats who control the state legislature believe they have figured out how to loosen restrictions without paying a political price for it theyre putting a "reform" ballot that they claim is more restrictive than the law currently imposed on politicians and they may get away with it because politicians can now serve a total of years in the legislature six years in the assembly and eight years in the senate and the ballot initiative would limit them to years in office but let legislators stay in one house continuously "the practical effect of the measure would be to allow more lawmakers to stay in office longer " concluded a san francisco chronicle news analysis in part because a special "transition period" would allow of sitting legislators to delay their departure and conveniently if the initiative passes the current leadership of the legislature will be allowed to stay until for assembly speaker fabian nunez and for senate president don perata instead of being forced to retire next year some reform backers of the scheme admit it will only pass if voters believe it improves term limits rather than waters them down "if voters believe that its somehow going to extend term limits and people are feathering their own nests it wont pass " says steve maviglio a spokesman for mr nunez the first step to qualify the initiative for the ballot is to collect signatures it already ran into trouble california verifies signatures by inspecting a small sample of those collected and then in large counties disqualifying names for every signature found to be invalid even with a lot of muscle behind it the initiative nearly failed to get enough signatures county registrars had reported earlier that an unusually high percentage of signatures turned in were found to be invalid once the counting was done the initiative came up several thousand names short out of more than one million collected but not to worry four counties took the unusual step of declaring that names theyd previously ruled invalid were actually valid normally totals are only changed to correct a mathematical error and a spokeswoman for secretary of state debra bowen a democrat admitted the revisions were "uncommon " nonetheless this week the initiative qualified for the february ballot by some signatures a margin of just one signature in a verified sample the initiative also scored a break from democratic attorney general jerry brown who may want to build up chits to return to the governors office in mr browns office prepared the summary of the initiative voters will see on their ballots they stress that the measure "reduces the total amount of time" a legislator serves while obscuring that it keeps current legislators in office longer a challenge to the wording was turned down by sacramento superior court judge gail ohanesian who ruled on narrow legal grounds that the summary was factual but she added "i may well have written this ballot title and summary differently " dan walters a sacramento bee columnist and dean of the capitol press corps concluded that backers of the initiative "want to fool voters and brown is helping them do it " anti term limit legislators know that if they can outspend opponents by more than the to one margin they enjoyed in their failed attempt they have a chance to win "theres something about the simplicity involved in the way we wrote it that will help people come to the right conclusion and keep us around a little bit longer " speaker nunez told the sacramento bee but the well funded business and labor interests backing the measure will still have to employ all the smoke and mirrors they can find the field poll shows only of voters approve of the legislatures performance and almost every month brings a new example of legislative arrogance in july it was revealed that two democratic lawmakers legally collected more than &# in "travel and living expenses" for sessions they both missed because they were ill at home last month it was revealed that state senators of both parties were collecting expense money of &# a day even though they were on break and hadnt passed a budget legislators already get a base salary of &# a year the key however is the governor he has come a long way from the recall campaign when he backed term limits and brandished a broom on the steps of the capitol vowing to sweep the place clean now he is courting favor with messrs nunez and perata in hopes of passing a universal health care plan which isnt gaining purchase in the legislature the governor has already hinted that he may accept a compromise to support the term limits initiative if messrs nunez and perata support an initiative of his to take redistricting power away from the state legislature and hand it to an "independent" commission the two would be sold as a "reform package " though the independence of any commission approved by legislative leaders would be significantly less than what the governor has backed in the past also allowing these sacramento pols to stay in office would negate any effect redistricting reform might have and leave the governor with two powerful legislative leaders who would probably treat him like a lame duck knowing that theyll have time in power after he leaves office if gov schwarzenegger strikes such a deal hell end any pretense of being a reformer perhaps that was inevitable after voters rejected his reform agenda in a special election in but its still no reason for him to turn full circle and embrace a phony reform deal that would mark him as just another politician mr fund is
