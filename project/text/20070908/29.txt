investor seeks the next china in vietnam mekong capital scouts for opportunities in transforming market ho chi minh city vietnam over the years dreams of hitting it big in this country often pitched to foreign investors as the "next china" have been routinely dashed by bureaucracy corruption or financial crisis just ask chris freund he has been here since the mid s when he arrived to build a new vietnam fund for franklin templeton investments then came s asian financial crisis the fund folded mr freund retreated to singapore now he is back running his own private equity firm mekong capital amid vietnams latest effort to transform itself into a more open economy the firm with about &# million under management has invested in makers of clothes mobile phones and mens hair care products among other businesses the latest bump in the road the recent turmoil in global markets vietnams tiny market fell since july the day before asia markets went haywire though it is still up for the year mr freund says he isnt worried mekongs strategy is to cash out of investments by listing them on the stock market and "i believe that even if the market were to drop up to the companies would still proceed with listings " he says if so that speaks volumes about the vietnam markets roller coaster in recent years vietnams exchange which opened only in is on fire last year the markets main index rose and the total market capitalization of companies listed on the exchange soared fold to &# billion in the past vietnam a communist country that has long had a heavily protected economy may have been less exposed to external financial pressures now however "the impact of such shocks is likely to be felt across more sectors of the economy " charly madan country officer here for citigroup says the u s subprime debt crisis that has caused banks around the world to clamp down on lending is also testing their faith in vietnams borrowers vietnamese companies are now having to "rethink their funding strategies beyond traditional debt financing " mr madan says that has provided opportunity for some private equity funds and other investment firms to jump into the mix looking for deals for instance vinacapital a firm that invests in publicly traded stocks as well as in private companies is working on an investment in a private hospital an opportunity that came about because global banks pulled back on plans to extend the hospital a loan don lam a managing partner says for an investment in a sugar manufacturer vinacapital has been able to negotiate a lower price partly because of the global pullback many see this country of million people as a microcosm of china with a manufacturing based economy that is roaring ahead with annual growth of more than foreign direct investment is surging with analysts predicting a possible jump this year of about from since private equity funds and venture capitalists have pumped about &# million into vietnam according to asian venture capital journal a hong kong research firm while a tiny sum in global terms that amount is more than four times as much as they invested in the previous two years combined mr freund years old doesnt think the recent meltdown in global markets will affect his timetable for exiting his investments as yet mekong hasnt sold any of its companies so it doesnt have a track record to speak of based on what other investors have paid to invest in companies already in mekongs portfolio at least a few of its investments seem to have gone up in value for instance when mekong bought into a magnet wire maker ngo han co three years ago it paid cents a share for its stake a month ago two vietnamese funds and an individual investor paid &# a share or nearly six times as much mr freund estimates that funds net asset value has doubled since its launch in mr freund and his team stand to reap about of any profit once mekong cashes out for now the firm is paid a management fee of to of assets mekong is hoping to begin that exiting process this year by taking one or two of its companies public the timing depends on "whether companies have completed two consecutive years of very clean financial reports " he says playing the private equity game in vietnam has plenty of risks the market could plunge as investors witnessed this summer and if global investors become increasingly risk averse buyers for his holdings could be few and far between mr freund took a circuitous route to finance as a teenager intrigued by math he spent hours at the horse track exercising his skill at figuring odds in college he dabbled in stocks and options at the university of california santa cruz he studied psychology and religion and first visited vietnam while on a semester abroad program in india on that trip mr freund also lived for a month at a buddhist monastery in thailand sticking to a strict regimen and foregoing worldly comforts it was only later he says that "i started eating meat and became this capitalist " his strategy with new investments launch a blitz of changes in the first days after closing a deal the time frame is "psychologically important" for setting the course at companies that are often trying to become globally competitive for instance when the firm invested &# million in minh hoang garment two years ago the apparel maker had just lost business from nike inc and columbia sportswear co for violating their clients labor guidelines soon after mr freund and his team uncovered other problems the companys manufacturing process made it easy to hide defects and in some cases pieces of broken sewing needles were left inside clothing shipped for export these and other problems arent unique to this company of course murky accounting plagues many businesses in vietnam "sometimes the accounting is so bad that the ceo doesnt even know that a division is losing money " mr freund says to boost efficiency mekong implemented a toyota style "lean" manufacturing system for eliminating inefficiency on the factory floor after these and other changes nike and columbia came back and net income is increasing about annually mr freund says
