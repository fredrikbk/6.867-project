politics &amp economics steel prices poised to rise faster steel prices around the world are likely to increase faster than predicted if china as expected in october moves to reduce or end the incentives that effectively encouraged steel exports into other markets and kept prices in those markets from rising too quickly having already pared a tax related rebate on exports of low end low profit steel products leaving the country china is expected next month to reduce or eliminate the rebate on exports of some higher value higher profit steel products in an effort to slow the production of steel and encourage consolidation which in turn would help the government curb pollution and energy consumption the loss of the rebates and the anticipated impact of reducing the amount of chinese steel in the open market is good news for european and u s steel producers many of which have invested heavily in upgrading their mills or buying rivals that produce the higher profit steel but it could be bad news for steel buying customers china by far the biggest producer of steel in the world has the power to roil steel markets across the globe whenever the country decides to pull back or increase the amount of steel it sends to other countries steel prices world wide have increased since china began eliminating the export incentives and the latest action could force auto makers appliance manufacturers and others to pay even more for the steel they use "steel prices are up dramatically in the last month up about " said charles bradford a metals analyst for bradford research inc and the increases are widespread as well "prices are going up every day in cities that i track " he and other steel analysts and industry observers expect that china will eliminate tax rebates for additional types of higher quality steel that once processed and coated is used to make appliances and specialized pipes that go into commercial construction officials at chinas ministry of finance and state administration of taxation two government agencies overseeing the tax rebate issue both ruled to reduce or eliminate the rebate earlier this year the agencies said they werent aware of pending rebate changes but others in the industry are widely expecting the move and note that china often gives little warning when making such policy changes china has used a tax and rebate system to control the types of steel that leave the country generally the tax rate was about depending on the type of steel being exported but the government also gave rebates sometimes just or even the full back to chinese steelmakers that were exporting steel the expected reduction or elimination of tax rebates would mean the exporter would have to pay the full tax on such products as galvanized and cold rolled steel used to make some car parts air conditioners roofing and metal cabinets such a hefty penalty is designed to keep more chinese steel within the country and force more restrained production while also blunting criticism from other countries about too much chinese steel flooding their markets and damping prices without the presence of chinese steel steel producers in north america and europe can expand production in their home markets if desired and exert more pricing power over customers some steel consumers are already blanching about how the current high prices are affecting their businesses "the biggest challenge despite all the discussion about interest rates and housing for us continues to be material cost inflation our no material that we purchase is steel " said jeff m fettig chairman and chief executive of whirlpool corp during an analyst conference call this past week along with oil resins copper and other material costs mr fettig said "in total this will be the most significant material cost increase that weve seen " mittal steel co chief executive lakshmi mittal said he expects exports from china to the rest of the world to continue to slow resulting in demand in the u s and europe picking up mittal steel and arcelor sa are in the process of combining to form the worlds biggest steelmaker arcelormittal ellen zhu contributed to this article
