love &amp money talking about money is so hard now do it i sat down this week to write my traditional end of the year column reflecting on the lessons that my wife amy and i have learned over the past year but as i began to write i was struck by a friends question "whats the biggest lesson you and amy have learned since you began writing the column " it brought me back to a line from my first column on mothers day when i asked myself why i was willing to open up our financial lives to millions of readers i said amy and i "believe this column can be a vehicle for us to confront some of the fundamental money issues that divide us " by writing about what others often shy away from our hope was to better understand why we and couples in general so often disagree about how the family spends and saves now years later i can see clearly what i could only hope for then so when my friend asked what lesson looms largest i immediately knew the answer for days and sometimes weeks after my columns run each sunday readers around the country dispatch emails revealing the hurt and anger they feel toward spouses siblings grown children parents friends co workers their notes are passionate often poignant and reflect two truths i wrote about in that original column that personal finance remains one of the last bastions of privacy in america and that a lot of financial disagreements stem from fundamentally different ways of thinking about money a perfect example a woman wrote me not long ago at wits end because her husband was breezing through an inheritance that was deep into the six figure range she was petrified that he was spending them into financial ruin but heres the thing this woman was telling me not her husband she was afraid to raise her concerns with him she told me because "hell get mad and throw a fit about me telling him how to spend his inheritance and then thats going to get me angry at him for being so obstinate and blind to what his actions are doing to us and then its just going to end up being one of those classic money fights " better to stay silent she figured than force a confrontation over money theres also the man who wrote me saying he has given up trying to explain to his wife why she should invest in her companys k plan "she simply cannot understand what the whole fuss is about with retirement " he wrote "she figures that as long as were going to get social security and as long as i contribute to my k plan well be just fine in retirement she doesnt think her life needs to suffer today so that she can have more money tomorrow i have no clue where shes coming from and i just want to scream " theres a theme here "learning to talk to each other " that i told my friend is the biggest lesson amy and i have learned through the years it sounds so trite so obvious so silly yet nothing could be bigger when it comes to solving the financial problems that divide so many of us if couples could only learn to communicate about this most personal of topics their lives would be filled with so much less conflict the truth is that fighting about money is easy much harder is to talk and listen and fashion together a solution that makes both people content before taking on this column amy and i had never really fought much over money but the main reason was that we never really talked about money i generally told her what i thought she might want to know she in turn never really asked any questions yet our financial lives were filled with silent resentment misunderstanding and ignorance it was a source of tension we werent even aware of and we were suffering financially because so often we werent pulling in the same direction once we started writing the column though we were forced to talk i had to seek her input she asked questions that shed been unsure of asking before suddenly we were communicating so that instead of blindly defending our positions we listened to each others answers a process that often blows holes in your own argument we began to understand how each other processes financial information learn about each others concerns and wants and see all the misconceptions we held and where the frustrations were silently massing we could each see how our own actions might make the other feel angry worried or alienated these days its all second nature to us either of us will broach financial issues without the slightest concern that the other will fly into a rage or even get defensive im not saying we never disagree as many of my columns make clear we certainly do thats natural in any relationship but we dont get angry or feel that the other just doesnt understand weve learned that talking about money doesnt mean well fight it just means were talking jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
