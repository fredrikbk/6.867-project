getting going bring fresh eyes to your portfolio in think differently in looking for a new years resolution for tomorrow evening forget exercising or dieting instead next year throw out the conventional financial wisdom and commit to looking at your portfolio with fresh eyes on that score here are nine suggestions  think about your human capital during your working years your ability to earn income is your most valuable asset indeed you are like a bond generating a steady stream of income because you have so much bond like income you can afford to take more risk with your portfolio investing heavily in stocks until youre within or years of retirement at that point your human capital will be winding down and you will want to prepare for your paychecks disappearance by gradually shifting more of your portfolio into bonds  think about your liabilities when you hear the word "liabilities " your thoughts probably turn to things like your mortgage and your credit card debt try expanding that definition in two ways first consider your biggest liability which is paying for retirement if you ask folks why they invest theyll mention goals like "earning high returns" or "beating the market " but the main reason we save now is so we can retire later want to be confident of meeting that goal aiming to beat the market or earn the highest possible return will if anything hurt your chances because you will end up taking unnecessary risks instead to improve your odds of retiring in comfort focus on saving diligently holding down investment costs and diversifying broadly preferably through low expense index funds  think about family that brings us to your second big liability your family what will happen if your elderly parents need nursing home care they cant afford what if your adult children get into financial trouble its worth monitoring your elderly parents finances and guiding your adult childrens money decisions or their problems could become yours this of course can go both ways and your family may bail you out if you get into financial trouble in fact when all else fails family often turns out to be the ultimate financial safety net  think about your assets family isnt the only resource we overlook as you tote up your retirement nest egg also consider social security and any pension youre entitled to social security is akin to an inflation indexed bond while a traditional fixed income pension is like a conventional fixed interest bond the implication if in retirement you expect to receive a heap of income from these two sources you might want to go lighter on bonds and invest more in stocks  think about whos on the other side of your trades before you buy a new investment you no doubt tell yourself a story about why the investment will be a good one but maybe you should also give some thought to the folks on the other side of the trade theyre also telling themselves a story about why this is a good time to sell given that the sellers may be veteran money managers with access to top notch market research theres a good chance their story is more compelling than yours  think about whether this is really news as you rush to buy you may be reacting to the latest news maybe the federal reserve is expected to cut rates which pundits say will boost the overall market or maybe you have heard about some company with a hot new invention problem is unless you are privy to inside information what youre hearing is what lots of other investors have also heard and the information is probably already reflected in share prices  think about fundamentals if the economy grows at the year average of a year then corporate earnings will also grow at around that in turn justifies a increase in share prices admittedly this brief description is a gross simplification still its worth bearing in mind when you come across a market sector that has jumped or in a single year such gains may be sustainable for a year or two but they sure arent sustainable over the long run  think about risk not return getting the sense that winners are hard to pick youd better believe it my advice settle on a basic stock bond mix which is the key driver of your portfolios performance thereafter as you add new stock and bond funds forget fantasizing about the possible return instead only add funds if you believe theyll better diversify your portfolio and thus lower its risk  think about whats in it for wall street whatever the markets deliver in investors will share those returns with wall street and the tax man the more wall street and the tax man take the less there will be left for you what to do before you make your next trade consider what it will mean for your year end tax bill and how much your friendly neighborhood financial salesman is likely to pocket a separate "getting going" appears each wednesday in the wall street journal email jonathan clements wsj com
