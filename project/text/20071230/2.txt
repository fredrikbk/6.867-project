best bet for next president prediction markets a wharton economist argues prediction markets can cut through the clutter of polls and pundits online edition as the presidential race heats up voters are overwhelmed by a flood of new data who is ahead in the polls who is winning the "money race" how are the dynamics of the race likely to respond as the candidates tack left and right advertising strategies change and we learn whose web site is drawing more eyeballs political prediction markets provide us the consumers of this information with a way to cut through this clutter a prediction market is a bit like the stock market except that you are buying shares whose value depends on the success of a political candidate rather than the profits earned by a corporation and just as stock prices are a useful barometer of the health of a company so too the price of a prediction contract is a barometer of the health of a political campaign alternatively for those schooled on the strip rather than the street prediction markets allow you to bet on the election just as vegas bookies allow you to bet on a football game and the uncanny ability of the betting line to predict football outcomes also holds in the political domain it is the accuracy of market generated forecasts that led the department of defense to propose running prediction markets on geopolitical events while political rhetoric about "terrorism futures" led the plug to be pulled on that particular experiment the original insight that markets can help make sense of vast amounts of disparate information remains valid experimental prediction markets were established at the university of iowa in and they have since amassed a very impressive record repeatedly outperforming the polls research by economic historians has documented betting on elections over a century ago and the impressive forecasting record of prediction markets was also evident in the period before scientific polling was adopted more recently in the primaries prediction markets pointed to the disintegration of howard deans candidacy in advance of the fateful iowa caucuses in the presidential election the market favorite won the electoral college in all fifty states in the markets also picked every senate race how do these markets work right now you can buy a &# bill for cents the only catch is that you only get the &# if hillary clinton is our next president the fact that this &# bill is selling for cents tells us that "the market" believes her to have a chance of winning the presidency a number that has risen sharply as she has become more likely to win the democratic nomination interestingly prediction markets have long suggested a strong showing for ms clinton even as popular commentators had earlier dismissed her as unelectable much as they did prior to her successful new york senate race in in a truly efficient prediction market the price will come to reflect the influence of all available information for instance those discouraged by ms clintons recent polling in new hampshire are probably selling while those who believe endorsements by the iowa register are crucial are buying ms clintons campaign to increase her likeability may lead some to buy while recent mis steps by her campaign may lead others to sell economists influenced by the possibility of a recession are buying various democrats while political scientists schooled in the incumbency advantage are probably buying republicans through this process of different people trading based on their own observations about the race prediction markets prices come to aggregate disparate pieces of information into a single summary measure of the likelihood of various outcomes moreover if this market operates efficiently it will appropriately summarize all of this information and the price will become the most statistically accurate forecast of the election outcome two other characteristics also distinguish prediction markets first they respond to all sorts of news beyond shifts in public opinion including changes in campaign staff political re positioning and performance on the trail second prediction markets are forward looking while polls are often backward looking for instance fred thompson continues to do well in national polls largely due to name recognition while prediction markets have discounted this advantage understanding that candidates like mike huckabee will become better known through the campaign indeed the markets currently believe that mr thompson is less likely to win the republican nomination than fringe candidate ron paul beyond mr thompson polling data for republican candidates is much more consistent with the markets suggesting a four way race in which messrs giuliani and romney are the leading candidates with messrs mccain and huckabee not too far behind the markets predicted mr huckabees surge a few weeks before the polls and it appears to have come at the expense of mr romney the big story this week though is john mccain who has resurrected his campaign the market now judges him to be a clearly credible alternative on the democratic side national polls suggest a landslide for ms clinton while the markets suggest that the race is still very competitive with a one in three chance that obama or edwards will ultimately win the nomination turning to the general election the markets are titling strongly pro democratic ranking them a chance of taking the white house stay tuned during the campaign and well continue to track where the markets undermine the conventional wisdom and when they start to point to barely emergent trends i cant predict what these trends will be but ill bet that the markets will yield interesting insights i will highlight them for you in the coming weeks justin wolfers is an assistant professor of business and public policy at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school he will be writing for the journal about the presidential campaign
