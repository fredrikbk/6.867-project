real time blade runner at why ridley scotts dystopian classic still speaks to todays techie culture online edition in i joined a bunch of my year old friends for a birthday party we went to see a new movie one we seemed certain to like after all it starred harrison ford known to us as han solo and indiana jones as a detective chasing down androids in a future world of vertiginous skyscrapers and flying cars as it turned out i did like "blade runner " though the movie was considerably different than what id expected there were gleaming skyscrapers and flying cars but most of the movie took place either indoors or on crowded streets awash in rain and noise mr fords character deckard sure didnt seem much like han or indy while he wasnt exactly the bad guy he shot two women one in the back and spent much of the movie all but leveled by exhaustion pain or both meanwhile the villain rutger hauers platinum blonde replicant batty wound up striking us as a sort of hero in fact the replicants seemed more caring and more human than the humans hunting them for a year old it was at first confusing then very interesting now "blade runner" is back in a recut restored edition billed as director ridley scotts "final cut " last week i watched the dvd curious to see what changes had been made if theyd improve a movie i vividly remembered in its original incarnation and how the future imagined in "blade runner" holds up in an age of ubiquitous computing and communications of course "blade runner" never really left it became a cult classic appearing in a puzzling array of versions and an internet favorite not long after i first went online i discovered newsgroup faqs recounting the movies troubled production the tug of war between mr scott and others over the story and arguments about what the movie really "meant " i was fascinated i hadnt known that mr ford had disliked the movie or that his sam spade voiceover and the oddly happy ending had been tacked on after test screenings and id never seen the odd "unicorn scene" added in later releases or read how it "proved" deckard was also a replicant all this net lore made "blade runner" a richer experience but it was also frustrating i wanted to see the movie i remembered again but i wanted to see it the way mr scott had intended it that kept getting pushed off though for years web chatter suggested a new edition would be on the way soon now the wait is over and "blade runner" and i are at last reacquainted the restored movie is beautiful with superb sound but id expected that while its possible the voiceover helped me get my bearings as a year old i didnt miss it now particularly not in the films powerful final minutes with a battered deckard left to ponder battys sacrifice in silence i enjoyed following the clues about deckard possibly being a replicant and found the less happy ending more satisfying some of the continuity bloopers and special effects flubs have also been cleaned up and of course there are all manner of intriguing extras from mr scotts commentary to a exhaustive occasionally exhausting warts and all documentary how did the movie hold up for me "blade runner" is set in los angeles in and some parts of that vision do now seem more derived from the early s darryl hannahs evil doll replicant looks like she stepped out of first wave mtv deckard wears a digital watch and nobody has a cellphone and then there was one of my favorite scenes deckard uses a voice activated computer to delve deep into a snapshot zooming in until he finds the reflection of a face in a mirror in the background it remains a startling piece of movie making one i often think about when working with high resolution digital photos but this time i found myself distracted why doesnt deckards software zoom in smoothly like every program does today this would be a real pain to use i thought and was disappointed to think so but these are quibbles i was still drawn in by the look and feel of "blade runner " slipping easily into the world it imagines yes that world includes space colonies and attack ships off the shoulder of orion but we never see them which is good because even in the best science fiction everything from gadgetry to clothing typically strikes us as fantastic and therefore fake "blade runner" is different we see a transformed but still recognizable world with odd but not unfamiliar fashions a familiar urban divide between conspicuous wealth and grinding poverty and people trying to get by as best they can on crowded chaotic streets as a forerunner of cyberpunk "blade runner" helped strip science fiction of starships and space wars though it just pushes them offscreen instead of doing away with them entirely another cyberpunk pioneer william gibsons "neuromancer " also comes with the trappings of conventional sci fi with orbiting space stations and a self aware supercomputer but "blade runner" also continues to speak to our hopes and fears in it channeled fears of overpopulation and pollution as well as american worries about asias rise if some of those worries have subsided new ones have replaced them the weather has changed by and real animals have all but disappeared and the fear of being ceaselessly stifled and jostled and overwhelmed remains with us though transferred from the real world to the virtual one "blade runner" is full of noise and overrun by gadgetry its buildings choked by the technological kudzu of advertisements and infrastructure yet peeking out amid the babble and clutter we recognize things from our time old cars photos the books and piano in deckards apartment they seem fragile and vulnerable as if a few more rainy nights might leave them rotted and replaced and we want desperately to hold onto them even without replicants or advertising zeppelins thats a fear weve felt as well watching with mingled excitement and anxiety as the digital age sweeps away old ways and familiar things so what do you think miss harrison fords voiceover or glad its gone should deckard be a replicant share your thoughts on "blade runner" with me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
