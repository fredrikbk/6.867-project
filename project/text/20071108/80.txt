no verdict on death penalty deterring crime as an attorney who represents people charged with capital crimes i read with interest the claim that the debate over the capital punishments deterrence effect had been resolved "capital punishment works" op ed by roy d adler and michael summers nov messrs adler and summers announced new research showing that each execution deters murders this claim presented as an unassailable fact ignores the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the authors purportedly compared the national number of executions to the national number of murders in the u s from to and concluded that there is an "obvious negative correlation " in other words they looked at a graph with both the murder rate and the execution rate plotted in time a correlation study one does not have to be a statistician to know the inherent danger of mistaking correlation for causation a common illustration of this basic point is that children with larger shoe sizes perform better in reading tests while this may be true it is age not shoe size that correlates with improved reading another flaw in the analysis is the false comparison between national crime statistics and national death penalty statistics the death penalty is not a federal penalty and it is not applied or available in several states with high crime rates there are other credible studies comparing death penalty states with non death penalty states that have found no evidence that executions have any effect on murder rates cassandra stubbs staff attorney aclus capital punishment project new york i dont have a strong view on the death penalty but the debate over whether it should be part of our justice system raises important and difficult issues that should be dealt with in a methodologically competent and rational fashion merely eyeballing the chart accompanying the op ed should put one on notice that something may be amiss the authors purported to identify an astonishingly strong relationship between execution and murders yet one can tell from inspecting their graph that this relationship does not hold for the years when as the execution rate increased so did the murder rate why would this be so if executions had a dramatic effect on murder rates the answer is that other variables are at play this is the first of three errors the authors make all their study shows is that there is a correlation between executions and murder rates in these years but there are innumerable such correlations i could just as easily show that population growth during this period correlates well with declining murder rates note a more devastating error during the period that obviously drives these results from the early s on crime rates were falling dramatically across the country crime rates were falling across the board not just for homicide and so messrs adler and summers could also draw a graph showing that executions caused the crime rate to fall for burglary robbery assault and so on which is implausible and now the most devastating error the homicide rate more or less fell everywhere and not just in states that executed people so in essence the model of these authors attributes the declining murder rate in e g new york to the executions that occurred mostly in southern states is that plausible of course not research efforts are under way to see if the deterrent efficacy of capital punishment can be determined this is all the more reason not to distract the debate over capital punishment with simplistic studies that do not meet the normal standards of scientific inquiry debates over important policy choices that could affect the lives of innocent people should be conducted at the highest intellectual plane in a careful and rational fashion ronald j allen professor of law northwestern university school of law evanston ill see related letter "letters to the editor sometimes the simplest explanation is right" wsj nov
