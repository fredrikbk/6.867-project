enel uses every tool to tap russia strategy is to cut in gazprom hit right political chords control gas supply rome enel spa first dabbled in the russian market in managing a power plant near st petersburg and doubling its capacity it hit one snag in energy rich russia it couldnt get extra natural gas to juice the expanded plant that experience might seem like a flashing red warning light against investing in russia but the italian electricity giant is pouring up to &# billion into russia in an attempt to make money in the last vast untapped power market on the continent enels willingness to make such an investment is an indication of both the immense potential rewards and risks that lie in russias energy sector for such a big bet there still are many unknowns such as the ability to secure fuel supply dealing with government imposed electricity prices and winning the favor of the pound gorilla of russian energy policy oao gazprom in addition as the european union grows wary of moscows potential to wield its energy might to expand its political goals investments like enels could get caught in the cross fire how enel fares in russia could determine whether other companies follow it also will test moscows willingness to let foreigners into politically sensitive industries such as power enels strategy in russia makes the italian company one of the biggest foreign companies in russias energy sector with projects ranging from arctic natural gas production to power plants that will supply electricity to businesses and homes of ordinary russians moscow estimates it will need up to &# billion to upgrade its overtaxed electric power plants and distribution grid to keep up with economic growth e on ag of germany also has invested heavily in russia but it hasnt been as aggressive as enel rwe ag of germany international power plc of the united kingdom and vattenfall ab of sweden have all said they are closely following the market these utilities face the same challenges their market share at home is capped by regulators and they need to push abroad to expand western europe has undergone a consolidation in its power sector enel e on and others already have expanded into countries such as the czech republic and bulgaria as eastern european markets have opened up russia several times the size of all of eastern europe remains the final frontier but the russian power landscape is laden with tripwires from spotty fuel supplies to contending with gazproms monopoly on transporting gas as well as the russian giants presence as an electricity supplier enel has tried to skip over them through a strategy of hitting the right political chords and forging close ties with gazprom while at the same time controlling all the links in the business to ensure it can meet its own fuel supply needs chief executive fulvio conti said enels experience in st petersburg convinced him of the importance of locking in his own gas supplies since then he has constructed a business model in russia that he said could give him a substantial jump on any competitors in april enel together with italian oil giant eni spa won an auction for eight siberian oil and gas fields holding five billion barrels of oil equivalent that once belonged to bankrupt russian oil giant oao yukos shortly before the auction enel and eni cut a deal with gazprom to sell the russian gas monopoly of the assets the deal shielded gazprom from potential litigation from former yukos stakeholders who claim the company was driven into bankruptcy in a politically motivated campaign from the kremlin but as part of the deal mr conti also was able to win an agreement from gazprom to transport the gas through its pipeline network to a set of power plants enel was looking to buy in june enel spent &# billion for of ogk a constellation of power plants in western russia that supplies electricity to customers ranging from large industry to private homes since then enel has increased its stake to and is waiting for regulatory approval to take that up to with enels own gas supplies from the former yukos assets its transport deal with gazprom and its own power plants where it can convert the gas into electricity mr conti said he has created a virtuous circle that will earn high margins "thats the winning model " he said in an interview "what makes it even sweeter is the transport accord with gazprom " derek weaving senior utilities analyst at renaissance capital in moscow said enels strategy is proof that russias power sector is still far from a level playing field "you are always dependent on the good graces of gazprom " he said part of that is what enel can offer gazprom in italy gazprom is eager to expand its reach abroad and mr conti is negotiating a reciprocal deal in which gazprom could buy into some power generating assets in italy "russia wants reciprocal investment and were more than happy to deal with them on this " said mr conti mr conti insists that the risks in the russian market are low he said russia desperately needs foreign capital to build its infrastructure in addition he expects moscow to follow through with its promise to liberalize the electricity market and gradually let the prices consumers pay for power rise from current levels which are far below market rates "i think the risk that they dont follow their own rules is low " said mr conti
