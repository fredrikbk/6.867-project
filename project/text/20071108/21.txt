canceled vaccine may have boosted hiv risk seattle new evidence suggests that merck &amp co s experimental hiv vaccine may have made its recipients more vulnerable to the deadly aids virus and has prompted researchers to warn participants in other trials that similarly made vaccines for a range of other diseases might also increase their susceptibility to hiv merck canceled development of its hiv vaccine in september after it became clear in a clinical trial that it didnt prevent infection or reduce the amount of hiv in subjects who became infected since then merck and its partners have analyzed data from the participant trial and found the damage may be deeper in a large subset of participants those given the vaccine acquired hiv at a higher rate than those who received a placebo all participants were hiv negative at the start of the trial scientists presented their analyses yesterday in seattle at a conference of the hiv vaccine trials network or hvtn which co sponsored the trial with merck the trial was conducted in north and south america the caribbean and australia a second trial in south africa has also been stopped the merck vaccine which includes only a few synthetic fragments of hiv loaded onto a genetically modified cold virus called an adenovirus couldnt itself infect patients with hiv instead the vaccine might have altered the immune system to facilitate infection some researchers are concerned that other vaccines made with the adenovirus could have the same effect scientifically the failure of the merck vaccine will make researchers "relook at everything " says anthony fauci a veteran hiv researcher and the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases he says scientists will likely re examine myriad issues from the animal models used to test a vaccine before it is tried in humans to the blood tests used to determine if a vaccine is stimulating the immune system the national institutes of health which helped sponsor mercks aborted clinical trial recently paused recruitment for vaccine trials involving several diseases including ebola those vaccines like the failed merck one are made with an adenovirus says gary nabel director of the nihs vaccine research center the nih trials are expected to continue but researchers want to advise subjects of the potential risks dr nabel says in addition researchers will meet next month to rethink whether and how to change a future nih trial of an hiv vaccine constructed from an adenovirus excluding the south african trial as of mid october there were cases overall of hiv infection among the male volunteers in the vaccine group compared with cases among the men in the placebo group among the men who had high levels of pre existing immunity to the cold virus there were infections among those who received the vaccine and nine among those who received the placebo its possible that the result occurred purely by chance or that it was caused by behavioral factors unrelated to the biology of the vaccine among the many possible explanations are differences in the participants rate of circumcision which is known to reduce a mans chances of acquiring hiv and variations in the strain of hiv that infected participants the merck vaccine is made from an adenovirus that is rendered unable to cause a cold and is genetically engineered to carry three hiv genes the subjects who appeared more susceptible to hiv infection are those who entered the study with pre existing immunity to the adenovirus in that group "there seem to be more cases of hiv infection in those who were actually vaccinated " says keith gottesdiener vice president of vaccine and infectious disease clinical research at merck of whitehouse station n j "we dont really know the reasons for this " its possible that subjects immunity to the cold virus may not have played a direct role but instead was a marker for some other phenomenon that increased patients susceptibility it is widely agreed that only a vaccine can end the aids epidemic last year more than four million people world wide contracted hiv and nearly three million died according to united nations estimates nearly million people live with hiv the merck vaccines failure was already a big blow to aids researchers and advocates who had become discouraged by the failure of prior experimental hiv vaccines that tried to stimulate the body to produce antibodies that would ward off infection mercks approach instead focused on the other arm of the immune system t cells that attack and kill cells that hiv has already infected it is possible that the merck vaccines failure indicates similar vaccines may be doomed as well merck hasnt disclosed how much it spent to develop the vaccine but it has said it worked on the project for about a decade the possibility of heightened infection risk from the merck vaccine may present researchers with an additional stumbling block more reluctance by people to participate in other vaccine trials "we need to ensure that future trials particularly the recruitment of participants in future trials doesnt get jeopardized" because of confusion about the merck results says mitchell warren executive director of the new york based aids vaccine advocacy coalition participants in mercks main trial were considered to be at high risk of exposure to the virus because of their sexual activity or drug use volunteers were informed in advance that their participation might increase decrease or have no effect on their risk of infection according to the informed consent form each volunteer signed before participating in the trial such forms generally offer strong protection in court against "garden variety informed consent" lawsuits said michelle mello an associate professor of health policy and law at harvard university who has studied cases stemming from clinical trials but isnt familiar with mercks vaccine trial merck says participants in the main trial can ask whether they were given the vaccine or placebo in south africa participants have already been told what they received in both trials subjects are being told that they may be more susceptible to infection if they were vaccinated hiv infects the immune systems cd cells especially those that have been "activated" to fight off infection one leading theory on why vaccinated participants may have been more likely to contract hiv is that the vaccine may have activated cd cells to fight the vaccines adenovirus or hiv flooding the body with the very cells that hiv likes to infect instead of suppressing hiv infection therefore the vaccine might have facilitated it "one possibility is that almost any time you immunize somebody for anything you give them a window of increased susceptibility" to hiv says harvard immunologist bruce walker who wasnt involved in the trials but will head a scientific committee charged with examining the data in people with pre existing immunity to the adenovirus the vaccine may have stimulated particularly large numbers of activated cd cells susan buchbinder co chair of the main trial and a member of the hvtn says researchers plan to follow participants to determine whether any increased susceptibility persists echoing other researchers dr gottesdiener of merck says the new findings should "be approached very cautiously" because the analysis is preliminary many other researchers noted that after the fact analyses are notoriously prone to error
