wonder land a medal for miss lee the presidential medal of freedom was awarded on monday to harper lee the author of "to kill a mockingbird " "to kill a mockingbird" in part the story of lawyer atticus finchs doomed defense of a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman in s alabama is arguably the most famous book on american civil rights ever written publishers weekly estimates it has sold some million copies look it up on amazon com and you will find it has about "customer reviews " so to the millions of student essay questions built around this book let me add one more compare and contrast "to kill a mockingbird" to the current bestselling book "my grandfathers son " by supreme court justice clarence thomas justice thomas in fact mentions "to kill a mockingbird" twice in his autobiography it was his grandmother tinas favorite book and in the summer of his second year of law school he traveled with a black attorney to a small georgia town to help represent a man accused of raping a white woman "it looked just like the courtroom scene in to kill a mockingbird " he said except the defendant was white "to kill a mockingbird" is literature and art but there can be little doubt that harper lee wrote her novel to make a political point about the status of blacks in the south in the early s rosa parks had refused to yield her bus seat in the novel was released on christmas day in still early in this important period the famous movie came out the following year with lawyer atticus finch portrayed by gregory peck by now "to kill a mockingbird" is wholly folded into the political life of the country it is safe to say that most democrats would consider the book to be an iconic testament to their legacy liberalisms greatest achievement one imagines that harper lee would agree with this but as with justice thomass famously sphinx like demeanor during oral arguments at the supreme court there has been nary a peep in more than years about the books meaning from miss lee it would sound absurd to refer to her as ms lee while schoolchildren today are assigned the book as an exercise in the formation of social virtue harper lee herself saw the novel as about more than that indeed one reads nearly pages into the novels account of scout and jem finch in maycomb before the racial drama arrives in time "to kill a mockingbird" got in the traps of acute political sensitivity there were objections to her use of "nigger " this is absurd but after the attempted book bannings of "huckleberry finn" and "to kill a mockingbird " it is unlikely any novelist today would risk similar assault by writing "nigger" in any context amid one of the attempted bans of her book by a virginia school board harper lee sent off a letter in to the richmond news leader "surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that to kill a mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct christian in its ethic that is the heritage of all southerners " clarence thomas is a son of the heritage that was harper lees south his description of his hometown pinpoint ga is similarly idyllic to harper lees fictional maycomb in alabama when he was though mr thomass mother moved with him and his brother to savannah "when i was a boy " mr thomas writes "savannah was hell " the physical poverty and squalor mr thomas describes during their early years in savannah is astonishing "the toilet was outdoors in the muddy backyard " its metal bowl cracked and rusty its wooden seat rotting his mother chose to use a chamber pot which clarence emptied he appears to have had virtually no significant contact with white people until high school we may assume that harper lee composed her remarkable story about the unjustly accused and gunned down tom robinson so that some day a clarence thomas could rise from pinpoint to the nations highest court if so we then have to account for this famous and still astounding statement by judge thomas toward the end of his corrosive confirmation hearings for the supreme court "from my standpoint as a black american it is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves to do for themselves to have different ideas and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order this is what will happen to you you will be lynched destroyed caricatured by a committee of the u s senate rather than hung from a tree " this wasnt it was the depth of mr thomass bitterness and anger over the racism he experienced in the south and north expressed throughout "my grandfathers son" is profound the only other force that seems to have touched every corner of mr thomass being is his grandfather "daddy " who raised him it is hard to miss the similarities between harper lees stiff necked lawyer distant father and hero atticus finch and clarence thomass hero his strait laced grandfather what mr thomas absorbed from his grandfather in an often harsh and brutal manner is precisely what harper lee said is at the core of "to kill a mockingbird" a code of honor and conduct atticus finch i think would have objected to what was done to clarence thomas in that senate confirmation hearing today a black man is running for the presidency perhaps the campaign is too long and perhaps barack obama is too young and too inexperienced to be president consider though the current knock on mr obama it is that he wont attack hillary with sufficient aggression that he is too gentlemanly even too "professorial" in demeanor presumably his critics would prefer the slashing tongue of a hip hop performer than the self contained barack obama who epitomizes middle class black achievement well years ago they preferred something other than the conservative middle class black man sent to the supreme court in his remarks presenting the medal of freedom to miss lee president bush said "as a model of humane sensibility this book will be read and studied forever " maybe some folks should re read it
