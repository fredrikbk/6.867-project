politics &amp economics the wall street journal nbc news poll poll suggests clinton is vulnerable she loses points on honesty ideology virtual tie with giuliani washington democrats enter the election campaign with powerful political advantages but face a tough and unpredictable battle because of the vulnerabilities of front runner hillary clinton and the democratic controlled congress a wall street journal nbc news poll shows that americans have turned sharply away from president bush and toward domestic issues favoring his partisan adversaries majorities believe the iraq war cant be won and want most u s troops withdrawn by the dawn of a new presidents term in but offsetting that demand for change in the presidential contest are reservations about sen clintons truthfulness and ideology even as americans applaud her experience and leadership qualities the result she is in a virtual dead heat with leading republican candidate rudy giuliani when the two are matched up the electorates shifting agenda "does tilt the field against republicans " said republican pollster bill mcinturff who helps conduct the journal nbc survey and yet his democratic counterpart peter hart said "this is an exceptionally close election" less than a year before election day mrs clintons rivals in both parties are moving to exploit the doubts revealed by the survey which was conducted after last weeks democratic debate at which she faced accusations of evasiveness and double talk sen barack obama of illinois used humor over the weekend doffing a halloween mask on the "saturday night live" television program and declaring "i have nothing to hide " former sen john edwards of north carolina has attacked more sharply challenging mrs clinton in iowa to remain in "tell the truth mode all the time " messrs edwards and obama both run even against mr giuliani too matching mrs clintons standing even though they arent as well known as she is but mr obama would enter a general election with serious vulnerabilities of his own since just of americans rate him positively on having enough experience for the presidency and just rate him positively on "being a good commander in chief " mr giuliani has maintained an aggressive stance toward his in state rival for the white house while promoting his antiterror credentials with tough talk on iran the former new york city mayor slammed mrs clinton for displaying "the worst of the clinton years" by equivocating in the debate on drivers licenses for illegal immigrants "if you think a question about drivers licenses is a tough question a gotcha question youre not ready for iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad " mr giuliani told a new hampshire town hall meeting a few days ago the former first lady has responded to criticism by touting her "experience at both ends of the capital" in battling for "women and children and people who feel invisible and left out " mrs clinton has generally avoided responding directly to attacks on her candor and straightforwardness she argues that she has laid out specific positions on important and politically risky issues such as health care while noting that in the case of social security her demurrals are designed to avoid "a republican trap " by to the poll shows americans prefer that a democrat gets elected to succeed mr bush next november in a direct matchup of leading candidates however that margin shrinks to for mrs clinton and for mr giuliani because of defections from voters like linda dunbar "i just dont totally trust her " said the year old homemaker from the cleveland suburb of seven hills though mrs dunbar voted for bill clinton in the s she would back mr giuliani over mrs clinton next november because at a time of steep foreign policy challenges "i just dont believe the international world is ready for a woman president " the survey conducted among an unusually large sample of adults with an error margin of percentage points shows a divergence in assessments of mrs clintons personal qualities while a majority gives her high marks for being "knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency " pluralities rate mrs clinton negatively on honesty likability and sharing their positions on the issues that isnt hurting her nationally in the democratic primary contest mrs clinton leads with support to for mr obama and for mr edwards who fell from in september the top candidates remain in a competitive three way contest in iowa however among republicans mr giuliani who notwithstanding his support for abortion rights picked up the backing of religious right leader pat robertson yesterday leads with sen john mccain of arizona who gained the endorsement of sen sam brownback of kansas another prominent conservative christian who recently dropped out of the presidential race runs second at former sen fred thompson of tennessee has fallen to from in late september former gov mitt romney of massachusetts who leads in the kickoff states of iowa and new hampshire remains stuck in fourth place nationally at former gov mike huckabee of arkansas has crept up to nationally in most respects the contours of the contest look auspicious for democrats at all levels just of americans said the next president should take an approach similar to mr bushs while want a different approach moreover americans by to call the economy and health care issues that favor democrats more important to their vote than the republicans relative strong suits of terrorism and values thats a reversal from the journal nbc poll finding just before the vote that re elected mr bush and republican congressional majorities when voters rated terrorism and values more important by a to margin that shift bodes well for democrats in congress as well as the partys presidential field by to americans want democrats to retain control of congress at the same time the poll shows that democratic congressional leaders have ample reason for concern
