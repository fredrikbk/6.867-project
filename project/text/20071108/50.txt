ford microsoft create car system that lets you ask for a song under the hood modern cars are packed with computers but in the passenger cabin they remain analog islands in a digital world for some this may be a blessed relief but others want to bring their digital music and digital messaging into the place where they spend hours every week unfortunately thats still too clumsy a process yes more cars are making it easy to connect wirelessly with bluetooth equipped cellphones so drivers can make hands free phone calls but not hands free text messaging and that results in the dangerous practice of texting while behind the wheel and yes you can pipe the sound from your portable music player into the cars speakers but you usually have to control the song selection and skipping by handling the player itself and thats another dangerous distraction some car makers solve this music problem with integration kits that transfer control of the music player to the dashboard or steering wheel controls and display song information on a dashboard screen but this option is most common in luxury cars and is typically designed only for apples ipods now ford motor working with microsoft has come up with a system thats a big step forward in integrating cellphones and portable music players into cars its highly versatile and works with numerous devices on a wide range of ford models ive been testing the &# option called sync with multiple cellphones and music players its quite good and indicates that the digitally backward auto industry finally may be getting it sync combines the often separate cellphone and music player functions into one unified interface that can be controlled by a voice recognition system that works well you can command it by voice to play a single song out of thousands on your ipod or other music player with some phones it will even read your incoming cellphone text messages to you and properly pronounce text message shortcuts such as lol laughing out loud ford isnt limiting this system to luxury cars its available on a dozen models including the companys least expensive car the ford focus i tested sync on a focus sync simultaneously handles multiple cellphones and music players from a variety of companies it imports and remembers the address books and song information for up to phones and four players so that as you connect and reconnect a remembered device wired or wirelessly it is ready to go it doesnt have a hard disk and doesnt store your music unlike other approaches the ford system doesnt require a special cable or proprietary connector it uses a standard usb port and the cable that came with your player sync will even play music directly from a usb thumb drive theres also an audio in jack for players that dont support usb or which require both sync can even stream music wirelessly over bluetooth from the cellphones that support this feature however due to limitations in bluetooth it doesnt transfer song selection controls or the song information display to the dashboard in this scenario the same limitation applies if your player can be connected only with the audio in jack i tested sync with two music players and four cellphones and the system handled them all effortlessly i used a year old ipod and a new samsung p as my test music players and sync quickly transferred their song information and allowed me to select playlists artists albums genres and individual songs by voice command i tried the cellphone functions with an apple iphone a motorola razr a rim blackberry and a new htc shadow phone and again all worked properly while phone calls and address book imports were handled easily on all the phones some of syncs advanced functions like the reading of text messages and the streaming of music arent widely supported on all phones for example only the razr worked with the text message feature the iphone test was especially interesting because it is both a bluetooth equipped phone and a full fledged ipod the sync treated it as both simultaneously i found the voice command system surprisingly reliable in four days of testing i encountered only a few instances in which my commands were misunderstood sync has some limitations while it can read text messages on compatible phones ford didnt build in the ability to dictate and send text messages you can send only canned messages like "be there in minutes " but there are a lot of advanced features too many to list here and ford plans to add others which owners will be able to install at home detailed information on the system is available at syncmyride com alas i did discover one glitch twice during my testing sync mistakenly declared that a music player had been unplugged when it hadnt been the system recovered with a little fiddling but ford needs to fix this still sync is a very well done method for integrating digital devices into a car and in a model that most people can afford email me at mossberg wsj com find all my
