a cultural conversation with susan stroman brookss young frankenstein is her broadway creation too new york from out of town tryouts the cast of the new mel brooks musical had made it to the stage of the hilton theatre a stones throw from times square in early october there they all were back in rehearsal mode roger bart as the mad doctor frederick "thats fronk n steen " frankenstein christopher fitzgerald as igor "thats eye gor " megan mullally as the doctors madcap nympho fiancee sutton foster as his buxom lab assistant andrea martin as the gothic chatelaine whose name scares the horses and shuler hensley as the green faced monster all singing and dancing their hearts out for a small army of scattered technicians at their blazing computer screens "its hard for them to do it just for us with a bit of clap clap clap " said susan stroman the soft spoken blond generalissima of the operation tapping her toes and passing notes to lieutenants from her command post in the center of the orchestra "the audience in seattle went crazy but theyre doing good this is our first run through in wigs and costumes theyve got eight seconds for a full change from transylvanians to medical students and everybody made it this is my favorite part to tweak to cut and polish editing the choreography the script the music the sets it takes so much to get a whole musical up a lot of times you have to put everything up there for the writers sake but the last part of the process is the audience theyll tell you if something is funny or not something thats funny in your living room will get total silence and something you never expected will make people explode we couldnt make changes in seattle because everything affects so many departments luckily it took two weeks for the sets to get here from the west coast " ms stroman familiarly known as stroman or stro is the tony award winning director choreographer behind the first mel brooks musical that megamonster "the producers " in "young frankenstein " which opens tonight mr brooks is recycling another of his vintage hollywood spoofs embellished by his own tuneful music and nutty lyrics the advance unofficial but from a reliable source is said to exceed &# million ms stroman has been coddling "young frankenstein" along for two years now "the show was in its very early stages at that point " ms stroman says "mel had a couple of melodies but he loves the collaboration of musicals he loves meetings and starting from the beginning wed meet very often with thomas meehan the co author of the book and glen kelly the musical supervisor when mel is writing he becomes the characters igor and dr frankenstein and even inga the babe so the meetings are always fun filled " the fun continued when the company got into the theater after his first glimpse of the dream sequence "join the family business " mr brooks was heard to exclaim "my ancestors were so crazy but boy could they dance " now the line is mr barts at an early preview with both mr brooks and gene wilder co author and star of the movie in attendance the house was packed with fans who pounced on every gag from the screenplay with eager delight no doubt hundreds more like them are showing up every night the one about the ancestors takes people by surprise and thats just fine as far as ms stroman is concerned her job is not to clone a classic but to start from scratch "i always work off the script a writer hands me " she says "off the script and the music and the lyrics i approach every show as if it were new even with oklahoma doing the dances for trevor nunns production we worked as if it had never been done before in the end you have to bring your own talents and vision to the table adapting a screenplay to a musical makes it different the minute someone sings an emotion its heightened more than it could ever be in a movie in the movie of young frankenstein frau blucher says he vas my boyfriend and its a great line but in the show its an entire number and the line is magnified times this young frankenstein stands on the shoulders of the movie as the actors stand on the shoulders of the original players but because its a musical its very different from the original conception its its own unique creature " besides theres the inherent magic of live theater "i love the movies " ms stroman says "but theres something more gratifying about the theater just the fact that its live and the audience response is live everything about the theater is life affirming because youre always present in the moment thats why people forget the movie they saw on friday night but they never forget the night they went to the theater " a five time tony award winner ms stroman falls into the line of star directors who came up from choreography like all her shows "young frankenstein" has movement moments to take your breath away igor tossing his cape open at the apex of a jump inga sliding into a split on a gurney like some swan queen from the bolshoi but never for their own sake mr brooks wrote his opening song "the happiest town" as a big production number ms stroman gave him a curtain raiser "were in a village in transylvania " she says "we find out that victor frankenstein has died and we find out that he has a living relative dr frederick frankenstein which is news to the town we have to get straight to frederick " eight seconds later there he is lecturing in new york on the wonders of the human brain when he sets sail for europe his fashion plate fiancee sends him off with the bon voyage number "please dont touch me " and there the dancing gets more expansive in the service of character and comedy which are actually the same thing "when i taught the company that number i taught it with partnering with the boys holding on " says ms stroman "then i had them do the same thing separated the girls were assuming the boys would still help them with their dips they didnt and the falls came in automatically and everybody laughed " out in the house theyre laughing too a lot is expected of a broadway performer these days "i think people really expect them to do it all " ms stroman says "to sing to dance to act but the talent is out there people are being taught the days of having a singing chorus and a dancing chorus are over " of course the bar is that much higher for the leads mr bart comes to frederick as a veteran of two previous stroman productions "the producers " "the frogs" not to mention his stint as snoopy in "youre a good man charlie brown " hunting down the red baron with demonic intensity "roger bart was born to play frankenstein " says ms stroman "a straight leading man couldnt do it but roger can cross from leading man to eccentric character actor and back in no time theres a danger in his eyes a spontaneous aura that makes an audience sit up hes one of a kind " she sees that same individuality in the other principals "its very much like the world of the mel brooks players in the movies gene wilder zero mostel harvey korman marty feldman madeline kahn roger bart is one of a kind sutton foster is one of a kind christopher fitzgerald it was the same with the original producers cast its one of a kindness that makes the ensemble so powerful " whatever talents her collaborators bring to a project ms stroman is sure to ask for more mr brooks envisioned toy horses pulling a hay wagon for the number "roll in the hay " instead courtesy of ms stromans longtime colleague william ivey long theres a priceless pair of merry escapees from "equus " dressed in unitards and bustles that disappear into the shadow "i told william i need horses but youll only see their heads " ms stroman says "i wanted them to be funny and to have real personalities " they prick up their ears when inga breaks into yodeling which by the way is a new trick for the game ms foster "i thought that would be fun to add that element " ms stroman says "to help highlight the romanian hungarian atmosphere the trick is to yodel once and then to accelerate i thought sutton could learn to do it so i bought a cd called how to yodel gave it to her and patrick brady the music director and said dont come back until you know how to yodel it didnt take sutton long she perfected it in a week " entertainment art would ms stroman make a distinction "as much as i love to listen to the sound and breath of the audience i have to be happy with what ive created " she says "in the end you have to please yourself and if youre pleasing yourself you are doing your art " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal about culture and philanthropy
