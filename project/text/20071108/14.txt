booster shot frequency is questioned in study vaccines against measles mumps and tetanus can fight off diseases for decades says a study that questions whether americans need booster shots with the frequency they currently are being given in the study published in the new england journal of medicine researchers at oregon health &amp science university in beaverton said they found surprisingly high levels of disease resisting antibodies in the blood of patients who had been vaccinated years earlier vaccines prompt antibody creation by giving patients a small dose of the virus that creates the disease the persistence of the antibodies suggests that current recommendations for booster shots for some common conditions could be revised the study said for instance mark k slifka one of the studys authors said that tetanus shots could be given once approximately every years instead of once every years as currently is recommended the study found that protection from conditions such as measles mumps and rubella following exposure to the diseases were in most cases maintained for life although it isnt dangerous to get booster shots the studys authors said it may be unnecessary in some circumstances "if we can continue to improve our vaccines someday we might be able to give one shot and give lifelong immunity " said mr slifka associate professor at the oregon universitys vaccine and gene therapy institute john treanor a physician specializing in infectious diseases at the university of rochester in new york state said that before the health care system eliminates boosters more study is needed on outbreaks of certain diseases and declining vaccine efficacy "i think this is helpful and great to have " he said referring to the study "i dont know if this is so definitive " the researchers said that the efficacy of vaccines doesnt apply across the board children frequently need chickenpox booster shots after five years because the vaccine antibodies arent as potent as the antibodies created by the disease itself mr slifka noted the researchers analyzed stored blood samples from patients with each sample the authors analyzed the decay rate for antibodies from vaccines for measles mumps rubella varicella zoster virus and epstein barr the herpes virus that causes mononucleosis
