how it has evolved over the years there are interactive kiosks for the civil war world wars i and ii vietnam and the war on terror that tell the stories of a handful of the men and women who have earned the medal and there are several interactive stations that let you search the complete database of medal of honor recipients by name service or conflict read even just a few of their citations and you realize that we could not possibly build a place majestic or sacred enough to honor their service the medal of honor created early in the civil war to be presented "to such non commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier like qualities " was extended to army officers in and to navy officers in the first was earned for action that occurred even before the medal was created in february army surgeon bernard j d irwin helped liberate troops trapped at apache pass ariz by chiricahua indians under the command of

machinegun mounted on an instruction stand in a completely exposed section of the parking ramp which was under heavy enemy machinegun strafing fire although painfully wounded many times he continued to man this gun and to return the enemys fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety it was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention " fourteen other sailors earned the medal that day posthumously in italy in former detroit lion maurice "footsie" britt showed his grit on another field he "personally killed and wounded an unknown number of germans wiped out one enemy machinegun crew fired clips of carbine and an undetermined amount of m rifle ammunition and threw fragmentation grenades his bold aggressive actions utterly disregarding superior enemy numbers resulted in capture of germans of them wounded and enabled several captured americans to escape lt britts undaunted courage and prowess in arms were largely responsible for repulsing a german counterattack which if successful would have isolated his battalion and destroyed his company " korea and vietnam also produced a number of notable medal of honor earners including former nebraska sen bob kerrey the first medals of honor awarded since vietnam were given

shugharts citation reads in part "after their third request to be inserted he and his team leader sgt gordon received permission to perform this volunteer mission when debris and enemy ground fire at the site caused them to abort the first attempt sergeant shughart and his team leader were inserted one hundred meters south of the crash site equipped with only his sniper rifle and a pistol and

the other crew members from the aircraft establishing a perimeter which placed him and his fellow sniper in the most vulnerable position sergeant shughart used his long range rifle and side arm to kill an undetermined number of attackers while moving around the perimeter protecting the downed crew sergeant shughart continued his protective fire until he depleted his ammunition and was fatally wounded his actions saved the pilots life " sgt gordons citation is equally moving "after his team member sgt shughart was fatally wounded and his own rifle ammunition exhausted master sergeant gordon

terrain and in the face of almost certain death he fought his way into open terrain to gain a better position to transmit a call lieutenant murphy maintained his exposed position while he provided his location and requested immediate support for his team in his final act of bravery he continued to engage the enemy until he was mortally wounded gallantly giving his life for his country and for the
