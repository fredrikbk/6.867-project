building awareness starting up the art of the gimmick online edition from smsmallbiz com for start up business owners nothing says "here i am" like an enticing sales promotion when a young couple getting married in boston last november spotted rain they werent upset a bit that same day richard berberian owner of elyse fine jewelers in reading mass where the couple purchased their engagement and wedding rings was doing what he calls "the happy dance " six months earlier berberian had started a sales promotion that called for a full refund of the price of a couples engagement and wedding rings if the national weather service at bostons logan international airport reported at least half an inch of precipitation on the couples wedding day to limit his risk berberian had sought out prize insurance which took about six months to find "it is very difficult to insure a program like this " he says largely because the payout hinges on nothing more than the weather but from that one fateful day the couple got back the &# they paid for their rings and berberian &lt mdash&gt who didnt have to pay anything besides roughly &# for the insurance premium &lt mdash&gt won an impressive amount of publicity including a front page story in the boston globe and numerous television reports thanks to the promotion the four year old business now "sells three to four more engagement rings a month " he says "at about &# to &# a pop thats a lot of money " being the new kid on the block poses a challenge for any business owner while a big business often gets its name out via high priced advertising campaigns or blow out sales a small business typically cant afford such strategies for this reason many entrepreneurs like berberian are increasingly turning to marketing gimmicks to get noticed an over the top sales promotion can be a great way to gain attention and boost sales but if things go wrong such promotions "can be an expensive way of building awareness " says bonnie carlson president of the promotion marketing association in new york that was the case for lee peppard who in started the first ever national foosball championship in missoula mont with a &# prize peppard who sold foosball tables though his company tournament soccer hosted more and more tournaments eventually doling out some &# million in prizes at events through one unfortunate problem he didnt count on foosballs popularity to fade not only did tournament soccer declare bankruptcy in but peppard had to pay winners cash prizes out of his own pocket according to johnny lott co author of the recently released "world table soccer almanac " peppard who went on to head medalist marketing corp a soft tip dart promotion company based in pacific wash was traveling in europe and unable to comment for this story for business owners considering making a similarly high stakes bet be sure to take the necessary precautions here are some ways to not only limit your risk but also translate promotional enthusiasm into long lasting customer relationships keys to promotional success promotional success starts with a consistent message says john jantsch author of "duct tape marketing" and a kansas city mo based marketing coach "people really like getting free stuff " he says but if theres no association between the giveaway item and your brand your efforts and the promotions cost will likely be spent in vain instead he says "spend some time finding an item that has a natural or metaphorical tie in to your businesss core message " from the very beginning sisters casey and sloane simmons started their kansas city mo designer arts and crafts store with "people not product" in mind says casey for nearly years stuff has sponsored large scale promotional events such as "diva day" geared toward women customers and "wings of hope " a cancer fundraiser for the holiday season about to people usually pile into the sisters square foot store to attend the two day events which are typically replete with entertainment demonstrations and giveaways its an opportunity she says for people to see brand new works of the season donate to a worthy charity and to connect with artisans and other community members the major events she says score solid sales and serve as the "top performing days of the year " its also a good idea to target your message for instance jantsch says a local accountant might send out about a hundred or so calculators with the businesss name and contact information stenciled prominently on the outer casing to select residents in this situation he says timing is also important that same accountant for example might have a greater response if the calculators are sent out just before tax time be sure to also follow up with customers and clients bruce hollander executive vice president at don jagoda associates a promotional marketing agency in new york recommends establishing a database of customers during promotions "as you begin to compile a database and do follow up marketing promotions can allow you to sell more products going forward " he says ways to reduce risk its also a good idea to get prize insurance especially if youre considering a large scale promotion a number of companies offer this unusual insurance one is grand prize promotions in richardson texas which sells policies covering prizes worth &# to &# million starting at &# per event according to brad henderson a spokesman for the insurer when debbie martinez and her husband planned the first annual fight "fore" sight golf invitational at her familys terrace hill golf course in algonquin ill the couple tapped hole in one international a reno nev company that specializes in insurance for golf contests for a &# premium which sams club a sponsor of the charity event agreed to fund the insurer covered &# worth of prizes at the event a person scoring a hole in one on certain holes throughout the course would have been able to choose between a new bmw a custom motorcycle or &# in cash "we wouldnt have paid anything out of pocket " says debbie as it turned out no golfer made a hole in one but the event raised &# for a foundation for the martinezes twin sons who are seeing impaired and also made terrace hill more well known in the community since the event allowed nonmembers to attend "quite a few people signed up for the waiting list " she says another option for cutting costs and limiting risk is to give away donated prizes for instance virtual instruments a magazine that focuses on music software has offered readers a "chance to win" ever since its first issue in june various companies that want their own publicity will give items to the magazine for free the magazine in turn advertises the prizes on its front cover the current giveaway item is music creation software valued at &# according to nick batzdorf the magazines founder in los angeles about people enter each contest and at &# an issue that attention he says
