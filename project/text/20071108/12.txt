playgrounds and street corners but over the past decade it has blossomed into an international sport with hundreds of teams and thousands of global competitors the most storied jump rope event is double dutch in which two ropes are spun in eggbeater fashion while a jumper leaps between them it was perfected in the inner cities of america and for decades u s teams owned the sport in recent years though the japanese have tipped the balance surging past the americans with eye grabbing dance moves and intricate blends of music and movement four of the past five years japanese teams have taken top honors at the double dutch holiday classic at the apollo theater in new york one of the major events in the sport now just as u s car companies cribbed from japanese rivals in the s some american jump rope teams are borrowing from asian competitors one team the bouncing bulldogs from here in chapel hill has gone to unusual lengths to mimic the japanese as their rematch at the apollo in december approaches during a recent practice a few of the bulldogs jumpers boasted red t shirts decorated with the japanese flag and an image of the bulldog mascot wearing a hachimaki or traditional japanese headband at the door the teams coach ray frederick clasped his hands and greeted a parent and child with a bow "hes really into that now " said tim martin one of the teams top jumpers in march the year old mr frederick shipped about of his jumpers off to tokyo and nagoya to study new techniques including handsprings with the team that bested them at the apollo last year mr martin a lanky college freshman is fine tuning a sideways flip that he learned during the trip another member of the team is in email contact with a japanese jumper he met there who sends him performance videos when the clips arrive the bulldogs gather around a tv to analyze the moves this global shakeup in double dutch comes even as jump rope is more popular than ever in the u s in january more than eight million people watched the disney channel jump rope movie "jump in " starring the young actor corbin bleu membership in usa jump rope one of the largest jump rope organizations in the country grew last year to about the bulldogs who have traveled the globe and won scores of jump rope events have long been the team to beat in double dutch the team has about jumpers mostly girls ranging in age from to mary hunter benton a tall bubbly year old joined the team when she was after seeing members perform at a mall she practices up to nine times a week for two hours at a time sometimes starting as early as in the morning jumping rope has taken her from australia to the virgin islands the bulldogs practice in several spartan rooms at the back of a dance supply store in a strip mall the decor is drab concrete the girls locker room doubles as a storage space for cleaning equipment yet the team is famous members perform more than a hundred times a year they make regular half time appearances in basketball games at duke and the university of north carolina recently news of the bulldogs has spread through the local japanese community in chapel hill and mr frederick is courting a handful of grade schoolers there for his top traveling squad which includes about of the best jumpers "theyre going to take our program to another level " he says jump rope was not mr fredericks first career choice growing up in the poor rural north carolina town of shelby he dreamed of playing professional basketball or baseball instead he started teaching physical education in elementary schools in chapel hill after watching children practicing double dutch at a basketball court he decided to incorporate it into his classes students were so enthusiastic he formed his own team the bouncing bulldogs that was years ago the early history of double dutch in the u s is in dispute some say it came over with the first dutch settlers while others say it didnt appear until the first half of the s but all agree that the sports heyday was in predominantly black urban centers like harlem in the s groups of girls gathered on street corners to show off new tricks and used clotheslines as ropes since then double dutch has evolved differently in different parts of the world complicated rope work is rewarded in some leagues but not in others music and unassisted flips are ok or taboo depending on the event the japanese have excelled at the free form dancing style while the americans have performed better in technical and speed events double dutch made it to japan in the s thanks in part to the hit proto hip hop single "double dutch bus " at first it was seen there too mostly on the streets but it has now been formalized mostly by college students and adults who have backgrounds in professional dance the recent japanese decision to share their trade secrets would be unthinkable in other sports yasuhiro fukuda a student at tokyos nihon university who trained with the bulldogs earlier this year says the japanese share their strategies because they and the americans perform double dutch so differently "we practiced together because we thought that if two teams that have a different style exchange techniques the performance of both teams would increase " he says the salt and pepper haired mr frederick says hes "old school" and eschews flamboyant dances and multicolored uniforms the bulldogs have worn the same monochromatic t shirts and white asics sneakers for every event the team generally doesnt use music with its competitive routines either mr fredericks favorite quote reads in bright blue letters on the wall of one of his gyms "pain of discipline pain of regret take your pick " these days mr frederick is lightening up a bit as he tries to outshine the japanese the apollo event is the most free form of all double dutch competitions the rules are loosely construed and one team in used a ladder as part of its routine high entertainment value has benefited the japanese with their explosive acrobatic routines including backflips and ostentatious outfits "theres no question they have an advantage " says mr frederick about teams will compete in the holiday classic at the apollo dec to an expected sold out crowd of about while five japanese jumpers were in town for a workshop last weekend they took the bulldogs shopping for uniforms at a mall in nashville tenn during some down time after a joint performance the bulldogs had their eyes on some baggy neon orange shirts and vibrant white sweatpants "its not for me personally " says mr frederick "but ill let it go just this once " ayako nomura in tokyo contributed to this article
