home &amp family cranky consumer personalizing childrens party favors we test a range of gifts featuring our guests names special to the wsj party favors are de rigueur at childrens parties but lately weve noticed more parents presenting their tiny guests with a single personalized gift rather than the old fashioned bag stuffed with toys and trinkets not only does this cut down on the number of small plastic toys in parents homes it also can be surprisingly easy on the givers wallet as a number of companies now offer personalized gifts painted with a name and sometimes more through their web sites to find out how much work it would take to order these party favors and whether theyd be worth the extra effort we tested five companies that specialized in personalized gifts we were planning a two year olds birthday party with guests ranging from two to eight and were looking for gender neutral presents that would appeal to various ages and cost no more than &# apiece while our web sites selection of gifts and ease of navigation varied for the most part the results were pleasingly festive and speedily delivered at two recent birthday parties for the under five set we had received hand painted favors from outrageouspartyfavors com along with raves from parents about how easy ordering was and how inexpensive the gifts were once we were on the companys site which had four pages of party favor options it was easy to find picture frames at &# each that would appeal to guests of all ages ordering was just as simple we typed in the date of the party the quantity and each guests name as well as information such as shipping and billing details as with other personalized gifts sales are final so be sure to double check your guest list an order of eight party favors cost us &# although the web site said orders required two weeks to complete we received ours in six business days each favor bore the correct name and was wrapped in cellophane paper and pretty curling ribbons popular catalog company lillian vernon offers many personalized gift ideas for children via sister company lillys kids it took about an hour to click through the options in categories such as pretend play and educational toys the gifts for kids category alone had pages of ideas unfortunately most of the gifts were over &# but we finally settled on the crinkle nylon lunchbox because both boys and girls would like it and the price was an affordable &# to &# depending on the color while lillys kids specializes in personalized gifts its site isnt designed for party favor orders each of the eight personalized lunch boxes had to be ordered separately despite the hassle the lunchboxes totaling &# arrived within five business days after the order was placed each favor bore a name stenciled in script an easy to read print would have been better for our young guests mailordermommy com has a huge selection of personalized party favors that cost less than &# it also promises to wrap each personalized present in cellophane and ribbon but ordering the &# plastic microphone took a bit of time for one thing there were several subcategories under the personalized party favors button also we were momentarily confused when we couldnt type in the names we needed painted on the toys until after we specified a quantity and updated the web page once we figured that out the rest of the ordering process was just like the other web sites we just wished we had been able to print out an invoice after our sale was completed or had been emailed one the microphone which arrived in four business days was a big hit with our birthday girl she spent hours singing every song she knew and enjoying the way it made her voice seem to echo in the room happykidspersonalized com offered a smaller selection of gifts but its favors were right for a wide range of ages and tastes we quickly located a toy appropriate for both boys and girls six foam bath toys in a clear plastic carrying case depending on the size of the order the price varied but for eight party favors our price was &# per item totaling &# as with mailordermommy com ordering went a little more slowly since we had to click through a couple of web pages to check out rather than entering the whole order on one page we got a little confused when entering the names to be painted on the toy only after reading the page a couple of times did we realize we could list up to three names in each of the six name slots but after that the checkout process was like any other the favors came within two business days as specified and each childs name was hand painted in pretty colors though the favors werent wrapped although new jersey based just a dream didnt provide any party favor ideas on its web site we decided to contact them anyway based on another parents recommendation we received a reply within a few hours of our email inquiry after three more emails detailing our need for a gender neutral present for guests of various ages and a budget of &# per present we were directed to a plastic carrying case that could be hand painted with each childs name for &# each while we would have preferred to have more than one option we were happy with our leap of faith after a telephone conversation with a staff member who enthusiastically assured us that they would make the gifts extra special the brightly colored totes came within three business days and were wrapped individually in cellophane and several bright curling ribbons sporting pretty hand painted stars or hearts as well as each guests name
