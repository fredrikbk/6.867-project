smartmoney stock screen finding tomorrows stock market stars many of tomorrows top performing stocks are leaving clues today one clue might be that a companys bosses are buying its shares another might be that last quarters sales and earnings beat wall streets forecasts some clues are better than others at predicting stock returns researchers sometimes refer to the best ones as anomalies because they defy the claim of some mathematicians that the stock market cant be consistently beaten investors can screen the entire market in seconds for such clues using internet screening tools many of them cheap or free in "your next great stock " smartmoney columnist jack hough explains which clues work and why and shares the best stock screening strategies hes found in the following adaptation he discusses using research spending to find promising stocks when a company announces a breakthrough drug or a sudden advance in computer chip technology its shares often soar right away imagine being able to foresee which companies are due for such lucrative discoveries you can do something close it doesnt require palm leaves or tarot cards the only mysticism involved is that of americas accounting standards technology breakthroughs are born of two parents the first is an idea the second is money ideas are difficult to predict but money is easy to follow before a new gadget goes into production it goes through years of mock ups prototypes tests remakes and so on technology companies spend piles of money on such research theyve become good at channeling spending into projects that are most likely to pan out so the spending translates into future profits in a fairly predictable fashion follow the spending and you follow the future profits it gets better because of the way research and development spending is treated for accounting purposes it makes current earnings look lousy so at precisely the moment a company is investing to build a future profit stream its shares look unattractive buy shares of such companies at their least flattering moment and hold them until the fruit of all that research spending appears and you have a good chance of securing big gains at the heart of americas accounting standard is something called the "matching principle " it states that when possible costs should be reported in the same period as the sales they produce if a company invests in a new aluminum smelter it doesnt deduct the full cost from that quarters profits it breaks it into quarterly charges that are deducted over the projected useful life of the smelter thats called depreciation its meant to prevent quarterly chaos in earnings reports caused by giant losses when investments are made followed by soaring profits when theyre put to work youd think research spending would qualify for that treatment it produces future profits after all but companies figured out long ago that they can stuff all kinds of expenses into their research and development budgets thereby spreading out the reporting and keeping current earnings plump a new computer for example might be used for a couple of months in the lab and then be sent to the ad sales department to prevent abuse the governments accounting board today requires research investments to be treated as ordinary expenses just like money laid out for the company christmas party research shrinks earnings and leaves nothing to show for it thats good news for you anything that serves to hide the true value of a stock creates a buying opportunity for those who are in the know run the tomorrows breakthroughs screen by treating r&amp d spending as you would earnings look for recent increases in r&amp d spending and low "price to r&amp d" ratios together they tell a story about a company its share price might be beaten down the low p in p r&amp d and so management is perhaps under pressure to increase profits by cutting costs but its doing the opposite growing r&amp d either management is foolish or it has reason to be supremely confident about the profit potential of all that research the latter is more likely to be the case a georgetown university study found that when companies that already spent a significant amount on research suddenly spent more their profit margins increased faster than peers over the next five years while their shares beat the market by an average of five percentage points a year a university of illinois study found something similar for companies with low p r&amp d ratios they tended to beat the market by six percentage points a year put it all together and you have the makings of a powerful stock screen youll find r&amp d on a companys income statement and a good stock screener will let you create a growth rate and a p r&amp d ratio from that figure look for r&amp d levels that are ample to begin with equal to at least of trailing month sales and of total assets and that have increased over the past year and look for p r&amp d ratios that are below or so tighten those restrictions as you please to create a shorter list of screen survivors adapted from your next great stock how to screen the market for tomorrows top performers by
