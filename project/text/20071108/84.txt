pakistanis say no when gen pervez musharraf suspended pakistans constitution declared a state of emergency and put the nation once again under martial law he expected limited civilian resistance and only ritual international condemnation in view of his role in the war against terrorism on both counts mr musharraf appears to have badly miscalculated pakistans burgeoning civil society led by lawyers and encouraged by judges ousted from the supreme court is refusing to be cowed protests are spreading despite thousands of arrests and the use of tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators more than attorneys have been jailed but still more are taking to the streets university students have joined the lawyers and former prime minister benazir bhutto has vowed to violate a ban on public meetings by leading a rally on friday there are a number of important reasons why pakistans attorneys are leading the protests against mr musharraf they have a long tradition of activism for rule of law and human rights issues in the lawyers started the campaign that resulted in the ouster of pakistans first military ruler field marshal ayub khan they also were at the forefront of the campaign against mr zia ul haq whose year military rule ended when he died in a plane crash the legal fraternity has another advantage in that they can afford to confront the government without fearing starvation for their families some million of pakistans million people subsist on less than &# a day while another million survive just above the poverty line the poor are willing to participate in organized rallies such as the one that welcomed ms bhutto back to pakistan on oct and was targeted by a suicide terrorist but they generally avoid protest demonstrations where getting arrested and missing work is almost inevitable that could change in the days and weeks to come although mr musharraf has taken all private and international television channels off the air images of the protests are being seen all over pakistan through the internet and with satellite dishes middle class pakistanis and increasingly the poor are making it clear that they want political freedom along with an improvement in their economic prospects and do not consider prosperity and democracy to be mutually exclusive the international community has also responded more strongly than mr musharraf expected the netherlands has suspended aid and several donors are reviewing their policy on military and economic assistance the bush administration is hoping to defuse the situation through assertive diplomacy but withdrawal of aid supported by several congressional leaders remains a possibility since mr musharraf has positioned himself as the key western ally in the global war against terrorism but in recent months he has been too distracted with domestic politics to play an effective role the u s in particular does not want anti musharraf sentiment to result in a fresh wave of anti americanism in pakistan that further fuels terrorism while some in the u s argue about americas limited options in dealing with the crisis in pakistan one could argue that mr musharrafs options are even more limited the more he has to repress critics and political opponents the less pakistan will be able to fight terrorism after all when troops have to be deployed to detain supreme court judges journalists lawyers and politicians there are fewer troops available to fight terrorists pakistans intelligence services can either spy on dissenting pakistani civilians or focus their energies on finding osama bin laden and his ever increasing number of deputies and operatives around pakistan but pakistan needs to fight terrorism for pakistans sake mr musharraf cannot endlessly blackmail washington by hinting that he would withdraw antiterror cooperation if the u s pressures him on other issues including democracy and human rights violations one thing is clear mr musharrafs authoritarianism is being challenged by diverse elements in pakistani society his self cultivated image as a benign dictator is a thing of the past and his recent harsh measures have failed to frighten pakistans civil society and political opposition into submission the defiance of the judiciary and the media might not immediately topple mr musharraf but it could render him ineffective to a point where the military rethinks its options the army will soon recognize that the only thing keeping the general and his civilian cronies in power is the armys support it risks further alienating the pakistani people and losing their respect as long as it continues to act solely in the interests of mr musharraf and his small band of political allies at some point the professional soldiers will wonder whether they should risk their institutions position to keep him in power the army is mr musharrafs support base it is a major beneficiary of u s security assistance having received &# billion since with equipment worth several hundred million dollars currently in the pipeline since the u s has subsidized the pakistani army to the tune of &# million per month the army is also a stakeholder in pakistans growing economy which benefits from international aid and investment if mr musharrafs autocratic policies threaten pakistans prosperity the army is likely to be less unanimous in its support of its commander already there are signs of economic fallout from the political turmoil rumors of an anti musharraf military coup on monday caused the biggest one day decline in months on the karachi stock exchange resulting in losses of an estimated &# billion pakistans credit rating has been revised downward in anticipation of further civic unrest and international sanctions pakistanis are used to coups detat where the army takes the helm of government things are different this time in the past generals have suspended the constitution to remove from power unpopular rulers usually weakened civilians rightly or wrongly accused of corruption as was the case when mr musharraf ousted prime minister nawaz sharif in october this is the first time an unpopular military ruler has suspended the constitution to preserve his own rule in doing so mr musharraf has clearly overplayed his hand mr musharraf cannot blame a civilian predecessor for bringing the country to the brink if there is internal chaos in pakistan today it is of the generals making after all it was his arbitrary decision to remove supreme court chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry in march that initiated the political crisis which has led to the current "state of emergency " justice chaudhry on the other hand has become a symbol of resistance to arbitrary rule the man who refused to roll over and disappear unlike earlier judges who cooperated with military rulers or simply went home when their conscience dictated otherwise justice chaudhrys call upon the legal fraternity to "go to every corner of pakistan and give the message that this is the time to sacrifice" for the supremacy of pakistans constitution has drawn elements disillusioned with existing political leaders to anti musharraf protests among pakistani political leaders ms bhutto has emerged as the viable civilian alternative to mr musharraf with public support at home and acceptance abroad as the only politician in pakistan to publicly describe islamist extremism and terrorism as the principal threat to the nation ms bhutto was initially measured in her response to mr musharrafs reckless actions she demanded that he restore the constitution and call elections as scheduled she hoped to change his attitude with the threat of putting hundreds of thousands of supporters in the streets without actually doing so but mr musharrafs stubbornness is changing that position like many in the u s ms bhutto appears worried about directing attention away from fighting terrorism and destabilizing pakistan further but leaving the anti musharraf campaign leaderless is not an option she has positioned herself as an opposition leader who represents the sentiment of the people but is also willing to accept a negotiated settlement that restores the constitution ends persecution and results in free and fair elections leading to full civilian rule so far mr musharraf has shown no inclination to negotiate in good faith with ms bhutto or the international community with each passing day the bush administrations hopes that with its help there could be a transition to democracy in pakistan with a continuing role for mr musharraf are diminishing unless mr musharraf changes course quickly the u s will be compelled to start looking beyond him to a more legitimate leader mr musharraf seems determined to put his own political survival before the rule of law actions that warrant the label dictator pakistans attorneys and increasingly the rest of its citizenry seem equally determined to prevent this from happening mr haqqani is director of boston universitys center for international relations and the author of "pakistan between mosque and military" carnegie endowment for international peace he also has served as adviser to several pakistani prime ministers including ms bhutto
