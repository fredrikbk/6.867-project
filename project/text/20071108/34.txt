address violence detroit isnt just another violent city according to the cq report which analyzed statistics compiled by the fbi it is now americas most dangerous city its murder rate of per residents is well above chicago and new york it is little wonder then that mr cosby is making detroit a centerpiece of his national campaign against black crime detroit is black and according to the census

than are working some have said that detroit is in the throws of committing cultural suicide it may be more accurate to call it a cultural homicide one murder victim this year was year old lakeisha white she was eight months pregnant with a baby boy and the mother of two other children when she was gunned down brian carter just was shot and killed earlier this year while standing on a street corner another victim a year old man was walking his four year old nephew to a neighborhood pharmacy when a bullet found and killed him notwithstanding the crime city officials responded to cqs report by attacking it "the city is as safe as any other major american city " mayor kwame kilpatrick declared through a spokesman police chief ella m bully cummings whose four year tenure has coincided with a rise in homicides said cq had a "skewed methodology" that forced detroit to come out on top of nearly cities studied nationwide with populations over its true that there is a bright spot on detroits landscape a newly restored downtown with the help of nearly &# billion in public and private development funds downtown detroit has become a one square mile wonder today there are jobs to be had in the riverfront core of the city quicken loans has established its headquarters there along with jobs general motors and compuware as well as three casinos and two professional sports teams have all moved in the streets are stirring with people small shops and restaurants crime in the downtown area is down by since thanks a wayne state university study found to the "vigilance of law enforcement agencies " which along with private security guards have about people patrolling streets near the renovated squares and graffiti scrubbed buildings of course outside of downtown there are the other square miles of the city there its a different story the citys population peaked in the s after decades of multiethnic urban migration at the time crime rates were stable even in a blue collar city rife with racial tension that changed with the social welfare policies of the s detroit erupted into riot in and in the years that followed violence never abated in the murder rate stood at per residents by it had climbed to per residents and has hovered there since downtown is an island in a city with one of the lowest median incomes &# in america the citys middle class black and white has vanished downtown detroit brings in middle class workers every day but only people actually live there the workers have little reason to stay detroit public schools are the worst in the state and local politicians oppose school choice even turning down a &# million gift from education philanthropist robert thompson who in wanted to fund new charter schools the one two punch of family disintegration and middle class flight has left detroit unable to address its problems new york tackled crime in the s because voters many of them middle class elected rudy giuliani and other leaders to combat crime and reform the citys police force homicide fell to six per residents from per likewise in southfield mich a suburb of detroit middle class blacks are a majority of the population and display little tolerance for unsafe streets the murder rate there is per residents in contrast detroits city council is elected at large so neighborhoods have no direct representation and therefore little ability to force change through the ballot box the one exception is downtown where business coalitions form a powerful constituency that can affect change other neighborhoods cannot ultimately detroits future may depend on whether bill cosby is right in saying that we need to get parents fired up to detroits west is dearborn mich a city with a population thats minority arab here children many of whom are first generation immigrants who cant speak english are raised in a vibrant culture where family is paramount and education prized last year dearborns population of suffered just two
