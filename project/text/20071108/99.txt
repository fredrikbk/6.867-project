ratings proliferate for green builders standards aim to help homes stand out but buyers may not appreciate low flow toilets as much as granite countertops what makes a "green" home green it depends on who is using the word in the next several months three nationwide certifications for environmentally friendly homes will be available to builders but buyers may be confused by the array of standards this week the u s green building council a nonprofit that rates commercial buildings on things like energy use and indoor air quality introduced similar rating systems for peoples homes builders can score points for things like solar panels and energy efficient appliances and earn ratings such as silver gold or platinum for environmental friendliness the national association of homebuilders a trade group whose members build about of the countrys new homes each year say the green building councils criteria for a "green" label are too impractical and costly they are developing their own standards which they say are flexible depending on the region and include easier to achieve certification in order to appeal to first time buyers a new draft will be available for public comment next month and the standards should be finalized by february yet another eco friendly certification is available through the federal governments energy star program started in the program focuses on certifying homes that meet a standard on energy use the current yardstick is at least more efficient than homes built to the residential code homes that meet the standard usually have features such as extra insulation and energy efficient appliances and must be verified through independent home energy raters states and local building associations too may have their own green building programs or guidelines the rush to focus on green homebuilding comes as the residential real estate market continues to struggle builders are eager to jump on the green marketing bandwagon as a way to differentiate their products new home sales were a seasonally adjusted annual rate of units in september up from the previous month but down from a year earlier according to data from the national association of homebuilders some builders say many of todays consumers would rather pay extra for luxuries such as granite countertops than for "green" features but they believe that demand will grow in the future for green homes as energy prices stay high the building industry also wants to develop a voluntary green standard before the federal government increasingly focused on energy concerns takes matters into its own hands builders recently lobbied congress against legislation that would allow the federal government to write some energy efficient building codes for states environmental advocates say coaxing people to make changes to their homes that trim energy consumption is important the residential sector accounts for about of the nations greenhouse gas emissions according to government figures buying a green home while more costly up front can save money down the road with lower utility bills there are also a number of state and federal tax credits for energy efficient upgrades the federal government offers a &# tax credit for installation of energy efficient air conditioning and heating systems for example some banks even offer a discount on mortgage closing costs for new homes that meet certain energy saving requirements some builders acknowledge the various "green" labels can be confusing for consumers mark fischer a builder with grupe co in rockland calif built around solar paneled homes to meet the green building councils standards through the pilot program that has been testing out the ratings he has found however that potential buyers dont really understand the features or why they should pay more for them "with all the different green certifications out there it kind of gets lost " says mr fischer who has lowered his prices a few consumers though do seek out a "green" home to save money on utilities and help the environment after a fallen oak tree destroyed his atlanta home rutherford seydel decided to rebuild his home to the specifications of the green building councils rating system a lawyer with an interest in the environment mr seydel earned a high rating for his home a "gold " by putting in things like solar panels a geothermal heating system low flush toilets and low toxin paint he says that the rating involved extra inspections which caught air leaks around some doors and problems with the ducts that would have been missed by the contractor "that extra layer of eyes is well worth it " he says the cost of the green building councils leadership in energy and environmental design or leed is between &# and &# depending on things like how big the house is and if theres a certifier in the area generally the builder pays and passes costs on to the home buyer the cost of certification for the home builders standards hasnt been determined yet but the association says it is aiming for it to be lower so more builders will be involved both the green building council and the builders association have vied to emerge with the most widely accepted "green" label for homes the green building council says its leed rating system is "the nationally accepted benchmark" for green building builders earn points in categories such as water efficiency indoor air quality and the selection of eco friendly materials for example a home would get four points for a rainwater collection system and two points for high efficiency appliances to achieve the highest "platinum" rating a home needs between and points the councils vice president for policy and public affairs michelle moore disputes the notion that the councils process is too costly or impractical for builders she says it has rigorous verification standards with a range of third party experts who inspect homes and test materials to guard against so called greenwash where any effort that is even nominally environmentally friendly gets painted with a "green" brush "in any marketplace theres inevitably going to be people who do the minimum that they can and call themselves green " she says builders meanwhile say their verification process which will involve training certifiers through local builders associations is just as rigorous they point out their national green building standard is being certified by the american national standards institute a national standards making body and representatives from the environmental protection agency and members of the green building council itself helped develop it apart from the verification process there are other differences between the two systems the green building council program is the same for homes across the country whereas the builders standards can be flexible from region to region for example the builders are developing water efficiency requirements that are tighter in the southwest than in the northeast when building or buying a "green" home consumers should ask what types of improvements they are paying for and how much money they will save over time energy saving advocates advise that if people want energy efficient appliances they should focus first on refrigerators because unlike a dishwasher or clothes washer they run all the time air conditioning units too tend to be big energy hogs so paying for one thats more efficient is a good investment they say both the builders certification and that of the green building council penalize larger homes since they use more resources for example the green building council requires more points for four bedroom homes bigger than square feet in order to achieve a certain rating while the draft builders standard allows a home to be built to square feet before requiring more points the higher ratings such as "platinum" and "emerald" have some similar requirements from both the green building council and the builders yet the council says theirs are designed for builders at the leading edge of green innovation in terms of the lower ratings builders have pushed for a more stripped down entry level standard for inexpensive homes the "bronze" standard instead of putting in costly energy efficient appliances for example builders can earn points by protecting existing trees on a lot or using salvaged materials the group argues that some green elements are better than none at all "in our quest for perfect green we dont want to throw out the baby with the bathwater " says randall melvin a maryland builder shades of green three green ratings systems leed from the u s green building council builders score points for things like solar panels and energy efficient appliances national green building standard the national association of homebuilders is developing standards that are flexible depending on region energy star a federal government program homes must be at least more efficient than homes built to the residential code
