undoubtedly keep fine time whats more ferragamos excellence in footwear and handbags is notable the company is even credited with inventing the wedge heel in the s but does the ferragamo label make consumers want to pay &# for a watch even if it is karat gold ditto for the roberto cavalli vodka that is selling for &# a bottle these days mr cavalli who is known for his revealing womens clothes says he filters the "handmade" liquor through crushed marble and uses fine italian water but does his name induce thirst for a vodka martini probably not says andy machover a year old businessman from old brookville n y he enjoys shopping for luxury goods and wears clothing from ralph lauren zegna and missoni but "as for me wasting my money on a ferragamo watch or cavalli vodka fuhgeddaboudit " says mr machover "what would cavalli vodka taste like three season wool " we have entered into an age of luxury brand extensions gone wild luggage companies make clothes clothing makers make chocolate and practically everyone makes watches and perfume giorgio armani recently signed a deal with samsung to produce luxury lcd televisions prada makes cellphones and versace is decorating airplane and automobile interiors celebrities have leapt whole hog into brand mania sarah jessica parker jennifer lopez and mary kate &amp ashley olsen now have clothing brands its easy to understand why companies with well established brands would veer into new territory its the temptation to squeeze out more revenue "people think my name is so powerful people will buy it " says eli portnoy chief executive of the portnoy group a brand consulting group he says he spends a good deal of time talking clients down from these temptations a pizza brand recently approached the beanstalk group a licensing and branding unit of omnicom group to launch a line of fashion apparel says michael stone beanstalks president and chief executive "i thought how fast can i get out of here " he says mr stone who launched

research and produce their new product lines and that they have moved beyond being a pure jewelry brand to be sure some brand extensions do catch on bulgaris first hotel in milan is a successful hot spot when clothing designers add shoes handbags and fragrances consumers frequently follow the logic because the products come from the same fashion arena adding jewelry as chanel recently did also makes sense for a super chic clothing designer brand experts say heck paul newman made a success of salad dressing and pretzels because people trust the man and his values a ferragamo spokeswoman says the companys watches will appeal to "sophisticated consumers " who will appreciate fine details such as leather and alligator watch straps that will complement other ferragamo bags and shoes a roberto

ralph lauren boutiques are really single brand department stores selling linens candles ladles beds couches dishware photo albums skiwear jewelry all manner of tchotchkes and cashmere dog clothes but mr lauren is selling a fantasy lifestyle thats his expertise in doing so hes living the dream of many luxury companies selling a plethora of products to a demographic that reaches well into the middle classes trying to emulate mr lauren could be risky for some luxury companies and their customers mr portnoy predicts that the middle class willingness to splurge "is going to dissipate" in the current economic climate deutsche banks chief u s economist joseph lavorgna this week released a report predicting were on the verge of a marked slowdown in consumer spending and of course some shoppers may remember the late s when pierre cardin the great and original french designer licensed his name to be used on so many second rate goods that he drove it into oblivion same for halston celebrities were

such companies did years ago he says luxury companies had narrower markets then so their reputations were more vulnerable to tarnish a few companies such as giorgio armani have established themselves as purveyors of a clear lifestyle rather than a particular product line but consumers learned from the s too they know they should see connective tissue between product a and product b margaret

trading on the name and had no expertise in the product " she says when luxury goods makers forays into new products arent successful customers get stuck with luxury priced baubles that lack cachet
