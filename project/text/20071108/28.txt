cables picture gets fuzzier market leader comcasts stock is hit as phone companies make gains in the ever intensifying wars between the cable and phone companies someone is always up or always down right now it is cable that is perceived as being on the defensive and when that happens comcast corp takes a hit the largest cable operator by number of subscribers it often bears the highest expectations of the industry investors hammered comcasts stock to what had been a week low after the philadelphia based companys third quarter results showed slowdowns in its ability to add customers and shares have since gone lower the company blamed stiffer competition and softness in the economy for its disappointing growth in most subscriber categories one analyst called the results "death by a thousand cuts " "none of the numbers represented a material miss but every one had just a whiff of softness and left investors nervous about comcasts longer term growth story " said the analyst craig moffett at sanford c bernstein comcast fell or cents to &# in nasdaq stock market p m composite trading phone companies are starting to pose a serious threat to cable companies and comcast is vulnerable verizon communications inc and at&amp t inc are offering new tv services and fast internet connections with big plans to expand into markets that comcast serves comcast has publicly acknowledged that verizon already is stealing video customers worries are mounting that as competition heats up comcast has been too passive a report issued by pali research last week cites remarks from comcast chief executive brian roberts in may as evidence of "how cable got into the position it is today " mr roberts told a pali interviewer back then comcast was "not out to hurt other peoples businesses " the report says the cable industry "is now looking at an all out war " comcast executives say they arent nervous they point out that months ago they predicted they would start feeling the impact of competition with phone companies right about now "our job is to keep our heads down and continue to put good operating results on the board " said steve burke chief operating officer of comcast in an interview "if we continue to do that the stock will take care of itself " as for detractors who think the company hasnt been aggressive enough in the past he said "different times call for different strategies and we will be plenty aggressive where we need to be " comcast plans to fight back against satellite companies that were offering deep discounts earlier in the year as well as phone companies that enter cable turf and offer lower prices for bundled tv phone and internet services but executives havent detailed specific plans other than to say they would sharpen their marketing for their video and high definition offerings "we are going to start shouting that from the rooftops to the consumer perhaps more strongly than we have " mr roberts said on a third quarter earnings call with analysts while investors laud efforts to market more aggressively they also say they fear comcast could make too bold of a move with an expensive acquisition for starters theyre nervous comcast could try to buy a wireless company such as sprint nextel corp which would help the company enter a growth market comcast bought wireless spectrum last year as part of a consortium of cable companies but the company says a wireless move isnt imminent "wireless may be a great business but its not probably a great business for the fifth player into the market " says mr moffett "it makes people nervous just knowing that it the spectrum is there " and investors are perpetually worried comcast could try to buy a content company comcast made an ill fated effort to acquire walt disney co in largely to acquire disneys content for its video on demand service the move spooked investors "the market has already seen them go after a major entertainment content company and interpreted that as a repudiation of their base business " said oppenheimer &amp co analyst thomas eagan "the market wants them to stick to fundamentals " mr eagan said the company needs to roll out new services while taking care not to alienate their basic video customers comcast reported a drop in new digital video subscribers in the third quarter from the prior year total basic video subscribers fell by to million over the same period a year ago those subscribers rose by comcast says that while basic video sales may be experiencing a slowdown its other businesses have huge growth potential the cable company wants to lure customers with its phone service which it began to roll out broadly at the start of last year comcast says that for every video subscriber it has lost it has gained phone subscribers as of the end of the third quarter of the million homes offered phone service have subscribed leaving considerable room for growth phone service is profitable because it uses the companys existing network by contrast phone companies are spending billions to update their networks with fiber optics for their new tv and other services if cable can sit back and enjoy the revenue the industry will be in good shape cable companies insist they wont have to build more infrastructure to play catch up with the telecoms but if that scenario changes the picture looks darker comcast has hired roughly sales people and trained about technicians for its nascent plan to offer services to small and midsize businesses it has the potential to serve five million businesses in its footprint and estimates that next year commercial revenue will show positive signs comcast also expects growth from its broadband offering and says it is beating verizon particularly in areas where verizon has yet to deploy fios a network that uses fiber optics to deliver television faster internet services and phone mr burke says high speed internet is a growth business despite signs that new subscriptions for all the companies are slowing mr burke predicts that eventually of homes in the u s will have broadband up from the roughly half of homes that do now "that could power our business for years to come " he said
