imaxs big idea braves digital age new d movie technology highlights the competition for a long time leader when warner bros released director robert zemeckiss animated film "polar express" in anyone who wanted to see it in d had to go to an imax theater now mr zemeckiss "beowulf" for viacom inc s paramount pictures is coming out on nov but this time moviegoers can see it in d not only at the imax theaters playing the film but also at standard movie theaters that will feature it in a new "digital d " this underscores some of the difficulties facing imax corp the canadian company with a franchise in large format movies that offer stunning images exhibited on special foot high screens imax with its year head start on the competition demonstrates how ahead of the curve technologies can find themselves in danger of being leapfrogged when something new comes along in the case of d films many of the nations screens equipped with digital projectors can show those movies at a fraction of the cost of the imax system leaving the company struggling to stay on the cutting edge in an increasingly digital world imax a technology introduced in built its reputation in the s as a feature at museums and nonprofit venues and it is known for showing science and nature documentaries in both regular and d formats in recent years imax has mounted a drive to show major hollywood films and has been trying to make its system more affordable in order to allow a rollout of imax into multiplexes and broaden its market the strategy has shown some promise in and the company made a profit of more than &# million each year on revenue of more than &# million but last year imax had a loss of &# million on revenue of &# million as announced in restated financial filings tuesday the loss stemmed in part from a tax write down and expenses related to regulatory inquiries into its accounting methods one of imaxs hallmarks has been its crisp images on huge screens achieved with special large format film the company has nearly theaters in the u s and canada and an additional in other countries studios have released hollywood movies in the imax format here and there most often paying for the film to be converted and then sharing a cut of ticket proceeds with imax and the theaters but up to now most of the mainstream movies on imax had come from time warner inc s warner bros with releases including "happy feet" and " " lately imax has made inroads with other studios landing "spider man " from sony corp s sony pictures this year and "night at the museum" from news corp s fox last year richard gelfond imaxs co chief executive says imax doesnt compete with standard theaters because a typical imax visitor has already seen the movie in a regular moviehouse or doesnt go to standard movies at all "the imax audience is almost completely incremental " he says "we are not moving people from theater box to theater box " he says the immersive experience imax offers is far superior to anything available in other theaters even those that use d but now film studios are helping finance the rollout of the digital projectors some believe are becoming imaxs competition making them essentially free for theater owners in contrast if a theater wants to install an imax system it ends up paying around &# for its part imax pays for equipment totaling about &# million imax is taking a number of steps aimed at holding onto its franchise next year it will begin rolling out its own digital technology which like the new digital systems for showing regular movies will make it easier and cheaper to tinker with movie schedules using digital files instead of clunky film reels which in the case of imax weigh pounds each imax theaters can quickly add another movie to play on an imax screen digital technology will dramatically lower the cost of individual movie "prints" for both imax and standard movies now it costs studios around &# to make a single print of an imax movie or &# for a regular film this means hollywood movies must play on imax screens for at least six to seven weeks to recoup the print costs and other fees with a lower cost for prints imax says its theaters which generally run only one big studio title at a time could show hollywood films a year instead of six or seven imax says offering more variety will bring imax fans back to theaters more often giving ticket sales a shot in the arm the company gets a cut of the ticket sales even if it doesnt own or operate the imax theater where the movie runs on the production side the company has taken steps to improve the technology for filming scenes directly onto imax rather than converting them after a movie is made the conventional way shooting in imax yields impressive results but requires cameras that weigh an average of pounds they make so much noise that dialogue and sound must be recorded separately now the company is starting to offer cameras that weigh less than pounds director christopher nolan is using them to shoot certain scenes for the warner bros batman movie "the dark knight " imax is also making it cheaper to convert a movie theater into an imax theater which involves adding special screens and seating as well as projection equipment it expects the cost to a theater to drop to about &# after the digital projection system rolls out the company says converting a theater to non imax digital projection costs about &# however some in the industry arent enthused about imax general electric co s universal pictures hasnt released titles on the imax format in several years its "apollo " imax release was "emotionally gratifying and financially disappointing " says producer michael rosenberg moreover while many of the companys traditional museum based theaters are running hollywood blockbusters a large number see it as out of step with their educational missions "its a bit of a slippery slope to go down that way " says joe deamicis vice president of marketing for the california science center near los angeles which sticks to offerings like "deep sea d " traditional imax filmmakers feel let down too "weve got a degradation of the brand in my view and thats really affected the power of the imax medium " says soames summerhays a filmmaker who has made several imax movies including "ocean oasis " as he sees it museum imax screens showing blockbusters cut into revenue that could go to independent filmmakers who make imax documentaries "our films traditional imax films are compromised " he says
