why coal is to get additional attention the international energy agency painted a tough energy outlook for coming years with tightening oil supplies and a surge in global warming emissions as china and india burn more coal to power their booming economies the industrialized worlds energy watchdog also predicted fast growing china will displace the u s as both the worlds biggest polluter this year and the largest energy consumer by based on current trends the paris group in its annual forecast said a number of factors including the cost of oil will contribute to a boom in coal aging and less productive oil fields and resistance among major oil exporters to build spare oil capacity will make crude oil and natural gas more expensive and prompt developing countries to turn increasingly to the worlds dirtiest fossil fuel the ieas annual world energy outlook also details a continued surge in oil demand that could result in a serious supply crunch around the agency portrays a world that by will be consuming more energy than it is now with almost half of the growth because of soaring demand in china and india while oil will remain the worlds largest source of energy in terms of metric tons of oil equivalent at coals share is expected to jump to up from now contributing to a increase in carbon emissions barring unforeseen changes in government policy to reduce oil consumption the iea predicts world wide oil demand will hit million barrels a day by up from about million barrels a day now electricity use will nearly double with most of the globes new plants burning coal for most economies the tough question is on the supply side the iea foresees a boost in production from new fields in the middle east particularly saudi arabia but warns that "it is very uncertain" whether these new sources "will be sufficient to compensate for the decline in output at existing fields" in the middle east and among other producers such as russia mexico and venezuela the resulting pinch in supply could result in "an abrupt escalation in oil prices" around an event the agency said "cannot be ruled out " the jump in oil prices to nearly &# a barrel from about &# in early january has invigorated debate over whether oil prices will go far higher in coming years or will taper off from a level that some critics insist is largely driven by speculation yesterday oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange fell cents or to &# the iea says consumers and governments globally are doing too little to improve energy supply security and to cut pollution even under the most optimistic assumptions global carbon emissions the main culprit blamed for global warming will be higher in from todays levels "the pathway were on is not sustainable " either for the health of the environment or for securing stable energy supplies in the future iea executive director nobuo tanaka told journalists in london "time is running out " china and india are setting the tone of global energy markets with the size of their populations each over one billion and double digit economic growth rates the iea predicts that the two countries combined will import more oil in than japan and the u s do today china and india will account for of the growth in coal consumption over the next two decades with china tapping domestic supplies but india having to import more of what it needs while the iea focused its most recent outlook on china and india it also forecast demand growth in the middle east oil use there is expected to hit million barrels a day by more than twice the predicted demand in india renewable energy sources such as solar will grow in use in certain areas like the united kingdom but the current logistical challenges and costs of using and developing them mean all renewable energy sources will remain a fraction of total energy use globally in at about unchanged from today
