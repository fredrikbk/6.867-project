tax and offend voters on tuesday faced a grab bag of local issues and responded with mixed messages for both national parties perhaps the one clear lesson is that voters remain as skeptical of government schemes as ever in washington state &# billion in transportation spending backed by tax increases to pay for them went down to apparent defeat in a referendum by what looked like a point margin as we went to press voters in that blue state also affirmed an initiative to strengthen the states supermajority requirement for raising taxes while rejecting a measure that would have made it easier to raise school taxes across the country in north carolina county level referendums on imposing a real estate transfer taxes lost everywhere and in indianapolis republican greg ballard defeated the incumbent mayor in a major upset one of his best issues was opposition to rising property taxes even in bluer than blue new jersey voters rejected a plan to borrow &# million over years to fund stem cell research with a &# billion deficit &# billion in state debt and some of the highest property taxes in the universe residents seemed to feel that more borrowing was merely feeding the spending addicts in trenton voters also rejected a plan that would have "dedicated" revenue from a recent sales tax increase to property tax relief this probably reflects good common sense with spending out of control shifting revenue doesnt address the underlying problem at the same time new jersey overwhelmingly voted democrats back in control of the legislature which reflects the states hapless republican party and speaking of hapless virginia republicans lost control of the senate for the first time in years and were all but wiped out in northern virginias fairfax county virginia republicans have lost their way by embracing the tax and spending agendas of successive democratic governors and the result has been more and more democrats in office perhaps they should try to stand for something other than bashing immigrants the gop also lost big in kentucky where voters showed scandal tarred governor ernie fletcher the door mr fletcher made the mistake of pardoning aides implicated in a personnel kerfuffle at the beginning of his term the scandal was largely a case of criminalizing politics from the start but what smacked of abuse of power in response did not sit well with voters in this year of public discontent further south republicans cleaned up in mississippi continuing a decade long trend away from one party democratic rule haley barbour was re elected as governor and all but one statewide office went to the republicans gop success in mississippi reflects voter approval of doing what republicans do best fiscal conservatism and a major tort reform combined with a sense that the barbour administration handled the fallout from katrina with competence and efficiency taken together these results paint a picture of voters wary of politicians looking for new pots of money to spend democrats running next year on a platform of taking more from taxpayers please take note republicans in congress have damaged their credibility on fiscal responsibility but voters are not in a trusting mood when it comes to government spending regardless of which party wields the purse strings perhaps the biggest disappointment came in utah where voters resoundingly voted down a statewide school vouchers plan passed by the legislature and signed by the governor this reflected a huge misinformation campaign by national teachers unions about the effect on public education but governor jon huntsman who campaigned for office as a supporter of vouchers deserves some of the blame for having bowed out of the referendum debate early on business was lukewarm as well voucher proponents are going to have to rethink their political strategy because suburban voters still seem to believe that their own public schools are fine even if everyone elses are rotten overall voters seemed to enter the voting booth in a skeptical mood tuesday if that attitude extends toward the many gauzy promises that presidential candidates will be offering next year so much the better
