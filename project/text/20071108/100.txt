saving civilization from itself churchill and the jews by martin gilbert henry holt pages &# why should we anglo saxons apologize for being superior " winston churchill once growled in exasperation "we are superior " certainly churchills views of what he and other late victorians called the "lesser races " such as blacks and east indians are very different from ours today one might easily assume that a self described reactionary like churchill holding such views shared the anti semitism prevalent among europes ruling elites before the holocaust but he did not as martin gilbert vividly shows in "churchill and the jews " by chronicling churchills warm dealings with english and european jews throughout his long career and his heartfelt support of zionism mr gilbert conveys churchills deep admiration for the jewish people and captures his crucial role in creating the state of israel churchill offers the powerful example of a western statesman who unlike other statesmen in his own time and ours understood the malignant nature of anti semitism and did what he could to oppose its toxic effects his father lord randolph churchill had been a close friend and ally to many wealthy british jews almost notoriously so given the rancid snobbery of his circles the son rarely failed to follow his fathers inclinations in this matter as in others jews like the rothschilds and the banker sir ernest cassel helped to advance winston churchills early career including watching over his finances after his fathers death and he repaid their support in part by publicly condemning the kind of anti semitism that was all too common in englands upper classes but his actions were not merely an expression of personal thanks a student of history churchill came to feel that judaism was the bedrock of traditional western moral and political principles and churchill was of a generation that preferred to talk about principles instead of "values " for europeans to turn against the jew he argued was for them to strike at their own roots and reject an essential part of their civilization "that corporate strength that personal and special driving power" that jews had brought for hundreds of years to europes arts sciences and institutions to deny jews a national homeland was therefore an act of ingratitude churchill became a keen backer of the balfour declaration of which broached the idea of creating a jewish homeland in palestine as a friend to zionist leader chaim weizman and as colonial secretary after world war i churchill made establishing such a homeland a matter of urgency "the hope of your race for so many centuries will be gradually realized here " churchill told a jewish audience in jerusalem during his visit in march "not only for your own good but for the good of all the world " by "all the world" churchill most pointedly meant to include palestines arabs as mr gilbert recounts churchill was dismayed and disgusted by arab resistance to jewish immigration and settlement in palestine "the jews have a far more difficult task than you " he told arab representatives since "you only have to enjoy your own possessions " while the jewish emigrants from europe and elsewhere would have to carve a society out of a barren wilderness yet churchill was convinced that arab civilization would benefit from contact with an entrepreneurial and morally centered people "speaking entirely as a non jew " he wrote "i look on the jews as the natural importers of western leaven so necessary for countries in the near east " at the same time churchill tried to ensure that palestinian arabs got their own national homeland it was churchill who as colonial secretary decided to separate transjordan modern day jordan from the rest of palestine assuming that transjordan would become the site of the arabs future state and that other parts of palestine including the west bank of the jordan river would be open to jewish settlement churchill was to be disappointed by the results of his middle eastern efforts as arabs hunted down and murdered jewish settlers by the hundreds in the s and s just at the time when adolf hitler was building his own regime around the persecution of the jews in germany as early as churchill realized that the nazis anti jewish policies carried the stench of an ancient evil "tell your boss from me " he said to a hitler acquaintance in the late summer of as the nazi party was on the verge of power "that anti semitism may be a good starter but it is a bad finisher " in december churchill now prime minister learned from a roman catholic member of the polish resistance a man named jan karsky that thousands of jews were being rounded up and sent by cattle cars to what turned out to be the death camp at belzec in eastern poland churchill used the karsky report to compel the allies including the russians to condemn "a bestial policy of cold blooded extermination" in germany although he understood that the best way to halt the slaughter would be the speedy destruction of hitlers empire the chief of britains air staff sir charles portal warned that any air raids "avowedly conducted on account of the jews would be an asset to enemy propaganda " and churchill reluctantly bowed to his advice nonetheless in he wanted a film that documented the atrocities committed against the jews to be shown to every american serviceman before the invasion of europe after the war churchill felt that the most fitting response to the holocaust would be to punish those guilty of the most horrific crimes against the jews and to fulfill the promise of a jewish homeland that he and britain had made almost years earlier when ernest bevin britains labour party foreign minister hesitated to recognize israel nine months after its founding for fear of inflaming arab opinion churchill swung back hard "whether the right honorable gentleman likes it or not the coming into being of a jewish state in palestine is an event in world history to be viewed in the perspective not of a generation or a century but in the perspective of a thousand two thousand or even three thousand years " israel was just recompense churchill felt not only for what the jews of europe had lost but for what they had given to civilization over the centuries this view of course no longer prevails today the existence of israel is apparently something to be regretted even deplored not only in arab capitals but in european ones and on american university campuses paradoxically such feelings intensified after an event that should have made us all aware of who the friends of western civilization really are and who its enemies martin gilberts book reminds us that anti semitism is the dark turn of the modern mind against itself and a form of cultural patricide mr hermans "gandhi &amp churchill" will be published by bantam in april see related letter "letters to the editor churchill might have saved more jews" wsj nov
