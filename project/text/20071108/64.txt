investing in america making things worse your editorial asserts that the number of foreign workers on h b visas is so minimal that we shouldnt care if americans are in fact displaced i challenge the journal to wave their labor force figures in the face of one of the hi tech workers who have had to train their own replacement who is an h b visa holder thats a smack in the face to the american worker and hardly an issue to take lightly i am committed to an effort to include additional h b reforms and increase the visa supply along with an increased investment to educate americans but i strongly disagree that the only solution is to increase our reliance on foreign workers by raising the annual cap reforms to the program must be a top priority big business cannot continue to ignore the home grown american talent who should be getting at least a good portion of these jobs sen chuck grassley r iowa washington see related letter "letters to the editor grassley is off the mark" wsj november
