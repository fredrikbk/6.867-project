politics &amp economics putins next role father of nation kremlin inspired film floats idea of making president modern day czar moscow the kremlin has dusted off the events of four centuries ago to help cast vladimir putin as a "father of the nation" who will remain influential after his presidential term ends next year a kremlin inspired blockbuster film titled " " now hitting theaters around the country sets the tone for the campaign produced by a personal friend of mr putin it focuses on a popular uprising in that drove a polish lithuanian army from moscow the dark period in russias history known as the time of troubles ended when a special national congress chose mikhail romanov as czar ushering in the beginning of what became the russian empire "im convinced and i have nothing against democracy that russians have a strong desire for a czar " said the films director vladimir khotinenko who is open about the states role in the film and has urged audiences to draw the appropriate lessons "i consider the th century an extremely important period in our history and now those times are really relevant " like mikhail romanov mr putin has stood up to foreign powers and rescued russia from a period of national turmoil in this case the s his supporters say after almost eight years in power mr putin has vowed to abide by russias constitution and step down when his presidential term expires in may but with polls showing that a majority of russians want him to stay on aides and supporters are floating ideas that would allow him to remain a compass for russian political life in the years to come perpetuating his political platform now being promoted around the country as "putins plan " in recent weeks top officials have made almost daily announcements saying mr putin will somehow remain a "national leader" who will guide the government even if he has no formal post there that would parallel the role of the late chinese leader deng xiaoping a senior ideologue in the united russia party has gone even further in an article posted on the partys web site this week abdul khakim sultygov proposed borrowing an archaic th century legal mechanism to codify mr putins future role as a latter day czar after parliamentary and presidential elections which he described as effectively referendums on mr putins rule he suggests that russia call a special national congress that would anoint mr putin as the "father of the nation " in that role mr putin would serve as the supreme representative of the people a check on the government to make sure it fulfilled his plan it is a formula that would appear to imitate the convention used to elect mikhail romanov as czar in mr sultygov said mr putins role would ensure his policies are continued for years to come mr sultygov wasnt available for comment but an aide said his ideas were "consistent" with the partys line analysts say mr sultygovs proposal is likely a trial balloon and is a reflection of the prevailing anxiety over mr putins imminent departure the kremlin they say will find other methods to cement mr putins "father of the nation" role without resorting to distant historical traditions "he will remain a national leader but there will be nothing extraconstitutional about it " said sergei markov a political consultant and member of united russia mr putins spokesman dmitry peskov said mr sultygovs initiative was a legitimate political suggestion but denied it originated in the kremlin other ideas to keep mr putin influential have included making him prime minister heading up the united russia party or making him head of the national energy colossus oao gazprom mr putin has kept his precise plans a secret the film harks back to russias so called time of troubles when what was then known as the kingdom of muscovy was beset by hunger foreign intervention and an anarchic power struggle mikhail romanovs rescue of the country embodies a clutch of current kremlin ideas namely the need for strong leadership and patriotism to confront treacherous foreign intervention while mr putins aides wince at suggestions that he is set to become a modern day czar polls give him an approval rating of around his popularity has been boosted by economic growth as well as fawning state media coverage and a political climate where opposition parties have been almost completely squeezed out the film "is similar to the story of putin coming to power and the message is that he came and fixed the troubles " said nikolai petrov an analyst at the moscow carnegie center mr peskov the kremlin spokesman confirmed mr putin would play an important role in public life after he steps down but said it was "quite obvious" that mr putin had already become a national leader and questioned the need to codify that "its a question of whether the role can be formalized " he said "in accordance with the legislative and constitutional system there isnt a position called father of the nation "
