judges vs jihadis advocates of a "law enforcement" approach to fighting transnational terror claimed vindication last week when of accused terrorists were convicted in madrid prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero described the oct verdicts as "justice" and urged spain to "look to the future " it is of course the future that is at issue spain has every right to celebrate the capture trial and conviction of these individuals either implicated in helping to organize the march train bombings in madrid that killed people or otherwise associated with terrorism yet there is little reason to believe that the verdicts will have any measurable deterrent effect on jihadists who remain determined to strike at the wests civilian populations whenever opportunity allows prevention remains key to defeating this threat here the justice system will be of limited utility because whether organized under the civil law like spain and most of europe or the common law like the u s it is not designed to anticipate and stop criminal behavior before it takes place at least since the enlightenment western judicial institutions have focused on dealing with societys deviants rather than on meeting the threat of foreign attack and have sought to prevent criminal behavior by inculcating a dread in the form of an individuals respect for rather than terror of the law as the great italian legal scholar and reformer beccaria wrote in the s to prevent crime "make sure that men fear the laws and only the laws " where respect fails of course there also is fear of punishment under the law deterrence the system breaks down however when the criminals neither have respect for the law nor fear its potential punishments this is exactly the situation in which the west now finds itself the followers of violent jihad do not respect the laws of democratic governments but claim a superior legitimacy in the form of their own interpretation of islams quran and shariah law many of them also do not fear punishment if proof of this were needed it can be found both in the very nature of al qaedas sept attacks on the u s by suicidal operatives and the self immolation of the seven ringleaders who masterminded the attacks on madrid when spanish police closed in on their safe house outside that city these men blew up the house and themselves to be sure since a number of european countries some experienced in fighting home grown terror movements such as the ira in britain and the eta in spain have made their judicial systems more capable of meeting the challenge britain denmark france germany italy the netherlands and spain have all adopted new or expanded counterterrorism legislation theyve all taken one or more of the following actions establishing or broadening the offense of terrorism to include membership in a terrorist organization approving sometimes long pretrial detention for terror suspects banning organizations with terrorist connections and legalizing the use of deportation and expulsion of suspected terrorist suspects in some cases however although europe has had some notable successes in preventing terror plots largely through the use of national intelligence agencies the record of convictions has been less promising as the u s state department diplomatically concluded in its "country reports on terrorism" with respect to germany "german laws and traditional procedures as well as the courts longstanding and expansive view of civil liberties sometimes limited the success of cases prosecutors brought to trial " even the successful spanish prosecutions did not include one of the individuals now jailed on terror charges in italy believed by the government to have orchestrated the madrid attacks rabei osman an egyptian was acquitted many march victims were not satisfied with the outcome this ultimately is the problem the criminal justice system is not infinitely elastic it can be changed only so much before it becomes unrecognizable although the civil law system is marginally better suited than the common law system for antiterror prosecutions permitting more closed proceedings and less technically demanding evidentiary standards both are built upon the assumption that it is better to let the guilty go free than to convict the innocent that is an appropriate balance when a society is dealing with its own reprobates it is not so obviously correct when the threat is a foreign movement whose purpose is to cause death and destruction on a grand scale if further proof were needed of the judicial systems inability to bear the primary burden of meeting and defeating transnational terror it could be found in the scenes last wednesday in madrid when the judges decisions were handed down the courthouse was surrounded by security forces including helicopters buzzing protectively around the building courts do not make good fortresses its likely that these very limitations at least in part prompted the bush administration to eschew a policing response to the attacks and to declare a war against terror the result has been one of the sharpest trans atlantic divisions in postwar history a division that probably will not end anytime soon regardless of whether the next american president is a democrat or republican he or she is likely to continue the war on terror in practice if not in rhetoric only the law of armed conflict permits the flexibility needed to disrupt al qaedas operations on an international level had the bush administration followed a law enforcement path and sought the judicial assistance of afghanistans taliban osama bin laden would still be secure in his bases and training facilities far more capable of planning and executing future attacks al qaeda and its allies believe that they are at war with the west and have acted on that belief even with the best intentions the west cannot prevail by ignoring this stark and unbending fact messrs rivkin and casey served in the justice department under presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush and were members of the u n sub commission on the promotion and protection of human rights from
