u s eu think smaller on trade political sensitivities diminish prospects of large scale deal brussels u s and european officials who meet for talks today on how to cut barriers to trans atlantic trade say they have given up dreaming of a sweeping deal that would unlock billions of dollars in new trade instead the two sides say they are taking a piecemeal approach to one of the biggest headaches faced by businesses on both sides of the pond regulatory differences that cost them revenue and time the more modest approach is a result of the political sensitivities that limit european union u s cooperation on issues such as product safety the environment and agriculture but it is also a sign of a new determination to make progress on setting standards that could serve as models world wide and help curb substandard competition from china officials and analysts say "we need to make sure we work together to compete better with asia " c boyden gray the u s ambassador to the eu told reporters tuesday ahead of the talks eu and u s negotiators say they hope to reach deals on rules that limit trade in chicken and cosmetics in two days of talks starting today in washington industry lobbyists say those deals would be welcome though they wont deliver the major boost to trans atlantic trade sought by previous initiatives the u s and the eu already have by far the worlds richest trading relationship valued at &# billion in goods in but it has grown slowly during the trade boom of the past decade from european rules restricting imports of genetically modified seeds made by u s companies such as monsanto co and dupont co to the imposition of separate accounting standards on each side of the atlantic regulatory barriers remain a major obstacle to trade growth officials and trade analysts say in the past years politicians have made a series of high profile efforts to create a trans atlantic free trade area to fix that but were unsuccessful in part because of a lack of political backing in their home countries but the rise of emerging economies like china india and brazil has added allure to the idea "this time around there is a realization that we can only succeed by focusing on specific areas " gunter verheugen a german eu vice president said tuesday he is co chairman of the talks with allan hubbard director of the national economic council and an adviser to mr bush on economic policy one item where the two sides appear close to agreement is on the need to recognize each others accounting standards european companies with u s listings must reconcile their accounting from international standards to u s rules that is often an expensive exercise the securities and exchange commission is considering a proposal that would drop the reconciliation requirement for companies following international accounting standards also on the agenda are eu rules that as of march are due to ban new cosmetics tested on animals u s companies exported &# billion of cosmetics to the eu in not all of those exports would be affected but u s companies are behind in developing tests that dont use animals and u s officials want a temporary exemption another eu regulation governing the use of chemicals in products takes effect next june the rule forces companies to register chemicals with the eu for approval most eu manufacturers have done that but not american ones again the u s wants a waiver period david reilly contributed to this article
