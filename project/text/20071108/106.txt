after moodys investors service said the funds were liquidating assets to meet financial commitments the rescue plan led by citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co is aimed at providing cash to the funds known as structured investment vehicles or sivs the plan is aimed at avoiding a forced fire sale of the sivs assets in its report moodys said it had cut or might cut ratings of the debt issued by the funds moodys said certain sivs owned assets with deteriorating values some sivs now could hit financial triggers that would speed up asset sales such sales could drag down the prices further including those of securities to u s mortgages when prices already are low moodys in its report said it now assumes sivs would be liquidating assets at distressed prices to pay off financial commitments given the problems sivs face in issuing new debt or refinancing maturing debt the breakdown of sivs is one of a number of concerns paralyzing global credit markets since this summer in a separate report yesterday citigroup said the worlds biggest banks could face write downs totaling &# billion because of exposure of securities tied to subprime loans the moodys moves yesterday will put more pressure on the banks behind the plan first announced last month to form a supersize fund to buy some assets from the sivs without the fund in place to purchase assets from the sivs they will be more likely to begin selling off assets at whatever prices they can get to raise money for payments they need to meet to investors who have purchased their commercial paper "they are going to have to sell at some point " said douglas long an executive vice president at london based principia partners which provides technology support for structured product managers "its not looking pretty " yesterday moodys downgraded or said might downgrade debt issued by sivs the ratings agency cited the deteriorating value of the assets in the sivs which hold &# billion worth of debt securities the siv market is made up of about funds that own some &# billion in assets investors stopped buying debt issued by sivs earlier this year they worried that the sivs could hold assets linked to subprime mortgages and thus could have trouble repaying debt moodys said it wasnt taking the ratings actions because of the quality of the assets in the sivs instead moodys said the sivs problems stemmed from the drop in the market value of the assets the sivs own as investors shun those investments amid the credit crunch the sivs have been the focus of attention because citigroup sponsors seven sivs moodys said it had put the bottom tier of notes issued by several citigroup sivs on review for possible downgrade citigroup for the first time disclosed details about the sivs it sponsors in third quarter financial statements filed earlier this week with the securities and exchange commission the bank said that as of sept the sivs it was affiliated with had &# billion in assets following the sale of &# billion in assets since july the three sivs whose capital notes were placed yesterday on review for possible downgrade by moodys have a combined &# billion in assets of the seven sivs or nearly &# billion in assets are invested in u s mortgage backed securities however the bank added that "the sivs have no direct exposure to u s subprime assets and have approximately &# million of indirect exposure" through investments in collateralized debt obligations a citigroup spokesman declined comment credit spreads widen investment grade corporate debt including that sold
