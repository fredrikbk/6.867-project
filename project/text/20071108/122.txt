business day sign up for the e mail here president bushs appeal for a return to constitutional rule in pakistan is shaping up as a test for how much global influence his administration still wields in the post iraqi invasion post post era the state of emergency proclaimed by army chief and president pervez musharraf has overshadowed two significant visits to washington this week by foreign leaders nicolas sarkozy of france and earlier turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan whose policies at the iraqi border could prove just as consequential as events in pakistan messrs bush and sarkozys discussions yesterday ran the gamut of global hot spots the middle east myanmar darfur iran the president said but the first question asked by reporters was about pakistan "i spoke to president musharraf right before i came over here to visit with president sarkozy and my message was that we believe strongly in elections and that you ought to have elections soon and you need to take off your uniform you cant be the president and the head of the military at the same time " mr bush answered in his strongest comments yet since the pakistani constitution was suspended on saturday pakistans foreign ministry the agence france presse reports offered somewhat of a different version of the conversation "president bush praised president pervez musharrafs leadership and pakistans critical role in fighting terrorism and extremism which posed a grave challenge not only to pakistan but the world " the ministry said and while it acknowledged mr bushs mention of "concerns over return to civilian democratic rule " the ministry said the u s leader "showed understanding when the president informed him about the difficult circumstances that led to the proclamation of emergency in the country " the new york times reports that u s military attaches have reached out to senior pakistani generals to support mr bushs efforts while gen musharraf according to the wall street journal has called the chairmen of the house and senate foreign relations committees to explain his action the many critics of his moves however have called gen musharrafs terror justifications a pretext for seizing power "in pakistan today there are almost people who have been arrested since saturday i challenge president musharraf to show me one terrorist amongst them " hina jilani a pakistani lawyer and vice chair of the nonprofit human rights commission tells the newshour with jim lehrer "he has placed judges of the superior judiciary under house arrest he has placed human rights activists under house arrest and put them behind bars he has beaten lawyers on the streets and filled up the prisons of pakistan with hundreds of lawyers " speaking on the same program the pakistani ambassador to the u s mahmud ali durrani said "i disagree with her sixty one terrorists who were taken by the government they were freed by the supreme court and what happened was some of them are back on the street " thus he suggested the move against the justices was needed mr durrani himself a former general also said the state of emergency would be lifted soon and that gen musharraf would soon drop his military role this afternoon in pakistan state television quoted gen musharraf as saying the elections originally scheduled for january would simply be postponed to february mr durrani said restoration of democracy would come with a new set of judges on pakistans highest court that could allow gen musharraf whose democratic pledges have gone unfulfilled before stay in power without the state of emergency since the supreme court must still rule on the legitimacy of his re election the u s is also backing benazir bhutto the most prominent non islamist opposition leader and whose thousands of rank and file supporters havent played a big role so far in the anti musharraf demonstrations as the washington post notes a spokesman for ms bhutto today said that police arrested at least of her supporters ahead of the rally she has planned for tomorrow in defiance of a government ban but the government denied it had made such arrests and said no crackdown was ordered a relatively peaceful and at least nominally democratic resolution of the standoff in pakistan would be a shot in the arm for the white house which has had little success lately in soothing geopolitical turmoil turkish government officials said yesterday that military operations in northern iraq will continue despite mr bushs promise to help keep a lid on kurish rebels who find sanctuary there an administration push for a middle east peace conference this fall has some israeli and palestinian backing but little evolution on the issues that have prevented progress before mr bushs repeated calls for change benefiting darfuris and burmese have gone unheeded by the governments of sudan and myanmar gen musharraf and mr bush have been tight allies since and the administration has a lot riding on what that relationship can accomplish beyond the other issues at stake u s intelligence officials tell the los angeles times that american "spy agencies have stepped up their scrutiny of pakistans nuclear weapons program and directed analysts to reexamine the risk that rising instability could lead to the loss of a nuclear device or material " fear in the markets most stock markets across asia and to a lesser extent in europe today suffered fallout from yesterdays crash on wall street more bad news about the credit crunch prompted by mortgage problems compounding fears about soaring oil prices and the plummeting value of the dollar led to a drop of points or in the dow jones industrial average as the wall street journal reports the journal notes that "a rescue plan for investment funds that are one source of credit market concern is under new pressure after moodys investors service said the funds were liquidating assets to meet financial commitments " and the paper points out that "instead of weakening the subprime storm that has pummeled wall street got worse " with both american international group and morgan stanley reporting big mortgage related losses moreover the journal adds "investors are fast losing confidence that bond insurers who provide a financial anchor for roughly a trillion dollars in debt will weather the credit market storm " and on top of the mortgage mess according to the financial times "wall street analysts are rapidly losing faith in u s companies ability to rekindle profit growth before the end of the year raising the prospect of the first earnings recession two consecutive quarters of falling profits in more than five years " sale of ford units could bring no profit while ford last week received offers for jaguar and land rover from at least six potential buyers including auto makers and private equity groups the pension deficits of the units mean their u s parent "is likely to have to pay any buyer to take the british luxury car brands off its hands " people close to the situation tell the financial times with those deficits topping &# billion a bit less than the asking price and ford expected to keep a significant minority stake the value of any sale "would be more than swallowed up by the pension shortfall " the ft says robertson likes giuliani rubin likes clinton if pat robertson were a man given to explaining his actions he might have some explaining to do the fundamentalist christian broadcaster and onetime republican presidential candidate who once suggested the attacks were a punishment for american tolerance of homosexuality yesterday endorsed rudy giuliani a current republican candidate who as the new york times notes is a twice divorced supporter of gay and abortion rights asked about the endorsement at his own news conference fellow candidate and abortion opponent john mccain said "every once in a while i am left speechless this is one of those times " the wall street journal calls the endorsement "the latest evidence that evangelical christians are as split as the rest of the republican voters " and cites a new wall street journal nbc poll showing "that white voters who identified themselves as evangelicals are divided evenly" among mr giuliani sen mccain and former sen fred thompson the same poll shows americans have reservations about democratic frontrunner hillary clinton it shows a majority turning away from president bush and favoring a democrat to succeed him "but offsetting that demand for change in the presidential contest are reservations about sen clintons truthfulness and ideology even as americans applaud her experience and leadership qualities " the journal says "the result she is in a virtual dead heat with leading republican candidate rudy giuliani when the two are matched up " sen clinton too could get a key endorsement today though people close to the candidate and robert rubin clinton administration treasury secretary and now the chairman of citigroup tell the new york times that he has overcome early misgivings about senator hillary rodham clintons presidential candidacy and will support her publicly in the fight for the democratic nomination " how blackwater operated the killing of three guards at the state funded iraqi media network by a sniper employed by blackwater last february "shows how american officials responsible for overseeing the security company conducted only a cursory investigation when blackwater guards opened fire " the washington post reports from the roof of the iraqi justice ministry across an open traffic circle the sniper shot the first guard who was years old and standing on a balcony "another guard rushed to his colleagues side and was fatally shot in the neck a third guard was found dead more than an hour later on the same balcony " the post reports "eight people who responded to the shootings including media network and justice ministry guards and an iraqi army commander and five network officials in the compound said none of the slain guards had fired on the justice ministry where a u s diplomat was in a meeting " and iraqi police called it "an act of terrorism" and caused by blackwater but based on information from blackwater guards and without sending embassy officials to the networks building near the green zone in baghdad the u s government judged the snipers actions "fell within approved rules governing the use of force " an official from the departments bureau of diplomatic security tells the post neither u s officials nor blackwater offered compensation or apologies to the victims families relatives of the guards and officials of the network tell the paper "its really surprising that blackwater is still out there killing people " network deputy director mohammed jasim says "this company came to iraq and was supposed to provide security they didnt learn from their mistakes they continued and continued they continued killing " meanwhile iraqs interior minister said yesterday " he would authorize raids by his security forces on western security firms to ensure that they were complying with tightened licensing requirements on guns and other weaponry setting up the possibility of violent confrontations between the iraqis and heavily armed western guards " the new york times reports also of note new york times more than veterans of the iraq and afghanistan wars
