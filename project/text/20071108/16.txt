as china soars an etf anti bubble if you think the chinese stock market is overvalued profunds group is with you today the bethesda md fund manager will introduce an "ultrashort" china exchange traded fund an investment designed to rise in value when chinese stocks fall making it easier for investors to place bearish bets the appearance of the fund called proshares ultrashort ftse xinhua china etf means fund marketers think u s investors might be ready to turn against what has been a red hot investment this year as if to underline the point profunds which specializes in funds that offer magnified and inverse returns relative to well known stock benchmarks doesnt plan a bullish china etf just one that goes "short " betting against chinese stocks profunds has also followed that strategy with some broader international offerings and will add a bearish japan fund too chief executive michael sapir says he has high hopes the china fund will catch on as a tool for "bubble popping " a reference to the recent run up in chinese stocks which he compares to the extraordinary run up in u s stocks in the ishares ftse xinhua china index fund which follows the same hong kong traded stocks that the profunds etf will bet against is up so far this year according to morningstar inc the funds annual returns have averaged over the past three years mr sapir sees signs u s investors may be getting wary despite the impressive returns investors have yanked about &# million from three china etfs tracked by amg data services so far this year through the end of october that goes against the grain investors have poured &# billion into international stock etfs as a group in the funds now hold about &# billion according to amg not everyone thinks betting against china is an easy call "there may be a bubble but its not like the s where these companies have no earnings " says zachary karabell co manager of alger china u s growth fund while stock prices may have temporarily outstripped profits of chinese companies earnings are still increasing at a hefty rate reflecting growth in the chinese economy he says investors that try to predict the short term direction of chinese stock prices could get burned if prices as they did in february fall then quickly snap back the new profunds etf which wont just bet against the chinese stock market but also magnify those returns could pose an extra risk the aim of the fund will be to rise on a day when the index of chinese stocks it follows falls meaning the returns will reflect both the reverse of the indexs returns and the effect of financial leverage as if the investor had borrowed money to double down exchange traded funds resemble index oriented mutual funds and trade on an exchange like a stock because u s etfs trade when stock markets in china and other parts of asia are closed etfs intraday prices usually reflect u s traders views of how those stocks will perform when markets reopen trading glitch in
