mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q do i need antivirus or antispyware software on a macintosh running the leopard operating system a the macintosh isnt inherently invulnerable to malicious software in fact last week it was reported that there is a new scam on the web that can plant a malicious "trojan horse" program on the mac however this is a rare event there have been practically no viruses spyware or other malicious programs written for the macintosh that have actually spread outside the laboratory for that reason most mac users dont run security software and security software companies dont make much of an effort to sell it for macs i dont believe it is necessary so far for all except the most paranoid and those who run windows on their macs in fact freedom from the burdens of running and updating security software has been one of the macs big advantages even the new trojan horse apparently relies on tricking the user rather than on sneaking through holes in the mac operating system according to reports to get infected you must go to a pornography site and agree to download a program allegedly needed to view the porn next the mac will require that you type in your administrator id and password to complete the installation thus agreeing to install the program a second time if you do all that you get a program that supposedly redirects your web browser to bogus web sites my advice even if you frequent porn sites dont agree to download any programs from them that goes for windows users as well some interpret the appearance of this new trojan horse as a sign that the macs increasing market share will begin to attract a flood of viruses and spyware and that mac users will soon have to start running security software if it happens and the threats are more insidious than the latest one i will be ready to change my recommendation but not yet q in reply to a question last week you mentioned that there are free security programs available for windows could you please suggest where to download such alternatives a there are a number of them but ones that i like are free basic antivirus and antispyware programs called avg from a company called grisoft which also makes more elaborate security software you can download these programs at free grisoft com doc us frt q i dont have microsoft powerpoint but i occasionally get powerpoint files as email attachments somewhere i read that one can download a free powerpoint program so you can read these files can you help me with this please a i dont know of any free versions of powerpoint but microsoft does offer a free program that will let you view but not create or edit powerpoint files you can download it at http www microsoft com downloads details aspx familyid dc e d dca dafd&amp displaylang en you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
