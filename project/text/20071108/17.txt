as energy prices soar u s industries collide dow chemical pushes limits on other firms but customers push back midland mich nearly a year ago with his company reeling from rising energy prices dow chemical co chief executive andrew liveris took a stand that turned heads in washington he called for tougher fuel economy requirements for auto makers businesses that buy some &# billion of goods from dow each year the move was as rational as it was risky dow figured that limiting oil usage by cars would ease price pressure on fossil fuels which dow must buy in vast quantities to feed its factories dow also reasoned that if car makers were forced to improve mileage they might buy more of various dow products that can make vehicles go farther on a gallon of fuel in the global push to curb energy consumption mr liveris noted earlier this year "someone wins someone loses " the designated loser however was livid "i called my buddy at dow and said what the are you doing " recalls a washington lobbyist for a major auto maker faced with the outcry from that industry dow backed down and this summer withdrew its support for the controversial fuel economy measure so it goes in the sector by sector jousting over what to do about americas voracious energy appetite which shows little sign of abating despite oils lofty price yesterday crude oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange reached a new intraday high of &# a barrel before falling back to finish at &# amid mounting pressure to curb fossil fuel use both to ease the price run up and to address climate concerns fights are erupting over who will bear the burden and who might win the spoils the auto and oil industries are at each others throats with detroit saying the oil industry should install more ethanol pumps and the oil industry saying detroit should make cars that are more efficient renewable energy producers are arguing over who qualifies for federal tax breaks in one spat producers of u s biodiesel traditionally made from soybeans are fighting a joint bid by oil giant conocophillips and meat processor tyson foods inc for access to a credit for "renewable diesel" fuel they would make from animal fat meanwhile members of the u s climate action partnership big companies that are trying to shape a federal greenhouse gas curb they see as inevitable disagree over the details of what that constraint should look like the problem each company uses hydrocarbons differently and thus each wants to tweak any emissions rule to its own particular advantage dow chemical is a microcosm of these tensions it calls itself the worlds biggest industrial consumer of energy because of the vast quantities of natural gas and oil it uses some for fuel but most as a raw material for years dow has worked to trim its costs by making its plants more efficient despite that effort soaring energy prices have nearly tripled dows annual fossil fuel bill over four years it comes to &# billion a year nearly half the companys production and operating costs now dow is pushing for national policies that would prod other industries to curb their consumption as well it sees two potential benefits less upward price pressure on hydrocarbons and greater sales of various efficiency related products dow makes from insulation to solar panels but dow is finding that taking on other sectors is messy business virtually every one of them is a dow customer thats why the company backpedaled on the fuel economy mandate and its why dow is treading gingerly on a federal proposal to toughen energy efficiency codes for residential and commercial buildings which together consume more energy in the u s than either factories or cars dow officials from mr liveris on down long have called for tougher building codes both to curb natural gas demand and to boost insulation sales but home builders are lobbying hard against the measure and they buy a lot of dow product dows bid to curb hydrocarbon usage elsewhere is creating rifts within the company itself a bill in congress to require electric utilities to generate a portion of their power from "renewable" sources is particularly thorny the proposal appeals to a dow division thats developing solar technology but it worries the company executives in charge of buying electricity for dow factories because it could boost costs "the overall company position gets a little complicated because dow has lots of businesses " says steve ellebracht who heads research and development at the unit developing solar equipment dows manufacturing process hasnt fundamentally changed since herbert h dow founded the company in in midland about miles northwest of detroit it feeds on vast quantities of natural gas and oil some is burned in dow plants to generate heat and electricity but a much greater portion is used as feedstocks in making chemicals every day dow factories churn through hydrocarbons equivalent to about a million barrels of oil about the same as the oil consumption of the netherlands dow has worked for years to improve its plants efficiency it reduced its energy use per product by between and through moves such as cogeneration in which steam and power are produced together dow has pledged to make a further improvement by but the internal efforts havent shielded dow from surging energy prices in and natural gas prices jumped and dows earnings swooned in a shakeup the following year dow put mr liveris in line for its top job which he gained in mr liveris years old grew up in australia and spent most of his career in asia as ceo he has tried to position himself as something of a corporate statesman on energy policy talking bluntly about the tough choices the world must make amid the current energy "crisis " he said in a speech last month consumers must realize "that perhaps they cant have it all " mr liveris believes that dow has paid disproportionately for what he calls "the failed energy policy of the s" and that its time for other sectors to ante up he blames that policy for keeping large u s areas off limits to drilling for oil and gas yet boosting demand for them for example he notes federal environmental policy has led utilities to build power plants fired by natural gas because it emits less air pollution than coal one factor in rising demand for this power meanwhile is a lack of tougher energy efficiency standards for buildings mr liveris says he also says that stagnant automotive fuel economy standards and comparatively low u s gasoline taxes have led auto makers to crank out bigger thirstier vehicles basic manufacturers like dow have been squeezed because they are far removed from most consumers mr liveris contends they havent gotten much of a break in washington "left unattended the losers will be the industrial sector " he says so dow has gotten more aggressive in mid dow helped form a washington advocacy group called the consumer alliance for affordable natural gas along with more drilling it supported measures including tax breaks for improving energy efficiency in buildings and mandates for more efficient appliances several of these made it into federal legislation owing in no small part to dows support say leaders of environmental groups that joined dow in that policy push in mr liveris joined another strange bedfellows advocacy group the energy security leadership council it includes leaders of several big energy consuming companies including fedex corp and southwest airlines co in it as well are retired military leaders who argue that curbing oil imports is a national security imperative last december the council recommended expanding drilling in the outer continental shelf an underwater formation along the u s coasts and toughening fuel economy rules for vehicles by a year president bush effectively endorsed the groups fuel economy proposal this january in his state of the union speech a few days later mr liveris and other ceos on the council met privately with mr bush to talk up the proposals in march mr liveris took part in a washington news conference marking the introduction of a bill based on the recommendations mr liveris sees opportunity for dow if it can develop new products to peddle to industries that are pressed to get more efficient "frankly thats what were doing " he says the upside is evident at dows automotive engineering center in midland dow makes an adhesive that can fasten steel auto parts together replacing welds steel that isnt welded can be thinner and thus lighter reducing a cars fuel usage john hacskaylo a vice president at dows automotive unit says that it is making some sales to the auto industry and interest is growing because of pressure to improve fuel economy also affected is a dow ceramic filter engineers originally designed it to remove beer impurities during brewing it didnt catch on dow adapted the filter to diesel engines which are growing in automotive use because of their fuel economy a spokesman says dow expects to know soon whether it has landed its first major contract for the filter from detroit a tougher fuel economy requirement for auto makers "helps us " mr hacskaylo said in an interview this spring but "do we as dow automotive go and poke at that a lot no we dont our customers wouldnt really like that " indeed throughout the spring and summer dow was getting angry complaints from car makers about its fuel economy stance the backlash was noted in washington dow "did a rather famous job of weathering the heat for quite a while " says jason grumet head of an energy related think tank and an advisory board member of securing americas future energy the parent organization of the energy security leadership council in july dow relented it withdrew from the energy security leadership council dow lobbyist peter molinaro says dow expected "that there would be a very robust debate and compromise along the way" on the proposal to toughen fuel economy requirements by but then to dows surprise the senate actually passed a bill containing a fuel economy provision about as tough as the proposal "thats when the volume went up" from auto industry critics he says meanwhile the proposal for more drilling got "no traction" on capitol hill mr molinaro recalls and with the newly democratic congress making clear its intention to cap greenhouse gas emissions from multiple sectors of the economy dow had joined the u s climate action partnership the big tent group that includes everyone from detroits auto makers to utilities to other basic manufacturers so dow threw its support behind a more moderate congressional fuel economy proposal one endorsed by the auto industry itself mr liveris says he still believes "transportation is key" in curbing energy demand but "i dont target someone else specifically anymore " he says other industries also need to get more efficient including builders efficiency advocates including dow have long called for more national oversight of building efficiency codes which are based on models from national organizations but are set by state and local governments home builders have fought such proposals saying they would raise construction costs a house energy bill would set a national "target" to toughen the model building codes by and by if the organizations that write those building codes didnt meet the targets the bill would authorize the energy department to establish codes that did the provision is endorsed by some groups and companies the national insulation association to which dow belongs is on the list but dow itself isnt mr molinaro the dow lobbyist says dow supports the proposals call for tougher building efficiency targets but not for energy department oversight for another thing he adds the national association of home builders is lobbying against the entire proposal and its members are important dow customers "were supportive of national targets " he says "but we also need to be mindful and respectful of the builders interest in this " the builders oppose even the establishment of targets "you can build very energy efficient homes " says bill killmer a lobbyist for the national association of home builders "but whos going to be able to able to afford that home " his group supports energy efficiency tax breaks he says but not "inflexible rigid targets " sometimes because dow is so sprawling its stake in an energy policy fight isnt clear even to the company consider a pending house proposal to require electric utilities to generate of their power from renewable sources by it sounds good to mr ellebracht the r&amp d chief in the unit developing solar technology in fact it sounds doubly good the proposal would let utilities meet the rule partly by raising energy efficiency and mr ellebrachts unit makes insulation too but the idea worries two other dow fiefs the people who operate power plants at dow chemical factories fret that a mandate on use of energy from renewable sources might require dow itself to buy costly renewable power and the people who buy natural gas as a factory raw material worry that the mandate might actually raise gas prices "to what extent will these policies drive demand for our products and whats the offsetting cost to dow " asks mr molinaro the lobbyist "were struggling like everyone else is to find that sweet spot "
