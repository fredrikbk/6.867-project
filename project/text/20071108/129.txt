troubled border failed courtship of warlord trips up u s in afghanistan eager for allies army tries turning insurgents chaos embroils pakistan the u s is struggling to find tribal allies in afghanistan and pakistan as it tries to beat back the resurgence of al qaeda and the taliban in alienating a powerful warlord named jalaluddin haqqani a few years ago however some u s and afghan officials argue the americans may have shot themselves in the foot mr haqqani is now one of the major rebel leaders roiling afghanistan but back in autumn he secretly sent word that he could ally with the new u s friendly afghan government the warlord had once been a partner of the central intelligence agency and later closely collaborated with osama bin laden and the ruling taliban cia officers held talks with his brother ibrahim and made plans to meet with mr haqqani who was leading some of the talibans troops but u s military forces operating separately from the cia arrested ibrahim cutting off the talks and entrenching his brother as a nemesis mr haqqani is still fighting u s troops along the pakistan border "we blew our chance " contends one of the cia officers involved who had worked with mr haqqani in the s "i truly believe he could have been on our side " other senior officials in the cia and pentagon are less certain but washingtons aborted courtship of mr haqqani epitomizes the conflicts and calculations that are complicating u s involvement in the region the war in afghanistan is a major factor in the chaos unfolding in neighboring pakistan a spreading islamic insurgency inside pakistan is one reason gen pervez musharraf cited saturday when he declared emergency rule though the opposition contends the move was more about extending his stay in power militants in pakistans tribal belt are suspected of fighting in both countries dramatically widening the conflict from the days that it was largely confined to afghanistan with u s intelligence officials concerned that al qaeda is using pakistan as a base to plot new attacks in afghanistan and elsewhere winning back tribal leaders like mr haqqani or eradicating those who refuse to be wooed has climbed to the top of washingtons strategic agenda the state department recently pledged &# million in new aid to pakistans border regions hoping to use economic development and education to peel local leaders away from al qaeda and militants such as mr haqqani the government of afghan president hamid karzai also is pushing to reconcile with the talibans ranks wooing hundreds of combatants through amnesty programs but it is failing so far to win over many core taliban leaders pakistani and american officials allege that mr haqqanis group based in the remote mountains of pakistans north waziristan region bordering afghanistan was critical in helping al qaeda leaders flee to pakistan from afghanistan in and today the warlord and his network continue to provide "security and support for the staging of terrorist acts" against both afghan and western interests says lt col david accetta of the u s armys regional command east in afghanistan debate continues in the u s and afghan governments over whether major afghan warlords can be turned commanders inside the pentagon which has largely taken over the job of hunting down the militants from the cia say theyve received promising overtures from members of mr haqqanis network in recent months and are interested in exploring them "i still believe theres a nonlethal way to get him to reconcile " says lt col dave bushey who served as a battalion commander for the u s armys th mountain division which until june led operations against mr haqqanis fighters along the border "i think these guys want to come home " but theres also concern that mr haqqani has grown too close to osama bin laden and other al qaeda leaders in recent months european security services have arrested south asian and arab men who allegedly trained in pakistans remote tribal regions partially controlled by mr haqqanis men to launch attacks in the west u s intelligence agencies say plots for bombing the u s s ramstein air base in germany and u s bound airliners from london were hatched there suicide bombers sent by mr haqqanis group have killed or injured a string of senior afghan officials u s and afghan officials allege the whereabouts of mr haqqani and his three sons who have increasingly taken command of the groups military operations arent known rumors spread this summer that mr haqqani thought to be in his mid s had died but afghan and u s officials say they dont have any supporting evidence mr haqqanis network is seen as one of the three most powerful militias fighting kabul from pakistani bases along with taliban leader mullah omars army in southern afghanistan and militants controlled by warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar in the north last month the pentagon put mr haqqanis eldest son sirajuddin on its most wanted list in afghanistan many intelligence analysts inside the pentagon and cia believe mr haqqanis militia will continue to fight in the insurgency if he dies but not if he and his sons change sides members of the pashtun tribe based along the pakistan afghan border which includes the haqqanis make up of afghanistans population but are underrepresented in the central government the taliban which ruled afghanistan from is made up almost solely of pashtun tribesmen swathes of eastern and southern afghanistan are in the hands of pashtun and taliban leaders who challenge mr karzais army heavily staffed by uzbek and tajik commanders many inside the cia the pentagon and mr karzais government argue that mr haqqani is more interested in regaining influence in his traditional strongholds than in restoring the taliban government in kabul like many afghan warlords he is seen by those officials as an opportunist more than an ideologue born to an influential clan in eastern afghanistan mr haqqani fled into pakistans tribal region with millions of other afghans after the soviet army invaded their country in many tribal leaders allied with the cia to fight the invaders and the soviet backed local government during the year afghan soviet war mr haqqani and his men won a reputation for being among the fiercest and most effective in one battle during the holy month of ramadan in the late s mr haqqani was shot in the leg the cia dispatched a medical team with a miniature x ray machine to locate the bullet mr haqqani refused to ingest painkillers citing islams tenet to fast during the holiday he "bit down on a belt and we pulled the bullet out with forceps " says milt bearden then the cias station chief in pakistan "haqqani then went back to killing soviets " mr haqqani was seen by cia and pakistani intelligence officials then as a relative moderate among the fundamentalist afghan rebels and his network received generous funding from washington for u s lawmakers and columnists who made the trek to see how u s taxpayers money was being used in the anti communist struggle mr haqqani displayed an elaborate staging area complete with hotel ammunition depot mosque and radio center in tunnels dug into a mountainside with the soviet troop pullout in mr haqqani warned his u s allies that they would quickly be forgotten if they stopped supporting reconstruction "he wanted money for hospitals and education " says a former senior cia operative who worked with mr haqqani at the time but the u s cut funding for the mujahadeen operations in mr haqqani gravitated to arab mercenaries who stepped into the void he struck up a close relationship with mr bin laden who personally fought in battles against communist forces along the afghan pakistan border where mr haqqani operated mr bin laden is credited with using tractors and other equipment to help mr haqqanis men build forward bases inside afghanistan with the taliban takeover mr haqqani aligned with the regime after the u s invaded in october over the talibans harboring of mr bin laden mr haqqani took charge of some taliban and pashtun troops fighting the u s led coalition he also helped al qaeda members flee into pakistans tribal belt say u s and pakistani officials the idea of splitting off pashtun leaders from al qaeda and the taliban became a major cia objective as the fighting wore on mr haqqanis previous cooperation with the cia made him an intriguing target and afghan warlords have a history of switching sides with the proper financial or political inducements u s officials believe members of mr haqqanis family may have been killed during a u s bombing campaign in march but that didnt stop him from reaching out in the ensuing weeks as fighting in eastern afghanistan intensified intermediaries sent word to cia officers who had worked with the warlord in the s that he was open to a deal pakistani intelligence also messaged the cia station in islamabad that reconciliation with mr haqqani was attainable say former cia members but when mr haqqanis brother ibrahim was identified in eastern afghanistan in fall the u s military arrested him as a terrorist risk he was released after nine months but his detention effectively killed the cias plans of striking a strategic agreement say former agency staff and afghan officials afghan officials say the u s military was pressed to arrest ibrahim by a pashtun leader long engaged in a bitter rivalry with the haqqani clan pacha khan zadran they say ibrahim was cooperating with local military commanders loyal to mr karzais government when he was arrested "zadran was in fear of haqqani " says faiz zaland an afghan provincial government official who worked with the u s military at the time some afghan officials say washington and kabul failed to provide convincing guarantees that pashtun leaders would be welcomed into a national unity government "at the beginning every taliban was seen as a terrorist " says afghanistans former interior minister ali jalali "it created mistrust " now pentagon officials say the haqqani network has adopted tactics tested by al qaeda in iraq using suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices against u s and afghan government forces in afghanistan in september a teenage member of mr haqqanis movement blew up himself and the governor of paktia province abdel hakim taniwal say u s and afghan officials at mr taniwals funeral two days later a second suicide attacker believed to have been sent by mr haqqani set off an explosive belt killing and injuring four of mr karzais ministers on jan of this year units from the th mountain division engaged mr haqqanis men near the pakistan border say u s army commanders the u s forces had built a border checkpoint along a key passage into afghanistan from waziristan to stem insurgents informers tipped them off that mr haqqanis men were preparing to hit the installation near midnight hundreds of armed pashtuns crossed into afghanistan some were barefoot others wore garbage bags on their feet to protect themselves from the frost say u s soldiers present the th mountain division hit them with artillery and machine gun fire from apache helicopters killing about of mr haqqanis men say u s army officials "that was a very good day " says col bushey a battalion commander who was present "we showed we were increasingly challenging their space " the division next built a base on the important route between the eastern afghan cities of gardez and khost near the haqqanis home district the afghan government is constructing administrative offices there to challenge mr haqqanis influence and has recruited local leaders in building schools and roads to win over the local population members of the th mountain division say they have received feelers over the past year about possibly striking a compromise with the karzai government they came from sirajuddin haqqani mr haqqanis eldest son who is on the pentagons most wanted list zahid hussain in islamabad contributed to this article
