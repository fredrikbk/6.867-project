capital from credit mess lessons about government as redwoods topple in the wall street forest chuck prince of citigroup stan oneal of merrill lynch were learning a lot about the business of modern finance or more precisely were relearning a lot of old lessons if you dont understand it dont buy it trust but verify what are we learning about the role of government ditch the cliche that government should be run more like a business its too flattering to business it would be great if government were as efficient and agile as the most nimble companies heck it would be great if most businesses were as efficient and agile as the best companies but the past few weeks are a reminder that a big title at a big name company is no guarantee of smart savvy management government doesnt have a monopoly on incompetence imprudence or short sightedness only government can protect the most vulnerable consumer a lot of sophisticated lenders and borrowers gambled and lost government cant and probably shouldnt protect them from themselves but as late u s federal reserve governor edward gramlich argued the fed didnt use all the power it had to expand consumer protection rules to mortgage lenders outside traditional banks some mortgages shouldnt be made some people are better off renting not owning houses mortgage brokers should have at least some responsibility stockbrokers do to assess whether a loan is suitable for a customers circumstances the fed is neither irrelevant nor impotent it has become fashionable to argue that the fed has lost its mojo and has been overwhelmed by the growth of global financial markets and the rise of economies outside the u s but the fed is blamed for a keeping credit too easy for too long and causing an unsustainable borrowing and housing boom and theres some merit to that case b not acting quickly enough to respond to the housing bust and c moving too swiftly to rescue beleaguered banks the fact is that central banks still do matter and the fed matters more than any other at times of financial panic the value of having a wise central bank becomes clear it just did again allowing the financial engineers to disperse risks has downsides as well as upsides for years alan greenspan and the like minded argued that allowing wall street to slice and dice loans and sell the pieces as securities was an innovation that dispersed risks widely and made the financial system and economy more stable theres a lot to that but as loans leave the books of those who make them and are sold off in parts to different investors no one can be sure who holds the risk if everyone fears that the other guy has a portfolio of toxic waste markets freeze and the rest of the economy can be hurt that in large part explains the behavior of big banks in the u s and europe since early august at some point the risks that greater opacity and complexity pose to financial stability offset the benefits of widely dispersing risks because what is in the clear interest of each individual player may not be in the interest of the global financial system as a whole market players arent likely to get this balance right without at least prodding from government market discipline isnt all it was cracked up to be the u s savings and loan crisis of the late s was made in washington the tax reform act of whacked the real estate on which they lent changing rules on interest rates unhinged their business model and more generous federal deposit insurance amounted to a government offer of heads we lose tails you win to s&amp l operators if risky loans paid off the operators made huge profits if they didnt government made the depositors whole duh the s&amp l crowd took the bet this crisis was made on wall street thats not to say government doesnt share the blame but all this occurred at a time when government regulators were in retreat the complex financial instruments were designed and sold by wall street and they were purchased by huge institutional investors that now say they blindly relied on credit rating agencies which are staffed by analysts whom the big investment houses didnt consider smart enough to hire for their own staffs but regulation isnt all its cracked up to be either for months the oft heard worry was that hedge funds the big largely unregulated pools of money would either cause or amplify the next financial crisis but when the crisis hit it turned out that commercial banks the most regulated supervised institutions in the entire financial system were at the epicenter
