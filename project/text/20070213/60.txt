its time to put the lid on nuclear weapons before terrorists get them the nuclear non proliferation treatys state to state bargain seems hopelessly ineffective and outdated in the face of todays security threats which involve terrorist cells and other non state actors but it isnt the npts state focused logic is if anything more relevant today than it was when the treaty was negotiated years ago while mikhail gorbachevs admonishment "the nuclear threat " editorial page jan repeats the same argument that treaty proponents have been making all these years the message is becoming more urgent following decades of inaction in which the spread of nuclear technologies continues to devolve from large rational nation states to rogue nations and quite possibly by now to terrorist organizations the nuclear world was a vastly simpler place until recent decades in the s hope still persisted for the logic of the npt that the exclusive club of eight nuclear nations would simply give up their nuclear arsenals other countries would forgo developing their own and that would be that there were many reasons why that scenario failed to gain traction not the least of which was that the central premise of the national security policies of the soviet union and the united states involved pointing nuclear weapons at each other but then by accident or design mikhail gorbachev initiated policies in the soviet union that eventually led to the collapse of the communist bloc in the ensuing chaos of the commonwealth of independent states and russias subsequent lurch toward its unique conception of "democratic market economy " nobody knew or still knows for sure where russia was or is going but it was quite clear to most that the vast majority of both sides nuclear arsenals served no military or political purpose being targeted at each other and could be abolished unfortunately the reykjavik "abolition" summit of happened so early in the process and so spontaneously that the professionals on both sides were proved unable to comprehend and respond to the challenge the u s and russia wasted the window they had in the s to do something serious about controlling the spread of nuclear technology now nuclear capabilities are leaking to a new decentralized and far less detectable class of enemies terrorists and other non state actors some believe that its not a matter of "if" but "when" there is a major nuclear terrorist attack but our enemies live somewhere and national law enforcement backed up with unprecedented multinational coordination will be necessary if theres a chance of hunting them down and pre empting their deployment of nuclear technology the non proliferation treaty offers a ready framework for tightening controls on the spread of nuclear weaponry its time to get serious about using that framework or is it too late already daniel j arbess new york
