have pulled off another well timed deal now analysts are scrambling to figure out what will happen to all that money and whether shareholders of mr lis flagship company hong kong listed hutchison whampoa ltd will reap the benefits of his coup last night hutchison telecommunications international ltd which is owned by hutchison whampoa confirmed it had entered a binding agreement to sell its stake in indian telecom company hutchison essar ltd to britains vodafone group plc hutchison telecom said it expects to book an estimated gain of &# billion before tax when the deal is completed the deal subject to approval by indian regulators and hutchison telecom shareholders isnt expected to be completed until the second quarter the transaction price amounts to a multiple of earnings before interest depreciation taxes and amortization or ebitda of nearly times hutchison essars results the telecommunications market norm is usually closer to six to seven times the ebitda multiple hutchison telecom says the &# billion value for the whole company implied by vodafones offer represents a premium that is about above the enterprise value of other telecommunications providers in india vodafone emerges victorious from a field of bidders but in addition to the rich price it is paying there is the fractious background of the deal hutchison has had a strained relationship with its partner in india essar group which owns of hutchison essar now essar is questioning the cost savings vodafone would be able to achieve as a result of a network sharing plan it announced in india on the grounds that essar believes that it as a shareholder must grant approval for such large contracts and it hasnt a person familiar with the groups thinking said a vodafone spokesman declined to comment on the shareholder agreement when asked whether he was worried about having problems working with essar group vodafone chief executive arun sarin said "i have no concerns " speaking on a conference call with analysts and media sunday mr sarin said essar was vodafones preferred partner given that it owns a stake and has experience in the indian market both in telecommunications and other industries essar group says it is considering whether to retain its hutchison essar stake meanwhile analysts are speculating on the future of hutchison telecom india is one of the worlds fastest growing telecommunications markets and the operations there were long seen as the crown jewel of hutchison telecom amounting to about of the companys enterprise value with that sold the company is left with scattered telecommunications holdings in markets including israel indonesia thailand and vietnam and a massive pile of cash analysts see multiple possibilities for the money "the debate now is whether theyll hold onto it and reinvest in other telco businesses or whether theyll pay it back up to hutchison whampoa " says morgan stanley analyst rob hart for hutchison whampoa shareholders mr hart says "its quite unlikely that theyre going to see this cash directly " hutchison telecom said it will announce its plans for the cash shortly after the lunar new year which begins this weekend "we havent made a final decision " said hutchison telecom spokeswoman mickey shiu "the options being considered include debt reduction finding suitable investment opportunities and making distributions to shareholders by way of special dividends " regardless of the outcome many analysts say the companys future still hinges on its struggling telecommunications operations in europe since hutchison

from g have diluted profit at hutchison whampoa which has far more profitable businesses hutchison whampoa could improve its earnings profile markedly by selling some of its unprofitable businesses such as hutchison g uk limited to hutchison telecom analysts say structuring such a deal would be complicated as hutchison whampoa would likely be barred from voting because it owns a significant portion of both companies as a result the company would have to convince minority shareholders there is an upside to taking on the struggling g operations under another more routine scenario hutchison telecom could pass some or all of the cash up to its parent through a special dividend that could boost hutchison whampoas corporate credit rating and ultimately improve its share price at the end of

"stable" from "negative " according to primary credit analyst mary ellen olson still analysts say hutchison whampoas subsidiaries have rarely paid large dividends to the parent following past deals finally hutchison telecom could use the cash to reinvest in its existing holdings and make acquisitions but analysts say hot opportunities in developing countries are rare and it would be difficult to
