manager a j smith said the coach would be back five days later offensive coordinator cam cameron was hired to coach the miami dolphins whod lost nick saban to alabama a couple of weeks before in the first instance of wing flapping a few days later bill parcells said he was flapping his wings as dallas cowboys coach for the last time last week chargers defensive coordinator wade phillips replaced him add to that long simmering tension between the head coach and general manager in san diego and the departure of other assistants and the martyball era was over at qualcomm stadium "smith didnt want to lose continuity didnt want to lose a year so he brought the coach back " nick canepa writes in the san diego union tribune "but continuity suddenly went aground and smith saw schottenheimer and no one else staring him in the face it became too much for him to bear " adds sportslines clark judge "dont think for a moment this was a premeditated act done with someone in mind it wasnt it was done to stop an internecine struggle that had become intolerable and it stopped it all right " but that timing means that messrs cameron and phillips arent available to succeed mr schottenheimer don

bondy resists taking easy shots at football noting that its losses have declined even as the budget has grown and points out that rutgers still has more varsity teams than most state universities "it is open to debate whether state taxpayers should support olympic style sports that do not interest the vast majority of the student body and rarely lead to discernible careers after graduation " mr bondy writes "isnt it better to get that scholarship and class space into the hands of a future doctor than an outstanding fencer but there is no denying the pain here and the failed commitments to student athletes who came to rutgers on faith " for the past half century john bucyk has been a boston bruin first as a hall of fame left winger who won two stanley cups and then serving various roles

snapping them straight up over the goalie roof shots that sometimes appeared as if they would rocket out the top of the net " kevin paul dupont writes in the boston globe "at the end of every practice without fail bucyk would lug a bucket of pucks to the front of the crease and snap forehanders and backhanders under the crossbar " hall of famer wayne gretzky whose years of nhl affiliation pale before mr bucyks mark also still enjoys hockey immensely the phoenix coyotes coach tells the miami heralds david j neal "my dad worked until he was years old i was too young to be sitting around doing
