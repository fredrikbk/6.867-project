stock watch how much fuel is in adms tank emphasis on ethanol bodes well but corn prices could pinch profits online edition who knew ears of corn could be so green agricultural processing giant archer daniels midland the largest u s producer of ethanol a fuel most often made from corn just reported a nice jump in quarterly earnings thanks in part to the biofuel adm also makes animal feed and food products such as high fructose corn syrup in the past year ethanol has emerged as a political darling in washington with president bush and many of the presidential contenders calling for increased consumption demand for the fuel has soared and some analysts think adms star will continue to rise along with it other analysts worry about high corn prices the chance that oil prices will fall and the fact that ethanol demand depends somewhat on political agendas the stock was up to &# at tuesdays close ratings and disclosures follow the bull case ethanol for all the "tremendous attention focused on ethanol" is a driver for adm stock says analyst ann gurkin of davenport equity research who recently raised her rating on adm to "buy " she projects "solid demand" for ethanol because of pressure on the u s to reduce oil dependence president bush set ambitious goals for alternative fuel use in his state of the union address calling for consumption of billion gallons of ethanol and other alternative fuels by the u s now consumes about billion gallons of ethanol a year adm is "well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for ethanol " writes standard &amp poors joseph agnese adm is also exploring cellulosic ethanol a cheaper alternative that would eventually churn fuel from resources such as switchgrass citigroup analyst david driscoll believes adm could be ready to sell some kind of cellulosic ethanol within two years "cellulosic ethanol is real and not very far off " he writes "the long term opportunity is huge " cost controls the cost of producing ethanol hinges on the price of corn the main source used to obtain ethanol corn prices spiked last year as ethanol demand rocketed but adm still posted a earnings gain last quarter as a result some analysts are optimistic about adms ability to manage future corn price increases last quarters earnings "underscore archers ability to manage through volatility " writes diane geissler of merrill lynch who thinks wall street concern about adms corn processing margins is "overdone " the u s corn crop should be bigger this year increasing supply and driving down prices says john mcmillin of prudential equity group davenports ms gurkin expects "a record corn planting" and that "adm will successfully manage its costs " jack of many trades though its ethanol is currently in the spotlight bullish analysts say adm is a multifaceted company not reliant on one product "adm is not a one trick pony " writes bmo capital markets kenneth zaslow but an "agriculturally diversified model that should create sustainable growth " citigroups mr driscoll notes that profits in adms oilseeds business rose in the latest quarter oilseeds are made into vegetable oils and used in animal feed growing demand for biodiesel another alternative fuel that uses vegetable oils as its base should boost adms soybean processing business the bear case margin crunch some analysts think ethanol prices will fall this year and that corn costs will rise a combination that would squeeze adms ethanol margins todd duvick of bank of america reiterated a "sell" rating on adm in part on worries about "shrinking profits going forward " he thinks ethanol returns peaked in the past two quarters credit suisses david nelson who remains "cautious" on adm "due to worries about crop supplies " says that a weaker than anticipated corn crop this summer would shrink supply and raise prices flat to declining ethanol prices plus higher corn costs "suggest margin compression in bioproducts from this point on " writes eric katzman of deutsche bank overplanting with its facilities for wheat cocoa and oilseed running close to capacity adm may have to build expensive new plants in the next two years says deutsche banks mr katzman the costs could hamper returns in those businesses the company is also presently expanding its capacity to produce ethanol writes mr nelson a "big risk " particularly if summer corn crops are weak capital expenses or outlays to upgrade a companys plants or equipment are projected at &# billion over the and fiscal years adm may have to use cash and short term debt to pay these costs adds mr duvick if expensive commodities eat up operating cash too political some analysts think the success or failure of ethanol depends dangerously on the whims of politicians merrill lynchs ms geissler writes that ethanol production is spurred by a government mandated program that could be "legislated into non existence" at any time just as ethanol tax credits are subject to revision by congress although the new ethanol mandate sounds like a windfall for producers much of the supply increase would have to come from cellulosic ethanol which isnt yet commercially viable says credit
