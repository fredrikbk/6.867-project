lvmhs new fashion luxury with restraint paris french fashion brand givenchys haute couture show last month was no lavish affair models wearing dark gowns walked across the concrete floor of a warehouse on the edge of paris dragging their trains through puddles meant to emulate a somber rainy evening it wasnt a publicity stunt for the brand that once threw sumptuous parties attended by glitterati like audrey hepburn the warehouse a cavernous brick structure built to store paris opera stage sets is much cheaper to rent than traditional fashion show venues such as the citys opulent grand palais where chanel showed its haute couture gowns the venue wasnt the only difference though the hand sewn dresses were luxurious givenchy showed only styles down from last fall and fewer than the that christian dior displayed in its show last month a management change at givenchys parent company lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton putting pierre yves roussel in charge of givenchy and sister brands including celine marc jacobs and kenzo has ushered in a new era of austerity the belt tightening highlights lvmh chairman bernard arnaults commitment to the small underperforming fashion houses that analysts and investment bankers have been urging him to sell for years when the company reports its earnings tomorrow analysts expect to see evidence that mr arnaults strategy is starting to pay off "so far the message from the company is that theyve been gradually improving profitability of these brands " says ubs luxury goods analyst yasuhiro yamaguchi lvmh doesnt break out sales or profits by brand in the company had a net profit of billion euros &# billion on billion euros in sales mr yamaguchi expects earnings to have risen to billion euros other analysts forecast as much as billion euros lvmh was the first to launch the multibrand business model that is now the foundation of the global luxury goods industry starting with flagship brand louis vuitton mr arnault began shopping for smaller labels in the s snapping up givenchy in in the late s as the luxury goods industry entered a period of prosperity lvmh and other companies picked up the pace of their acquisitions buying smaller labels mainly in italy and france these labels had loyal local followings but couldnt compete on a global scale the theory was that owning a variety of brands in different countries would offset the risk of fashion cycles while one brands popularity waned another would flourish the thinking went lvmh went on to buy italys family owned pucci and fendi companies and new yorks donna karan other companies followed the same logic gucci group owned by frances ppr sa bought yves saint laurent and prada group spa bought jil sander the theory didnt pan out lvmh continued to rely on louis vuitton as well as its champagne and cognac businesses for the bulk of its sales and profit likewise the gucci and prada brands outshone their smaller sister labels the luxury goods industry was hit by the drop in tourism after the sept terrorist attacks and analysts stepped up their criticism of fashion executives for wasting time on loss plagued brands two years ago lvmh and other big fashion groups started to backtrack lvmh sold struggling fashion house christian lacroix and prada later ditched its helmut lang and jil sander brands now smaller labels across the industry are starting to show promise the recent improvements in part reflect an overall upturn in the &# billion luxury goods industry which has benefited from a strong economy in the u s and china and a global surge in tourism in the past two years the parent companies also have devoted renewed management attention to their flailing brands after years of unmet financial targets guccis yves saint laurent brand for example reported strong sales growth last year italian leather goods label bottega veneta also part of gucci is blossoming in both the market and the fashion columns at lvmh mr arnault decided to tackle his "other" brands a year and a half ago by putting them all in the hands of mr roussel an lvmh veteran he was officially confirmed in the post in december after a trial period mr roussel who declined to be interviewed for this article poached some of the best executives across the lvmh empire for his new division he nabbed serge brunschwig a top manager at louis vuitton to head french fashion house celine he offered bertrand stalla bourdillon also at vuitton the top spot at the hot marc jacobs label mr stalla bourdillon who also oversees lvmhs shoe brand berluti is spearheading an aggressive international expansion for the american fashion house reaching outside the group mr roussel hired alberto puyol pineda away from mass market spanish lingerie chain womens secret and put him at the helm of the loewe fashion brand also spanish another lingerie expert alberto lavia from the closely held la perla label took over kenzo mr roussel wants each brand to learn from the others experiences "were all at a comparable stage in our development and have similar questions about how to grow " mr brunschwig says mr roussel looked at production synergies a year ago for example celine outsourced its shoe production to rossimoda an italian shoe maker that belongs to lvmh and makes footwear for sister brands donna karan givenchy and pucci to boost their visibility many of lvmhs smaller brands have started expanding their product lines through licenses these deals let fashion labels collect royalties without worrying about manufacturing though they can dilute a brands image if used too extensively u s designer marc jacobs is using a licensing partner to launch a childrens clothes line called little marc this month and is selling a collection of china and crystal tableware made by waterford wedgwood plc celines mr brunschwig recently signed a license for watches with taramax sa which already makes watches for lvmhs fendi across his new division mr roussel has imposed cost cutting measures in addition to saving on the womens haute couture show givenchy also dropped its mens fashion show last month in favor of a less expensive presentation in a paris showroom loewe an official supplier of clothes and accessories to the spanish royal family laid off about workers at its spanish factories which also subcontracted for other brands the shakeup is finally helping lvmh regain credibility for the multibrand strategy it pioneered "its easier to play the angle of a multibrand conglomerate if you have more than one success " says merrill lynch luxury goods analyst antoine colonna
