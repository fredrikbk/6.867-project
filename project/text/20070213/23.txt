coated stents gain ground in risk trials drug coated stents took a scientific drubbing over the past two years as study after study asked are the benefits of the tiny scaffoldings which prop open clogged arteries worth the added risk of blood clots later on now after fiery confrontations at cardiology conferences an inconclusive hearing before a food and drug administration panel in december some retrenchment toward the older bare metal stents and indications of cold feet from medicare manufacturers of the coated stents may have won a round or at least a reprieve the new england journal of medicine yesterday rushed five stent studies to early publication on its web site that largely confirmed the scientific consensus coated stents do cut the need for repeat procedures in half and appear to be safe when used on healthier patients but the studies also suggest that little is known about the performance of coated stents in a larger group the sicker to of patients who receive stents "off label" outside the limits approved by the fda all of the studies were presented in preliminary form to the fda panel in december but yesterdays mass publication of the formal results will likely be the most authoritative analysis of stent risks and benefits for some time "were at the end of the beginning " said andrew farb a medical officer at the fda who wrote an accompanying editorial to the studies on the upside three of the five studies dug through data supplied by the manufacturers boston scientific corp and johnson &amp johnson and concluded that among healthier patients who were allowed to participate in the firms clinical trials overall those who received a coated stent werent more likely to die suffer a heart attack or have a blood clot coated stent patients did have more "very late" clots those that form more than a year after implantation but this was balanced by a higher incidence of earlier blood clots in bare metal stents one finding was worrisome diabetics who participated in johnson &amp johnsons clinical trials of their cypher drug coated stent had a death rate to higher than those who got cyphers bare metal predecessor known as velocity but the lead researcher christian spaulding of the cochin hospital in paris said even he didnt trust the finding "this may be due to chance " he said "even though i did the study i still implant the cypher stent in my diabetic patients " he suggested further study of diabetics a fourth study combining data from manufacturer run clinical trials with a number of smaller more independent trials also found no significant difference either among diabetics or overall in death rates heart attacks or blood clots however a swedish study which examined medical records of every patient who got a stent in sweden in and concluded that "real world" patients with coated stents both on label and off label were roughly more likely to die within three years than those who got bare stents such a result would be quite significant if confirmed in a controlled trial but several experts cautioned the studys limitations meant it was hard to draw firm conclusions because the swedish researchers looked only at medical records after the fact they werent able to control which patients received bare metal and coated stents meaning the two groups werent perfectly matched the group that received drug coated stents was healthier to start out compensating for such differences is very difficult several experts said thats why controlled clinical trials where patients are randomly and secretly given either a coated or bare stent and then followed for several years are considered more reliable even though typically only interested manufacturers will fund them rigorous trials of stents in sicker "off label" patients are in the early stages and published data arent expected for several years "am i satisfied with the timeliness of the data no im not " said william h maisel who was chairman of the fda panel and wrote a second accompanying editorial yesterday "we still dont have the answers to some of the important questions " yesterdays publication wont close the chapter on blood clot worries dr maisel said "i think there will be a continued reduction in the off label use of drug eluting stents " lack of data on "off label" uses may prove frustrating to medicare which last week said it was studying the data from the fda panel and considering possibly reopening its decisions on how broadly to cover drug coated stents
