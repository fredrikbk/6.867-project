qatar shows interest in natural gas cartel qatars interest in exploring the creation of an opec like cartel for natural gas adds another major producer to a group that includes russia and iran even so industry experts say the nascent effort faces significant obstacles ranging from a fragmented market to a history of noncooperation among the worlds biggest holders of reserves russian president vladimir putin and qatari emir sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani said yesterday at a meeting in doha qatar that they wanted competing gas producers to cooperate more mr putin said he would send a team of experts to a natural gas conference in doha in april where they would discuss details of building a cartel the leaders of russia the no gas producer in terms of reserves and no iran have been talking recently about creating a group similar to the organization of petroleum exporting countries which manages its output in an effort to sway crude oil prices world wide if such a group were formed the inclusion of no qatar a major producer of liquefied natural gas or lng would give it significant clout but forming such a group could be difficult sheik hamad said he supported the discussions but he was unsure whether a gas cartel would be able to command the same degree of market control as opec does gas demand is climbing amid global economic growth and because it burns cleaner than other fuels but gas markets are fragmented in part because transporting gas overseas can be difficult complicating efforts to form a single global market like oil in which a group of producers could hold sway lng which is natural gas cooled into liquid form and shipped overseas via tanker has moved natural gas closer to a world market but it remains a small part of global use also gas tends to be sold through long term contracts that means a cartel would have little influence on such arrangements sheik hamad said in a press conference in his presidential palace past efforts havent led to significant cooperation among gas producers russia qatar and iran are members of the gas exporting countries forum which was formed in but hasnt met since jonathan stern director of gas at the oxford institute for energy studies said mr putins talk of closer cooperation among gas exporters isnt the same as a cartel and "doesnt mean a price setting or volume setting organization " he said russia and qatar as gas exporters dont have much in common and they have much more potential to be competitors especially in the european market a spokeswoman for the international energy agency said a cartel that raises prices "will encourage consumers to reduce demand or switch to other fuels this is particularly true for gas which can be substituted with coal and nuclear " julie reside a state department spokeswoman said there has been talk of a possible "gas opec" for many years with no result "i think experience has shown that free and open markets work best for both producers and consumers " she said russia has sparked concern in the west that it is using its vast energy reserves as political leverage mr putin has dismissed the criticism and he has defended moves to raise gas prices on some customers as an effort to put market prices in place after years of lower prices
