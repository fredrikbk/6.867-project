career journal m b a track m b a programs take fast track focus on academics careers business school trends jiye shi a scientist for belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb group travels regularly to europe on business and didnt think he could fit an executive m b a program into his schedule but he recently discovered a revamped program at the university of rochesters simon graduate school of business that should suit the pace of his life dr shi will miss work less often because he will attend classes on alternating fridays and saturdays instead of every friday in addition by taking some summer or evening classes he can now complete the degree in months instead of the usual months "with the previous format " dr shi says "i would have had to miss up to a quarter of class hours which would have been frustrating and unacceptable the extra two days at work every month will make a significant difference for me to make progress on collaborative projects and maintain good customer relationships across the continents " more executive mba programs are switching to shorter more flexible schedules to appeal to busy managers and sponsoring companies that want to minimize time away from the workplace as business becomes ever more global time is an increasingly important factor for prospective students like dr shi ken syme vice president for global purchasing at xerox who earned an executive m b a from rochester last year believes the schools new schedule will be much less disruptive for companies "the format will give employers greater flexibility in scheduling " he says "my boss had trouble always working around my classes every friday " schools are shrinking executive m b a calendars in a variety of ways eliminating summer breaks cutting courses from the curriculum combining related courses and adding more online content the shortest programs now last as little as to months the thunderbird school of global management in glendale ariz will launch a new executive m b a program this fall that will run for months down from months it will include weekend classes in arizona four week long modules in the u s europe and china and some web based courses "the market is driving the change " says angel cabrera thunderbirds president noting that the university of arizona moved north from tucson into thunderbirds backyard last fall with a new month executive m b a program at a phoenix area hotel some prospective executive m b a students say they welcome abbreviated programs so they wont have to put their personal lives on hold as long "sixteen months will be very intense and will test my time balancing skills to the max but it will mean five less months without a life " says mary stubbs who works in aerospace engineering at honeywell and plans to enroll in thunderbirds new program but how short is too short thats a subject of much debate among academics who question how a condensed curriculum can measure up in terms of quality both columbia university and the university of pennsylvanias wharton school are sticking firmly with schedules of months and two years respectively because they believe a briefer course of study would diminish the value of their degrees "we dont want to compromise the rigor and integrity of a columbia m b a " says ethan hanabury associate dean howard kaufold director of whartons m b a for executives realizes companies want employees as available as possible but contends that they also seek a return on their investment if they are helping to pay for the degree "companies appreciate the networks their employees build rubbing shoulders with other students during their two years at wharton " he says "thats something students and their employers wouldnt benefit from in shorter programs that rely heavily on distance learning " in defense of their fast track executive degrees deans insist that they are paring programs with care in moving to months from two academic years the rochester institute of technology didnt decimate the curriculum for example it embedded part of a discontinued business government and society class in a leadership course and merged content from a management information systems class into operations management "we also beefed up and gave credit for things like our international trip and leadership development " brian oneil associate dean says some schools maintain that older experienced managers seeking an executive m b a want not only a speedy education but also a different learning experience than younger full time students "we didnt do m b a lite when we designed our month program but we also werent constrained by traditional academic thinking " says trina callie m b a associate program director at the university of arizona "we told the faculty to start fresh asking what are the critical skills executives need and how can we make the program more interdisciplinary through team teaching by professors and retired executives " with students the first executive m b a class in the phoenix area exceeded arizonas expectations of to so encouraging was the enrollment in fact that this month the university announced it has decided to lease a permanent home in the suburb of scottsdale
