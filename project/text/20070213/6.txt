as it polishes green image ge fights epa general electric co which is running a marketing campaign promoting itself as environmentally friendly has pushed to weaken smog controls for railroad locomotives in rules about to be proposed by the environmental protection agency the rules which could take effect between and are designed to cut smog and soot levels and would replace standards adopted in since the rules would apply to new locomotives and could require changes on older ones they would have a big effect on ge which dominates the nearly &# billion a year north american locomotive market while the nations other locomotive maker and diesel engine makers say they are prepared to meet the proposed new standard ge argues it is "unlikely to be achieved" and has proposed a weaker one the debate conducted behind closed doors at the epa for more than a year focuses on a significant source of air pollution the epa estimates each locomotive produces as much pollution over its lifetime as heavy duty diesel trucks in a notice to the industry the epa says current locomotives including ges evolution series were designed to "meet relatively modest emission standards" of the agency announced in it would toughen emission standards for diesel locomotives and similar diesel engines on ships it hoped to propose a rule by last summer the proposal may come this month william wehrum acting assistant administrator for epa clean air efforts said ges opposition has been one factor in the delay "we have our boxes of data and they ge have theirs " he said he described the proposal as "a very high priority for us " the agency estimates reducing emissions from locomotives and ships would cost between &# billion and &# billion by and provide at least &# billion in health and environmental benefits over the same period particularly to people who live in smog prone areas in california the mid atlantic states the great lakes region and near rail lines the epa says breathing diesel exhaust can cause cancer in a letter reviewed by the wall street journal ge told the epa in december that catalytic converters used to meet epa emissions reductions imposed earlier on trucks and off road construction equipment have "fundamental limitations" that make their durability on locomotives unlikely much of the dispute focuses on the acceptable level of emissions of nitrogen oxides which cause smog the epa wants a limit of grams per horsepower per hours operation ge is advocating a gram limit and says in its letter achieving that level would require "significantly high risk technology breakthroughs " current rules which cover ges evolution series set a limit of grams steven gray a vice president for ges transportation division who wrote the letter asserts that ge and the epa "fundamentally agree" on the need for reductions but calls the epa proposal "pretty aggressive " he adds "were just concerned about some technologies and the right approach i think its been a helpful dialogue " the dispute comes against the backdrop of ges marketing campaign highlighting what the fairfield conn conglomerate considers its ecologically sensitive approach to business it features products including the evolution locomotive seen in one ad chugging through pristine rural settings surrounded by flowers birds trees and mountains ge says it has a &# billion backlog of orders for its "ecomagination" products which include fuel efficient jet engines wind turbines and compact fluorescent light bulbs ge launched its "ecomagination" campaign in may winning praise from some environmental groups frank odonnell president of clean air watch an environmental group in washington says "it is the height of hypocrisy for ge to be spending money advertising so called green locomotives while lobbying behind closed doors against important standards needed to protect our health from train emissions " mr gray argues ges marketing campaign and its efforts at the epa are consistent "ecomagination is all about solving todays environmental challenges across the spectrum i think weve put in the yeomans effort more than anybody in the industry " mr gray says the marketing for the evolution locomotive is appropriate because the engine meets current epa standards and is more fuel efficient than older models ges position on the locomotive rules isnt supported by a competitor in the business electro motive diesel inc lagrange ill "were not making a big thing out of being green but were definitely intending to meet all of the epa rules and requirements " said martha lenz director of engine design for the company jed mandel president of the engine manufacturers association representing makers of engines and parts for locomotives and ships called the epa target a "stretch goal " but one the industry can meet "nobody likes to be regulated but members in this marketplace are very progressive companies and they realize that theres more that they can do to reduce emissions from their products " joseph kubsch executive director of the manufacturers of emissions control association representing catalyst makers says new devices tested on big trucks ships and utility plants will meet the epa locomotive target
