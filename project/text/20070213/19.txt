blood substitutes face long odds history scientific concern hamstring sector northfields high hopes northfield laboratories chief executive steven a gould recently described himself as "encouraged" and "optimistic" that the companys blood substitute soon will become the first approved by the u s food and drug administration to revive hemorrhaging patients based on the recent history of the blood substitute business and northfield laboratories inc research results experts and an increasing number of investors are less optimistic for the fda to approve northfields blood substitute the agency would have to look past a series of trial results including recent preliminary data from a major study of the evanston ill companys polyheme product and others that havent been previously reported in which blood substitutes were linked to higher death and adverse event rates than standard therapy in treating patients in different medical settings northfield which declined to comment has said it plans to seek fda approval this year the search for a blood substitute got a huge push in the s when concerns about hiv and hepatitis tainted blood had grown acute since then new tests have helped make the supply of donor blood safer a blood substitute with a long shelf life could ease an expected future shortfall in donor blood or help in a crisis such as a natural disaster today the prime likely market for a blood substitute may be the battlefield where it is difficult to get fresh blood to trauma patients quickly but many experts in the field have serious reservations about treating patients with this class of blood substitutes known as hemoglobin based oxygen carriers one doubter is william d hoffman chief of cardiac surgery critical care at massachusetts general hospital and former medical director of biopure corp in cambridge massachusetts maker of a product similar to northfields he said the "totality of the data" on this class of products is that "so much harm has been shown without benefit that the field should be stopped " biopure recently rejected by an fda advisory panel for a u s navy study of blood substitute use in trauma patients said it is negotiating with the fda about further research into its product called hemopure it declined to comment a third company closely held sangart inc in san diego said it plans to move ahead with a late stage study of another chemically similar blood substitute in surgery patients "blood substitutes in general do still have potential " says robert winslow sangarts chief executive and a former professor at the university of california at san diego "what these products can do is deliver oxygen to tissue where its needed " on dec northfield disclosed what it termed "preliminary results" from its study of polyheme in badly hemorrhaging trauma patients forty six patients or of those given polyheme died compared with patients or who died after getting standard therapy the news crushed northfields stock which had doubled during the second half of last year to more than &# in anticipation of the trauma test results the shares rose cents or to &# as of p m yesterday in nasdaq stock market composite trading the company has said it has almost &# million in cash on hand enough to last two years northfield doesnt have any products on the market on a january conference call with investors dr gould said the data had mistakes especially "discrepancies in the dates of death for two patients " he said that if only patients with error free data are included the number of deaths in each group would be comparable typically the fda would look at all patients in a study dr gould said he is confident that after the errors are taken into account polyheme will be found "noninferior " or not worse than standard therapy standard therapy is saline solution given in the ambulance and then donor blood in the hospital northfield has said it expects to complete its final analysis in the next few weeks other blood substitutes in the same class as polyheme also have yielded disappointing results in baxter international inc halted a u s trauma study after of patients on its blood substitute died compared with of patients on standard therapy people familiar with research on blood substitutes of two other companies somatogen inc and hemosol corp said a blood substitute from each of those companies was linked to cardiac or other toxicity somatogen became part of baxter which abandoned blood substitute research baxter declined to comment hemosol is in canadian restructuring under bankruptcy law and has dropped its first blood substitute for reasons other than toxicity said nigel meakin of pricewaterhousecoopers inc the court appointed receiver he said hemosol is developing a different blood substitute hemoglobin the oxygen carrying component of whole blood is normally inside red blood cells but is toxic if released from those cells hemoglobin based blood substitutes generally release the hemoglobin from outdated donor blood or animal blood depending on the product then the substitute is chemically restructured so it can be stored for a year or more and will lose its toxicity but the hemoglobin based products so far have often been linked to cardiac or other possible toxicity even so the u s military wants to find a blood substitute for the battlefield blood cant be practically used on the battlefield because of factors that include its short shelf life and the need to match blood types before infusion so the main resuscitative fluid generally given by military medics is saline solution saline raises blood volume and pressure but cant carry oxygen to vital organs admiral john mateczun the u s navys deputy surgeon general testified before the fda advisory committee on biopure that "as many as " of the u s military deaths in iraq have stemmed in part from severe bleeding "some would not have died if they could have received an oxygen carrying substitute to sustain them immediately during evacuation and until they could receive blood transfusions " he testified northfields earlier research raised red flags too a study of its product in aneurysm surgery patients found that of polyheme patients had heart attacks compared with none of patients who got standard treatment including donor blood northfields dr gould said it is possible these results werent because of polyheme johns hopkins vascular anesthesiologist edward norris who participated in that surgery study said "if the fda had that information it makes you wonder how they could have allowed northfield to go ahead with the trauma trial " fda officials said they accepted northfields explanation that excessive fluids infused in that research and not polyheme may have been responsible for the heart attacks the fda in a written statement said earlier northfield research including that on animals persuaded the agency to allow northfield to proceed with the recent trauma study
