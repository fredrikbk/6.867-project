business technology peer to peer goes corporate gm looks for savings in technology at heart of file sharing craze when general motors corp extended its in house video service to car dealers and sales staff in latin america in november it took an unorthodox step it turned to peer to peer technology peer to peer technology heavily criticized by some for helping illegal music downloading through services like the original napster and kazaa is coming in from the cold companies such as gm coca cola co and videogame publisher tulga games inc are now using the technology to transmit large chunks of data like video files or software updates to employees and customers the technology also known as pp typically offers an inexpensive answer to the galloping demands that distribution of video software and internet telephony are placing on corporate computer networks instead of downloading a file from a centralized server peer to peer technology arranges direct connections between pcs thereby creating a network where files are distributed from one pc to another in the network peer to peer services continue to be used to download music and other content without regard for copyright issues but numerous peer to peer providers have ceased operation or settled copyright infringement suits and some such as bittorrent inc verisign inc s kontiki service and axt holdings inc s solid state networks have now begun to recast their services as a viable option for businesses the technology is a "phenomenally good solution from a management and cost perspective " says andrew schroepfer an industry analyst with tier research "but the fact its associated with illegal downloads of copyrighted material has served as a deterrent to some businesses " gm saw an opportunity in using the technology lawfully instead of a costly expansion of its satellite network last year gm turned to pp to push videos of marketing messages and sales targets to employees overseas especially those in regions that have limited internet capacity pp provided a relatively cheap way to sidestep capacity issues says len marsico a gm communications director though he declined to detail the savings from implementing pp under the gm system the pp technology sits on gms servers and directs gm pcs that have already received the video file to send chunks of it to other pcs on the network traditional online video distribution would have required a file to be sent to each employees computer which would significantly increase traffic on a network given the large size of many video files mr marsico says gm now uses the pp technology daily to "deliver a five minute broadcast to our plants offices and dealers" in latin america he adds that pps "bad rap" wasnt a concern because of the cost savings and how it helped ease network capacity coke also implemented a pp communication service last year until recently the service was restricted to delivering companywide messages from senior executives but engineers have since added a "narrowcasting" function to the service the new feature lets coke decide on the size of a video audience allowing it more flexibility to send video messages between small business units or for all employees says adam brown cokes director of digital communications "we get such tremendous value out of the service " says mr brown cokes pp service is provided by verisigns kontiki business which mr brown says "is reputable so there was no thought to pps bad rep " pp originated in the late s when it became associated with file sharing services such as napster kazaa and edonkey in that industry took a hit when the supreme court ruled that grokster a popular pp network for music could be held responsible for copyright infringement committed by its users the legal firestorm pushed other companies that offer pp to institute safeguards to deter distribution of illegal content and to begin distancing themselves from potential misuse of pp technology for example solid state networks a tempe ariz company founded in decided to limit access of its technology to just receiving files instead of uploading them "i tell my clients we dont run a file sharing network " says rick buonincotri chief executive of solid state meanwhile bittorrent another pp service recently began to market its technology to business customers and plans to launch a file distribution service for businesses by mid year bittorrent known as a service where consumers can download movies is also trying to enhance its image by signing several deals with major film studios over the past year to get permission to download their content companies that turn to pp may discover some drawbacks to the technology highly secure web sites are necessary to protect corporate networks against viruses that can easily spread from one peer computer to another cautions mr schroepfer the tier analyst but more companies are finding pp to be a workable cost saver for their businesses tulga games which makes a massive multiplayer online game called "horizons " had been using its own servers to distribute the game to users but as more consumers began playing horizons tulga turned to pp technology last march "we needed to solve the download problem " says rick simmons ceo of the tempe ariz firm he notes that updates to the online game are issued as often as twice a month so pp helps distribute the new software efficiently
