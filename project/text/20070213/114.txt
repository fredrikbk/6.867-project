the evening wrap kim cuts a deal online edition americans awoke today to the welcome news that north korea had agreed to begin dismantling its nuclear program in exchange for one million tons of oil but making sure pyongyang stays true to its word could be a challenge ever since president bush included the regime alongside saddam hussein led iraq and iran in the "axis of evil " north korea has been doing everything in its power to live up to that malevolent billing roughly a year and a half after mr bushs speech north korea bucked the clinton era agreed framework when the u s agreed to provide the north with light water reactors and fuel oil and informed the rest of the world that it had become a nuclear power then just a few months ago the regime tested out a nuclear device though apparently to rather unsatisfactory results in the meantime the six nation talks bringing together north korea south korea the u s russia japan and china lurched on with very few hints of progress that is until today when u s assistant secretary of state christopher hill emerged from the latest round of talks in beijing to inform his sleeping countrymen that at long last there was a deal the white house hailed the breakthrough the president said the talks "reflect the common commitment of the participants to a korean peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons " but almost as soon as word of the agreement emerged so did static north korea said through its official news agency that it was receiving the oil for a "temporary suspension" of its nuclear doings there was not a whisper of any ultimate promise to disarm whether that was just more of the usual bluster dictator kim jong il offers for the benefit of his downtrodden domestic audience or real backsliding by his regime wasnt clear the history isnt encouraging north korea had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table for the six party talks and it has never been a gracious host to past teams of weapons inspectors mr hill counseled patience "we dont want anyone to think that these initial actions were ends in themselves " he said but some were none too pleased with the idea of sitting around waiting for the north to throw its next temper tantrum while sending fuel back the other way detractors included john bolton the former u s ambassador to the united nations who played a key role in putting economic restrictions on pyongyang after its nuclear test and who pushed hard for tough measures against iran in response to its nuclear ambitions he said the deal sends "exactly the wrong signal to would be proliferators around the world if we hold out long enough wear down the state department negotiators eventually you get rewarded in this case with massive shipments of heavy fuel oil for doing only partially what needs to be done " alcoa rumor rallies blue chips reports from london that mining giants bhp billiton and rio tinto are in hot pursuit of aluminum heavyweight alcoa or alcan helped
