in chinas offices foreign colleagues might get an earful hong kong i was riding the elevator a few weeks ago with a chinese colleague here in the journals asian headquarters i smiled and said "hi " she responded "youve gained weight " i might have been appalled but at least three other chinese co workers also have told me im fat i probably should cut back on the pork dumplings in china such an intimate observation from a colleague isnt necessarily an insult its probably just friendliness theres a lot that goes on in chinese workplaces that mystifies and occasionally embarrasses the expatriates pouring into china chinese people draw the lines between personal and work space differently from americans beyond weight and body shape office small talk here often includes the size of your apartment and your salary sometimes my chinese colleagues nap at their desks during lunch some chinese office characteristics came about because corporations here embrace the idea of company as surrogate family many offices have a "tea lady " who spends all day making tea and heating lunches kind of an office nanny for lunar new year starting feb this year bosses give employees red envelopes filled with money as family elders do and host a banquet complete with games prizes and karaoke shoe habits suggest that chinese women feel more at home in the office many female american executives commute to work in sneakers and put on professional shoes in the office chinese women are likely to do the opposite slipping out of the manolo blahniks they wore to get to work and into slippers at their cubicles when american lawyer jennifer gallo moved to beijing a few months ago she had to go from her own office in san francisco "my little haven " she called it into a shared room with another lawyer after one day of polite silence in the new office ms gallos chinese office mate cried out "jennifer gallo you are incorrigible " her co workers problem too much quiet "my chinese colleagues seem to thrive on noise and community " says ms gallo shes surrounded she says by loud phone talk buzzing gadgets and a "concert of ring tones " her office mates phone blasts "work it" by missy elliott but the lack of personal space goes beyond noise she says "it goes to the very heart of this american idea that certain things are better left unsaid " in recent months ms gallo has been given assessments of her wardrobe "very nice could be european" muscle tone "flabby " a translation settled on after consultation with a group of english speakers and childbearing prospects "certain to have many boys" of course theres plenty about american office culture that confuses chinese employees who join u s companies out here theyre baffled by "brown bag lunch" conferences during which junior staffers rudely chomp while somebody senior is giving a talk its rude because it mixes a social event with an official one "chinese law firms would not have this kind of lunch " says qian wei who works at an american law firm in beijing "maybe we would go outside to a really good restaurant to drink and chat for a while but in the u s people pay much more attention to efficiency " also chinese offices tend to be hierarchical and employees wouldnt think of calling their boss by his or her first name so while there are often close relationships between chinese co workers american managers efforts to seem egalitarian can backfire justine lee who works for an american manufacturer in hong kong says her boss caused havoc with an annual ritual of meeting with all his employees individually "people tried to work out their smartest question a month in advance it became a big project for the chinese staff every year " she says after a couple years her boss dropped the idea most of the time she adds chinese people do their best to avoid bumping into their american colleagues "the chinese staff dont know how to hold small talk with americans " she says direct translations of chinese chatter can come across as confusing or intrusive in english one of the most common is "have you eaten " which is less of an invitation to lunch and more of a "how are you " food is a particularly useful social lubricant in many offices the most popular foreigner is the one who likes eating local delicacies such as pigs blood and chicken feet learning to navigate chinese office culture is essential to ensuring you dont end up with a terrible nickname many chinese office workers create nicknames for foreign colleagues whats mine my office manager refuses to say ms gallo says that she and her office mate have become friends when they work late they sing the carpenters"close to you" together to make it fun at the christmas party they performed a choreographed routine to abbas "dancing queen " and when her office mate went on vacation recently ms gallo says she missed even the "work it" ringtone so how should a foreigner respond when hes told hes fat my stock response is "theres so much good food here " send email to geoffrey fowler wsj com
