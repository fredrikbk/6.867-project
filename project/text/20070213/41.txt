enterprise firms jump on trend to broaden use of safety gear new products are sleek and serve a purpose beyond emergencies not long after hurricane katrina hit two entrepreneurs from encinitas calif smelled opportunity as government officials and the media harped about the need for emergency preparedness the pair canvassed the marketplace and found most consumer survival gear to be hardcore doom and gloom products such as face masks for anthrax water filtration systems or bulky first aid kits with limited use such items typically were sold online or in specialty outdoor stores many mainstream retailers were short on disaster gear in part because stores were reluctant to devote precious shelf space year round to items that might sell only during or immediately after an emergency so the two men dennis bertken and nicholas connor began producing a line of moderately priced sleek looking safety products they hoped consumers might also use in nonemergencies among them a small hand cranked led flashlight with siren and fm radio that also can charge a cellphone &# a lantern that plays an ipod &# and a backpack that is filled with survival gear &# including food and water rations approved by the u s coast guard for emergencies "we understand one key point to save lives we must integrate safety into everyday life " mr bertken says "this means that every product we design must be usable every day for everyday purposes not just in an emergency " today their small enterprise pacific pathway llc has products selling under two brands life+gear and safetycross on the shelves of major retailers including wal mart stores inc dillards inc costco wholesale corp and sears holdings corp s sears roebuck and kmart stores the products also are sold online including the firms web site www lifegearcompany com sales last year totaled &# million and are expected to climb to &# million in pacific pathways fast entry to mass market a feat that can take small businesses years if ever to achieve says much about the potential of using new design packaging and branding to shake up a dormant market it also shows how a small company can compete with larger players if it is quick to hop on a burgeoning trend indeed the new safety chic strategy is playing out across retail home depot inc this fall will launch a homehero line of safety products which features among other things a white fire extinguisher resembling a coffee thermos that needs only one hand to operate last christmas black &amp decker corp pushed its new simple start car battery booster which requires no jumper cables and plugs into a vehicles cigarette lighter it also can charge a cellphone target corp has partnered with the red cross to sell a &# first aid emergency preparedness starter kit complete with childrens activity book and crayons that is stylish enough to sit on a living room bookshelf "people just havent thought about redesigning these categories " says peter arnell founder of the design and marketing firm arnell group a division of omnicom group inc which helped craft the home depot homehero line "in the old days you had a clunky old red fire extinguisher and you were going to hide it that doesnt work anymore the world has changed " pacific pathways founders leaned heavily on design and packaging to entice big retail buyers to give their wares most produced in china a shot one key move spending to cents more an item for "try me" packaging that let the crank handles of items stick out enabling consumers to test products without waiting for a sales clerk to bring out a demo the "wings of life" backpack with tarp survival blanket and other items has detachable wings that fold out to make a retail display eliminating the need for extra shelf space for marketing material "this is the key to sell the products " says steve carpenter corporate gift buyer for dillards department stores "we need a product that will virtually sell itself " after katrina mr carpenter says dillards was looking for preparedness products for things like hurricanes tornados floods and car accidents but found it to be a tricky category "no one wants to bank on catastrophes " he says "but if theres not a catastrophe then it does affect sales in a negative fashion " because life+gear products had what mr carpenter believed was an all around appeal for more people than just those affected by hurricanes he decided to add them to his stores mix in the mens gift department dillards now sells four life+gear items including the in personal safety device with cellphone charger alongside nonemergency gear like ipod stereos wallets and shave kits pacific pathway also is pushing functionality "what we did was make the backpack designed to be used every day to carry books or go on a trip " mr bertken says "but what happens is that this backpack with other stuff in it can save your life this approach became really appealing to retailers " using high design and ease of use to jump start the emergency preparedness category is a critical part of the sales strategy for most of the players not just pacific pathway in the case of the black &amp deckers simple start car battery charger for instance the ability to recharge without having to flag down a stranger or ever open the hood of a car much less get out of the car is designed to attract more female buyers to a predominately male category early on pacific pathway attempted to ward off a potential sales hurdle among higher end retailers who sometimes balk at selling the same wares as discounters so company created two distinct brands for its products life+gear for the higher end stores and safetycross for the middle market and big box chains that strategy has shifted as retailers are increasingly carrying both brands now the company will increasingly push life+gear to become a lifestyle brand similar to brookstone or sharper image while safetycross will segue into more hard core safety products including bandages gauze and first aid kits aimed at the medical industry offices and schools as well as consumers in expanding the lifestyle aspect of life+gear the company says it will strive to incorporate safety more into everyday items this year for instance it will introduce items including alarm clocks that automatically turn on when an emergency alert broadcasts for an earthquake fire or flood there also will be consumer tote bags that can be submerged in water pacific pathway says it will frequently rotate its product offerings to retailers a move that will let stores better control inventory by ordering smaller quantities at a time and give consumers new reasons to shop "they have clearly recognized an absence in the market and thats the fundamental proposition " says dale k cohen founder of dkc resources a new york marketing strategy and growth catalyst firm "fear is an emotion and whenever you tap into the emotional component of something in selling you have a very strong resonant angle
