health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q are the benefits of exercise the same if you do all your exercise at the same time or spread it out over the week for example is it the same to run three times a week four miles each time versus running one time a week for miles mathematically speaking shouldnt the two be equivalent j c a in theory the answer to your question is yes if your three times a week runner clocks a nine minute mile hell burn about calories each of the three days he runs for a total of calories of exercise during the week if he runs all miles at the same nine minute pace that minutes of exercise will also burn calories but in real life chances are the calorie expenditure from exercise is going to be slightly different in the two scenarios it all depends on what kind of condition the runner is in if he isnt used to running miles at a time his body will be less efficient and might actually burn more calories while a well conditioned athlete who is used to that level of exercise might burn slightly fewer calories the difference isnt particularly meaningful to overall health and anyone who can run four miles three times a week or miles all at once is in good enough shape that he doesnt really need to worry about his caloric expenditure in terms of wear and tear on the body for most people it probably makes more sense to run the shorter distances three times a week and given the fact that exercise boosts your mood and reduces stress shorter regular runs is a better bet for most people in terms of cardiovascular health research shows that it doesnt really matter if you get your exercise in several small spurts or all at once the surgeon generals recommendation on exercise is to get enough exercise to expend or more calories a week that is typically interpreted as minutes of moderately intense physical activity three or four days a week but most experts say it doesnt matter if it takes you one day three days or seven days to expend those calories for a person weighing about pounds calories of exercise is the equivalent of jogging for minutes three days a week or playing a minute tennis match on the weekend proof that one day a week of exercise makes a difference to health came from a swedish study of men over the age of the men who exercised only once a week were less likely to die during the year study period than those who did nothing at all more information on how many calories are burned through various types of exercise can be found online at www caloriecontrol org exercalc html email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
