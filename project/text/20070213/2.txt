an early kahn gem restored new haven when the yale university art gallery reopened in december the university had spent three years and &# million restoring the structure twice as long and four times as much in adjusted dollars than it had spent building it in the first place some years before but in its designer louis kahn was not yet one of the centurys most venerated architects the building was his first major commission and a financially strapped postwar yale wanted a flexible utilitarian structure on a tight budget kahn responded with a building whose spare and haunting vocabulary of elements the signature tetrahedral ceiling the brooding concrete cylindrical stair tower sheltering the crisp metallic triangular stair the perfectly proportioned glass and steel curtain wall the innovative movable wall system adeptly cracked the core issues confronting mid century architecture in a manner that seems simultaneously idiosyncratic and definitive the design transcended modernisms bauhaus roots through technical inventiveness the dramatic use of industrial materials and an aesthetic sensibility that extends from archaic to modern all held in eerie equilibrium by the classical laws of order and proportion the design met another related challenge of mid century design a sort of unified expression of everything theory wherein the buildings technical systems structural mechanical and electrical and its ordinary construction materials would all be made visible and finally resolved in a sculpturally expressive triumphant whole kahns gallery was the first of an extraordinary adventurous collection of mid century modern buildings commissioned by yale the last being another gallery by kahn the mellon center for british art his final magisterial project completed posthumously in and located right across the street from his first when modernism was daringly new there was little sense that these buildings would ever grow old that their uses would change or that their technologies would need to be upgraded some years later these mid century masterpieces "arent kids anymore " as robert a m stern dean of the yale school of architecture has noted presenting yale with a curatorial responsibility fraught with unusual difficulties the eras technical progressivism which embraced the exciting but unperfected new postwar technologies resulted in systems that have failed over the years and the unified expression of everything once so exciting is inherently unadaptable because there is no place to hide anything how does the restorer insert newer improved technologies without changing the architectural expression whats the proper way to patch a cinder block where does one hide a few more necessary ducts or a new entry for the disabled in their restoration of kahns gallery yale and the architectural firm of james stewart polshek have answered such questions with extraordinary sensitivity leading the charge for yale has been jock reynolds the charismatic director of the gallery who sees the building as the premier artwork in its own collection and for polshek duncan hazard a yalie who aimed for a restoration so subtle that a viewer would wonder what had been done but as mr hazard says the building was never so pure as it is now since originally it was designed to house functions ranging from the display of art to studio spaces for architecture and design soon after kahns gallery first opened a new director covered the cinder block walls and replaced kahns movable wall system with fixed floor to ceiling partitions gradually walls proliferated obscuring the cylindrical stair and the loft like space spanned by the tetrahedral ceiling the curtain wall one of the first of its kind suffered from condensation that caused the frames to rust and the double paned windows to fog thus the building languished a compromised and largely hidden beauty until when yale hired polshek to perform a technical survey of kahns gallery the firm concluded that the buildings problems were severe enough to require a thorough overhaul proceeding like artists restoring a renaissance painting messrs reynolds and hazard have been careful not to restore the gallery too perfectly and erase the evidence of times passage thus the color of the mortar they chose to patch the cinder blocks is visible but not distracting they repaired but did not replace the terrazzo border and they removed the paint and wax from the ceiling without making it seem brand new taking such extraordinary pains to restore common industrial materials is an ironic aspect of mid century restorations moving mr reynolds to remark on a building tour last summer "a surprising amount of work went into making the ceiling look like old rough concrete " the toughest challenges were the technical ones particularly the replacement of the curtain wall which mr hazard describes as a nearly insolvable equation the new window frames needed thermal breaks to prevent the condensation that occurs in the relatively humid climate of a modern museum necessitating an aluminum system inherently bulkier than the original steel making matters worse the wall had to meet new requirements to resist wind loads and allow for thermal expansion all while looking the same as the original the solution was highly technical but part of it lay in making the frames nearly identical when viewed head on but actually deeper and stronger when viewed perpendicularly almost as difficult were the adjustments to the buildings innovative mechanical and lighting systems the first track lighting system and one of the first central air conditioning systems which because of the construction sequence were trapped between the tetrahedral coffered ceiling and the concrete floor slab above to add extra lights unusually short track sections needed to be ordered that could be fitted painstakingly into the coffers new security smoke detector and emergency lighting systems requirements that post date the original construction had to be snaked visibly but harmoniously through the coffers and since the original embedded ductwork would have been next to impossible to remove and replace the designers had to find a way to accommodate the enlarged air handling system entirely in the area outside of the coffers mr hazard describes the satisfaction of seeing the building once the detritus was stripped away revealing for the first time in decades its "symphony of proportions" created out of seemingly banal materials carefully calibrated in scale the cinder blocks turn out to be half the size of standard ones the bricks are unusually long the oak floorboards are tiny and there is a quick rhythm of the planks used to form the stair cylinder all this delicacy contrasting with the vast sweep of the curtain wall and open loft like space articulated with the intermediate scale of the coffers this epiphany is now available to the visitor since mr reynolds has choreographed the art in the entry sequence to showcase the museum itself set off by a perfectly scaled and perfectly placed installation by sol lewitt polshek is now renovating two adjacent former galleries due to be completed in the three interconnected buildings will stretch across more than a block allowing yale to unveil another long hidden treasure its extensive art collection which mr reynolds compares to the metropolitan in its breadth for now a healthy taste is on view including a group sculpture show selected by students from the museums holdings and a new permanent gallery of african art with a highly impressive inaugural display best of all the galleries are open to the public and free a true delight in this era of the &# museum admission fee ms kerr
