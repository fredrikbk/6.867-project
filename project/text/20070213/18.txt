blind pedestrians say quiet hybrids pose safety threat for blind people crossing the street is becoming even more of a challenge michael osborn a blind marketing consultant from laguna beach calif and his guide dog hastings were in the middle of an intersection one morning last april when the yellow lab stopped short mr osborn took the cue and halted just in time to feel the breeze from a car passing right in front of them "half an inch and it would have hit us it wasnt making any noise " says mr osborn who has been blind for years witnesses say the car was a toyota prius a hybrid vehicle hybrids deliver better mileage and less pollution than traditional cars by switching between a gasoline engine and an electric motor but when operating on the electric battery especially when idling at a stop or running at low speeds the engine in a hybrid is almost silent a hybrid vehicle is generally quieter than a vacuum cleaner "im an environmentalist and im all for quiet cars " says mr osborn "but it poses a particular problem for somebody who has no vision " blind pedestrians using a guide dog or cane are largely dependent on the sounds of traffic to cross streets safely for a blind person "its very important to be able to gather auditory and tactile cues from the environment " says sumara shakeel of toms river n j who is a rehabilitation teacher for the new jersey commission for the blind hybrid cars became commercially available to mainstream consumers in and are gaining in popularity nationwide registrations for new hybrids more than doubled to in from in according to r l polk &amp co an automotive research firm at least a dozen states and several cities are encouraging drivers to buy fuel efficient hybrids by offering tax breaks and other incentives and the vehicles are being added to municipal fleets still the total hybrids on the road reflect just over of all new vehicle registrations in the u s the national federation of the blind an advocacy group says all hybrid vehicles should emit a sound while turned on and is calling on the auto industry to make changes the group says the sound should be loud enough to be heard over the din of other ambient noise members of the nfbs committee on automobile and pedestrian safety have discussed sound cues that hybrids could use to alert pedestrians including a device built into the axle that could make a sound as the wheels rotate or a sensor that blind travelers could carry that would indicate when a hybrid is in the vicinity the committee has yet to have a formal meeting with auto industry representatives quiet cars pose a problem for not only those with limited vision says the nfbs debbie stein but also for sighted pedestrians cyclists and the elderly who rely on sound to gauge the position and speed of cars while there are no national data on pedestrian injuries or deaths related to low noise cars the nfb argues that a link will be more discernible as quiet vehicles become more common police reports often dont record what kind of automobile caused a pedestrian vehicle collision and the insurance industry says it doesnt have those figures in pedestrians were killed nationwide according to the national highway traffic safety administration an increase of about since "we want to get ahead of this and not have to wait until five blind people end up seriously hurt or dead " says gary wunder who is on the nfbs committee on automobile and pedestrian safety some businesses are taking action several guide dog schools are planning to use hybrid vehicles when training animals to acclimate them guide dogs for the blind inc with campuses in oregon and california uses electric golf carts to simulate the quiet cars so far advocacy groups pleas for louder hybrids have failed to generate much noise in automotive circles a spokesman for the alliance of automotive manufacturers an industry group says he wasnt aware of the issue "were interested in hearing about the concerns of the blind community and well work with them to ensure that theyre addressed " says alliance spokesman charles territo sev macpete founder of the toyota prius club of san diego dismisses the idea that hybrids pose a safety threat he says blind pedestrians are easy to spot because they usually have a special white cane with red tip "and if you could say anything about hybrid drivers they are more aware of their surroundings than other drivers " mr macpete says toyota spokesman bill kwong says he wasnt aware of the issue and believes that the responsibility lies with drivers and pedestrians to watch out for each other mr kwong adds "one of the benefits of the vehicles is that they dont contribute to traffic noise "
