north korea deal could boost bushs beleaguered foreign policy win on nuclear program turns the focus to iran misgivings on the right north koreas apparent decision to accept a breakthrough aid for disarmament deal would boost u s efforts to rein in the spread of nuclear weapons and provide a victory for the bush administrations battered foreign policy team after a bargaining session that went well past midnight delegates from north korea its four neighbors and the u s signed off on the final text of a plan to end pyongyangs nuclear weapons program in return for financial and energy assistance worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually the delegates sent the text to their respective capitals for approval by their leaders and planned to meet again early today to formally approve it there is still a chance leaders in pyongyang wont like the deal and could block its acceptance christopher hill the u s envoy to the talks told reporters the final text is "an excellent excellent draft " senior u s officials in washington said the administration has signed off on the deal and is simply waiting to hear from north korea the other participants in the talks china japan russia and south korea are also likely to approve it a deal to rein in north koreas nuclear program would give president bush a rare foreign policy success at a time when he is embroiled in a bitter debate over the war in iraq and tensions with iran it would also mark a triumph for secretary of state condoleezza rice who had to beat back skeptics within the pentagon and vice president cheneys office who opposed any deal that could in any way strengthen the current north korean regime but the proposed deal also exposes the administration to accusations from both conservatives and democrats that mr bush has returned to a clinton era arrangement with north korea known as the agreed framework that he had disparaged and cast aside soon after taking office in some say this refusal to bargain wasted time during which pyongyang was able to expand its arsenal while hawks warn the north will renege on the deal critics of current u s foreign policy are sure to draw parallels between north korea and iran and argue the administration should now move to open direct talks with tehran over its nuclear program the u s and others claim irans goal is nuclear weapons while the iranians insist they seek nuclear technology only to produce energy for civilian purposes the u s and north korea hammered out key parts of the pact in a two way meeting last month in berlin but the deal nearly collapsed during the formal six party negotiations that began on thursday the trouble in arriving at the deal is emblematic of the challenges that are sure to lie ahead from the start of the six party talks in august north korean delegates showed little willingness to compromise wary of any action that might threaten dictator kim jong il or erode his power over the country north korean envoy kim kye gwan hasnt spoken to reporters during the talks but just before the latest round started mr kim expressed a new desire to reach a deal though he didnt specify why some analysts suggested that after testing its first nuclear device in october north korea calculated it could negotiate its best deal but had otherwise run out of cards to play diplomats involved in the latest talks say the new deal is different from president clintons agreement because it requires north korea to dismantle its only nuclear plant a small facility in the city of yongbyon and allow outside experts to monitor the process the country closed the plant as part of the deal but was able to reopen it in the yongbyon complex includes a center to reprocess spent uranium fuel from the plant into weapons grade plutonium analysts estimate north korea has enough plutonium to make about nuclear weapons ultimately state department officials say north korea would have to give up all of its nuclear material in addition the new deal provides a mechanism for the six countries to work on broader goals beyond denuclearization they include forging diplomatic relations between north korea and its former enemies japan and the u s and crafting a peace treaty that formally ends the korean war of the s u s officials say the agreement would reward north korea in phases for making certain moves with energy supplies accounting for most of the initial incentives the u s treasury department is also preparing to lift restrictions on north korean accounts at a macau bank thought to amount to millions of dollars the six countries plan to create five working groups to handle details one will concentrate on further steps for denuclearization one on setting up diplomatic relations one on the logistics of the energy and economic assistance and another to work on a korean war peace treaty the fifth group will handle special issues of conflict between north korea and japan particularly the fate of an estimated to people the north abducted from japan in recent decades "were trying to address some of the underlying problems in the region why there are tensions on the korean peninsula in the first place and some of the bilateral problems " mr hill told reporters in beijing "the agreement really offers a framework for proceeding with that "
