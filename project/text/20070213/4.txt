anna nicole smith breathless commentators these last few days have likened anna nicole smith whose untimely death like her much observed physique was not the result of entirely natural causes to marilyn monroe this comparison is preposterous arthur miller who married monroe would have had little time for ms smith beyond the obvious dictates of chivalry it would be hard to imagine ms smith courted by contemporary playwrights either and not just because so many of them do not as it were handle women well playwrights notwithstanding ms smith was the object of a fierce popular fascination it could be said and said not entirely as metaphor that anna nicole smith embodied america she embodied its bounty as well as its overabundance its exploitability and its propensity to exploit she embodied also its litigiousness its enterprise its universal offer of the chance to remake oneself gatsby did it one way anna nicole smith did it another and to many foreigners particularly foreign men she embodied america in a literal way too in a brassy blondeness that people in repressed cultures marvel at it is no coincidence that the places in the world where women such as ms smith are the most popular are typically those with which the u s has the worst diplomatic relations for all her gaudy excesses there is in some of us or there ought to be the urge to treat ms smith gently hers is a pathetic story of ersatz celebrity dead children and the pursuit of money sex drugs weight loss and validation through litigation that this pursuit was so thoroughly unembarrassed is a comment not so much on ms smiths personal aesthetics as it is on human folly u s style taken to its logical extreme a girl boosted almost to the point of malformation married a wheezing aged wheelchair bound texas billionaire one can visualize his clawlike fingers laying claim to her torso some have condemned her as a "gold digger " but she wanted what you are supposed to want money and she worked industriously with what she had and one must note that in america where most adult relations have been recast as transactions breast enhancement is the perfect meeting of commerce and sex a means to lay bare the frankness of your opening gambit and to make plain that it invites a response what you see is what you get now let me see how you propose to get it we watched ms smith take off as if from nowhere then crash land in our midst and then self combust all through a process of theater designed to give us a perfect view of the repellence in others while sparing us from taint or complicity the scale of the celebrity meltdown in the u s is phenomenal supersized as it were and ms smiths was no different everything in america is larger than life and alas despite americas best efforts smaller than death but without the camera she might only have caused forgettable if scandalous damage in a small town and crumbled inconsequentially into the smallness of her natural milieu in fact ms smith turned us all into inhabitants of that small town the american blonde who burst her bounds expanding her conduct along a vector with no known or safe landing strip one of those women who instantly turned us all men and women into voyeurs if only to see where her story could possibly end she was a permanent invocation of the question "what happens to a woman who " in american culture the arc of some lives still promises something uncharted just as the country itself offered that promise at its inception it is possible that in private ms smiths life held its own sad end in view she must have known her own trajectory even as she shrank from its darker motions but in her media incarnation her outsize smile and busty brightness suggested always that shed burst out of the frame and create an entirely new possibility a new plane where such creatures as she triumph or laugh afresh all the way to the bank finally a critical word anna nicole smith was also a lowbrow or really a narcissistic version of the american dream the american dream of only bravado and guile bereft of character or principles or talent she was proof that the dream applies even to people with nothing to offer but themselves if she is a tragic and cautionary tale to americans evidence that the american dream requires substance and character she may be evidence of the opposite to outsiders who see only the magic of wealth and fame won through the mere presentation of self she inflates the reputation of american possibility abroad making it seem like anything is possible in america even reward without merit mr varadarajan is the editorial features editor of the wall street journal see related letter "letters to the editor our shabby culture" wsj february
