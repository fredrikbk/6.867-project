credit history jitters hit derivatives two camps place high stakes bets on risky mortgages mortgage lenders arent the only ones losing sleep over loans to home buyers with shaky credit histories a corner of the derivatives market is caught in a high stakes game that places two powerful camps on opposing ends of the table on one side are mostly hedge funds and banks betting on the deteriorating creditworthiness of subprime mortgages by buying credit protection through derivatives such as the abx index or individual credit default swaps based on loan deals on the other side are the sellers of protection mostly managers of collateralized debt obligations or cdos who are counting on these riskier loans staying afloat the bets of hedge funds and banks will pay off as long as the credit quality of subprime mortgages plummets further while cdos are in the clear as long as there are no actual defaults "it all boils down to risk " said matt meehan portfolio manager at eos credit opportunities fund a new york hedge fund with &# billion assets under management which has benefited from the recent moves in asset backed derivatives by buying protection while investing in asset backed derivatives isnt new the stakes are getting higher as a steady stream of negative news around these riskier investments is hammering this small corner of the credit markets the rising inability of subprime mortgage borrowers to meet their payments amid higher interest rates has caused sharp spikes in the abx index the derivative index tracking subprime mortgages as well as individual asset backed derivatives linked to specific loan deals thats because the cost of protecting these asset backed securities against a possible default increases leading to wider trading levels on the index betting that the nervousness around the creditworthiness of these loans will escalate even further investors particularly hedge funds are buying protection on these subprime mortgages hoping they will turn a profit as widening risk premiums increase the cost of protection some investors including mr meehan at eos are buying protection on loans that are most at risk of defaulting those loans originated at the peak of the housing mania in late and early when liberal lending standards and looser restrictions prevailed eos believes the cost of protection on these loans that required few or no documents or the ones made in areas worst hit by the housing slump will rise the most and therefore provide the maximum gains the abx index which was created about a year ago includes five subindexes ranging from the highest aaa slice to the lowest and riskiest bbb minus slice the bbb minus slice based on loans made in the first half of was trading at percentage points about percentage points wider on the week in this instance for every &# million of protection on the index an investor bought at the start of the widening spree he could sell it and pocket the &# difference on the other side are the sellers of protection typically investors who are upbeat on the economy and the creditworthiness of consumers and companies take on credit risk while those with a more pessimistic view buy credit protection "ultimately the other side of the trade is generally cdos " said mr meehan cdos are structured finance products that pool different types of securities including default swaps of asset backed debt a cdo of asset backed default swaps takes on credit risk by selling protection against a potential default of an asset backed security in return it receives quarterly premium payments a portion of which are used to pay investors "you also have a lot of foreign investors in cdos who are only recently starting to become aware of the problems with subprime mortgages in the u s " said mr meehan "unfortunately we believe that much of what they own will prove to be problematic " that said cdos dont suffer unless there are actual defaults and the cdos have to make good on the losses of the buyers of protection widening risk premiums by themselves affect cdos to the extent that the rise in risk perception of these securities translates into higher cost of insurance on new contracts "the performance of cdos revolves around actual credit performance " said alex cigolle chief investment officer of strategos capital management the asset backed securities business of cohen &amp co in philadelphia cohen is a cdo manager with &# billion in assets under management "the widening of spreads in itself isnt very significant to us as a cdo manager if the assets dont actually default " said mr cigolle treasurys finish lower treasury prices ended modestly lower on hedging related to corporate debt issuance as well as anticipation of the congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke later in the week with &# billion to &# billion in corporate bonds expected to price in the next few days wall street dealers were likely selling
