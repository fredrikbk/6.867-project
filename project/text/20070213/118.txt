the game deal or no deal isnt a possibility when on defense least worst option is sometimes best play but a ceo wont say it by the samurai code of corporate deal making fessing up to weakness is the greatest dishonor imagine a chief executive who describes a deal as his companys "least worst option " hed be melted on the spot rendered into mush like one of the ark opening goons from raiders of the lost ark the reality is that executives often get grief for doing deals that turn sour even though their companies might have fared worse without doing a deal this is one of the most important and least discussed facets of the m&amp a game its especially relevant given some recent developments in the deal market consider the drubbing medical device maker boston scientific corp has taken for its &# billion acquisition of guidant corp last april fortune magazine dubbed it the second worst deal ever next only to that icon of regret aol time warner "grumpy" is how the boston scientifics ceo james tobin assessed investors mood in an interview last week mounting product safety worries have hit boston scientifics sales of artery opening stents very hard similar concerns have wrecked guidants main business of selling heart zapping defibrillators a decades old growth machine boston scientific last quarter had to endure the indignity of reporting a drop in sales its shares have lost cents on the dollar since the deal closed but what would boston scientifics future look like without guidant oddly it is only through the companys recent struggles that an answer begins to appear worse in mid the company relied on a special kind of stent called taxus for two of every five dollars it brought in rival johnson &amp johnson was eating away at boston scientifics commanding market share if boston scientific were still on its own its recent stent sale convulsion such sales fell by would have been far more critical with guidant in the fold these declines are easier to absorb because boston scientific is less concentrated on one product and the guidant addition presents boston scientific with another source of growth once the defibrillator market recovers which mr tobin says will happen faster than for stents concentration "leaves you very vulnerable " mr tobin said "we had one product line in one business that was to of our sales it gave us a risk profile that was unacceptable " investors had caught on to the risk before the guidant deal pushing the shares down nearly half from mid to the end of mr tobin said he has used the "least worst option" phrase at various times in his career but in private investors dont seem to understand it "the market cannot deal with hypotheticals like that " he said "they look at earnings " the nasdaqs failed run at the london stock exchange is another example of the least worst option in play nasdaq stock market ceo bob greifeld loaded his company up with debt to pursue a deal with a rival that wasnt interested why the rest of the industry is consolidating without a bigger base of its own nasdaq could end up a pipsqueak that cant compete the ceos are a part of something that is of growing fascination to psychologists economists and the occasional science fiction author the tweedy types use a term called "downward counterfactuals " which describes when one believes his current fate is better than some other path he could have taken and managed to avoid it turns out people just arent programmed that way thats especially true when it comes to investing in the excellent book "the paradox of choice " author barry schwartz brings up the proverbial silver medalist instead of being happy she avoided missteps that would have earned a bronze she is likely to regret the flubs that kept her from winning the gold research shows that people rarely focus on the problems theyve managed to avoid unless specifically asked to do so mr schwartz writes the problem is that its difficult to benchmark ones life or ones least favorite m&amp a deal against something thats inherently immeasurable a path that wasnt chosen but wait economists are starting to do just that in a new study by a young professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school pavel savor develops a crude but intriguing method for assessing those unchosen paths he slogged through thousands of mergers between and sifting for deals that fell apart before closing because of regulatory disapproval competing offers and others reasons the group of transactions he came up with represented in essence an alternate m&amp a reality isolating companies intent to do deals but failing to follow through "my paper is all about disentangling what would have happened anyway " he said dr savor found that for stock only deals companies that failed to complete transactions were punished by investors three years after their deals died the acquiring companies outperformed the nonacquirers by a stark in the stock market as dr savor sees it the very act of wanting to do a deal is an important signal in the case of his research executives werent necessarily pursuing "least worst options " they were trying to use overpriced shares to buy other companies in stock deals before the market came to its senses thats another subject that executives dont dare broach that their shares might be overvalued its all part of the game investors might like to hear executives admit when deals were defensive compromises or efforts to cash in on soaring shares instead ceos fall into podium pabulum about economies of scale and synergy playing defense is exactly what boston scientific has done with guidant that doesnt make the deal cheap or necessarily lucrative it does give boston and its shareholders a chance to keep fighting and that helps us appreciate the realm of the least worst the game covers the world of deal making and wall street write to dennis berman wsj com inside investors heads boston scientific spends &# billion on guidant in april since then its stock has fallen heres how psychologists and economists might analyze investors psychological reactions an investor thinking about the "downward counterfactual" would appreciate how boston scientifics stock might have fared worse without guidant in the fold one employing an "upward counterfactual" would focus on all the errors boston scientific made in doing the deal and how performance could have been better
