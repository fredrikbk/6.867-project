cancer patients gain say in drug approvals fda and drug makers add reports from trial participants to traditional measures such as survival tumor shrinkage a cancer drugs effectiveness has long been measured in two important ways whether it shrinks a tumor and whether it extends patients lives but researchers and regulators are paying increasing attention to another criterion how a patient feels while taking the medicine in an important change cancer patients own assessments of how a drug is working called patient reported outcomes or pros are increasingly part of the drug approval process at the food and drug administration the agency says pros have been integral for the approval of a number of cancer drugs in recent years including amgen inc s kepivance for severe mucositis mouth sores that are a side effect of cancer treatment and axcan scandipharm inc s photofrin an agent used in treating precancerous lesions in barretts esophagus there have been calls by researchers to add pros to reports of drug toxicity that are used during clinical trials something traditionally reported only by clinicians there is even emerging evidence that for patients with advanced cancer a patients self report about how he is feeling is a better predictor of how long a patient will live than other standard clinical data traditionally patients quality of life or well being while on a drug has been a secondary consideration rated and reported by researchers but one recent study demonstrated that clinicians tend to underestimate subtle signs of problems that patients can pick up on earlier patients reporting numbness in the hands or feet a symptom caused by some anticancer drugs were able to detect the problem months before the clinician reports did the shift toward pros is important for cancer patients whose opinions now play a much more significant role in determining the success of a drug it is driven in part by the growing influence of the patient advocacy movement but it can also be valuable for drug companies which often invest huge sums of money in drugs that fail because they cant demonstrate that the drugs extend a patients life with the emerging role of pros drugs that dont necessarily extend life but make the patient feel and function better have a better chance of winning approval pros have long been an integral part of trials testing new drugs to treat conditions such as arthritis where patients are the most accurate source on whether a product relieves pain in cancer trials though whether a patient lives longer has long been the central measure by which a drug is judged however in recent years the reality began to sink in that there werent many new cancer drugs that dramatically extended peoples lives the fda increasingly began to acknowledge that giving someone a higher quality of life offered clinical benefits that could lead to an approval what drug companies and fda both realized is that "changes in tumor size do not always conform with improvement as perceived by the patient " says laurie burke director of study endpoints and label development in the office of new drugs at fda eli lilly &amp co has used pros in the regulatory process for its drug gemzar approved for pancreatic cancer in and ovarian cancer in in the approval of its alimta drug for lung cancer pro data were critical in showing that the new drug not only shrank tumors as effectively as the existing treatment but had fewer patient reported side effects "pros are now a standard part of our phase iii cancer drug trials " says astra lipa senior health outcomes scientist at lilly patient reported data are also becoming more important in determining which approved drugs oncologists will prescribe especially important given the high price of cancer drugs at a meeting of american society of clinical oncology in atlanta last year bayer pharmaceuticals corp and onyx pharmaceuticals inc made a point of presenting patient reported data on their new kidney cancer drug nexavar demonstrating the drug improved the way patients perceived their own health related quality of life in the case of nexavar the pros werent submitted for the fda approval process because the trial had early success and there wasnt time to evaluate those data the drug the first new kidney cancer treatment approved in a decade was shown to double the time before the disease got worse compared with a placebo last year the fda issued a set of guidelines as to how the agency will evaluate pros during drug approval the final version is expected to be issued in the coming months the guidelines emphasize that patient responses should be relevant measures of whatever is being tested and raised concerns about the credibility of the pros in cases when patients know they are getting an active drug because patient responses are subjective in a paper published in the journal of the national cancer institute a group of researchers associated with the radiation oncology therapy group studied whether short term radiation therapy was as effective in alleviating pain in patients with cancer that had spread to their bones as the standard course which was longer and involved higher doses by asking patients to rate how much pain they felt and how much pain medicine they needed doctors concluded that shorter and lower doses of radiation were just as effective deborah watkins bruner one of the authors of the study and a professor of nursing at the university of pennsylvania says the trial was a case study in the way pros "can provide evidence for important clinical changes " the trial also demonstrated some of the challenges of using patient information of the patients died or were too ill to fill out questionnaires after three months of therapy even of the patients who were able to provide the data only participated ms burke at the fda says the problem of "missing pro data cant be ignored " and is especially challenging in a disease like cancer where many of the patients on a trial are likely to die she said the agency was asking companies to start working with fda on finding ways to deal with this issue as early as phase i of drug trials when companies are still only testing a drug in small numbers of patients for safety issues patricia ganz the director of the division of cancer prevention and control in uclas cancer center says that all measures of how patients are faring have problems blood pressure readings can be different depending on who is taking them x ray results may be interpreted differently by various radiologists it isnt always easy to calculate exactly how much a tumor has grown using ct scans in her own research and clinical experience she says "physicians are very poor at predicting how long someone will live" using standard clinical information in a study she and her colleagues conducted of patients with advanced lung cancer she said that patient self reports of their quality of life were a more accurate predictor of survival outcome than physician or laboratory assessments of prognosis david cella executive director of the center on outcomes research and education at evanston northwestern healthcare in evanston ill says drug companies arent going to be able to stray too far from the issue of whether a drug has an impact on a tumor but dr cella who helped develop the questionnaire used by bayer and onyx in the nexavar trials says he noticed that patients and physicians often had different priorities in assessing a drug known as the functional assessment of cancer therapy kidney symptom index the questionnaire included questions chosen by both patients and clinicians in the final list of questions the top eight chosen by patients included whether they were able to work and whether they lacked energy questionnaire items chosen by clinicians and not ranked highly by patients included treatment side effects bone pain shortness of breath and coughs dr cellas group has created other patient questionnaires targeted to specific cancers at bayer which supplied a grant to help develop the new index kathleen gondek the head of global health economics and outcomes research at the company says that "traditional measures" are necessary in evaluating drug efficacy but she adds "what we have embraced is the understanding that how a patient feels and functions may be equally important " the experience of robert eppinger demonstrates how important quality of life can be to patients he enrolled in the nexavar trial in for advanced kidney cancer on the drug his tumors have either shrunk or held stable and although mr eppinger a retired office furniture developer in stamford conn said he would prefer a "cure " he still feels well enough to continue activities such as going to the theater "to find out that i could maintain a relatively normal life began to make me feel a lot better " says mr eppinger from the trenches how patient reports have helped in assessing a drugs usefulness with amgens kepivance for mouth sores patients reported the pain of the condition before doctors even saw the sores demonstrating a need in one recent study patients reported numbness in the hands or feet a side effect of some cancer drugs months before clinician reports did eli lilly says patient reports showed that its cancer drug alimta had fewer patient reported side effects than the existing treatment differing views in creating a questionnaire to measure how kidney cancer patients felt during treatment patients and clinicians listed the issues they saw as most important patients i am able to enjoy my life i worry that my condition will get worse i feel fatigued i have a lack of energy fatigue i am able to work includes work at home i have pain providers i am losing weight i have a lack of energy fatigue i am bothered by side effects of treatment i have pain i am bothered by fevers i have a good appetite source cella et al journal of supportive oncology april
