in race to take tourists into orbit partners split spar bragging rights divided spaceshipone creators virgins &# million bet when the suborbital craft spaceshipone first lifted off from the mojave desert in june of it ignited lofty dreams of space travel for tourists now its fueling a feud between its two creators partners burt rutan a famous aerospace designer and jim benson an entrepreneur envisioned that passengers would pay &# for the ultimate joy ride a roughly two hourlong flight reaching miles per hour and more than miles above the earth but after sparring over who deserves credit for various aspects of spaceshipone the two men are now fierce competitors they are working on two separate ventures and are currently in a race to become the first to offer commercial flights into space last fall mr benson set up benson space co declaring that he intended to beat mr rutan and his new partner british billionaire sir richard branson to the launch pad mr benson hopes to offer paying passengers the first regular rides as soon as december potentially many months before the rutan branson venture called virgin galactic the dispute between messrs rutan and benson centers on who developed key parts of the novel rocket motor that powered the red white and blue spaceshipone on two consecutive flights to space in less than two weeks using a mixture of rubber and laughing gas as fuel the motor say proponents is simpler to operate and less prone to accidental explosion than conventional rocket engines mr rutan conceived built and tested the bullet shaped spacecraft while mr benson focused on the intricacies of the rocket motor mr benson who acquired the preliminary concepts and drawings from a now defunct company says his crew spent months perfecting them "spaceshipone would not have happened without us " he says he claims his team "designed and built every single part and component" except for the bell shaped exhaust nozzle at the rear and the outside motor casing not so according to mr rutan he says the benson teams work was limited to a valve and some plumbing inside the engine not the most challenging components that had to be engineered to withstand degree temperatures "weve had an enormous dispute with jim benson for fraudulently claiming that he developed the rocket propulsion system" for spaceshipone mr rutan says mr benson has challenged his foe "to sit down in a public forum and go over the emails" detailing core engine contributions the showdown features two self assured and stubborn rivals both used to getting their way mr rutan views himself as a st century match for the feisty spirited wright brothers known for his signature leather aviator jacket and mutton chop sideburns he has long dismissed government aviation and space officials as unimaginative saying they are more interested in pushing paper than exploring new frontiers he frequently calls the national aeronautics and space administration the department of "naysay " a secretive sort mr rutan built his reputation by bucking conventional wisdom about aerodynamics in the s he and his closely held scaled composites aviation shop gained international recognition for designing and building voyager a graceful twin engine propeller plane that completed the first nonstop flight around the world without refueling mr benson a geologist by training is more attuned to the demands of marketing and finance he made his fortune in the computer industry in the s by developing a path breaking search engine able to manipulate text files mr benson sold his two software companies to a group of private investors in for about &# million he invested most of that to set up spacedev inc a parts supplier for commercial and government space systems in august later that year the company went public today spacedev has employees in three states volatile from the beginning the companys stock at one point climbed to around &# a share but is now trading at below &# mr benson says he believed early on that space ventures once they were run by pragmatic managers "would probably create the first trillionaires " rather than starting from scratch his philosophy has been to save time and money by exploiting and improving upon existing technologies as mr rutan solicited proposals from several firms for rocket motors in and he was increasingly drawn to mr bensons track record as a manager and businessman with funding from billionaire paul allen the two men formally joined forces in to create spaceshipone it didnt take long for their cordial relationship to turn frosty tim pickens an engineer initially in charge of supervising work on spaceshipones rocket motor says mr rutan frequently fumed about what he considered the engine makers penchant for publicity and skirting nondisclosure agreements even before the design was fixed the benson team was jockeying for the best position for its own spacedev corporate logo on the rocket ship according to mr pickens at the time mr pickens recalls wondering "how much of bensons effort was really designed for public relations " mr benson remembers some talk about displaying logos of various suppliers as a "nice tip of the hat" for their contributions mr rutans reaction to that suggestion was comparable to "hitting a brick wall at miles an hour " mr rutans demand for no logos prevailed animosity between the two men increased with exchanges of sharp emails mr rutan even threatened to file suit to block public discussion about the motor he says he never did to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation yet when a small army of journalists and television crews assembled for the final launch in the fall of supporters of mr benson energetically waved large signs in the crowd proclaiming spacedev was responsible for the engines the successful flight earned mr rutan the &# million ansari x prize prize bestowed by a private foundation for spaceflight innovation after the hoopla of the win subsided the two men went their separate ways almost immediately mr rutan linked up with the flamboyant mr branson who has since committed an estimated &# million to take his virgin trademark into orbit aboard an eight passenger version of spaceshipone mr rutan says he and his employees are designing and fabricating a new upgraded engine mr rutan quips that rivals such as mr benson and amazon com founder jeff bezos who built a spaceport in texas and is working on his own rocket ship arent "really even in the same business " since none of them have yet accomplished the basic task of flying a reusable rocketship into space a spokesman for mr bezos had no comment mr benson pushing his vision just as hard has talked about raising &# million to build and test a rocketship based on a s vintage u s government design resembling todays space shuttle "i havent been as flamboyant and havent had as much money" as mr rutan he says "but i think hes worried and he ought to be worried " in the next few weeks mr benson plans to announce a nationwide competition to hand out free rides aboard his spacecraft lately mr benson has resorted to what may be the ultimate insult refusing to name mr rutan as his true rival at this point mr benson says "we have benson competing with branson " see related letter "letters to the editor different orbits" wsj feb corrections &amp amplifications a
