laces "ians shoelace site" is the comprehensive online resource born out of that quarter century old epiphany mr fieggens site showcases a series of smooth digital demonstrations that teaches what he calls the "ian knot " its not really a new knot he admits since the final result is identical to both the standard shoelace knot and the two loop knot "you should really call it the ian method " the

lifetime of repetition its tough to mentally separate the process into its individual steps mr fieggens analysis counts six of them the initial act of crossing the laces is counted as one act though even that simple move can be broken down into four distinct components the so called bunny ears method that begins with two loops often taught to novices also has six steps then theres the ian knot it can be executed in a third of the time it takes to tie a standard knot mr fieggen says heres how it works both shoelace ends are shaped into loops and simultaneously pulled through each other "a truly revolutionary way to tie your shoelaces " the instructions promise beyond the benefits of speed mr fieggen hypes the knots aesthetics and symmetry "it wears evenly so you wont have one side break
