face the music following in cobains footsteps the great expectations faced by the shins recall nirvanas ascent to alt rock glory online edition welcome to face the music a new online journal column about music past and present in the movie "garden state " theres a scene in which natalie portman hands her headphones over to zach braff and declares "you gotta hear this one song itll change your life " i remember leaning forward in my seat in the theater after that line could any composition live up to that kind of hype the song that then swelled over the soundtrack was "new slang" by the shins much later when i was researching the bands background on the web i had to smile at the historical connection the shins shared a label with another group that was forced to grapple with great expectations nirvana last month the shins released their third and most buzzed about album "wincing the night away " on the seattle based indie label sub pop records they recently performed on nbcs "saturday night live" a coup for a band that has yet to score a gold record the bands new single "phantom limb" performed well on the rock charts and while the shins debut album "oh inverted world " only shipped copies in its first week "wincing the night away" shipped an impressive copies the album also debuted at no on the billboard charts selling copies in its first week a huge commercial breakthrough for a previously low profile act before that the highest the shins had been on the album charts was no some purists are griping that the shins arent truly an indie band since media giant time warner owns a minority stake in sub pop while many reviews of the new record are positive some critics have complained that the band played it too safe in a bid for sales so the pressure is on and the knives are out will a group that formed in in albuquerque new mexico end up going hollywood will the band be able to live up to the heavy promotion and retain its indie charm nirvana faced some of the same kinds of questions when they released their third studio album "in utero " in nirvanas debut album "bleach " was an underground hit for sub pop and the cries of "sell out " from fans and critics began around its release and only got louder as the bands popularity grew nirvanas second cd "nevermind " was a no smash that elbowed aside michael jackson on its rush to the top of the charts by the time nirvana came out with its third album singer guitarist kurt cobain bassist krist novoselic and drummer dave grohl faced a deluge of criticism for courting mainstream stardom attacks that only subsided after mr cobains suicide but by then nirvana had made an indelible impact the group helped usher in the era of alternative rock which lasted for around a decade it should be noted that a number of earlier groups such as r e m fugazi and the pixies laid the groundwork for nirvana the success of "nevermind " and the popularity of nirvanas generational anthem "smells like teen spirit " helped make the world safe for pearl jam rage against the machine smashing pumpkins liz phair sleater kinney and many others many of these acts hated the labels such as "alternative rock" and "grunge" that the media attached to them but many of these performers did share a common urge to make progressive music that pushed beyond the borders of mainstream pop groups such as the white stripes the strokes death cab for cutie tv on the radio and the shins are the heirs of that s movement is it still possible for a musical act to have the kind of cultural impact that nirvana had in the s music sales have been slumping for several years in part due to illegal downloading in the past a hit album might sell more than five million copies now an album is considered a smash if it sells a million or two and todays bands seem to have downsized their ambitions since the heyday of alternative rock after all in "garden state " ms portmans character promises music that will "change your life " not change the world the members of nirvana were taken by surprise by their bands success the next nirvana whoever that may turn out to be may also be an unexpected phenomenon when i talked to stuart meyer the shins a&amp r person he was bullish on the bands future but even he didnt believe his group was poised for a nirvana sized breakthrough after all nirvana songs such as "come as you are" are still a staple on radio more than a decade after their release mr meyer notes that the two bands have "completely different" approaches to making music while nirvanas sound was often raw and expansive the shins music is typically lush and sometimes unassuming "i dont think anything will really compare to nirvana " he says "that was a cultural and global juggernaut " write to christopher john farley at christopher farley wsj com
