seeds of reform in china farmers become health care monitors test program targets nations broken system fining the local doctor xinlian china in this remote mountain village residents were complaining about a local doctor some suspected he was prescribing drugs that werent necessary that set off an unusual response a special council of local health care monitors formed as part of an experiment to address sweeping problems in chinas health care system swung into action in they fined the doctor yuan or about &# a significant amount of money in this poor part of china for overprescribing drugs "hopefully the other village doctors will take this as a warning " they wrote in an official notice posted in the village the experiment was launched here in xinlian three years ago by a harvard professor in response to a big gap in chinas surging economy only a small fraction of chinas rural population receives any health care aid compared with about in the early s efforts to make people pay for their own insurance often meet resistance because patients suspect their payments will simply line the pockets of corrupt government officials and the quality of what medical treatment people do receive is often questionable one pivotal problem in china most village doctors make their income solely by selling drugs the xinlian plan drafts a team of local residents to monitor health care in the village and publicize what they find out it has made progress in weeding out bad doctors but isnt a perfect fix the doctor it fined for overprescribing drugs was drummed out of the village health plan but he kept practicing medicine and only had his license taken away after a tragedy as china rapidly pushes industrialization fixing its health care system has become a national priority late last month for example the government announced a major investigation into corruption at chinas drug watchdog agency the state food and drug administration in william c hsiao a senior professor of economics at harvards school of public health began enrolling about farmers in a health insurance program he and other academics designed in xinlian the annual cost is about &# a person with farmers paying a little less than half of that the rest has been subsidized with private funds organized by dr hsiao last year a city in guizhou province adopted the program for million people one of the most striking parts of dr hsiaos undertaking is its effort to inject a dose of democracy and accountability into chinese health care "we set up self governance the farmers have a major voice in how to govern the money on how its spent " says dr hsiao a year old chinese born professor who grew up in queens n y doctors involved with dr hsiaos plan must submit a record for each patient they see noting what drugs they prescribed and are expected to charge an average of no more than yuan or a little over &# per patient per visit the health plan pays doctors a modest salary of &# a month so they wont have to rely on selling prescription drugs for income one of the greatest challenges facing dr hsiao was gaining the confidence of farmers who for years have been hit up for fees by local officials "the farmers do not trust the government " says dr hsiao who has a ph d in economics "when the government collects money from them they often worry that the money is going into the pockets of the government officials not being used for the people " under his plan each village elects one of its own to a council that helps administer the system villagers can hire and fire doctors that helps purge those who try to make money by prescribing costly medicines and procedures people dont need for example putting people on intravenous drips for a cold a routine practice in china and everyone can see how money is being spent because larger insurance reimbursements are written on publicly displayed boards in each village the world health organization in beijing issued a report on rural china that cited rampant overprescription and said markups for drugs can be as high as to one study published in the academic journal health policy and planning in found that of drugs prescribed by rural doctors for influenza patients were unnecessary mao qunan spokesman for the ministry of health says the chinese government is watching dr hsiaos program closely "if it turns out well we will use the experiences of the experiment for reference in the health care policy making for rural areas in the future " harvards school of public health hopes the model could thrive in other developing countries india ghana and tanzania are already working on implementing similar projects based in part on dr hsiaos academic work the experiment in xinlian ended recently and the local government is now running the program dr hsiaos experiment addresses only a small piece of a much broader crisis including a lack of funding for health care services and an ailing set of state run hospitals the government is rolling out its own health care plan for farmers but it covers only catastrophic illness and critics say fails to deal with the corruption that breeds malpractice dr hsiaos plan like the governments only reimburses villagers for part of their costs less than half and forces them to pay for hospitalization before they receive treatment given that surgery can cost as much as a years income or more for a farmer many are forced to go deeply into debt or forgo care dr hsiao thinks the government will eventually have to boost the fees it charges for insurance as well as increase its own contributions to reduce the burden on patients xinlian which has about residents held its first election in to select villagers who would help manage the new health insurance program when the plan was announced some thought the annual fee the government was asking them to pay would simply go into party cadres pockets not provide them with health care "some farmers didnt believe this would work they dont believe this is true " says zhu zhizeng a farmer now enrolled in the program "we used to pay all kinds of fees when the government asked us to pay we paid " dr hsiao contended that the more the villagers understood about where their money was going the more they would want to participate when elections for council representative rolled around villagers were eager to take part local officials distributed a notice to each household asking for nominations a half dozen of the most popular candidates were selected to vie against one another one candidate was liu yuzhang a year old retired wheat farmer who is often asked to organize weddings and funerals an honor in rural china when he learned he had been nominated "i was not only surprised but i felt the burden of responsibility on my shoulders " he says a few days later more than people representing each house in the village gathered to select one of the six to be council representative votes were counted in front of the villagers mr liu won edging out his nearest rival by around ballots he remembers "i was very excited to attend that meeting because i voted for someone who will serve us " says ni shicheng a farmer in his s "mr liu is a senior old person he has the trust among us " mr ni says he has paid his fee each year partly because mr liu is helping make sure the money is put to good use not long after the election mr liu began receiving complaints from people in the village about one of the local doctors wang bangmin some suspected he was prescribing drugs simply so he could sell them mr liu even heard that the doctor would take advantage of illiterate villagers who would leave their "chops" stamps in red ink that are the chinese equivalent of a signature with which he would forge receipts all doctors in the experimental health care program receive the monthly salary plus a bonus of one yuan for every villager treated doctors are supposed to sell only certain drugs at prices set by the government and submit records of each prescription ni shiqiao a year old doctor in a nearby village whose father and grandfather were both village doctors says that before the experiment started he made nearly all his income selling prescription drugs now he makes a monthly salary and prescribes fewer drugs than before he says some villagers suspected dr wang was violating the new rules "every time he saw a patient he tried to get more money from the patient " says mr liu the council representative "he would overcharge them and prescribe drugs they didnt need " si wenming a year old farmer remembers falling ill once and going to see dr wang when she arrived at the doctors home which doubled as an office and a pharmacy she says she was given an injection of medicine ms si says the medicine later caused an allergic reaction "and then he would prescribe more drugs to treat the allergic reaction " ms si says mr liu took the complaints he was hearing to the council of representatives from local villages they gathered in march in the towns dusty government building after discussing options they decided to fine dr wang yuan for overprescribing drugs and posted a notice in the village a few months later managers of the health care plan reviewed dr wangs prescriptions again and calculated that from january to june he had made prescriptions they said he had cheated villagers out of yuan the equivalent of a years income for some farmers here on july the village council held another meeting and decided to fire dr wang from their health care program but even though he was expelled from the health care program dr wang continued to prescribe and sell medicines to villagers on his own according to chen wendong one of the program administrators "to take away the license of the doctor thats beyond our power " says harvards dr hsiao "we can remove him from our roster so the insured people cannot go to him that usually would reduce his income drastically he probably would have to turn to some other occupation " but some villagers continued to see dr wang who had treated residents for years in the fall of yang zhao an year old boy complained of a headache to his teachers at the yellow dragon primary school his grandmother took him to dr wang who prescribed and sold her a combination of chinese and western medicines including ribavirin after diagnosing that the boy had the flu according to dr ni ribavirin is an antiviral agent seldom used in western countries to treat the flu the boy began clenching his teeth and fell into a seizure according to mr liu at one point dr wang tried to pry open the boys mouth with a pair of chopsticks but one snapped and cut into his face according to a doctor at the local hospital who saw the child later that day an ambulance was called and ding shiquan the schoolmaster at yellow dragon rode with the boy to the hospital along a bumpy dirt road he recalls the boy moaning during the trip with his arms and legs twitching when the ambulance arrived at the hospital at around p m the child was unconscious the boy died that night an official government investigation later concluded that overprescription contributed to the boys death according to kou wenrai a local township official overseeing the health care program who has reviewed the report an official in the county health department says the precise cause of the boys death was never determined because the boy was buried before an autopsy could be done dr wang was prohibited from practicing medicine for six months following the incident according to an official in the county health department who identified himself only as mr ma dr wang was also forced to pay the parents of the boy about &# as compensation according to mr liu the village representative not long after the boys death dr wang left the village for a neighboring province to find work in a coal mine according to villagers reached by phone dr wang declined to discuss the matter "it has all been past and i dont want to recall those experiences which have been a mental scar to me " he said one day last autumn his old house in xinlian was shuttered and farmers used the doorstep to dry soybean plants a smattering of the drugs the doctor used to sell could still be seen through a dirty window in the village there was a blackboard by the side of a dirt road on it payouts from the insurance plan are written in chalk recently the board indicated that one farmer hu wenchai broke his left hip and was reimbursed about &# for the operation another had urinary tract problems for which he got about &# to cover the fees mr kou the local official says the blackboard is intended to promote accountability and honesty by showing people where their money is going "the purpose of doing this " he says "is to let every villager be a supervisor of this system " zhou yang in beijing contributed to this article
