in the fray nfl players americas newest victims theres a new class of victims in america former nfl players in the week leading up to super bowl xli the sports media were awash with stories of former nfl players hobbled by long term disabilities from their playing days hbos "real sports with bryant gumbel" profiled former nfl defensive lineman conrad dobler the new york times ran a super bowl sunday front page story on former new england patriots all pro linebacker ted johnson who claims he suffered multiple concussions during his year career and is now addicted to amphetamines both are blaming the nfl and calling for reform of the pension and medical disability system and this past weekend espns "outside the lines" program featured former nfl players who say theyre still suffering the effects of their careers theres no doubt that many former players are physical wrecks but should we feel sorry for them after all many players reveled in the fact that they could punish their bodies week after week and continue to play noticeably absent from this debate is any discussion about the personal responsibility these players bear for their post career conditions mr dobler is a textbook case he was a three time pro bowler who played seasons in the nfl from to theres no denying that his knees are destroyed and after many operations he manages to hobble around at best he said he takes about vicodin a month to dull the pain but anyone who remembers mr dobler from his playing days will have little sympathy for him "conrad dobler was a pit bull without a leash on the field " espn wrote when fans voted him no among the dirtiest players of all time "he didnt care who he hurt how he hurt and who saw him hurt he even went as far to write a book called they call me dirty to proclaim he didnt have a care about anyones health " mr dobler isnt alone oakland raiders defensive back jack tatum is unapologetic to this day for a hit that paralyzed new england patriots wide receiver darryl stingley famous defensive units over the years have included the fearsome foursome the purple people eaters and the steel curtain in short the nfl has never been confused with the bolshoi "in football thats the way it is " new york giants center shaun ohara told the times "if its not bleeding and its not completely broken rub dirt on it and lets go there is that machismo in there and also the ego from the players standpoint that hey i can play through this " mr johnson certainly did that he admits that he continued to play even though he knew he was suffering from repeated concussions furthermore he didnt tell patriots coaches or trainers about his recurring injuries for fear that he would lose his starting job and starting salary amazingly these self incriminating facts havent kept mr johnson from blaming patriots coach bill belichick and the team medical staff for his long term ailments but if the patriots didnt know that he was hurt how can he blame them for continuing to play him because these players were well compensated during their playing careers it will be hard for juries to sympathize with them mr dobler made a fraction of what players make today but he and his contemporaries werent exactly paid slave wages his first contract in with the st louis cardinals was for &# double the u s median single male income of &# his last contract with the buffalo bills in was for about &# more than double the u s median single male income of &# what happened to that money did he save for his retirement or buy long term disability insurance todays players like mr johnson havent any reason to cry poverty in mr johnson was paid a base salary of &# but with signing and performance bonuses his total compensation came to more than &# million where is that money today why does mr johnson feel that the league the nfl players association and the patriots should be responsible for his condition and his medical bills further undermining the players efforts to portray themselves as victims is the fact that theyre represented by sophisticated sports agents and a union that hasnt completely ignored the issue the union pays out about &# million a year in retirement benefits and the latest collective bargaining agreement negotiated in march included more than &# million in enhanced medical and pension benefits yes its a pittance for a league that brings in almost &# billion a year just in television revenues but the nfl pension plan was never designed to be a players primary source of post retirement income theres also a bit of union politics at play here some players dont like gene upshaw the former oakland raiders all pro lineman whos the current head of the union many think hes too cozy with the league its true that he isnt your typical union boss he doesnt pick fights with the league just to harass it instead he fights the important battles in the last labor agreement he negotiated hard to get players a bigger share of television revenues and a piece of the lucrative local revenues that are generated by entrepreneurial big market teams like the washington redskins and dallas cowboys in the end what this comes down to is money many of the older players who made &# a year are jealous of todays players who make &# million and the worst cases like mr dobler are being held up as the norm instead of the exception "what you dont hear about is the guys we help " mr upshaw said at a press conference during super bowl xli more important what you dont hear is anyone asking if these former players bear any personal responsibility for the financial and physical plight in which they find themselves mr yost is the author of "tailgating sacks and salary caps how the nfl became the most successful sports league in history" kaplan see related letter "letters to the editor mom says i can play" wsj feb correction in tuesdays article "nfl players americas newest victims " former pro bowler conrad dobler was referred to as a defensive lineman he was an offensive lineman wsj feb in the feb leisure &amp arts article "nfl players americas newest victims " former new england patriots linebacker ted

his career and that he continued to play for fear of losing his starting position he has not blamed the nfl the players union or the patriots wsj march
