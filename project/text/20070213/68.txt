lse available again may seek new partner after nasdaq bows out local deals could prove difficult to put together for the first time in almost two years the london stock exchange plc isnt spoken for without anyone trying to partner with the exchange chief executive clara furse is now free to look for merger options herself immediately after nasdaq stock market inc conceded this past weekend the lse said it intends to progress with "various competitive collaborative and strategic opportunities " underlining how hard it has been for the lse to pursue its own deals ms furse twice held preliminary discussions with exchange operator borsa italiana based in milan about the potential for a deal people familiar with the matter say both times these early stage talks were interrupted by rival approaches once from australias macquarie bank ltd and then by nasdaqs first crack at the lse months ago borsa italiana said last month that it considers the lse the owner of europes largest stock exchange by the value of companies listed a potentially interesting partner but it wanted to wait for the nasdaq situation to settle and that no talks were under way the value of domestic companies listed on borsa italiana is just over one quarter that of london stock exchanges an lse spokesman declined to comment on the exchanges views on borsa italiana that said in the short to medium term there are few likely candidates for the lse to strike the sort of global deal that is joining rival exchanges nyse group inc the operator of the new york stock exchange and euronext nv which owns four european stock markets indeed nyse euronext is seen as the most promising contender as a partner for lse but its senior executives have talked of bedding down their own merger before considering other major deals for lse "there are some options but nothing transformational in nature " said mamoun tazi an analyst at man securities ltd in london some of the major investors who helped lse by refusing to sell their shares to nasdaq are expected to eventually push for some kind of deal even as the exchange released record trading figures for january yesterday showing the business is doing well on its own many of these investors are known as event driven funds because they invest ahead of what they think will be future corporate action also nasdaq with its stake in the lse could complicate a deal as its presence may deter other bidders while another exchange could still buy a majority stake no buyer can force it out there are more local options for the lse spanish exchange group bolsas y mercados espanoles sa is potentially interesting to london a person familiar with the matter said but the spanish market regulator requires any bidder to ask for permission to buy even of that exchange so any deal could face political complications bme is europes no exchange operator by value of listed companies behind lse euronext and deutsche boerse ag instead the lse could focus on partnerships and joint ventures signing agreements to cross list companies or share technology the lse has said it is talking to the tokyo stock exchange and the bombay stock exchange about cooperation agreements bombay also has said it is looking to sell a stake in itself to a foreign exchange south african exchange operator jse ltd is another option ms furse said in a recent interview that the lse has "ongoing conversations" about extending its relationship with jse which already uses londons trading technology she declined to discuss further details though one person familiar with the matter said the jse isnt at the top of any to do list striking joint ventures is all the rage among global exchanges "the costs of such partnerships are limited and it opens up the possibility of something more meaningful down the road " said andrew mitchell a london based analyst at fox pitt kelton not all investors are in a hurry however brendan caldwell president of caldwell investment management ltd toronto which owns about &# million of lse shares said he believes that an lse nyse euronext deal could eventually happen but said in the meantime lse management "should stick to their knitting and run a really good business " aaron lucchetti in new york contributed to this article possible partners for the lse nasdaq would third time be a charm bob greifeld has suggested he would wait months before considering it borsa italiana the bosses have chatted over whether there is any possible chemistry but it is seen as a hard deal to do for italian political reasons bme spain is europes fourth largest exchange by value of listed companies ownership rules in spain could make a deal hard to consummate nyse euronext it likely would get a lot of backing but nyse and euronext are busy settling into their union nasdaq could try to undermine it omx group the scandinavian markets operator is an old suitor but recently said it wasnt interested it could come back with a partner to bid exchanges in hong kong singapore and australia wild cards so far they are just names being thrown into the ring by outsiders
