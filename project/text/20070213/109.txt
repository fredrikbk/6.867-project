talking tech telecom industry set for big changes more than billion mobile phones are expected to ship world wide in making cellular devices more popular than the home computer and fixed line telephone according to professor william webb author of the just published "wireless communications the future" and head of research and development at united kingdom telecommunications regulator ofcom the telecommunications industry is set to see yet more change in the next years as he discusses in these excerpts from an interview q the telephone has changed massively since its invention years ago how do you think communications will change in the next years a i think quite a lot of change will occur for the mobile phone user around convergence of devices and mobile services at the moment most people have multiple phones a mobile phone an office phone and a home phone plus multiple different email addresses there have been efforts by many telecom companies to converge these in the past but they havent really worked however it strikes me that were now at a stage where were seeing more of a concerted and sustainable effort by telecom operators such as bt and france telecom the mobile handset itself is also becoming more converged its now a camera at first their capability was laughable but now some have three megapixel cameras and this is getting better q in your book you say the mobile phone will become the "remote control of life " what do you mean by this a weve gradually seen mobile phones take over parts of peoples life for example a few years ago people might have taken an alarm clock with them when they traveled but i dont think many people do now for many people the phone is also used as a calculator and a replacement for the wrist watch people are increasingly realizing that the phone which they always carry is something that they can use to replace other items in their life and theres no technical reason at all why the mobile phone cant replace two other things we always carry around with us keys and money but with all these things it will take a long time to do it as you need the right infrastructure in place and user acceptance in terms of changing how they do things q will handsets continue on their current trend of becoming thinner a some analysts have predicted that mobile phone screens headphones and keyboards will become separate devices i think there will be more of a steady progression it will always be the case that some people will want very small thin phones while other people will want large full feature phones i expect we will see phones evolve in many different ways as people want to get different things out of them in particular there will be larger screen versions for people that want to use their phones as a video type device for mobile tv and podcasts its unlikely that we will see roll out keyboards in the next or so years but what we could see are screens that are brighter and have more power with better resolution meaning that watching television on your mobile phone isnt quite so bad i also think the memory capability of mobile phones will go up tremendously over the next years or so mobile devices could have gigabytes of storage capacity this will be more than enough to store someones entire music collection
