new frontiers for cellphone service telecom firms see potential in worlds remotest regions when telecommunications company mtn group ltd started expanding its cellphone service to remote areas of nigeria it hit a potential roadblock many villages lacked the electricity to power parts of its network and although the country is rich in oil trucking in fuel on poor roads over long distances was expensive and risky so mtn came up with an alternative using biofuels made from local crops such as soy and jatropha for years developed nations provided the cellphone industry with most of its growth and fat profits now that growth has slowed and it is the emerging markets that are rising fast as a result cellphone service providers are reaching into the worlds remotest regions developing regions such as africa china and india together account for roughly billion cellphone subscribers about of the global market according to wireless intelligence a joint venture between the gsm association and ovum holdings ltd that tracks cellphone industry data analysts expect these newer cellphone markets to contribute the vast majority of growth in mobile subscribers in the coming years only about a third of people in developing markets currently have mobile phones in india less than of the population has a cellphone but the market is increasing by more than six million new subscribers a month by contrast roughly of the u s population own a cellphone and some western european markets have reached saturation point the industry is racing to adapt companies from vodafone group plc the worlds largest wireless service provider by revenue to regional providers like kuwaits mobile telecommunications co are looking at everything from lower cost handsets to services tailored to clientele living on very low incomes and often far from urban centers for mtn a regional company based in south africa powering parts of its network has proved challenging as a solution the company plans to have its first biodiesel fueled base station up and running by march in nigeria through a partnership with swedish telecommunications supplier telefon ab l m ericsson the aim is to have biofuel powered base stations in that country by the end of the year and operators in other countries are expected to follow suit says ericssons vice president of marketing johan bergendahl just last week ericsson and wireless operator idea cellular in india announced they were teaming on a similar project in a rural part of that country among the challenges they face mr bergendahl says is building a reliable local supply chain for the crops one popular approach for operators to spread their services to remote low income communities has been to set up communal cellphones they often join forces with local entrepreneurs who rent out use of a phone to neighbors charging them based on how long they talk in algeria orascom telecom holding sae has a pilot project to install cellphones in very small villages and other remote areas that border the desert including places nomadic populations frequent such as watering holes and bathing tents the phones are wireless but resemble old fashioned chunky desktop phones in order to withstand the heavy use and extreme desert climates so far the or so phones in the trial are used for roughly minutes a day a level the carrier says is profitable says roslane bencharif head of strategic planning and business development for orascom in algeria orascom is rolling out about phones in algeria which cost the operator about &# each says mr bencharif based in algiers joshua perry an independent consultant working for orascom says as he traveled around algeria to set up the project "the reaction was fevered it was quite phenomenal " once a local official invited him in for mint tea and in another village locals slaughtered and roasted lamb to welcome him he says to make it easier for lower income customers to purchase calling time some carriers are experimenting with new payment options they are letting customers replenish prepaid cellphone cards in increments of the equivalent of just a few u s cents building out network coverage to rural areas is expensive at the same time customers typically have lower incomes and therefore are less lucrative still operators say they can turn a profit from customers who spend the equivalent of just a few dollars a month on phone calls by reducing their operating costs to that end some operators are exploring outsourcing the running of their networks or sharing networks with other operators for some companies emerging markets are an incubator for new services such as mobile banking which lets people who dont have bank accounts use their cellphones to transfer money the concept is starting to take hold in some markets such as the philippines and south africa kenyan operator safaricom ltd a joint venture between telkom kenya ltd and vodafone is launching a service called m pesa that lets customers without bank accounts transfer money using text messages customers using m pesa which stands for mobile money get a new chip installed in their phone at no cost so they can add credit to their account at street kiosks gas stations or shops basically any seller of cellphone airtime credit they can send the credit to any other kenyan mobile phone via a code bearing text message recipients then take their phone with the text message to a retailer or similar outlet to pick up their cash the service may someday include other financial transactions such as paying utility bills and taking out small loans says nick hughes head of mobile payment at vodafone of newbury england customers initially will be able to make only domestic money transfers but the company hopes to take the service to other parts of its global network while the potential of such services long has been discussed for developed markets they have failed to take off there due to well established alternatives such as debit cards and credit cards and industry experts note a number of challenges for mobile banking in general including technological and regulatory requirements
