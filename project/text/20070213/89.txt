politics &amp economics how a tradition ends in new mexico with larger prize in mind gov richardson nears ban on cockfighting in about a year before he proposed building a &# million spaceport in his relatively poor desert state new mexico gov bill richardson was buttonholed by a reporter how did the democrat and former u n ambassador feel about cockfighting the widely banned sport is popular and legal in the land of enchantment "below my radar " the governor replied little incites more passionate political debate in new mexico than the question of whether to join much of the rest of the country in outlawing cockfights indeed mr richardson now admits he avoided the issue during his first term precisely because "the legislature wouldnt be able to do anything else" during the session were he to seriously press a ban on cockfighting but that was his first term re elected in the fall with nearly of the vote mr richardson proceeded to take two of the biggest steps of his public career in december he came out in favor of a cockfighting ban then in january he began campaigning for president it was a natural progression the governor said in an interview "i didnt want an issue like cockfighting hanging over my presidential campaign " with a few sentences mr richardson breathed life into a longstanding proposal to ban cockfighting in new mexico one that has been offered and summarily killed in consecutive legislative sessions with the governors blessing a ban is on the verge of becoming law having passed the state senate which traditionally served as the wrecking yard for similar proposals though the ban still needs house approval senate passage marks a turnaround on the issue legislation banning cockfighting had been such a lost cause says state sen joseph carraro that it was routinely employed to haze incoming lawmakers when he took office in mr carraro a former wall street stockbroker was approached by a group of legislators "they told me how bright i was and how well spoken i was and how they really needed me to carry this bill they couldnt pass " he recalls shortly thereafter he was confronted in his office by an unhappy rooster breeder "he had something like a bowie knife and he was talking and getting rather angry and he pulled it out of this belt scabbard and stabbed it into my desk " mr carraro said "cockfighting is an emotional issue " and not just for new mexicans over the years rue mcclanahan pamela anderson and other hollywood types have appealed publicly to mr richardson to get behind a cockfighting ban jay leno joked about the practice in the state once in a monologue outsiders mostly focus on the cruelty of the sport in which two specially bred roosters equipped with metal spurs battle to the death often to the cheers of a raucous free betting crowd but cockfighting fans in new mexico focus on the history of the practice saying most adherents are latinos who brought the sport from mexico where it is legal cockfighting they say is as embedded in the states culture as bull roping state sen mary jane garcia a democrat who is leading the charge in the legislature to ban the sport has been proposing and supporting cockfighting bans since taking office in an anthropologist she rejects the idea that cockfights are culturally redeeming as a child she said she was traumatized when her parents took her to a movie that showed bloody scenes of a match now she has been agitating for a ban for nearly years it was as a freshman legislator that ms garcia managed to get a hearing in the senate she is convinced it was a humiliating trick employed by sniggering rural senators so they could ask her to define the archaic word for rooster and then watch her stutter "i just couldnt go through with it because i was so embarrassed " says ms garcia now the majority whip of the senate "i just sat down and killed my own bill " her luck changed this year after mr richardson and the states catholic churches which say cockfighting promotes violence came out in favor of her ban the senate conservation committee approved her bill on a vote last week following five hours of debate and parliamentary maneuvering the full senate also approved the bill which would make organizing or watching a cockfight a petty misdemeanor the measure is now pending in the state house which approved similar legislation in the past ms garcia gives the bulk of the credit to mr richardson for turning the political tide so do the sports boosters "i believe its richardson " said ronnie barron a game fowl breeder from artesia n m near the texas border "its all politics he had political pressure put on him " just as a generation ago republicans developed a "southern strategy" to break the democrats hold on the old confederacy democrats are now targeting the west democratic governors and u s senators in once monolithic red states such as colorado arizona montana and nevada are aiming to deliver electoral votes in coming elections in part by redefining their party through the progressive policies and individualistic roots that have marked its leaders in recent years this political image is one mr richardson labored to build during his first term in office when he concentrated on progressive initiatives such as building a commuter train and improving schools attracting high tech businesses and imposing a greenhouse gas regime thats stricter than the kyoto accord does cockfighting fly in the face of the image of a progressive western democrat mr richardson shrugs he does say though that when he found out only one other state louisiana allows organized cockfighting "i knew it was time to end it " see related letter "letters to the editor cruel tradition ends" wsj february
