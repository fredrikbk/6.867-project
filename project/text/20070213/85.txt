the day after the funeral mr kerzner boarded his private jet and flew halfway around the world to singapore where the company was bidding against two rivals for an important casino project mr kerzners presence was meant to assure singapore officials that the sudden death of his son would not impact the firms ability to deliver big projects shortly after returning from singapore to his london home mr kerzner felt faint while running on his treadmill following an angiogram the next day nov he underwent triple bypass heart surgery sending him into a few weeks of convalescence then on dec still more bad news arrived at a m mr kerzner was awakened by a phone call in his suite at the st regis hotel in new york the singapore government had rejected the kerzner proposal which featured a futuristic design by architect frank gehry a project that was crucial to the companys future suddenly vanished most succession dramas involve the sudden death of a company patriarch not the successor the elder mr kerzner now faces the prospect of coming back to fulfill his companys growing global ambitions just as it must deal with new private equity investors who expect healthy returns he returns to the helm after a lifetime in the fast lane a jet setting lifestyle that took its toll in the form of four marriages a heart attack and an alcohol rehabilitation stint at the betty ford clinic two years ago mr kerzner says he was extremely close to butch and they would often speak on the phone two or three times a day "before butchs death the kerzners were going to continue running things and there was no time frame for the family not to be involved " mr kerzner says in his tidy corner office deep inside the sprawling atlantis resort complex here "but im and i wont be doing this for another or years " now kerzner international is stuck with the same dilemma it faced a decade ago succeeding the legendary founder instead of a young year old ceo who had been carefully prepared for the job over many years the company will be led by mr kerzner and paul oneil a board member and former top executive who was also lured out of retirement following butchs death mr kerzner says he and mr oneil will continue to run the company "for the foreseeable future " and he has not formulated a succession plan but pressure is building on the company many in the industry see the companys failure to win the singapore license as an immediate consequence of butch kerzners death long in his fathers shadow butch had shepherded the singapore deal from the start and was seen as the key contact by officials in singapore who did little to explain their decision in its aftermath "i believe that if butch were alive they would have won singapore " says gambling titan steve wynn a close friend of the elder mr kerzner mr kerzner declines to speculate on the impact of butchs death on losing the singapore project "bidding on those projects is always a roll of the dice " he says with an eye for luxury and a swashbuckling style solomon kerzner carved out a career that reads like a history of the modern hotel and casino industries over years he courted controversy lured the wealthy and helped expand and reinvent the global gambling landscape with projects like the sun city resort in south africa the aquatic themed atlantis complex in the bahamas and the indian owned mohegan sun casino in connecticut born outside johannesburg in to russian jewish immigrants mr kerzner had a hardscrabble childhood that led him to boxing but instead of pursuing the sport professionally he

influences in their own casino developments in las vegas and atlantic city n j in mid mr kerzner left south africa under a cloud of suspicion and resettled in london he was charged by a prosecutor in the black homeland of transkei of bribing the governor of that state for casino rights the governor served a nine year prison sentence for accepting a gbp payment from mr kerzner mr kerzner later admitted paying the money but claimed he was extorted he spent years and millions of dollars in an eventually successful effort to get the charges dropped mr kerzner later sold most of his interest in his south african hotel empire and began looking for new markets his company bought a run down hotel here in the bahamas and rebuilt it as the lavish atlantis resort themed around the concept of the lost underwater city the resort which included a vast aquarium integrated into its public spaces and a big water slide disguised as a mayan style temple was an immediate hit mr kerzner also struck a deal with the mohegan tribe of connecticut to build what became one of the first native american megacasinos both the bahamas and mohegan deals were spearheaded by butch kerzner who joined the company in when he was unlike his father whose taste for the fast life would be breathlessly chronicled in the world press for decades butch lived a quieter life leaving south africa at age for stanford university he graduated from stanford in and embarked on an investment banking career working at cs first boston then joining lazard freres &amp co in new york after receiving a stanford mba in the early s lazard brought mr kerzner the opportunity to buy a derelict resort in the bahamas which became the atlantis resort casino mr kerzner unfamiliar with u s banking practices suggested that his son help him review the deal as his banker the elder mr kerzner says he wasnt thinking in dynastic terms but his son soon left lazard to join him at the company on the finance side butch kerzner at first seemed awed at times by his father operating more like a "financial analyst" than a top executive says one person close to butch "at the time sol was running the whole show and butch was like a helper a supporting cast member " says a close acquaintance of both men while sol spent his free time carousing friends and family say butch relaxed by running boating and doing other outdoor activities gradually butch began applying his financial skills to the hotel and gambling business sometimes when his father didnt see the point len wolman chairman and chief executive of lodging
