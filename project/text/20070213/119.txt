service internet companies are pushing to change the way consumers store personal computer files while most people still prefer to back up their data on discs external hard drives or flash memory devices new services that outsource the storage process to the web can be faster safer and often less expensive than other storage methods after creating an account with an online storage site you can

depends on the speed of your internet connection in rare cases the service downtimes may leave you temporarily unable to access your files online storage options have existed for years but they have

extra software xdrive users can upload files through their browser box net recently began allowing users to store files by emailing them as attachments to upload box net and it will soon build a feature for storing files created on a mobile device like photos the services then allow users to retrieve the files they uploaded by logging on to their accounts from any computer consumers may be wary of storing personal information with a third party service particularly one that may some day go out of business or experience technical problems the companies insist that customer data wont disappear they stress that customer data are backed up on multiple servers in multiple places and many save the data in formats that can be easily uploaded and imported into other storage programs in

washington state university recently uploaded a flier he wanted to share with some friends to box net when he went to retrieve it a few weeks later he found that it along with all the other files he had saved were gone box net says the problem was caused by a rare instance of the company needing to move traffic to another database on its server due to high traffic volumes and all of mr petersons files were restored within six hours but mr peterson of moscow ind says he has "learned his lesson " "in the future i am going to make sure i have a way to recover things on my own like using a flash memory device " he says long upload times can also be trying rick mahn years old started using xdrive after aol made it free he finds it useful for clearing space off his computer and likes a photo sharing feature that enabled him to share a slide show of vacation photos with family by sending them a link he says he would use the service more often however if it were faster "it can be painful to upload files " says mr mahn who says it can take him around minutes to upload or photos from his home in monticello minn and twice that for a few video clips stashed away storing data online has some advantages although it isnt risk free or without hassles speed files can be quickly dragged and dropped into folders housed online safety the files wont be lost if a computer hard drive fails or if
