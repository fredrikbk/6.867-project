a festival that lovers of fossils could really dig washington i always love to show these to kids " said scott wing as he pulled open a specimen drawer crammed with seemingly first rate clearly museum quality samples of year old dung balls donor giant ground sloth that were found in northern arizonas rampart cave "ive never opened this drawer " continued dr wing curator of fossil plants in the smithsonians department of paleobiology "that a five year old hasnt said ewwwwww " dr wing would have been well advised to prepare for many "ewwwwww" choruses this was just one of many behind the scenes tours he conducted as part of the smithsonians first fossil fest held this past saturday at the national museum of natural history which has million fossils in its collection the event attracted visitors most young enough to identify barney as their favorite dinosaur and no contest to identify mommy and daddy as their absolutely favorite fossils "my sons class has been studying dinosaurs so i thought this would be a nice tie in " said shannon perich a photography curator at the smithsonian whose pretty in pink three year old daughter meg had a prior commitment attending a princess themed birthday party "but " said ms perich "she was motivated to leave before it was over so she could come " still the charms of animal plant and microbe remains that are at least years old such is the shorthand definition of a fossil had no age boundaries after a behind the scenes tour that included a look at sawdonia ornata a land plant that is million or so years old and neuropteris ovata a seed fern that is million or so years old one adult was heard to exclaim "i feel like i got a ticket to willie wonkas chocolate factory " the impetus for the fest "was to try to find a new way of engaging people in fossils " said dr wing whose field hat and red bandanna helped him stand out in the teeming crowd "theyre the best evidence we have for evolution and we dont want anyone to forget that also the fossil record is full of striking environmental change we want people to understand that like the geological record its the source of information on the history of the planet "weve had other festivals on different topics in the museum in the last number of years " he continued "and it seems that creating a special occasion is a good way of getting more of our local community to appreciate whats here all the time " additionally according to dr wing the fossil fest was a way "of putting a more personal touch on things to put a more human face on the museum and build a community of people who are interested in fossils and evolution and biology " deploying plastic bins of different colored beans museum specialists and volunteers offered an engaging lesson in natural selection to eager gaggles of children while elsewhere in and around the dinosaur hall toddlers standing on tiptoe peered through a microscope at fossilized ostracode a shrimp like crustacean after being clued in that they were dealing with a billion year old planet young museum visitors were given markers and strips of paper and invited to create a time line of earth others with an artistic bent elected to help paint a mural with illustrations of fossils appropriate to a given period eocene oligocene or perhaps late miocene children whose parents had a sense of time similar to that of a paleontologist early is better could count themselves lucky they showed up at a m just as fossil fest was beginning and thus were able to get their names on the reservation list to take part in a mini dig an event that was fully booked long before noon every half hour six children knelt around a low table whose covering of sand and plaster obscured fossils teeth tusks leaves bones safety glasses in place six year old virginian ashley summers and four year old cameron stuart of silver spring md who as he explained "loves dinosaurs i have dinosaur movies and lots of dinosaur books" took up their rawhide mallets and began tapping wooden chisels "this is what youll be doing for the next minutes " said steve jabo a museum specialist who like the other smithsonian hands working the event had the patience of a pre school teacher "go parallel to the object when you chisel so you dont chisel the object " he urged parents to urge their children "mainly slow and steady " those who had no use for slow and even less for steady could take comfort in the fact that they were dealing with what mr jabo referred to as disposable objects i e faux fossils "each one of them is a little battle scarred but thats what glue is for " he said indulgently "kids love this stuff they get to hammer and make a mess " "tooth alert tooth alert " called margaret noel a retired smithsonian employee who was helping her young charges sift through gravel for treasures like coral and crab claws "is that a real sharks tooth " asked nine year old billie coulson of washington transfixed by the curved chopper dangling from a chain around ms noels neck you betcha "this is fossil poop " ms coulsons six year old brother max announced loudly holding up a recent find "manta ray alert manta ray alert " ms noel called raking the gravel with a pink plastic knife "were going to find teeth and coral and beautiful shells i love seeing kids turned on by this " she said with a smile "they can find so much cool stuff they have much better eyes than i do " as he made his way around the three dozen activity tables and exhibitions dr wing overheard parents suggesting occupations like scientific illustrator or evolutionary biologist to their offspring hagan assmann "im and three quarters" needed no such career guidance "i like how fossils look i like their shape i like the way they are preserved " he explained while his father william a chevy chase financial consultant grinned ruefully "im not going to retire off him " mr assmann said "hes going to be a paleontologist " hagans ambition was music to dr wings ears "this is all about understanding where we come from " he said at the end of the afternoon "fossils are touchable tangible evidence of our ancestry "i want to believe that all kids start out wondering about the world around them " he added "it gets kind of beaten out of them but they begin as natural natural scientists " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
