the morning brief north korea u s agree on first steps online edition the wall street journal online north korea the u s and their negotiating partners reached a deal the exchange of millions of dollars in energy and food for an agreement to shut down the main source of north korean plutonium in what amounts to serious concessions from both pyongyang and washington but the most difficult issues including nuclear disarmament were left to future talks the six parties this morning sent copies of the accord to their capitals for confirmation and by late afternoon beijing time early this morning in the u s word had arrived that all the governments were on board under the deal within days north korea must shut down the yongbyon reactor the probable source of plutonium used in the atomic bomb tested last october and allow back into the country inspectors from the international atomic energy agency who will verify the process iaea inspectors were kicked out in early in the wake of a u s north korean dispute over an alleged uranium enrichment program that would have violated the deal north korea reached with the clinton administration in exchange for shutting down yongbyon north korea will get energy food and other kinds of aid equivalent in value to tons of heavy fuel oil as the associated press reports most if not all of that will come from south korea china and the u s while japan made clear it wont provide any energy aid until it has learned the fate of japanese citizens kidnapped long ago by north korea this and other sensitive issues will be the subject of talks also slated to begin within days and more prominent among these will be bilateral u s north korean talks previously taboo for the bush administration on ending u s trade sanctions and on the potential removal of the north from washingtons list of terrorism sponsoring countries after days the parties will move on to discussions aimed at replacing the korean wars cease fire with actual declarations of peace and the resolution of other issues if the process proves more resilient than past accords north korea could then get tons of additional heavy fuel oil but as the new york times points out the accord doesnt address the uranium program the u s claims the north confessed to having in october pyongyang later denied its existence and it leaves for future talks the fate of perhaps half a dozen nuclear bombs held by a country president bush grouped in his "axis of evil " still as some bush administration officials tell the times the u s "concluded that a step by step accord was their only choice and that it would be impossible to set a schedule for the norths disarmament without taking initial steps to build trust " and in doing so the wall street journal says the deal may deliver a rare "victory for the bush administrations battered foreign policy team " at the same time the journal notes it "exposes the administration to accusations from both conservatives and democrats that mr bush has returned to a clinton era arrangement with north korea " the arrangement was long derided by mr bush even as critics said his refusal to bargain was allowing pyongyang to expand its arsenal and if the current deal is a "triumph" for secretary of state condoleezza rice as the journal says more hawkish members of the administration may still oppose it "it contradicts fundamental premises of the presidents policy hes been following for the past six years " former u n ambassador john bolton who remains close to vice president dick cheney said on cnn as the washington post reports "and second it makes the administration look very weak at a time in iraq when it needs to look strong " for north korea the willingness to relinquish its right to enrich plutonium also marks a reversal but now that it seems to have at least a small nuclear arsenal and all the bargaining power that represents pyongyang may have reasoned that the new aid and prospects for future security were worth it interpreting the iranian explosives a deal with north korea could allow the bush administration to devote more attention to iran but white house objectives in that direction remain difficult to parse a day after military officials in baghdad laid out what they said was evidence of iranian meddling in iraq skepticism was growing about the evidence explosives and other materiel and how it was made public as the new york times reports democratic rep silvestre reyes of texas the new chairman of the house intelligence committee "suggested that the white house was more interested in sending a message to tehran than in backing up serious allegations with proof " the times reports former administration weapons inspector david kay who led the post invasion search for wmd in iraq said the u s experience there should have taught the white house to be more transparent about the source of such provocative intelligence and marine gen peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that while the u s knows the explosives were made in iran "what i would not say is that the iranian government per se knows about this " as the washington post reports sec moves to limit investor lawsuits in what critics see as a significant pullback from the post enron tightening of investor protections the securities and exchange commission is moving on two fronts to shield corporations their executives and their accountants from investor lawsuits accusing them of fraud the new york times reports the sec last week filed a brief with the supreme court "urging the adoption of a legal standard that would make it harder for shareholders to prevail in fraud lawsuits against publicly traded companies and their executives " the times says and the chief sec accountant said recently that the commission is looking at ways to "protect accounting firms from large damage awards in cases brought by investors and companies " according to the times sec chairman christopher cox tells the times that both actions were aimed at limiting "fraudulent lawsuits" from the likes of "professional plaintiffs " and the intent was also to prevent further consolidation of
