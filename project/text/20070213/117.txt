the myth of superstar cities "if new york city is a business it isnt wal mart it isnt trying to be the lowest priced product in the market its a high end product maybe even a luxury product new york offers tremendous value but only for those companies able to capitalize on it " mayor michael bloomberg january these seem the best of times for americas elite cities wall streets megabonuses created thousands of instant millionaires and with their venture fund soulmates in places like san francisco boston and greenwich the best people are prowling for ferraris planes multimillion dollar condos the newest &# lunch place and the latest in high fashion in some markets office prices and rents are breaking all time records the bluest of the blue cities can also celebrate their rise to the top of the congressional pole speaker nancy pelosi of san francisco finance chairman barney frank of suburban boston and ways and means chairman charles rangel of manhattan all represent something of an economic coup for the "good rich" such as dot com billionaires subsidized downtown real estate developers and "enlightened" investment bankers the new notables most likely wont find fault with their constituents windfalls as they have with those of the oil companies the pharmaceutical firms or wal mart yet these triumphs obscure the longer term developments that continue to reshape metropolitan america economic and demographic trends suggest that the future of american urbanism lies not in the elite cities but in younger more affordable and less self regarding places over the past years it has been opportunistic newcomers houston charlotte las vegas phoenix dallas riverside that have created the most new jobs and gained the most net domestic migration in contrast there has been virtually negligible long term net growth in jobs or positive domestic migration to places like new york los angeles boston or the san francisco bay area what as much as anything distinguishes elite places what wharton real estate professor joe gyourko calls "the superstar cities" are their absurdly high real estate prices new york boston san francisco and los angeles have long been more expensive than say dallas houston or phoenix but in recent years the difference in price he calculates has increased beyond all reason san francisco prices since for example have grown at twice the national rate for the largest metropolitan areas this is good news for those who hold property but has been less than a blessing for those middle class families who might want to enter these markets in some superstar cities less than of households can afford a median priced home nationally the average is about mr gyourko traces these surging prices to two basic causes first there remains in superstar cities a remarkable concentration of very high earning families who can bid up real estate the second factor lies with the regulatory and tax regimes which greatly limit the production of housing and job opportunities particularly for middle income families not only in the city cores but in surrounding areas of course high productivity from educated workers and companies resident in these cities also contributes to the superstar phenomena but mr gyourko asserts these earning are not nearly high enough to explain the massive real estate price differential "you dont have to be productive to live in these places you just have to have money " mr gyourko suggests what drives the process is a simple combination of limited middle class housing options combined with strong demand among the wealthy given the economic centrality and cultural vitality of a place like new york there remains a sizeable top echelon many in business that can and does consume the bloombergian "luxury product" as their primary or secondary residence the high price trend is further exaggerated by the large concentrations of "trustafarians " or those with large amounts of inherited capital in these areas many of these people have multiple residences in some manhattan buildings as many of half of the owners are non residents but can still drive up prices together with top end business types they can create what mr gyourko describes as "the vailization" effect that is turning part of the city into something akin to a high amenity resort area a "scarce luxury good" for a relative few and those who must remain behind to service them so what about the rest of the hoi polloi what is their urban future for the most part sadly not in the "superstar" cities middle class people have been fleeing the expensive cities for more affordable ones for a generation and the migration has continued as the price differentials have grown fortunately the jobs are headed in the same direction after all companies depend not only on elite mbas but upon on the collective skills of middle managers technicians and skilled laborers most companies also tend to be more mindful of basic costs taxes and regulations than the average hedge fund manager or trustafarian this perhaps explains why the largest companies with the notable exception of silicon valley have continued to move toward the more opportunistic cities new york and its environs for example had such firms in in the number had dropped to less than half that some of those running with only skeleton top management houston in contrast had only one fortune company in today it is home to over houston companies tend to staff heavily locally this is one reason the city was able to replace new york and other high cost locales as the nations unchallenged energy capital another example of this trend is charlottes rise as the nations second ranked banking center in terms of assets surpassing san francisco chicago and los angeles indeed all superstar cities except new york the non superstar cities have become the nations most prodigious centers for job creation between and job growth in las vegas averaged over annually phoenix and riverside well over houston atlanta dallas and charlotte right around new york city l a boston chicago and san francisco all remained well less than since these divergences have if anything actually widened one reason is that superstar cities have continued to hemorrhage prodigious numbers of blue collar jobs including in fields such as manufacturing and warehousing that once sustained many urban working class families to be sure the superstar cities still likely boast far more high six and seven figure incomes in finance and other business services but in any industry this covers only a relatively small minority of workers overall according to data collected by pepperdine universitys mike shires the average real income after factoring in taxes and the cost of living of workers in professional business services is actually higher in places like phoenix denver houston and dallas than in the pricey environs of san francisco new york boston or l a some urban boosters see these shifts to the high end as evidence of superiority after all they argue only the "best" remain while immigrants the poor and ordinary middle income slobs migrate out to the suburbs and other less elite regions yet even here the demographic trends are not nearly so promising over the past decade college educated workers who once disproportionately migrated to the superstar cities now appear to be tilting instead to more affordable family friendly places since riverside phoenix charlotte las vegas and dallas all have been among the big net gainers with such migrants in contrast new york boston l a and even the bay area a big winner in the s appear to have become among the highest net losers the big outlier here as in many things is washington d c where an ever expanding federal government and its satellites continue to draw in ever more educated workers another intriguing shift is taking place among immigrants the group who did much in the s to help reverse demographic and economic decline in places like new york recent census data suggests they are increasingly likely to move to more affordable business friendly places such as houston dallas charlotte and phoenix these phenomena have led andrew beveridge a sociologist at queens college to dismiss mayor bloombergs much ballyhooed projections of another million new yorkers to roughly nine million by mr beveridges numbers show that new yorks briefly impressive population growth is markedly slowing the growth in the immigrant population he notes appears to be dropping significantly since the late s new york has had high population expectations before s census estimates of million for proved a million off target this may be the case again now mr beveridge suggests unless the city finds ways to address the basic issues that affect the middle class high housing costs taxes regulation schools and lack of support for diverse small businesses particularly in the outer boroughs how else can new york hope to create opportunities for a population already overwhelmingly minority and predominately working class to raise such issues amidst todays giddiness tends to reap the scorn of many big city developers and other devotees of the superstar version of urbanism elite city boosters like academic richard florida consider any return to a traditional "back to basics" agenda as reflective of "neocon anti urbanism " this is something of an oddity where the fashionable "left" defines successful urbanism by its ability to lure the superaffluent the hypereducated and the avant garde or what dr florida calls "the greatest number of the most skilled people " one wonders what true progressives like harry truman or fiorella la guardia would think of such an approach la guardia or truman understood that great cities become so in large part due to the strivings of the upwardly mobile middle class and families not the elites of any stripe it may well be true as mr gyourko argues that as the nation grows to million or more there could be a niche for to such "productive resorts" serving as "enclaves of the wealthy " but the urban future today as in past generations will belong mostly to places that continue to draw and nurture the middle class which has driven the rise of most successful capitalist cities the game however is far from over some larger superstar cities like new york or l a may still possess enough economic and social diversity as well as the physical space to shift direction despite their dysfunctional political systems radical changes in tax regulatory and education policies including a new emphasis on practical skills training could restore their historic attraction to those who wish to start a small business or maintain a middle class family such a city might not pass always mayor bloombergs "luxury" calculus but to its residents it might seem super indeed mr kotkin an irvine senior fellow at the new america foundation is author of "the city a global history" modern library paperback he is working on a book on the american future
