antipsychotic drugs link to weight gain found new york scientists say they have pinpointed a mechanism in the brain that helps explain why certain antipsychotic drugs can trigger increased appetite and potentially dangerous weight gain in patients the side effect has cast a cloud on newer and more powerful drugs such as eli lilly &amp co s zyprexa used to treat schizophrenia and other mental illnesses significant weight gain increases the risk of life threatening complications including heart disease and diabetes the latest study appearing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences links a class of antipsychotics to brain chemicals that regulate appetite the mechanism was discovered in mice a similar link still needs to be established in people "if we understand why the drugs make you fat we can design drugs that dont do that " said solomon snyder professor of neuroscience at johns hopkins school of medicine and an author of the paper others include several colleagues from johns hopkins and a scientist from the university of vermont college of medicine in their research dr snyder and his team first turned their sights on an enzyme called ampk which monitors energy use in cells and is also suspected of regulating appetite when mice were given the antipsychotic medicine clozapine it increased the activity of ampk in their brains fourfold dr snyder says that the potency of the reaction led him to suspect that the drug was acting not directly on ampk itself but upon a cell receptor which then affected ampk activity but the brain has more than neurotransmitter receptors and dr snyder says his team "squandered &# on experiments" trying to pinpoint the right one he then came across past studies that showed how antipsychotics can block the histamine h receptor although none had shown the specific connection with weight gain he says the johns hopkins team now had a possible explanation the role of ampk in tests on mice the scientists found that by blocking the h receptor site they could increase ampk activity to the same extent that clozapine did in a more compelling experiment they gave the drug to genetically engineered mice lacking the h receptor and found that clozapine didnt increase ampk activity the research had established the three way link between the drug the histamine receptor and the change in activity of ampk "this is a very insightful study " says p murali doraiswamy chief of the division of biological psychiatry at duke university who read the paper but wasnt involved in the research "if the link is confirmed in humans the holy grail will be to try and develop newer antipsychotics that dont affect ampk " dr doraiswamy cautions that other mechanisms and other receptors might also play a role in the weight gain effect and it isnt clear whether they also act through ampk "uncovering these links is a huge priority for the field " dr doraiswamy says lilly for example gets more than &# billion in revenue each year from selling zyprexa last year the company booked a charge of nearly &# million to cover the settlement of about legal claims that generally alleged that lilly didnt properly warn of zyprexa side effects including diabetes lilly has said the claims were without merit some zyprexa lawsuits remain unsettled in november the national institutes of health kicked off a patient trial to determine the effect of the schizophrenia drug aripiprazole on metabolic changes including weight gain and cholesterol levels the drug is marketed as abilify by bristol myers squibb co and otsuka pharmaceutical co
