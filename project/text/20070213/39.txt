energy chinas cloudy oil data smuggling muddies usage estimates vexing markets to understand how china can confound efforts to quantify its surging demand it helps to know that within its borders petroleum can sometimes be red or white "white" oil and "red" oil are the names given to illegal or unregistered oil products smuggled into and out of the country every day analysts and traders believe they amount to only a tiny part of chinas huge consumption of oil still such contraband sales combined with domestic oil stock data kept secret by the chinese government mean analysts dont have a clear picture of chinas overall oil use that can have a big impact on world oil prices in an unexpected surge in chinas demand startled markets and jump started oil prices a key point early in the three year oil price surge driven by growing global demand supply constraints and political uncertainty in oil producing regions the international energy agency which watches oil markets on behalf of the worlds industrialized nations last month criticized china for a lack of transparency and inconsistency in its oil data and the impact this had on its oil forecasts iea executive director claude mandil said chinas oil data needed to be improved nobody knows for sure just how much illegal diesel and gasoline is being sent in and out of china taking advantage of price differentials resulting from government price controls and tax policies the iea estimates chinas oil demand rose about last year to about seven million barrels of oil and refined products a day and contraband supplies likely make up a small portion of that but tiny differences can matter in a time of tight differences between supply and demand "what really matters is not the volume sometimes even a small volume could cause a large impact on local supply and demand " said yan kefeng director of china energy with cambridge energy research associates "red" oil refers to diesel officially available in hong kong only to local industrial and shipping users and dyed that color to denote its low tax status it also can be found in use over the border in southern china by motorists truck drivers farm workers and fishermen though industry observers say the activity has eased somewhat because the difference between its prices and chinas government set prices have narrowed the hong kong government said it seized liters of red oil last year in cases as part of its efforts from jan to feb this year it seized liters of red oil in four cases the hong kong customs department in an email response to questions said it coordinates its efforts with mainland customs officials and uses radar to find fishing vessels that may be engaged in smuggling "white" oil is the local name given mostly to gasoline and ordinary diesel either exported illegally from china or occasionally smuggled in from hong kong taiwan or vietnam to offset local shortages on the mainland the average retail price of gasoline in southern china now is about four to five yuan a liter compared with hk&# to hk&# a liter in hong kong in u s currency those comparisons equal about to cents per liter in southern china and about &# to &# a liter in hong kong "the bigger differential between retail prices and world market prices the more likely smuggling is to occur " said lawrence eagles head of oil industry and markets division at the iea chinas oil price system can lead to local shortages and sometimes rationing of transport fuels which is another incentive for smuggling chinas ex refinery and retail prices for oil products are set by the government but wholesale prices levied on distributors are controlled mostly by two oil majors china petrochemical corp or sinopec group and china national petroleum corp when international oil prices rise they usually lift wholesale prices to above government set retail prices to avoid losses that can makes things uneconomical for private sector filling station operators the companies also sometimes sell gasoline to higher paying legitimate offshore customers adding to shortages in southern china are drivers from hong kong coming across the border to fill up on relatively cheap gasoline or diesel subsidies in other countries also can affect the flow china officially exports large volumes of gasoline to vietnam which doesnt have any refineries of its own but as it is then sold locally at subsidized prices smugglers find it profitable to send it back to china before chinas domestic retail prices of oil products were higher than international prices which led to a heavy inflow of illegal oil noted qiu xiaofeng an analyst with chinas everbright securities chinas prices now are often lower shifting the incentive for many smugglers the beijing authorities are trying with limited success to clamp down on smuggling but penalties for smaller scale criminals arent particularly severe under chinas law a criminal investigation isnt usually launched for smuggling cases involving less than yuan or about &# wrongdoers caught with less need to pay fines and arent usually sent to jail hong kong and chinese newspapers are full of stories of truck drivers fishermen and other smalltime smugglers known by local police as "oil ants" getting caught occasionally the big players take a fall one smuggler accused in a chinese court was lai changxing who government officials have said was the kingpin of a multimillion dollar smuggling ring chinese investigators have said mr lai smuggled as much as &# billion of goods including oil as well as autos textiles and electronics products and skirted nearly &# billion in import duties chinese state run media have said mr lai smuggled in million tons of refined oil valued at billion yuan &# billion into china between and mr lai who denies the charges fled to canada in august and china has being trying to extradite him one technique used to try to hoodwink the authorities is to treat red stained hong kong diesel with bleach traders and analysts say smuggling by fishermen is concentrated in southeastern chinas fujian and zhejiang provinces and sometimes involves small tankers loaded with illegal diesel waiting in international waters near the taiwan strait in the early morning fishing boats leave mainland ports with their tanks nearly empty when in international waters they top up with fuel for fishing and then when the trip is finished go back to the oil tankers and fill up as much diesel as possible which is later resold onshore according to the anti smuggling office in guangzhou in guangdong province and quoted in state run media local customs officials caught about boats smuggling oil in up from or boats in and aries poon contributed to this article
