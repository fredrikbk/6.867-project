when east met west nixon and mao by margaret macmillan random house pages &# chinese dictator mao zedong was nearly and a sick man when began he suffered from congestive heart failure with high blood pressure and a racking cough caused by fluid in his lungs but in february mao wrenched himself out of bed he had his first shave and haircut in months tried on a new suit and shoes made specially to fit his bloated limbs he was visibly excited he was getting a visit from the president of the united states richard m nixon mao ordered prime minister zhou enlai to bring nixon to him immediately after air force one flown from shanghai by chinese pilots touched down at beijing airport on feb the two national leaders smiled as cameras recorded their historic handshake they sat in neighboring armchairs and talked for nearly an hour at which point a tired mao called a halt he had rebuffed nixons efforts to discuss substantive issues saying he dealt only with "philosophical" matters but what really mattered was the handshake it signaled a rapprochement of sorts between capitalist america and communist china mao and nixon knew it would serve their separate political ends untold thousands of words have been spun out by writers and commentators in the years since that meeting it even figures into "nixon in china " a opera by composer john adams and librettist alice goodman one would think there was not much more to be said but historian margaret macmillan at the university of toronto has demonstrated that even an event suffering from media overkill can be made to sound fresh with prodigious research and skillful writing her "nixon and mao" is a readable account of the winks and nods and secret diplomacy beginning in the late fall of that led to the visit she describes the intricate bargaining with zhou mainly over taiwans status conducted by the americans after they arrived president nixon and national security adviser henry kissinger wanted zhous help in making a graceful exit from the unpopular war in indochina both sides hoped to check soviet expansionism by raising the threat of a possible alliance they succeeded to a degree as ms macmillans accounts of kremlin nervousness make clear the author offers succinct profiles of the four main protagonists nixon mao zhou and mr kissinger as well as capsule histories of the mutual suspicions of the u s russia and china some pages of notes and bibliography and the acknowledgment of a string of research assistants attest to the prodigious mining of published materials the author also interviewed mr kissinger and other players in the drama including six from the chinese side ms macmillan does no gilding of mao she estimates that million chinese died in his disastrous "great leap forward" agricultural and industrial "reforms" of the late s and that further millions were killed or injured during the cultural revolution maos exercise in red guard mayhem he executed anyone suspected of plotting against him his psychopathic tendencies were displayed at a shanghai performance when he continued laughing and talking with his companions after a child acrobat was badly injured in a fall and yet as so often happens when a dictator locks up a nation from public view the world was fascinated with the mystery of china nixons popularity ratings shot up after the visit mr kissinger was entranced with zhou saying that "he moved gracefully and with dignity filling the room not with his physical dominance as did mao or de gaulle but by his air of controlled tension steely discipline and self control as if he were a coiled spring " such effusiveness can perhaps be written off as the admiration of one practitioner of high stakes politics for another of equal skill zhou was only a moderate when compared with mao he exploited the nixon visit by telling the chinese people that the president had come hat in hand to kowtow to chairman mao some critics have argued that the star struck americans were out foxed by mao and zhou lured into making dangerous concessions on the status of taiwan beijing obviously was successful in concealing how much more china needed america than america needed china primarily because of the soviet threat on its border on the other hand the modus vivendi worked out by mr kissinger and zhou which included the withdrawal of u s troops from taiwan doesnt seem to have done taiwan a great deal of harm it became a democracy with de facto independence from the mainland and its well to do investors have acquired a large and profitable stake in the china boom as for indochina the u s got no serious help from zhou and the ultimate exit from vietnam was far from graceful thanks in part to a peremptory cutoff of funds by congress after the hash mao made of the chinese economy deng xiaoping would have set a new capitalistic course in even if there had been no nixon visit but it was probably useful to him that the late mao himself had entertained a capitalist chieftain as to the soviet union it ultimately collapsed one little problem i have with ms macmillans smooth flowing narrative is her remark that nixon was the "best prepared president on foreign policy until bill clinton " its not clear what she means by that but it seems to ignore the president who "well prepared" or not actually did change the world by leading the western democracies to a clear victory in the cold war ronald reagan oh well "nixon and mao" is a darn good read pulling together the many elements of a fascinating episode in american foreign policy mr melloan retired last year as an editorial page columnist and deputy editor
