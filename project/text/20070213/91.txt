politics &amp economics iraq debate in congress shifts focus washington the iraq debate in congress is quickly moving beyond nonbinding resolutions of disapproval to the question of how far lawmakers will go to restrict funding for the war before the first votes are cast republican leaders concede president bush has lost the support of bipartisan majorities in both the house and senate which oppose his decision to add at least soldiers in coming months senate action was prevented last week only because of a procedural fight in the house as many as to republicans could join democrats in adopting a narrowly written resolution of disapproval to be voted on friday conceding defeat in this first round republicans want to skip ahead to the money fight because it is a more difficult forum for the wars critics who must find a way to restrict the presidents policy without seeming to hurt u s troops the two paragraph house resolution avoids this subject by pledging to "protect" u s forces nonetheless republican leader john boehner of ohio was quick to accuse democrats of taking the "first step" to cut off "funding of american troops who are in harms way " the mounting war costs make it a fight about money as well as policy the pentagon has begun to say the increase will be closer to when support personnel are counted that would bring the total u s troop level in iraq to about soldiers but the administration has budgeted for that number only through sept after which the fiscal numbers assume troop levels of about according to the white house budget office a &# billion pentagon appropriations bill including war funding for will be debated this summer if the soldier level were to be maintained through the end of this calendar year it could strain even that budget the house appropriations committee meets march on the administrations &# billion request for emergency war funds through the final months of this fiscal year it includes &# billion for iraqi security forces money that will be a target of critics for added conditions or outright cuts there is also pressure among democrats to add language to bar u s military action against iran unless authorized by congress rep john murtha d pa the bills manager doesnt rule out a move to force the start of a u s withdrawal from iraq if benchmarks arent met "the best thing to help the troops is get em out of there " he said however mr murtha says he will focus first on recommending steps that restrict the pentagons ability to implement the presidents policy without hurting units in the field for example he wants service chiefs to certify that each new unit sent to iraq has the training and equipment needed language could be added to prohibit some of the shortcuts commonly used to maintain troop strength and the integrity of units given the shortage of personnel he would restrict "stop loss" procedures which are used to keep soldiers such as young non commissioned officers in a unit about to deploy even when their enlistments are running out extended tours in iraq would be prohibited soldiers would be guaranteed a year at home before going back "we want to guarantee at least a year at home " mr murtha said "then no stop loss and we want to make sure they are not extended " if enacted these requirements would have real impact on an army already straining to complete the increased troop level target by late may the combination of allowing no extensions plus a full year of "dwell" time in the u s between tours could set a cap on u s strength below current levels one defense department official estimated nothing so restrictive is being attempted in the house debate this week the bare bones resolution simply expresses disapproval for mr bushs decision last month to deploy more troops debate will begin today with a vote likely on friday senators had attempted a much wordier resolution and couldnt hide their frustration at the prospect of the house going first "the house is debating and the senate is dithering " said sen olympia snowe r maine
