politics &amp economics china tilts green climate concerns sway beijing beijing buffeted by a year of deadly typhoons in the south and unusual droughts in the west chinas leaders are voicing rising concern over how vulnerable the worlds most populous nation is to the effects of global warming whether the unusual weather is directly related to climate change blunt acknowledgment of chinas exposure to its dangers and the beginnings of an effort to address it represent a subtle but important shift for beijing chinese leaders have until now mostly blamed the west for contributing to a problem they said their country couldnt afford to tackle china has long prioritized getting rich over going green while acknowledging concerns about global warming qin dahe director of the china meteorological administration said recently that "development is the first urgent task its a firm principle and moreover we need good and fast development only then will we be able to step by step solve the problem " now as china is emerging as a fast growing polluter its leaders are beginning to worry that global warming isnt just a rich mans problem a hotter planet could be as big a roadblock to economic growth and social stability as the pollution limits policy makers had dismissed the chinese government is reviewing an assessment of the risks facing the country if nothing is done to stem global warming and preparing its first national strategy for combating the problem among the warnings in the report rising temperatures could threaten chinas food security beijing also is embracing carbon credits the kyoto protocol program in which companies in developed countries that have agreed to limit emissions can invest in reducing output of the gases in developing countries in exchange the companies are allowed to produce more emissions than they otherwise would last year there was a surge in the number of pollution reduction projects approved by the government after a period of foot dragging beijing also is seeking to set up a carbon exchange that would match chinese sellers of carbon credits with foreign buyers "theres a lot of strong commitment by china which is not getting major attention " said khalid malik the head of the united nations development program in china the program is advising beijing on setting up the carbon exchange china is the worlds second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases so named because they warm the earth by trapping the suns rays in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide or pollutants linked to global warming and some scientists say it will soon surpass the u s in the top spot if it hasnt done so already yesterday beijing acknowledged it had failed to reach its own targets for reducing major pollutants in because high growth outpaced control efforts emissions of sulfur dioxide the acid rain causing byproduct of coal burning rose last year compared with in according to the state environmental protection administration beijings goal was to reduce such emissions sulfur dioxide isnt a greenhouse gas but burning coal also releases carbon dioxide in india which has a billion people and is growing at a breakneck pace similar to chinas there also is rising awareness of the toll a hotter globe will take at home with new delhi preoccupied with issues such as reducing poverty and shoring up infrastructure cutting greenhouse gas emissions is likely to take a backseat for the time being any moves to curb emissions will likely come from international aid or foreign investment through the carbon credit program in china the awareness that something more needs to be done is taking root just as heavy industry is advancing at a faster pace one result is the governments growing emphasis on trading carbon credits chinas leaders also are working on formulating the countrys first national strategy on climate change they arent talking about setting limits on greenhouse gases something most developed countries excluding the u s signed on to do under the kyoto agreement while china and india signed that pact they are exempt from greenhouse gas caps but china is launching a drive to use energy more efficiently a move some analysts say could have a similar impact to an emissions cap the central government also is investing in upgrading radar and satellite capabilities to track changing weather patterns said wang bangzhong an official from the china meteorological administration this past year has seen unusual weather wreak havoc on china typhoons in the south destroyed fishing fleets and leveled villages the worst drought since has shriveled the mighty yangtze river and left some cities desperate for water record breaking balmy weather in beijing has befuddled a city accustomed to bitter cold winters while global warming may not be causing all the irregular weather scientists say china could be especially vulnerable to climate alterations coastal flooding from melting polar glaciers could submerge the commercial centers of shanghai and shenzhen higher temperatures would devastate the large portion of chinese farmers who scratch by in semiarid regions and most of chinas big rivers are fed by glaciers which are fast disappearing depleting what already is one of the worlds lowest per capita water supplies a national evaluation on the impact of climate change paints a sobering picture and warns of crop shortages increasing floods in the rich coastal river deltas and higher energy use to ward off mounting heat crop output could fall to by according to estimates by the meteorological administration rising sea levels by will increase floods along the deltas of the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers areas that support the bulk of chinas manufacturing and export might chinas scientists have never denied any connection between greenhouse gases and global warming still beijing has long argued that per capita emissions in china were much lower than in the west and that china didnt have the money or technology to clean them up the result has been a surge in greenhouse gases from china as its economy in recent years has taken a sharp turn away from the light industry that made it rich in the first years of its economic emergence and toward highly polluting energy intensive heavy industry instead of trying to cap greenhouse gas output chinas leaders last year decided to try to reduce energy intensity the amount of coal and other fuels the country burns relative to economic output chinese scientists say this will be a keystone of the new climate change policy on a per capita basis china uses about one eighth the amount of energy that the u s uses beijing has set a goal of quadrupling its economic output but only doubling the amount of energy consumed changes in chinas energy consumption could have a big impact on global warming because china still relies primarily on highly polluting coal fired power plants for electricity even though it is working on diversifying its energy sources the government has required key state owned enterprises and provincial governors to sign contracts pledging to reduce energy consumed relative to economic output by over five years the target was apparently missed the first year it was set but chinese scientists say there is a chance it will be reached as the policy is more fully implemented eric
