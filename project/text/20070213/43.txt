eurolinks daily view pyongyang disarmament deal awaits kim jong ils pleasure online edition in the end the tentative agreement on initial steps for pyongyangs disarmament apparently came down to the energy details in a sweeping deal framework that was largely arranged by the u s in two way talks with north korea last month energy is critically important for the country which is believed able to generate only about half its electricity needs the tentative deal involves what u s assistant secretary of state christopher hill terms commitments on disarmament and energy assistance along with initial actions to be made by specific deadlines in three days of talks in berlin last month mr hill and north korea envoy kim kye gwan resolved several disputes and created the framework of a deal under it north korea would shut down its sole nuclear plant which provides spent fuel that can be reprocessed into weapons material and begin to take other disarmament steps it also would take steps toward friendlier relations with the u s japan and south korea in return the five countries would provide north korea with economic assistance chiefly in the form of free fuel oil and electricity the u s would resolve a portion of a banking dispute with pyongyang which appears to have been critical in tightening the screws on kim jong il and his inner circle the countries planned to set up five working groups to implement the various parts of the deal and schedule regular meetings as often as every month the tentative agreement now requires review by the governments of the six countries at
