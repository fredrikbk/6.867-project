weekend journal books buttering up vs taking down who occupies the higher moral ground the flatterer or the insult slinger sticks and stones by jerome neu oxford pages &# in praise of flattery by willis goth regier university of nebraska pages &# in august new york mayor ed koch recovering in the hospital following a minor stroke received a visit from andrew stein the city council president after a little chit chat mr stein emerged to inform the media that the mayor whom he had long viewed as a political rival had been speaking very slowly the mayors communications adviser david garth replied on mr kochs behalf "what people dont understand is that when ed talks to andy he always talks slowly " ah the vanishing art of the great public put down to help us understand the ethics of insults both those that zing like mr garths and those that whistle harmlessly past their targets "you can always tell when the republicans are getting restless " hillary clinton has said "because the vice presidents motorcade pulls into the capitol and darth vader emerges" we now have a full scale philosophical treatment of the subject jerome neus "sticks and stones " mr neu leads his readers into many a satisfying alleyway of mortifying wit we spend some time with "the shakespeare insult kit " which offers choice adjectives and nouns from the bards work that one can configure in any number of combinations such as "thou dankish fat kidneyed moldwarp" or "thou mammering onion eyed ratsbane " we come across camille paglias comments on various feminists calling one of them an "imploding beanbag of poisonous self pity" and all generally "unlearned unreadable bores with their garbled rumbling hollow rolling trashcan style " mr neu spends time as well on the reactions of insultees from the insouciant katharine hepburn "i never cared what anybody wrote about me as long as it wasnt the truth" to the philosopher soren kierkegaard who reeling from the unkind remarks hurled at him by the good people of copenhagen because his pants cuffs were uneven felt he was "being trampled to death by a flock of geese " all these byways though lead mr neu toward his main point he believes that an insult is much like an assault the only difference being that the one wounds mentally and the other physically from dame ednas "sucker punches" "i love that outfit youve chosen is it reversible " to don imuss often lame curmudgeonly strikes "bald headed weasel " etc insults should be subjected to the sorts of moral appraisals we reserve for physical aggressiveness whether locker room towel snaps or vicious attacks even the words "insult" and "assault " mr neu notes share common etymological origins to put mr neus claims in sharper relief it will help to think about them alongside willis goth regiers "in praise of flattery " an elegant analysis of the opposite social form mr regiers title is at least partly ironic since as he allows there is something morally dubious about flattery its not that flatterers always whisper sweet lies they can just as easily speak truths rather as mr regier says in discussing an analogy made by the writer richard stengel flattery is a type of bribery true or false it is uttered with an ulterior motive to elicit a favor or simply to stay in the good graces of the flattered personage if insults are a form of assault and flattery a species of bribery then together the arguments of messrs neu and regier pose an irresistible question who is morally worse the insulter or the flatterer perhaps another way of asking it would be why have the worlds leading moralists from plutarch to dante to montaigne to bacon all savaged flatterers while giving insulters a free pass there are a few reasons since flattery is not simply praise but praise with a purpose because it is intentional meant to draw forth something in return it reflects on the flatterers character by contrast insults like physical injuries can be unintentionally inflicted mr neu tells the tale of the actor john gielgud who certainly didnt mean to insult his dull lunch companion eddie knoblock when noticing a certain person near their restaurant table he observed "that man is the second biggest bore in london " "who is the first " mr knoblock inquired "why eddie knoblock of course " mr gielgud blurted out then catching himself said "i dont mean you eddie i mean the other eddie knoblock " insulters can be innocent of ill intent though their insults may well be true it is also possible for an insult to be deserved even if it is false you dont have to believe that andrew stein is dim witted to conclude that he had somehow earned david garths put down thats because insults like assaults can be a matter of self defense mr garth was defending mayor koch cleverly inflicting collateral damage to mr steins intelligence along the way when it comes to flattery by contrast it is deserved only if it is true if you dont believe that paris hilton was one of the most "fascinating people of " in the words of barbara walters ever interested in snagging celebrity interviews then youre unlikely to think that ms hilton deserves such praise on other grounds but while flattery must be true to be deserved it can do the trick elicit favors or warm feelings whether it is true or false if its true as mr regier notes the person being flattered will regard the flatterer as a shrewd observer and may be moved to reward him if flattery is false however reward may follow anyway "we love flattery " emerson wrote "even though we are not deceived by it because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted " flattery can win favors either way of course but insults cease to sting when they completely fail the truth test then they become less like real assaults and more like pro wrestling matches nobody really gets hurt generic taunts mr neu writes of friars roasts and "yo mama" exchanges dont wound because they say nothing in particular about their victim for an insult to bite it must have at least one foot planted in the truth as when norman mailer described j d salinger as the "greatest mind ever to stay in prep school" or for that matter when king james described john donnes poems as "like the peace of god for they pass all understanding " perhaps the flatterers most unflattering feature is that to succeed he must as mr regier says "corrupt" the object of his praise plumping up vanity to the point where it overcomes modesty or common sense weve all felt this strange effect having listened to over kind words about ourselves and feeling a strong nearly irresistible impulse to believe them even when we know that they are untrue and that they are shamelessly serving the agenda of the person uttering them obviously insult entails no similar kind of corruption of the target together messrs neu and regier give the moral high ground to insulters over flatterers for an insult to work it must show at least some acquaintance with the truth but it can still be deserved even if that acquaintance is merely a nodding one insults can also arise without any malign intent or corrupting effect no wonder it was the purveyor of flattery not the slinger of insults whom dante consigned to the eighth circle of hell the ninth went to traitors but thats another story mr starks books include "the limits of medicine" and "conflict of interest in american public life "
