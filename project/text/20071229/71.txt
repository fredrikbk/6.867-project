weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations be reasonable by next week politically active iowans will have met and tallied their votes their decision this year will have a huge impact on the election and a decisive impact on various candidacies some will be done in some will be made some will land just right or wrong and wake up the next day to read raves or obits a week after that new hampshire the endless campaign is in fact nearing its climax but all eyes are on iowa iowans bear a heck of a lot of responsibility this year the first time since when there is no incumbent president or vice president in the race all of it is wide open iowa can make obama real it can make hillary yesterday it can make huckabee a phenom and not a flash mccain the future and not the past moments like this happen in history theyre the reason we get up in the morning "what happened " "who won " this is my slogan reasonable person for president that is my hope what i ask iowa to produce and i claim here to speak for thousands millions we are grown ups we know our country needs greatness but we do not expect it and will settle at the moment for good we just want a reasonable person we would like a candidate who does not appear to be obviously insane wed like knowledge judgment a prudent understanding of the world and of the ways and histories of the men and women in it here are two reasonables joe biden and chris dodd they have been united states senators for a combined years theyve read a raw threat file or two they have experience sophistication the long view they know how it works no one will have to explain it to them mitt romney yes characterological cheerfulness personal stability and a good brain would be handy to have around he hasnt made himself wealthy by seeing the world through a romantic mist he has a sophisticated understanding of the challenges we face in the global economy i personally am not made anxious by his flip flopping on big issues because everyone in politics gets to change his mind once that is you can be pro life and then pro choice but you cant go back to pro life again because if you do youll look like a flake the positions mr romney espouses now are the positions he will stick with he has no choice john mccain yes remember when he was the wild man in for republicans on the ground he was a little outre if republicans on the ground said "outre " as opposed to the more direct "nut job " george w bush then was the moderate more even toned candidate times change mr mccain is an experienced personally heroic seasoned blunt eyed irascible american character he makes me proud he makes everyone proud barack obama yes i think so he has earned the attention of the country with a classy campaign with a disciplined and dignified staff and with passionate supporters such as jfk hand ted sorensen who has told me he sees in obamas mind and temperament the kind of gifts kennedy displayed during the cuban missile crisis mr obama is thoughtful and it would be a pleasure to have a president who is highly literate and a writer of books is he experienced enough no hes not old enough either men in their s love drama too much young politicians on fire over this issue or that tend to see politics as a stage on which they can act out their greatness and we dont need more theatrics more comedies or tragedies but mr obama doesnt seem on fire he seems like a calm liberal with a certain moderating ambivalence the great plus of his candidacy more than anyone else he turns the page if he rises he is something new in history good or bad and a new era begins hillary clinton no not reasonable i concede her sturdy mind deep sophistication and seriousness of intent i see her as a triangulator like her husband not a radical but a maneuverer in the direction of a vague half forgotten but always remembered leftism it is also true that she has a command and control mentality an urgent insistent and grating sense of destiny and she appears to believe that any act that benefits clintons is a virtuous act because clintons are good and deserve to be benefited but this is not actually my central problem with her candidacy my central problem is that the next american president will very likely face another big bad thing a terrible day or days and in that time it will be crucial crucial that our nation be led by a man or woman who can be at least for the moment and at least in general trusted mrs clinton is the most dramatically polarizing the most instinctively distrusted political figure of my lifetime yes i include nixon would she be able to speak the nation through the trauma i do not think so and if i am right that simple fact would do as much damage to america as the terrible thing itself duncan hunter fred thompson and bill richardson are all reasonable mature accomplished nonradical mike huckabee gets enough demerits to fall into my not reasonable column john edwards is not reasonable all the democrats would raise taxes as president but mr edwardss populism is the worst of both worlds both intemperate and insincere also we cant have a president who spent two minutes on youtube staring in a mirror and poofing his hair really we just cant i forgot rudy giuliani that must say something he is reasonable but not desirable if he wins somewhere ill explain because much of the drama is on the democratic side a thought on what might be said when they win or lose if mrs clinton wins modesty is in order with a graceful nod to mr obama if she loses well the clintons havent lost an election since for a quarter century shes known only victory at the polls does she know how to lose however she acts whatever face she shows it will be revealing humility would be a good strategy in politics you have to prove you can take a punch i just took one on second thought thats a bad idea she might morph at the podium into robert deniro in "raging bull" and ad lib the taunt you didnt knock me down ray im still standing for mr obama a lot of america will be looking at him for the first time and under the most favorable circumstances as the winner of something this is an opportunity to assert freshly what his victory means and will mean for america this is a break with the past a break with the tired old argument a break with the idea of dynasty the idea of the machine the idea that there are forces in motion that cannot be resisted but what is it besides a break from what is it a step toward an embrace of good luck iowa the eyes of the nation are upon you
