weekend journal books how the kitchen got hot the warmest room in the house by steven gdula bloomsbury pages &# yes of course you are what you eat but you may well have to cook whatever it is you are eating and the tools and techniques for doing so can say as much about you as the food itself if you want to understand the workings of a people thomas jefferson once said referring to the french as they headed toward revolution "look into their cooking pots " we are way past mere pots these days the american kitchen is a place of motors and chips and sensors and specialized appliances you arent in the game if you dont have an espresso maker a bosch oven and a sub zero refrigerator as for those once pedestrian vessels that sit on a hot stove they have evolved too the promotional copy for one line of products describes woks crepe pans fish poachers and roasting pans as well as products for "specialty uses " such as "making pommes anna " the same firm also offers a "zabaglione preparation bowl of solid copper " the kitchen has gone from a workplace characterized by drudgery and even danger to a kind of studio devoted to self expression and truth be told a certain amount of ostentation whereas middle class people once liked to show off the new basement rec room with its pool table they now parade their guests through the kitchen with its new viking range how one wonders did such a transformation happen this is one of the questions that steven gdula endeavors to answer in "the warmest room in the house " he begins by exploring the movement that went about "elevating domestic duties out of the home fires ashes " the proselytizer in chief was fannie farmer and her followers who "christened themselves domestic scientists " cooks had previously worked at least partly by intuition and local lore with her best selling "boston cooking school cook book " farmer made something of a fetish out of level and exact measurements this was science after all but the kitchen as mr gdula also notes is not merely a place for ever more expert cooking it is an emblem of domesticity and a gauge of social self definition the kitchen he shows was celebrated as a kind of second front during the world war i while the doughboys were "over there " american women were doing their bit back home by canning food and making pleasing dinners out of mere mashed potatoes and leftover fish the s were about a more desperate form of frugality which may explain the introduction of spam by the s the fda commissioner was intoning that "our industry will not have done its job until housewives buy most of their meals as packaged ready to serve items " it must be said that when it comes to social history mr gdula often trades in cliche the s in his account suffered from a stifling conformity who knew as for the s "cultural differences also separated americans in the sixties and a young politician by the name of john f kennedy proposed a vision for america that protected personal freedoms and guaranteed equality " one wishes that mr gdula had left the new frontier alone and stuck to the stove he is much more interesting when he outlines the rise of julia child the abiding tension between diet books and cookbooks and the appearance of appliances as faddish as the fondue pot and as durable as the microwave mr gdula does an especially good job on the food related double consciousness of americans in recent decades we are after all a people who once embraced freeze dried coffee and now roast and grind our own beans only the best from kenya will do and the kitchen though filled with high tech wizardry is often the warm place in the house where families unpack the bags and boxes that a local takeout place has just delivered who has time to cook mr norman is the editor of vermonttiger com
