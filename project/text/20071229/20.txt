junk bonds suffer tough year but investors cheer return of volatility market too frothy it has been a bruising year for junk bonds which were caught up in the repricing of risk as a result of problems originating in the subprime mortgage market and weighed down by a backlog of new issuance returns for junk or "high yield " bonds have shrunk to a meager as draws to a close a downbeat performance after s double digit gains still the return of some volatility after a long bull run is welcome as is the return of a measure of sanity in pricing levels particularly for those fund managers who had deemed the market too frothy for its own good "when the market was just screaming higher its frustrating to someone who cares about what they own " said kevin lorenz high yield portfolio manager at tiaa cref the largest u s retirement fund with &# billion in total assets under management "now what youre seeing is the field is spreading out what were all witnessing is that a lot of people didnt understand what they owned " mr lorenz said "with the repricing that weve just witnessed thats creating opportunities " as ever when markets are in a state of flux there has been an overreaction with many bonds being punished despite no real signs of any deterioration in credit quality or a pick up in the default rate high yield fund managers feel their asset class has suffered unfairly as a result of the troubles in the investment grade sector and particularly banks which have been damaged badly by the subprime woes as a result this is the moment to pick through the asset classes and dig up those gems be warned however this is necessarily a complex and time consuming process as it is important to get it right "if you have sectors that are moving lower at least relative to treasurys but think the fundamentals have not deteriorated to the same degree thats a good way to hopefully get positioned and provide some good relative performance " said eric takaha director of corporates and high yield in franklin templeton investments fixed income group after a heavy slant in favor of issuers who were getting funds at extremely low interest rates the balance of power is shifting back toward investors this will probably mean issuers will have to offer more incentives either in the form of better yields or by adding more stringent covenants which are a way of providing additional protection to bondholders certainly some lessons have been reinforced over the past year liquidity the ability to buy or sell bonds when you need to has become extremely important as too many investors were either unable to sell their assets when they wanted to or were obliged to get rid of them at fire sale prices some investors have been upgrading their portfolios to ensure they are more protected in the event of more fallout in the corporate sector that can involve exchanging unsecured debt for secured debt which gives investors more rights over assets in the event of bankruptcy there is a debate over default rates which having been at record lows for years cannot but start to rise as has been flagged by ratings companies and investors alike for months or even years still no one is expecting a meltdown as many companies are in a fairly strong position will frozen lbo market finally start to thaw and then there is the fate of the leveraged buyout market a boom there in past years drove issuance in risky bonds and loans sharply higher as private equity firms snapped up companies and loaded them with debt to pay for the acquisition a backlog of risky bonds and particularly loans is sitting on the books at banks standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data unit estimates underwriters are holding onto &# billion of loans and &# billion of junk bonds that they need to sell optimists say that though it currently appears frozen eventually the lbo market will thaw barring a massive downturn in the economy lbos will almost certainly continue to feed the high yield bond market
