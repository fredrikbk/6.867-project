ask encore focus on retirement at retirement keep your k or move to ira i recently retired from a fortune company after years of service at retirement i left the money that had accumulated in my k account in my former employers plan ive been comfortable with my decision as the plan has investment options spread across all asset classes retirees can make unlimited withdrawals of &# or more from the plan without restrictions after you turn however several representatives at financial services and brokerage firms have recommended rolling over my k balance to an ira the primary reason they offer is that the ira has an almost unlimited number of investment options and thus in their opinion has more choices and flexibility i suspect that the firm and the representative also earn higher fees im very much interested in the pros and cons of this important financial question k or ira rollover upon retirement bruce allred baltimore you have hit upon one of the biggest reasons that people move their retirement savings to an individual retirement account a much larger number of possible investments "unless there is a compelling investment option thats in the k that isnt available to the retail investor i would roll the money over to an ira " says mark cortazzo a certified financial planner in parsippany n j but there are certainly pros and cons to each approach among the advantages of keeping your money in the company plan are your familiarity with the investment choices and management protection of your assets from creditors the opportunity to retain life insurance if its included in your plan the ability to borrow from your account if youre still an active employee and the delay of mandatory withdrawals beyond age if youre still working for the company the disadvantages to staying with your k plan include again more limited investment choices than those typically available in an ira limited access to your money and limited control over investment fees in contrast if you move your savings to an ira you get maximum flexibility in designing your portfolio and choosing investments this may not sound that appealing if you find yourself overwhelmed by all the choices out there but its important to keep in mind that your investment needs may be different in retirement than when you were working particularly for the fixed income portion of your portfolio where you might want "to lock in interest rates to have predictable income theres much more flexibility with an ira than a k because you can buy individual bonds versus a bond fund " mr cortazzo says you also have more flexibility in the way you can name beneficiaries most iras give you the option of leaving an inheritance "per stirpes " which means that if one of your named beneficiaries dies before you do his share would go to his children "very few k plans allow you to do that " mr cortazzo says one other thing to keep in mind he says if you have company stock in your k plan and the stock is performing well consider distributing it from the k plan before rolling over other assets to an ira any increase in the price of your company stock from the time you acquired it until the distribution called the stocks net unrealized appreciation or nua would be subject only to long term capital gains tax which has a maximum rate rather than ordinary income tax of up to ordinary income tax is what you pay on k or traditional ira withdrawals alternatively if you leave your company stock in your k or roll it over into an ira you could wind up paying higher income tax when you take it out there is some tax up front when you withdraw the company stock from your retirement plan you have to pay income tax on the original purchase amount or "cost basis " but you dont owe the capital gains tax until you sell the shares and any appreciation in the stock price between the time you take it out of your k plan and the time you die would get whats called a "step up" in basis meaning your heirs wouldnt owe tax on it mr cortazzo says send your question to encore wsj com ask encore focus on retirement is a weekly column answering readers questions about retirement and personal finance from annuities and bonds to trusts and inheritance issues please include your full name and city and state
