weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink heres how to get a kick from champagne novelist and polemicist hans koning once denounced the champagne cocktail with that peculiar combination of socialist prejudices an anticommercial solidarity with the everyman joined with a snobbish contempt for the average sort of person "the champagne cocktail " he wrote in a new york times magazine feature "while useful to impress a girl friend from bent flower iowa was invented strictly for the benefit of the restaurant owner not of the customer " well assume that konings assessment of sharp practice in the drinks conception was a rhetorical flourish because the invention of the champagne cocktail occurred a good century earlier then again koning who is best known for his tirades against old christopher columbus never did let the historical record get in his way of the many concoctions in jerry thomass original bartenders manual the "how to mix drinks or the bon vivants companion" there were only about a dozen "cocktails" so called the rest of the drinks fell into different categories altogether flips sangarees juleps crustas smashes daisies and such but among that protean group of "cocktails" was the champagne cocktail a drink of sugar angostura bitters and champagne that has barely changed in all those years its also worth pointing out that mark twain no bent flower rube he was known to call for a champagne cocktail on occasion and while in paris no less the new york times hadnt always been quite so supercilious in the matter of champagne cocktails as new years eve approached at the end of the paper suggested that they were a way to make "a fine extravagant gesture which after all need not turn out to be too extravagant " as long as something short of a "distinguished" bubbly is used still there was in the papers recommendation the implication that champagne cocktails were a way to make the best of bad wine david embury made it explicit in his influential book "the fine art of mixing drinks " arguing that "this cocktail is a decidedly inferior drink and no true champagne lover would ever commit the sacrilege of polluting a real vintage champagne by dunking even plain sugar much less bitters in it " ill agree with embury this far on those occasions when a bottle of vintage bollinger comes into my possession i wouldnt dream of adulterating it but i cant endorse emburys rant that if one had to "serve this incongruous mess just for the sake of putting on the dog " the cheapest of champagnes or even "an artificially carbonated white wine " would do in that faux show is the point no amount of sugar and bitters will redeem a lousy bottle of fizz use a cheap and nasty champagne and you will have a cheap nasty champagne cocktail as in so many things an aristotelian mean between the extremes is the answer dont waste the best stuff by turning it into a mere ingredient yet dont use as the backbone of a cocktail anything you wouldnt be willing to drink on its own it is a principle broadly applicable in the science of liquid refreshment it assures us palatable cocktails and puts the lie to the hoary canard that mixed drinks are by their nature nothing but dishonest vehicles for delivering substandard liquor the champagne cocktail is hardly the only drink made with the bubbly stuff mimosas and bellinis are perennials though better suited to brunch than new years eve and in the last couple of years creating new drinks with champagne has become something of a trend roux in portland ore has been making a drink called a creole resolution with champagne lillet blanc sugar and grenadine benjys in houston came up with me &amp mrs jones champagne sweet vermouth lime juice grenadine and sugar cav in providence has been serving under the rather unfortunate title "paris sunset " a cocktail of champagne dubonnet angostura bitters and sugar happily were not stuck with the maudlin moniker because the drink was known in the s as an alfonso the only difference was that when the alfonso first turned up the recipe specified that a brand of bitters called secrestat be used alas the brand was soon defunct and drinks compendia of the late s and s adapted by switching the ingredient to angostura not that theres anything wrong with that with angostura the alfonso is an excellent festive cocktail but one cant help but wonder what the original would have tasted like its the sort of question that drinks archaeologist ted haigh author of "vintage spirits and forgotten cocktails " obsesses over he notes that secrestat was a drinkable bitter liqueur such as campari or an amaro not the angostura sort of "aromatic" bitters that get used in drips and dashes and in particular secrestat was flavored with gentian the root of an alpine wildflower as it turns out it is possible to find a bitters that has at least some similarity with the old secrestat stirrings a newish company focused on making quality cocktail ingredients is now selling a "blood orange bitters" with a strong note of gentian i tried a good splash of it in an alfonso and found that it makes for a complex sophisticated drink the key to success with an alfonso as with any champagne cocktail is to make sure it is as cold as possible find the coldest corner of your refrigerator and keep your champagne there the dubonnet too and dont forget to ice your glasses thats a detail about which charles h baker jr was adamant in his in well lubricated travelogue "the gentlemans companion an exotic drinking book " discussing champagne cocktails he rightly observed that warm glasses lead to warm champagne "a foetid thing of brassy taste astringent to the throat an insult to the nostrils " i suspect even the girlfriend from bent flower would turn up her nose "lets start the new year right " bing crosby sings in "holiday inn " and a nice icy alfonso is one way to do it email me at eric felten wsj com alfonso  oz dubonnet red  sugar cube  tsp stirrings blood orange bitters champagne place sugar cube in the bottom of a chilled champagne glass and douse with the bitters if you substitute angostura bitters use only a couple of dashes shake dubonnet with ice and strain into the glass top with champagne and garnish with a twist of lemon
