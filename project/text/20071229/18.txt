hot topic first in line an iowa caucus primer by friday morning iowa will feel a lot quieter statewide caucuses the night before in community centers schools and other public buildings will wrap up more than a year of advertisements speeches and photo ops by a stream of presidential candidates who have spent millions of dollars in pursuit of iowans support iowas first in the nation nominating contest provides early clues about how voters responded to months of sustained and up close campaigning polls show heated contests among both democrats and republicans in the presidential race the first in more than a half century that doesnt include an incumbent president or vice president the impact of this years vote is more unpredictable than usual though several other states have moved up their nominating contests in a bid to have a greater say in selecting the nominees leaving iowas caucuses just five days ahead of the new hampshire primary and four weeks ahead of a crush of others on feb the unusually dense schedule introduces some new dynamics will losing candidates have sufficient time to recover before the next contest will winners have too little time to capitalize on the resulting momentum and will contests later in the year gain importance since so much time will have elapsed between primaries right now most of those in the race are more concerned with winning iowa than with figuring out what comes next through dec the top democratic candidates had logged an average of days in the state this year and their republican counterparts an average of days heres a closer look how do the iowa caucuses work the iowa caucuses are different from primary elections in which voters cast secret ballots at polls as they do in a general election caucus participants gather along party lines in county precincts at a school or even a home where they try to persuade fellow caucus goers to support their candidate in a republican caucus participants can speak on behalf of candidates after which votes are cast on blank ballots democrats gather in a corner of the room based on whom they support so their decisions are public candidates who dont receive support from at least of participants are "eliminated " but their supporters can realign with another group a final head count at the jan gatherings will determine how county level not statewide delegates will be apportioned neither party is nominating delegates for its national convention that requires several more steps that take months but caucus results have been regarded in the past as a bellwether for voter sentiment giving winning candidates momentum and losing candidates more to prove going into later nominating contests how could those dynamics shape the vote with no clear front runner among the democrats and mike huckabee showing a slight lead over mitt romney on the republican side the caucuses could hinge on turnout and on which candidates supporters will be most persuasive in a crowd for democrats a voters second choice can also play an important role because of the rule a poll taken this past week shows john edwards is the second choice of of iowa democrats followed by illinois sen barack obama with saying he is their second choice and new york sen hillary clinton with but of likely democratic voters say they have no second choice according to a los angeles times bloomberg survey the complex process has its critics "this is undemocratic " says larry sabato director of the university of virginia center for politics "if people are intimidated they dont show anyone who works late is out students who are home for the holidays they cant participate " are the iowa caucuses important focus on the event by candidates and the media is a fairly recent phenomenon the first time iowa heavily influenced the national nomination was when relatively unknown jimmy carter won and went on to win the democratic presidential nomination since then the caucuses have gained in importance but havent played a role in every election in al gore and george w bush won iowa and went on to secure their parties nominations in john kerry boosted his support to from among likely democratic voters by winning in iowa and new hampshire but bob dole won the caucuses in and lost the nomination to george h w bush and michael dukakis finished third in iowa that year but ended up with the democratic nomination history says it is hard to recover from poor performances in early contests however of the past party nominees have won either iowa new hampshire or both sarah nassauer and nick timiraos points of view this compressed time frame will affect this election in ways we dont understand " obama campaign manager david plouffe "if i come in a distant fourth im out of this as i would argue anybody else is theres only three people basically coming out of iowa and heading to new hampshire " sen joe biden facts in the iowa caucuses nearly of democratic votes were "uncommitted " while top vote getter jimmy carter received about of eligible voters participated in the new hampshire primary compared with who participated in the iowa caucuses according to data

republicans mitt romney leads with days the financial boost from the caucuses for iowa was between &# million and &# million according to iowa economist harvey siegelman this years more competitive races are expected to generate more
