suicide bombing thursday on an al qaeda faction based in a pakistani tribal area they said ms bhutto died not from gunshot wounds as some witnesses contended but from a skull fracture suffered after the explosion pakistans instability is likely to test u s patience and to make mr musharraf years old more susceptible to a military coup analysts said mr musharraf stepped down as army chief last month to begin his new presidential term as a civilian "hes now very vulnerable to political forces and the disappointment of the army " said talat masood a retired general and a political analyst "the question is whether hes become a big enough liability that he needs to be removed " pakistans government said friday it is weighing whether to hold national elections as scheduled on jan officials said they would be consulting with pakistans main political parties to try to widen participation in the vote which would result in a new prime minister to share power with mr musharraf the election is aimed at restoring democracy after mr musharraf led a bloodless coup in the bush administration which has been criticized for focusing too intently on its ties to mr musharraf is promoting a moderate coalition of political parties u s officials while opposing a long delay in voting acknowledged it might have to be pushed back to give the parties especially the one that ms bhutto led more time to prepare u s officials held talks with leaders of all pakistans principal political parties friday the state department said president bush talked to mr musharraf thursday pakistans government moved to deflect accusations that it had provided inadequate security to ms bhutto interior ministry spokesman javed iqbal cheema told a news conference in islamabad the capital that ms bhutto ignored repeated security advice when she stopped her motorcade and emerged through her armored vehicles sunroof to greet supporters after a campaign rally in rawalpindi a garrison town near islamabad the attacker a young clean shaven man according to photographs released by the government fired three shots at ms bhutto he missed according to the government account although witnesses said she was shot in the neck and chest when the attackers suicide bomb went off moments later the shockwave from the explosion threw ms bhuttos head against the lever of the vehicles sunroof mr cheema said the resulting skull fracture which he described as the only injury that ms bhutto sustained that day proved fatal "i wish she had not come out of the rooftop perhaps she would have been saved " mr cheema said none of ms bhuttos aides inside the car were hurt in the blast mr cheema who released video footage of the attack and the post mortem x rays blamed the killings on an al qaeda faction led by baitullah mehsud a pashtun tribal leader in south waziristan on pakistans frontier with afghanistan mr cheema aired what he said was an intercept of a telephone conversation in which mr mehsud early friday congratulated the alleged direct organizers of ms bhuttos assassination mr mehsud has established an islamic emirate in the border area and his men have been fighting against the u s led coalition forces in afghanistan according to pakistani security authorities he has close links with al qaeda he declared jihad against pakistani forces after a raid in july against radicals who had occupied islamabads red mosque the raid killed more than people pakistani security officials said mr mehsud has set up training camps for militants in the border area his men this autumn took hostage several hundred pakistani troops and later released them in exchange for the release of some two dozen captured militants mr cheema said he believes mr mehsud a reclusive man deeply influenced by the taliban was responsible for "most of the recent terrorist attacks that have taken place in pakistan " he added "they are systematically targeting state institutions in order to destabilize the country " many in pakistan and elsewhere still believe elements of pakistans security services may have been involved in the bhutto assassination an allegation denied by security officials "theres nothing compelling yet pointing toward a single individual or group " said one european official violence following the assassination appeared worst in the province of sindh the home and political stronghold of the bhutto family mobs looted several banks in karachi a city of million that is the provinces and the nations largest city and engaged in shootouts with police many people stayed locked inside their homes troops were called out and a curfew was imposed in several cities in the province after people including four security personnel were killed in a second day of violence train services were disrupted after rioters burnt down several trains across the country nationwide some bank branches were looted islamabad turned into a ghost city friday with shopping areas and gasoline stations shuttered despite a heavy contingent of army and police forces on the streets rioting broke out in islamabad and rawalpindi in the hours following ms bhuttos funeral supporters of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party waved the partys red black and green flag as they set tires on fire in the middle of the roads they also methodically tore down campaign banners of politicians allied with mr musharraf and threw them on bonfires roads across the two cities were strewn with rocks and bricks that the protesters threw at passing motorists in another attack in the scenic valley of swat a former provincial minister and seven others were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb mr musharrafs decision in march to suspend the chief justice of the supreme court prompted months of street protests led by lawyers who helped spawn a prodemocracy movement the chief justice was ultimately reinstated as his popularity waned mr musharraf reached out to the exiled ms bhutto the two appeared headed for political alliance after a series of secret discussions aimed at paving the way for ms bhuttos return from self imposed exile the understanding was that ms bhutto would throw her partys weight behind mr musharraf provided he step down from the army and hold free and fair parliamentary elections but upon ms bhuttos return in october the prospective alliance quickly fell apart she blamed people inside the government for plotting a suicide attack during her oct homecoming in karachi that killed more than people ms bhutto who narrowly escaped finally broke with the president after declared emergency rule on nov and suspended civil liberties analysts blame mr musharraf for bungling what might have been a peaceful transition to civilian rule "hes in well over his head " said stephen p cohen a south asia scholar at the brookings institution mr musharraf retains the backing of the nations military and for now the u s as a partner in the u s led war against islamist terrorism mr musharrafs government has received nearly &# billion in assistance with most of the funds going to pakistans fight against islamic extremists the armys operations in pakistans tribal areas where al qaeda leader osama bin laden is suspected of hiding have turned many locals against the military and the government that insurgency has spread into other areas of pakistan such as northwest frontier province over the past few months suicide attacks have struck a number of military and political targets including buses carrying children of military personnel many in pakistans army have been distressed by the wave of attacks and rising antimilitary sentiment in the nations cities the trouble has fed speculation that the army under a new chief gen ashfaq kiyani might seek to dislodge mr musharraf from power and bring in a new government through elections others played down that possibility "the military is a disciplined institution " said asad durrani a retired general and former head of pakistans inter services intelligence or isi "no one should be counting on any revolt in the military " ms bhuttos death has marked another victory for militants in their efforts to undermine the government and frighten secularist politicians despite threats against her life ms bhutto continued to lambaste the forces of extremism earning her admiration even among her critics "its not just a person who has been killed " said muhammad ali saif a minister in an interim government put in place ahead of elections "a nation has been challenged " in the wake of her death a faction of the pakistan muslim league led by nawaz sharif another former prime minister announced it will boycott januarys elections a threat it had made previously before agreeing to participate mr sharifs faction said elections cant be fair under current circumstances u s diplomats and strategists said they have reached out to aides of mr sharif to see whether his political party might reverse the boycott while wary of mr sharifs politics which are viewed as more conservatively islamic senior u s officials said they see the politician as central to calming pakistan "hes in the middle of everything politically " said a u s diplomat involved ms bhuttos party declared a day mourning period the party hasnt yet decided whether to boycott elections according to spokesman farhatullah babar "we are in a state of shock " said mr babar who was part of a huge funeral procession that accompanied the body to the bhutto familys native village of garhi khuda baksh in sindh province "the first thing is the burial of ms bhutto then we will take up the political discussion " senior u s strategists suggested that one way forward would be to create a government of national unity comprised of the ppp and the parties led by messrs musharraf and sharif to jointly oversee preparations for the parliamentary vote mr musharraf also may be forced to allow international involvement in investigating ms bhuttos murder ms bhuttos family has already sought the involvement of the federal bureau of investigation and britains scotland yard in the probe according to u s officials ms bhutto was buried next to her father zulfikar ali bhutto another former prime minister of pakistan her plain wood coffin draped in the flag of her party was carried in an ambulance toward a white mausoleum ms bhuttos husband asif ali zardari is among those considered leading candidates to take over the partys leadership yet mr zardari comes with heavy political baggage a former minister in his wifes government he spent more than eight years in jail facing corruption and other criminal charges though he was never convicted he was released in and has since been living in dubai and new york its not clear whether mr zardari can rally the partys rank and file many of whom hold him responsible for the dismissal of ms bhuttos two previous governments a less controversial choice would be the partys long serving vice chairman amin fahim u s officials said they have spoken with both potential successors and are trying to galvanize and strengthen the leadership of ms bhuttos party siobhan gorman in
