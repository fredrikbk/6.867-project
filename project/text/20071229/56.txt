the week ahead our take on coming events employment fridays payroll report will offer best window on state of economy by sudeep reddy the u s economy is clearly downshifting fridays report on the job market may indicate whether it drops into low gear or reverse economists expect the labor department report on december payrolls to show a further slowdown in job growth employment gains were modest in the prior three months averaging about new jobs a month thats just enough to meet the needs of a growing labor force the numbers have been volatile however underscoring choppiness in the economy the week will provide a slew of data on existing home sales construction spending the state of the manufacturing sector and factory orders but the jobs report will be the most important window into the state of the economy the strength of the labor market is crucial for wage growth a key factor that drives consumer spending which makes up more than two thirds of economic activity the fact that job growth hasnt skidded to a halt is a major reason why the economy hasnt already tumbled into recession despite a worsening housing slump and a continuing credit crunch employers had been pulling back in recent months largely through a slowdown in hiring rather than a sharp increase in layoffs in particular employment readings in consumer sentiment reports are indicating fewer options for job seekers but cuts are starting to take a greater toll pushing jobless claims to their third highest reading of the year though still far from levels indicating a recession "most evidence with the exception of the payroll numbers themselves points to quite a weakening in the labor market " says joshua shapiro chief economist at the consulting firm mfr inc which expects december payroll gains of near the wall street consensus estimate "typically when thats the case the payroll numbers catch up eventually " markets will have several other indicators to gauge the state of the labor market ahead of fridays report the institute for supply managements survey of purchasing managers on wednesday will signal the direction of employment in the manufacturing sector a day later payroll giant automatic data processing using its data covering million workers will offer its estimate of december private sector employment the labor department also releases its weekly jobless claims report on thursday the state of the labor market will be a key factor guiding federal reserve officials ahead of their interest rate decision jan a strong jobs report could mean consumers can maintain the spending growth necessary to offset weakness in the housing and credit markets a particularly weak outlook for employment however may embolden fed officials who want to cut rates currently at despite concerns about rising inflation the employment report also could signal how much the credit crisis is hurting businesses so far the finance and housing related sectors have taken the biggest hits while much of the service sector has propped up the economy "firms are just frightened right now " said joseph brusuelas chief u s economist at ideaglobal businesses resilience in the face of higher inflation and tighter credit he said will be key to holding up the job market and "determining if the economy goes into recession or barely avoids contraction " politics in iowa weather forecast is now a top focus for candidates by amy chozick ice and snowstorms have closed iowas airports and highways in recent days stopping even the most determined presidential candidates in their campaign tracks but thursday caucus night here the weather may be more than an annoyance political analysts say the atmospheric conditions could have a serious impact on how candidates fare in this first step in the nations presidential nomination process right now meteorologists are expecting a balmy by midwestern standards high of degrees sunny conditions and a chance of precipitation that forecast suits hillary clinton on the democratic side and mitt romney on the republican side the political pundits say their logic both are relying heavily on voters above the age of who have the most issues traveling in poor conditions new york sen clinton is counting particularly on a large number of elderly women snow and ice could prevent many of them from leaving the house on caucus night dealing a possibly devastating blow to sen clinton in a race polls show as a virtual three way tie with barack obama and john edwards "were paying more attention to weather reports than the polls " says mark daley iowa press secretary for the clinton campaign unlike a typical state primary where voters go to polls and cast ballots caucusing takes more effort iowans must meet in a local precinct usually a school church or public library and publicly stand up for their presidential preference the mild forecast may also benefit illinois sen obama who is largely relying on first time voters many are college students going to school in iowa but who will be driving back from vacation breaks visiting family in neighboring illinois on caucus night "if theres anyone who should be rooting for bad weather " says cary covington an associate professor of political science at the university of iowa "its edwards " the former north carolina senators supporters tend to be die hard and many have already been through the caucus experience with him having lifted him to a surprise second place finish in for republicans former massachusetts gov romney with his elderly backing could enjoy an extra boost from the bearable weather still the well funded campaign isnt taking any chances it has a shuttle service and buddy system in place that asks dedicated romney supporters to pick up a friend on their way to caucus "well take great measures to get everyone there " says romney spokesman tim albrecht republican rival former arkansas gov mike huckabee handicappers say would fare well in a foot of snow since his supporters tend to be dedicated they include evangelicals as well as hunters and outdoorsmen from rural areas who are prepared for harsh winter weather a big storm could also jolt the race by lifting long shot u s rep ron paul of texas who lags in the polls "if bad weather hits " says campaign spokeswoman jesse benton "i am sure we can rely on our supporters passion for dr paul and the constitution to carry them to their caucus locations " media at time warner curtain goes up for bewkess ceo show by merissa marr the long wait is almost over for jeff bewkes time warner inc s chief executive elect takes the reins this coming week assuming one of the media industrys most challenging tasks reinventing an entertainment conglomerate in need of a new script for many investors the bewkes show comes not a moment too soon time warners shares have gone nowhere during the past five years and shareholders have been crying for radical action they may have to be patient though mr bewkes is unlikely to charge out of the gate with immediate plans to tear apart the company home to such staples as the warner bros movie studio hbo aol time warner cable and time magazine the year old yale graduate has been busy preparing for his big day in the two months since being officially anointed ceo to be mr bewkes has been putting his analytical skills to work studying various strategic options including scenarios for the cable aol and time inc units according to people familiar with the situation he also has been rearranging the corporate suite with a particular focus on bolstering the team in charge of charming time warners weary investors that includes a new chief financial officer john martin and a new investor relations recruit douglas shapiro both former wall street analysts outgoing ceo richard parsons has already effectively passed the mantle and turned his attention elsewhere say people familiar with the situation mr parsons will stay on as chairman

that allows him to resign if he isnt appointed to the role when mr parsons leaves mr bewkes hasnt had much of a welcome thus far in the past two months the companys stock has skidded to new lows for

haverty sees significant upside in time warner however especially in the cable business mr bewkes is still working on his road map say people familiar with his plans he is expected to roll out his strategy in stages in the first half of they say two dates loom large in that plan feb when the company reports earnings and the companys annual meeting in may aol and time warner cable remain the two most obvious candidates for action investors have high expectations for both on the aol front investors are expecting at least a sale of the internet access part of the business and time warner has made clear that time warner cable should have its own balance sheet and funding mechanism as it morphs into more of a telecommunications play suggesting that time warner may at least reduce its stake to below from the current one factor possibly complicating the cable option cable valuations have slumped rather than laying out his plans months in advance mr bewkes generally favors executing and then explaining his actions later investors probably will have to wait until february to see what that really means
