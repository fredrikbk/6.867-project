midlevel officers show enterprise helping u s reduce violence in iraq the u s militarys role in iraqs fragile transformation from a country plagued a year ago by worsening violence to a place of at least some hope isnt a single story its dozens of tales of largely anonymous and entrepreneurial american officers who relied on four years of hard won knowledge of iraqs complex tribal and sectarian politics to change the course of a conflict its dozens of tales of largely anonymous and entrepreneurial american officers who relied on four years of hard won knowledge of iraqs complex tribal and sectarian politics to change the course of a conflict these mostly junior and midlevel officers many on their second and third tours of duty in iraq literally built walls to separate warring sunnis and shiites they fought to re open banks and clinics in the face of an often indifferent central government most important they sought out local power brokers courted them with reconstruction contracts and helped them build neighborhood security forces in short they improvised military leaders credit those efforts with helping bring about a dramatic decline in bloodshed in recent months while iraq is still wracked by violence the trends are encouraging civilian deaths have fallen to levels not seen since early there have been american fatalities so far this month down sharply from in may what remains to be seen is whether the delicate web of local deals spun by these midlevel officers will hold as american troops begin to pull out of iraqi neighborhoods in "what we created is very fragile " says lt col steve miska who just completed his second tour as the second in command of an army brigade in western baghdad for it to hold "the iraqis have got to develop systems that allow them to sustain themselves and are appropriate to their culture " col miska adds there has been little or no progress on that front baghdads neighborhoods have largely divided along sectarian lines and even the hardiest optimists caution that without improvement in this area iraq could quickly slip back into bloody and chaotic civil war for now though iraq is faring far better than almost anyone would have predicted nine months ago perhaps no officer embodied the spirit of innovation better than year old capt travis patriquin an arabic speaking army officer in the fall of as iraq was being ripped apart by sectarian violence capt patriquin sat down at his computer in ramadi and put together a crude powerpoint presentation that captured how he and his fellow soldiers were working with local sheiks to bring a measure of stability to the most violent province most military powerpoint presentations are dominated by elaborate sleep inducing graphics capt patriquins was simple smart and funny "this is a sheik " he wrote beneath one stick figure "theyve been leading the people of this area for approximately years in spite of many many conquering armies trying to remove him this man and his family have been involved in politics here since recorded time began " in december as capt patriquins presentation was making its rounds of the army via email he was killed by a roadside bomb ten months later it caught the attention of defense secretary robert gates in a speech to senior army leaders charged with planning how the army should fight future wars the defense secretary singled out capt patriquins "courage and ingenuity " along with his powerpoint presentation "at this young captains direction " mr gates said "the brigade courted local sheiks over cigarettes and endless cups of tea outreach that combined with al qaedas barbarism helped spark the anbar awakening that has garnered so much attention and praise in the past months " the anbar awakening is an alliance between tribal sheiks and u s forces to fight al qaeda in iraq before soldiers began streaming into iraq earlier this year as part of president bushs surge strategy senior administration officials in washington sought to portray the war as wrapping up rather than attempting to fix problems themselves field commanders often focused on handing responsibility for security to someone else the iraqi army local police or the fledgling and corrupt iraqi government "we were always six months away from leaving " says col miska but with more troops at his disposal gen david petraeus the top commander in iraq pushed soldiers off of big secure bases and into iraqi neighborhoods the troops many of whom saw their tours extended to months got the message that they werent going anywhere mr gates and gen petraeus pushed troops to take risks and innovate they also benefited from some subtle changes in policy u s military officers had been meeting with sheiks and local religious leaders since the u s invasion in but they often had little to offer them local commanders overseeing reconstruction and the development of local police forces were often required to give reconstruction contracts to the lowest bidder instead of working with local power brokers the focus was on building a strong democratic central government that would replace the tribal sheiks "u s rules dont work in iraq " one commander from ninewah province complained in a blunt internal army report from late in the contracting rules were modified so that local commanders had far more discretion over how u s money was doled out now battalion commanders who typically oversee about troops could use reconstruction contracts to build alliances with tribal leaders in their areas in doing so they were following a template for governance in iraq that has existed for centuries and which even dictators like saddam hussein had to rely on "the tribes have always sought to exploit governing institutions by gaining access to resources and influence " says william "mac" mccallister a retired army officer who has spent most of the past four years in iraq first as a soldier and then as a civilian tribal affairs adviser to marine officials in fallujah working for consulting firm applied knowledge international llp "we have finally taken the time to learn what the audience in iraq will appreciate " in different parts of iraq the relationships developed in different ways in sunni dominated areas like rural anbar province local commanders often worked directly with the tribes in anah a small town in western iraq capt jeremy graczyk refashioned the meeting room at his base into a tribal diwan or banquet hall replacing chairs with pillows and desks with small tea tables so local sheiks would feel more comfortable capt patriquin and his boss col sean mcfarland forged a tight alliance with a group of sunni sheiks led by sheik sattar al risha when capt patriquin was killed sheik sattar named a police station in anbars province capital of ramadi after him ten months later sheik sattar was killed but the peace in ramadi held as the movement that began in anbar province spread to baghdad u s officers modified it because tribal identity isnt as strong in baghdad american officers instead formed relationships with local sunni religious leaders the imams sometimes brought in a military adviser from another province known to them through tribal connections says david kilcullen who until this summer served as gen petraeuss counterinsurgency adviser "so while the surface level of activity is not obviously tribal tribal and kinship links played a key underlying role " dr kilcullen says by late summer progress in the sunni areas of baghdad was beginning to spread to shiite areas of the city like kadhimiyah as the threat from sunni insurgent groups like al qaeda in iraq receded shiites began to turn against radical shiite militias that had formed to protect them many of these militia groups were dominated by young armed men who terrorized local sunnis and extorted money from their shiite brethren "when the al qaeda threat went away it took away the reason for being of these militias " says col miska who returned a few weeks ago from a month deployment in kadhimiyah col miska and his fellow officers negotiated deals with kadhimiyah leaders in exchange for reconstruction aid they promised to keep out the more radical elements of anti american cleric moqtada al sadrs mahdi army "it was in their interest to work with us they didnt want to see the money cut off " col miska says as mr sadrs positioned weakened he called for a six month suspension of all military activities so that he could "rehabilitate" his force which was alienating the local population in kadhimiyah col miska says the key to the progress in his area was a decision to move u s troops off of big remote bases into the neighborhoods where they could interact with the people and local leadership "getting off of these superbases where you get three meals a day and baskin robbins and getting around the people of iraq is what did it " he says "we were trying to drive a wedge between the people and the insurgents we couldnt do it if we were pulling away from them "
