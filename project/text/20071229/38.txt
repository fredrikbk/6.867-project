politics &amp economics obama stings with subtle jabs digs at rivals are timed with an effort to keep overall tone upbeat des moines iowa in the closing days of the iowa presidential campaign barack obama is walking a strategic tightrope highlighting his upbeat message of ending political bickering while stepping up attacks on his principal rivals "its a very fine line to walk " says david axelrod chief political strategist for the illinois democratic senator "we dont want to get rolled by anyone but on the other hand we dont want to get bogged down in extraneous arguments " when he takes his jabs mr obama rarely calls out his targets by name but it is clear he is intent on casting john edwards and particularly hillary clinton as inflexible establishment candidates who dont have the capacity to end the internecine sniping that keeps washington in gridlock iowa voters are famously averse to negative campaigning they have punished practitioners such as former vermont gov howard dean whose rhetoric during the presidential campaign appeared to crater his high flying iowa effort the obama camp goes farther they agree that his campaign of optimism and change he often mocks himself in political rallies as a "hope peddler" makes him even more vulnerable than rivals as mr obama notes in a sly dig at mrs clintons "turn up the heat " campaign chant "theres no shortage of anger or bluster or bitter partisanship out there we dont need more heat we need more light " this strategy of getting in his licks even as he seems to take the high road has become a feature of mr obamas stump rhetoric especially as iowa girds for its caucus thursday it was on display this past week when mr obama took a shot at the new york senator so subtle that her spokesman felt compelled to point it out even when most of the media didnt "theyve been secretive in the past theyll be secretive as president " mr obama said at a recent rally without saying who "they" were "if they havent been all that strong on lobbyists in the past it doesnt matter what they say in the campaign they wont be that strong about it when they are president " to understand the slap a listener needs to know that mrs clinton is alone among the three frontrunners in directly accepting money from lobbyists and that she has often been taken to task for the secretive way she handled an abortive effort to fix the nations health insurance system when her husband was president in an email to reporters phil singer mrs clintons national media spokesman decried mr obamas "negative attacks" during the final sprint in iowa he followed it up the next day with an email saying "now is not the time for political attacks its time to pick a president who can give us a new beginning in a time of war and a troubled economy " the clinton campaign has set up an "attack timeline" on its web site chronicling reported criticisms from messrs obama and edwards during the past few months with a link encouraging readers to contribute to mrs clinton the clinton campaign itself hasnt been averse to what is seen as negative campaigning raising mr obamas admitted teenage drug use and criticizing him for everything from his stance on negotiating with enemies such as cuba and iran to his presidential ambitions which the clinton campaign recently claimed to much catcalling from political pundits stretched back to kindergarten "i know that some people have been checking my kindergarten papers but i really havent been plotting that long " mr obama recently told supporters in nevada iowa prompting sniggers from many in the crowd these understated attacks mr obama often flashes a mischievous smile when he trots out what have become at least a score of them have become an increasing frustration for the clinton campaign in particular which has strained in recent weeks to curb its attacks on rivals and present the softer side of its candidate even as she slips in voter surveys one political operative with a rival campaign says she may be taking her cues from internal polling he said his own campaigns surveys consistently show that many potential iowa voters view mrs clinton as the source of most of the negative campaigning this political season far more than the other two frontrunners mr edwards once the most combative candidate in the democratic field has also started to temper his attacks these days the former north carolina senator rarely mentions his rivals at all save for an occasional limp slap at mr obama who has pledged to reformulate the nations health care system with the help of insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms mr edwards favors going to war with the industries in a subtle riposte mr obama notes that any health care overhaul will need the support of the insurance industry they will get a seat at the table mr obama says "i just wont let them buy all the seats " in the closing days the obama campaign has stepped up its own criticism of rivals his campaign manager recently blasted mr edwards and mrs clinton for currying support from independent political committees asking backers to contribute money to counter the effort in a chat with reporters mr axelrod subtly linked the recent assassination of former pakistan prime minister benazir bhutto to the vote both mrs clinton and mr edwards cast to authorize the iraq war saying the conflict has distracted washington from the real global threat of islamic extremism and an obama radio advertisement in heavy rotation in iowa criticizes mrs clinton for being critical in particular for making last minute attacks on his health care overhaul program mr obama doesnt speak in the ad other than to say that he approves it
