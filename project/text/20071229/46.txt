read all about it how newspapers got into such a fix and where they go from here it was the fall of and the newspaper i edited the wall street journal was awash in money thanks to the dot com boom and the lush advertising it generated we were running the presses at full tilt nearly every day yet had to turn away ads for lack of space even as the good times rolled two non newspaper names kept coming up i recall being stunned to learn that the main place where our own readers checked stock prices was the finance section of yahoo a couple of kids from stanford had launched a search engine called google already many of my colleagues were using it less than six months later the tech bubble began to deflate hundreds of dot coms died taking with them their ad budgets but the web industry pushed forward and within a few years it shredded newspaper business models that had held sway for decades that high tech jolt to my industry wasnt something i could have imagined on the july day in when i walked into a factory like building in san francisco to start work as a year old reporter for the journal vintage linotype machines spat out hot metal versions of stories a line at a time an industry of family owned newspapers was setting off on a momentous period of growing power and profit on thursday ill pack my last box and take leave of a place where ive spent of my years in journalism including as managing editor of the journal the other years to i was a reporter and then business editor at the los angeles times today all around me is an industry in upheaval with slumping revenues and stocks layoffs and takeovers of publishers that a decade ago seemed impregnable just this month rupert murdochs news corp completed its acquisition of dow jones &amp co the journals publisher and real estate magnate sam zell gained effective control of tribune co the journals editors have asked me to retrace my experiences of the past four decades in search of insights into how all this has happened what may happen next and the implications of all this change for readers the nation and society at large for readers the implications are clear a stark contrast of feast and famine the cornucopia of national international and business news sports and especially opinion available free on the web is rich beyond historical parallel anyone with a fact a comment a snapshot or a video clip can self publish and instantly compete with the professionals at the same time the vast array of investigative reporting and foreign correspondence assembled at american newspapers over the past several decades is being cut back at all but a few publications as papers succumb to the pressure to cut costs many journalists and academics see in these cutbacks a threat to the democratic ideal of a well informed public some urge turning to philanthropy or an expansion of public television as a way to fill the gap others have begun to argue for a government subsidy for newspapers an unlikely prospect for now less clear is how the industry will ultimately be transformed many papers are seeking to leap ahead in adapting to the movement of readers and advertisers to the internet this means tightly holding down costs of print publications while leveraging metro papers principal unique assets local reporting staffs and local ad sales teams cash from newspapers own web offerings has grown fast but needs to grow faster because at current rates it will be years before it makes up for the slumping inflow from the still much larger print side as google yahoo and similar internet enterprises suck away ad dollars many newspaper companies hope to gain new revenue by forming once unthinkable partnerships with each other and some of these same rivals particularly yahoo in some ways whats happening to the newspaper industry is a return to its past less than years ago american newspapers were in the main relatively small narrowly profitable family owned locally focused and hotly competitive as a kid reporter in california in the s i heard tales from newsmen and photographers about how just a few years earlier they had sat in cars engines running and radios tuned to police bands trying to get an edge in covering the next murder the national and international news would be handled by the wire services lurid local photographs on page one were what sold newspapers in that era a certain fast and loose devil may care attitude often prevailed i remember walking past a photographers open car trunk and noticing that he carried a well preserved but very dead bird among his cameras and lenses the bird he explained was for feature shots on holidays like memorial day hed perch it on a gravestone or tree limb in a veterans cemetery to get the right mood nowadays such a trick would get him fired but in the s this guy said there was no time to wait for a live bird to flutter into the frame then beginning in the s the industry morphed into a series of mini monopolies first mounting costs forced a shakeout mergers and newspaper closings that typically left one city paper preeminent in the morning market and another in the evening for a while the evening franchise had a slight edge people had more time to read then in a twinkling that advantage disappeared crushed by a phenomenon that can be summed up in two words walter cronkite more and more families gathered in front of the tube at the dinner hour the morning papers then got a boost a surge in women readers as baby boomers reached school age their mothers could sit back for a moment with a second cup of coffee and read sections aimed squarely at them soon in city after city the leading morning newspaper came to dominate and often eliminate its rivals reaping comfortable margins in the process before long these were linking up in multibillion dollar multi city chains building publicly traded companies with rising profits and stocks some acquired tv stations as well many of these information behemoths invested heavily in quality expanding their reporting locally nationally and internationally this was good business as well as a boon to readers because it raised barriers to entry for would be competitors the result was a golden age of american journalism in new york washington chicago and los angeles of course yet also in boston philadelphia miami milwaukee atlanta st louis des moines louisville st petersburg and more daily papers were willing to send reporters far afield in pursuit of stories exposing corruption or explaining the world newspapers opened or expanded washington bureaus and added reporters abroad some stationed them not just in london moscow and tokyo but in places like sydney and sao paulo as their financial strength and staff size increased they became fearless in pursuing corruption a supreme court decision new york times v sullivan protected publishers from libel judgments by public officials even if what was published was inaccurate so long as the paper didnt know the article was inaccurate and wasnt reckless about what it published the news operations of the three main television networks in those days followed a similar pattern as profits grew they added to staff and launched foreign bureaus and investigative projects the sunday night magazine program cbs launched in " minutes " set a new standard for expensively produced and deeply reported video journalism the public seemed to approve intrepid journalists proliferated in films like "all the presidents men " depicting washington post reporters exposure of watergate enrollments in journalism schools surged as well as applications for reporting jobs they were heady times indeed when the l a times investigated suspected gasoline hoarding during fuel shortages in one reporter got the idea of flying over refineries and tank fields to look for evidence as the editor running the coverage i asked my bosses for approval to hire helicopters or small planes for a story the answer go right ahead in the end we didnt our reporting showed that most of the hoarding was by people like our own readers whod taken to driving with their gas tanks always full but the lesson was clear when it came to getting an important story dont worry about the cost i dont remember exactly when cracks began to appear in this halcyon life at most big papers circulation revenue and profits grew through the s and s and into the s with recessionary pauses that werent excessively fretted over around the time of the slump l a times editors were told they needed to impose modest spending restraints i figured out i could meet my target just by eliminating first class travel on my groups reporting trips then allowed on flights of more than three hours or so i was quite proud of myself until the next day when the top editor of the entire paper who only occasionally visited our floor strode straight to my desk "i like flying first class " he said with a grin "youre setting a bad example " i found another way to reach my goal in the mid s when i was a deputy managing editor at the journal the dow jones ceo almost apologetically imposed limits on our then ample spending in the face of cyclical advertising cutbacks by financial firms as the ceo quipped referring to then managing editor norman pearlstine "we gave norm an unlimited budget and he exceeded it " in those days we worried quite a bit about television survey after survey showed that with each year more americans were getting their news there while that made circulation growth tougher to achieve ad revenue continued to rise as newspaper readers generally had better incomes cable tv added a new worry because here was a medium that could target smaller exclusive audiences and thus pose a greater challenge to print even so newspaper revenue continued its growth then in the s came the digital networks and the internet unleashing forces that would ultimately undermine newspaper business models that had been so supportive of journalism first came dial up then a few years later the internet and by dozens of newspapers including the journal had online editions early leaders of the journals online edition privately referred to it as "the paper killer " to the great annoyance of print colleagues when they found out but the phrase was apt the web could deliver words and numbers at nearly the speed of light without the cost of printing paper or delivery trucks all searchable and archivable in response newspapers sought to do three things cut costs diversify and above all embrace the new technology and dominate it after all in the s and s the leading radio networks had become the leading television networks why couldnt newspapers copy that model they certainly tried cost cutting first followed a path set in the s of using computers to eliminate jobs downstream from the newsroom today nothing but electrons stands between the minds and hands of the journalists and the photographic image used to produce a printing plate but those cuts often werent enough and publisher after publisher turned to hiring freezes buyouts and ultimately layoffs the reductions have fallen particularly heavily on foreign and investigative or "project" reporting which are among the most expensive categories to produce diversification typically took the route of investments in television stations cable systems satellite book publishing and other domains at least notionally related to newspapers some were successful some not publishers internet ventures almost always had limited success at least at the outset part of the problem was that those in charge of print advertising and circulation were suspicious of their counterparts on the online side and vice versa at the journal i saw it often at one point the print folks suggested that online subscriptions be awarded free to print subscribers it was an idea the online folk retorted that relegated their site to "toaster status " as in savings banks giving away cheap gifts for opening an account in turn the online people wanted renewal mailings to print customers to include a line soliciting a paid subscription to the journals web edition the print side resisted mightily fearing that adding any new option to the form would cause some customers to delay responding long enough to trigger a costly follow up mailing a bigger problem was that newspapers often sought to copy fairly closely on the web what they did in print rather than offer new products taking full advantage of digitization the most creative new products came mainly from enterprises with little connection to newspapers and soon if you named almost any bit of data you used to rely on papers for sports scores weather stocks movie times there were web sites offering more information faster and free the decisive blow may have been googles with its powerful search engine that would either give you a quick answer to a question you had or steer you to sites that could the irony of course was that some of the most useful of those sites were newspapers papers remained quite profitable for the most part but as the future began to look increasingly troubled one publishers stock after another got hammered starting around the turn of the century especially hard hit were publishers of prestigious newspapers dow jones stock was at less than half its high before news corp made its successful bid for the wall street journal publisher last spring times mirror fell more than before being acquired by tribune co which in turn has fallen around from its high knight ridder fell from its high before its acquisition by mcclatchy which now trades at around below its peak new york times co is near an year low washington post co is about below its top some publishers with less prestigious papers have done better scripps and cox have diversified successfully into cable networks and cable systems respectively thomson sold all its newspapers and became a financial market legal and medical data company before reaching a merger agreement with reuters this year news corp leveraged its australian newspaper business to acquire not only newspapers but also a movie studio television cable satellite tv and web interests around the world it picked up the prestigious times of london along the way and the journal after its transition to a global media company why this divide it could be that operators of high prestige newspapers were more reluctant to risk the franchise even under a level of financial duress that would provoke many managements to bet the farm in pursuit of a radical opportunity what happens next change rapid and largely unpredictable nearly every company in the industry needs major new revenue big cost reductions or a healthy dollop of each the people and entities to watch most closely are the entrepreneurs mr murdoch and mr zell mr murdoch has vast experience in media generally and newspapers in particular controls major financial resources and has big plans to expand the journal in print and online domestically and overseas mr zell used financial engineering to control tribune co with minimal investment of his own has little media experience and isnt likely to spend much on his new properties both are decisive investors and operators they arent always successful but its unwise to bet against them new york times co mr murdoch has said hell use the journal to steal a portion of the general news and cultural news franchises of times co s eponymous flagship newspaper but entities fight hardest defending their home turf and the times has both a strong growing web site and a sunday edition that remains an advertising monster it will be under pressure to follow some of the cost cutting its sister boston globe has done pure conjecture assuming that new york mayor and bloomberg lp owner mike bloomberg isnt u s president elect a year from now would he and times chairman arthur sulzberger jr consider putting their two enterprises together hearst corp after the inheritors of william randolph hearsts empire lost their bet on evening papers in the s they bulked up their revenue from magazines like cosmopolitan diversified smartly in tv including a stake in espn now worth roughly &# billion and stayed in newspapers but with a close eye on profit with four metro papers like the houston chronicle and san francisco chronicle and eight smaller ones hearst is in the vanguard of figuring out ways to exploit newspapers local reporting strengths both in print and online hearst has helped forge a partnership involving a consortium of newspaper companies and sometime nemesis yahoo the idea is that together they can offer advertisers total coverage of various metropolitan areas and feed readers back and forth question are these going to be best friends forever or a cobra and a mongoose final word next week i move over to a nonprofit called pro publica as president and editor in chief when fully staffed we will be a team of journalists dedicated to reporting on abuses of power by anyone with power government business unions universities school systems doctors hospitals lawyers courts nonprofits media well publish through our web site and also possibly through newspapers magazines or tv programs offering our material free if they provide wide distribution pro publica is the brainchild of san francisco entrepreneurs turned philanthropists herbert and marion sandler who along with some other donors are providing &# million a year in funding the idea is that we along with others of similar bent can in some modest way make up for some of the loss in investigative reporting resources that results from the collapse of metro newspapers business model
