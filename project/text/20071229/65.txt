weekend journal food &amp drink eating out a skybox dining game plan wheres the best football food hint club level beats the private suites the miami dolphins got pasted by the undefeated patriots last sunday the result was never in doubt and many faithful fans spent much of their time at gillette stadium getting stuffed and sozzled at food stations in the glamorous glassed in club level such elite watering holes in one configuration or another offer respite from football in all of the nfl arenas for fans who pay thousands of dollars for access to these enormous sheltered sports bars food there goes on sale hours before kickoff and menus run the gamut from standard stadium fare to lobster and crown roast of pork for a lapsed fan like me who hadnt seen an nfl game except on tv since the great detroit lions bobby layne era of the s at unclubby briggs stadium club level dining was a real eye opener i first dipped my fork in such lavish food two weeks ago at miamis dolphin stadium on the hunch that the leagues losingest team then now might have winning food at its brand new club level facility then i followed the dolphins north last weekend to the home of the patriots the winningest team then now and poised to break an old dolphins milestone as the first team to go undefeated in the regular season since i came to see how the patriots equally ambitious atrium restaurants feeding the highest paying ticket holders would fare in an unacknowledged gastronomic competition being fought out at opposite ends of interstate unlike the affray occurring at binocular distance outdoors the food scrimmage ended up as an even contest fans at both arenas spent about the same amount of time away from their seats and watching football between bites on high definition tv monitors miami had slinky bar waitresses the patriots countered with the snappy wrists of sauteers at action stations who turned out winning seafood and beef dishes to order over open flames the biggest surprise in both stadiums the fattest cats who paid top dollar for individual chef service in their private suites got inferior food to what club level clients could purchase in the enormous diversely provided lounge areas guests at private suites most often booked by corporations eat preordered prepaid food served by dedicated chefs and waitstaff or from buffet style chafing dishes at the patriots gillette stadium suite holders order the dishes in advance from a page menu here are a few of the dishes executive chef brad ozerdem and his team offer maple brined double breast of turkey pepper crusted sirloin of beef crown roast of pork loin garlic and herb rubbed prime rib tenderloin of beef mr ozerdem himself carved a beautifully presented crown roast but the pork chop from it that i tasted was dry other dishes i sampled from the suites stainless steel chafing dishes were equally lifeless teriyaki beef skewers lobster ravioli beef filets and an asian style seared sea bass a much better choice was an attractive cold platter of seared tuna squares arrayed next to a rainbow of cold asian vegetables that included a delicious curving line of chewy green sea bean sprigs the some suites at gillette accommodate around attendees but most of the more than club level eaters generally season ticket holders who have paid a higher price for better seats and the chance to order better food than regular ticket holders get their grub in the two lounge areas on opposite sides of the arena during my visit to one of them i could hardly complain about the fresh meaty lobster rolls &# or the first rate hickory smoked pulled pork sandwiches &# in each of the two atriums there are around different food stations of varying size from bakeries to individual cooks specializing in single meat or seafood dishes made to order up a notch in sophistication the seafood and beef sautes were good enough to earn their keep in a serious if not top flight restaurant in the real world you asked for medium rare and you got medium rare hot off the skillet how did similar facilities in miami compare in atmosphere dolphin stadium is many yards ahead of the restrained new england atriums almost anywhere you tilt your head you catch sight of one of high def tv sets theres a fantasy bar for people who want to keep tabs on their own private football world bathroom fixtures are a museum of taps and drains courtesy of the kohler corp at the two full service restaurants attached to the atriums there are dishes like a kobe style beef burger with french fries &# bouillabaisse &# and chilean sea bass &# in the main hall are a dozen food stalls specializing in a range of foods from standard stadium fare to thin pizzas deli sandwiches and made to order sushi you can pick up an exemplary cuban sandwich &# at the latino food counter fresh pasta an orecchiette dish was &# emerges al dente from another counter an electronic wine bar called the enomatic wine dispenser pumps out excellent reds and whites by the glass at the push of a plastic card from a &# ounce glass of california zinfandel to a &# ounce quaff of robert mondavi cabernet sauvignon reserve while no sane person would brave the miles of standstill traffic on route outside gillette just to stand in the cold outside the stadiums gates the dolphins put on a full scale welcome for the ticketless with bands costumed stilt jumpers lumberjacks competing to saw logs and climb trees full bars and decent fast food in a plaza adjacent to the entrance for club level ticket holders the hapless dolphin team continues to sell out its larger arena seats compared with at gillette warm weather may account for some of this perverse enthusiasm but the deep loyalty of fans togged out from cap to crocs in dolphin tropical coral and turquoise colors can hardly be exaggerated after their teams sudden death escape from a winless season on dec it was easy to feel the happy throb of their rational exuberance on the way down the exit ramps after the dodgy victory over the unimpressive baltimore ravens in my case i also felt the salubrious effect of the free massage id stood in line with club level fin lovers to enjoy during one of the long stretches of second tier football email me at eatingout wsj com
