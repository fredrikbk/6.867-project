weekend journal leisure &amp arts is art an industry or a luxury the answer to that question affects both art collectors and tax collectors sens pete domenici r n m and charles schumer d n y have been complaining for the past few years that the capital gains tax rate of for the sale of art and other collectibles compared with only for the sale of real estate and securities unfairly puts art collectors at a disadvantage the reduction in the tax on real estate and securities from came in measures passed in and "art for investments sake should not incur an additional tax bill simply for revenues sake " sen domenici said according to sen schumer "the tax penalty on arts and collectibles unfairly targets the art industry which is very important to new york and many parts of the country art is a capital investment for many and should be treated that way " the two senators have co sponsored legislation endorsed by both christies and sothebys auction houses and the art dealers association of america to equalize the tax treatment of capital assets this will be their third try why so far have they not persuaded their congressional colleagues and why have two other bills affecting art collectors and museums run into similar resistance lets look back in congress included in the pension reform act a measure to restrict the practice of letting collectors of high value art make "fractional" gifts of these pieces to museums collectors who cannot use the full tax deduction at one time want to make their gift over a period of years and museums have been happy with such arrangements knowing that the artworks will eventually belong to a public institution still congress limited the length of time collectors could fractionally donate artworks to years and further disallowed collectors from increasing the amount of the tax deduction as the objects rise in value since then museum directors have been screaming that the change has caused fractional gift donations to dry up reps tom udall d n m and phil english r pa have proposed a bill to restore the old system heres the longest playing drama after a change in the tax law artists writers and composers could deduct only the cost of materials when donating their work to museums libraries and other nonprofit institutions in every congress since there has been a bill to allow these creative types to take a full fair market value deduction on their taxes for their gifts museum directors bellow that the disincentive has made artists unwilling to donate their work thus depriving the public of access to it the three bills have run into the same buzz saw they defy standard economic practice or public policy or both reducing capital gains taxes on art to the same as real estate and securities makes sense only if one believes that art is just one more and equally important investment realm "the government is interested in encouraging people to invest in businesses and the housing market and other areas of risk taking that stimulate job growth and generate tax revenues and art doesnt really do that " said joseph cordes professor of economics public policy and public administration at george washington university having a higher tax on art sales "isnt punitive " he says "the government isnt trying to encourage or discourage the sale of art rather it looks to encourage entrepreneurship " on the public policy side he added reducing the capital gains on art sales might have the "unintended effect" of dissuading certain collectors from donating to museums that view was seconded by leonard burman director of the tax policy center of the urban institute who noted that lowering the tax on art sales could result in "shifting into art and collectibles money that should go to more productive things which would be taxed as ordinary income to some extent people would do that " as an example of more productive use of capital he suggested investing in a factory or apartment house in effect reducing the capital gains tax rate would be a gift to the wealthy that doesnt add anything to the overall economy mr burman opposes changes to the law on fractional gifts for the same reason "letting wealthy collectors retain things they supposedly donated and allowing them to take larger deductions for the gifts year after year is a step in the wrong direction " he said and as for artists donations "deducting actual costs make sense because you shouldnt be able to deduct income youve never earned that would end up giving artists a double deduction " he added that changing the law "helps wealthy artists but wouldnt do anything for the starving artist " encouraging donations to museums by artists and collectors is good public policy but changing the tax code to do so may be bad economics lowering the tax rate on sales of art would probably lead to more sales gerald peters an art dealer with galleries in santa fe n m and new york claims that "a huge number of collectors are just waiting for the rate to change before they do sell " if so the increasing number of sales might offset any losses the federal government incurs from the rate reduction but even if the schumer domenici bill turned out to have no effect on the economy it might still be poor public policy "a lot of people visit the art institute of chicago " said john silvia chief economist of wachovia "but not a lot of people can afford the art they see there it is perceived that the buying and selling of art is a rich persons game " the dispute may boil down to whether one sees art as a luxury or an industry "i take issue with the idea that art isnt productive " said gilbert edelson administrative vice president of the art dealers association of america "there is a whole industry involved in it " or perhaps the issue isnt one of economics or public policy but simply an antipathy to "be visibly associated with advantaging people of means " said maxwell anderson director of the indianapolis museum of art the people who make expensive art and those who can afford it appear to have few committed friends in washington mr grant is the author of "the business of being an artist" allworth
