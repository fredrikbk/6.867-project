have been advisers to maharajas mughals and military rulers under british rule they served as administrators a position they kept after indian independence in but in todays india high caste privileges are dwindling and with the government giving extensive preferences to the lower caste majority many brahmins are feeling left out of the economys rapid expansion r parameswaran has suffered that reversal of fortune the year old starts every day with a prayer to the hindu god shiva marking his forehead with red and white powder to let the world know he is a brahmin in his home village his castes mark brought him respect but since he moved to chennai a sprawling high tech city in the southern state of tamil nadu in the late s he has found his status a liability in tamil nadu nearly of government jobs and public college slots are reserved for people from lower castes and other historically disadvantaged groups although he says he graduated near the top of his high school class and had strong test scores mr parameswaran couldnt get into any of the state engineering colleges his family had to borrow from friends to send him to a second rate private college he now teaches english at a small vocational school on a salary of &# a month mr parameswaran cant afford an apartment so he sleeps in the classroom at night "i am suffering " says the intense young man using the exaggerated enunciation of an english teacher "unfortunately i was born as a brahmin " although the role of brahmins has never been synonymous with accumulating wealth many are affluent enough to educate their children in the better private schools on average members of the caste who make up about of indias population of billion are better educated and better paid than the rest of indian people the term brahmin has come to be used globally to describe those at the top of the heap with an attitude to match as in boston brahmins yet close to half of brahmin households earn less than &# a month according to the center for a study of developing societies a new delhi think tank for these brahmins the array of state mandated preferences for other groups present a high hurdle the reverse discrimination is rooted in indian history and politics for decades brahmins were resented for their dominance of the government economy and culture indeed political parties in tamil nadu sprang from anti brahmin feelings "if you see a brahmin and a snake kill the brahmin first" was an old slogan a national constitution adopted in reserved more than of government jobs for lower castes in an additional were set aside for what were called "other backward castes " some states set higher quotas including tamil nadu which reserves of government jobs for lower castes and other needy groups the

simple circle of twine brahmins wear under their clothes after college he had an internship in a state owned chemical company but says he was told he wouldnt be hired as there were openings only for lower caste applicants he says he took exams to join national railways state banks and other government agencies such as the immigration department but found most posts closed to all brahmins except the most brilliant from his makeshift home where he sleeps with a blanket on a desk most nights mr parameswaran still applies for government jobs he pulls out his latest application form and shows a visitor where he always gets stuck the three squares where he has to write the abbreviation indicating his caste "i want government work " he says shaking the application "but they have no jobs for brahmins " mr parameswaran has tried to adapt to the lessening of caste distinctions taking place in many parts of india today especially in cities the changes are less in villages such as the one where he grew up some miles away there his grandfather who is years old still wont wear western clothes and wont eat outside of his home for fear of mixing with lower castes mr parameswarans father has a job with the state telephone company and is more liberal he dresses in shirts and pants doesnt mind eating at restaurants and doesnt expect lower caste neighbors to take off their sandals in his presence mr parameswaran has had good friends from lower castes all his life many of whom have used their communities to grab good government jobs he says he wont eat meat but has no qualms sharing a meal with people of any caste or creed his year old sister r dharmambal is even more liberal he says "she will take non vegetarian food " he exclaims using the common indian term for eating meat mr

were standing around at a hindu scriptures school hoping for work for as little as rupees about &# they offered to perform complicated rituals and blessings required when any hindu has a baby a wedding or a new home "my sons cant support me so i have to survive by performing hindu rituals " says k narayana an year old scholar "if we had been from another community we would have had better opportunities " nearby stands the kapaleeshwara temple with towering gates of colorful carvings from hindu mythology it is one of the most important places for worship for followers of shiva the hindu god of destruction the temple used to be surrounded by rows of simple single story homes each with its own courtyard and well so the brahmin families wouldnt have to share water with other castes most houses have been replaced by concrete apartment blocks and small stores at the temples back gate brahmins beg for spare change or look for odd jobs as cooks or even bearers of bodies to funeral pyres
