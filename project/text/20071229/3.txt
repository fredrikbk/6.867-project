come to bethlehem and see who persecutes the christians in dismissing the necessity of israels security barrier to protect its citizens against attacks by palestinian muslim extremists kenneth l woodward ignores the pressures and ongoing intimidation facing palestinian christians by these same extremists "the plight of bethlehem " op ed dec while christians in bethlehem do suffer daily hardships their situation is not the result of israels desire for land rather it is the fact that during the second palestinian intifada bethlehem served as a hotbed for muslim extremists hateful anti israel philosophy and a breeding ground for terrorism to defend its citizens israel built a security barrier that has saved many lives by preventing suicide bombers from reaching their intended targets inside israel mr woodward claims that due to these necessary security measures the israelis have made it "impossible" for christians to visit christian holy sites in bethlehem yet tourism was up by this christmas and the hotels reported a occupancy rate both indicating israels willingness to find ways to restore a sense of normalcy to the city additionally israel eased travel restrictions for christians living in gaza allowing hundreds of pilgrims to celebrate christmas in bethlehem additionally mr woodward fails to mention the intimidation and persecution palestinian christians endure from palestinian muslims incidents of muslims stealing land from christians defacing their property and physically harassing them are well documented and have driven many christians from the city indeed since the israeli pullout after the oslo accords the situation for them has worsened and the christian population of bethlehem which had been about has been reduced to glen s lewy national chair anti defamation league new york i was surprised to learn that israel alone is responsible for christian palestinians suffering when two american courts accepted the threat of "religious persecution" as grounds for granting asylum to palestinian christians u s courts recognize that palestinian christians are persecuted by their fellow palestinians but for some reason mr woodward does not none of this is to deny that christian palestinians like their muslim neighbors suffer economic depravations but we have a duty also to not close our eyes to the fact that palestinian christians are doubly victimized they are the economic victims of the israeli palestinian war which they did not begin and in which by and large they do not participate and they are the victims of their muslim neighbors intolerance we should help them on both counts not just the one inna tysoe sacramento calif demographic statistics show that after jordan captured the west bank during israels war of independence in bethlehems christian population began falling in response to muslim persecution after the six day war when israel recaptured bethlehem its christian population started rising as it had before but after bethlehem came under the rule of the palestinian authority following the oslo accords bethlehems christian population went into a nosedive from which it has yet to recover the facts speak louder than mr woodward gideon kanner los angeles kenneth woodwards diatribe over bethlehem was all the more remarkable because he admitted he had not visited the city in seven years perhaps for that reason he is ignorant of the fact that half of all the suicide bombers attacking jerusalem came from bethlehem a bomb factory was even discovered near manger square israel had to institute security responses instead of blaming israel woodward could have examined the role of the palestinian authority its policies have accelerated the decline of the christian community of bethlehem not just through supporting attacks on israel but also through an active replacement of christians there are numerous recorded incidents in which christians have been forced to flee their houses and christian representation in the citys institutions has declined dramatically since the palestinian authority took over ironically israel is the only country in the middle east with a growing christian population doron lubinsky atlanta
