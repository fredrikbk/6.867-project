weekend journal picks just asking tim burton the oscar winning director on his new horror musical sweeney todd director tim burton was introduced to the story of sweeney todd a barber whose murdered customers become filling for meat pies when he saw it on the london stage more than years ago now mr burtons take on this year old legend is in movie theaters adapted from the hit musical by stephen sondheim songs have played a part in some of mr burtons previous films including "the nightmare before christmas" and "charlie and the chocolate factory " for his first full fledged musical mr burton worked with lead actors who also lacked experience in the genre including helena bonham carter as mrs lovett and johnny depp who accepted the part of sweeney todd after testing his singing abilities in a friends recording studio before the recent opening of "sweeney todd " we spoke to mr burton about musicals blood and the struggle he has making every movie q "sweeney todd" is a stage classic but your version is just as rooted in the horror genre what were some of your reference points for the film a johnny and i have talked since we did "edward scissorhands" about the old lon chaney peter lorre movies they had an acting style that seemed rooted in silent movies without saying or doing much those actors could register these internal emotions this material seemed perfect for that it reminds me of humphrey bogarts only horror movie "the return of doctor x " it was so cool to see humphrey bogart as this weird ghoul character so to see johnny in this way is almost the same q what was the last musical you saw a ive got a reputation as a musical hater which is not quite the case i remember liking strangely enough the frank sinatra marlon brando version of "guys and dolls " the dialogue didnt feel quite so abrupt q theres lots of blood in the film geysers of it are there different kinds of movie blood a its like red paint we went for the monty python approach rather than the realistic approach the first "sweeney todd" show i saw there was lots of blood but in later versions it seemed like they were trying to soften it make it more politically correct and it lost a bit of its character q you were an artist before you were a filmmaker how did you use art to visualize the movie a instead of making a splatter movie it felt like we were making a jackson pollock painting we tried to use color as a character q at the time of "pee wees big adventure " your breakout feature how did you imagine your directing career progressing over the years a with each one you feel kind of lucky after all these years its surprising that it doesnt get any easier to get a movie made thats the weird part each one is its own unique uphill struggle but thats the way it is after every one you feel lucky about it like with this one its not every day you get to make an r rated musical read an extended q&amp a with tim burton at wsj com onlinetoday
