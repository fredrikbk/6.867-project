the weekend interview with jeffrey gedmin a voice for freedom prague can radio change the world it used to on the walls at radio free europe radio liberty here hang pictures of solidarity rallies in poland and a smiling vaclav havel the message isnt subtle or inaccurate this legendary u s funded broadcaster helped win the cold war the glory days are past at rfe rl and for american public diplomacy as a whole after the fall of the berlin wall when history ended and freedom triumphed or so it seemed munich based rfe rl landed on the chopping block it was saved on a threadbare budget partly thanks to then czech president havel in gratitude he offered cheaper digs in a communist era eyesore here in prague that previously housed the czechoslovak parliament yet in the public mind the station founded in by the likes of george kennan and john foster dulles might as well be gone "were trying to revive it " says jeffrey gedmin the broadcasters new president doing that and making the station a valued tool of u s foreign policy again wont be easy the neoconservative expert on germany and longtime denizen of washingtons think tank world makes an energetic pitch in his nine months in office mr gedmin has told anyone wholl listen that government funded robust "surrogate broadcasting" a stand in where the real thing is missing matters as much as ever "massive evidence suggests that it irritates authoritarian regimes inspires democrats and creates greater space for civil society " he says the mission at rfe rl a pioneer in u s international public broadcasting didnt end in it merely moved further east and south the europe in its name is an anachronism the original central european stations were shuttered years ago rfe rl broadcasts in languages to some of the highest priority and most difficult countries for u s foreign policy today its the most popular station in afghanistan with a market share in a country where radio is the main source of information and one of the last free broadcast outlets in russia central asia and belarus and the american voice in persian in iran but there are several strikes against them the first is the new "media rich" environment with so much competition from the internet podcasts widespread satellite television and radio none of which existed in cold war days the surrogate stations such as rfe rl radio free asia or radio marti for cuba are struggling to hold on to listeners and influence along with the rest of old media in addition the "surrogates" suffer from an existential crisis of their own the nine person broadcast board of governors the federal agency responsible for all government supported international stations is bipartisan but deeply politicized and with a reputation for micromanagement recent years saw the division blurred between surrogate epitomized by rfe rls stations and traditional public diplomacy broadcasting that had been the preserve of the voice of america which as the name suggests is tasked with explaining u s policies to the world the board experimented with different approaches pushing a commercial radio model on the stations intended to win young listeners with music and playing down the old staple of serious programming about politics the economy and culture old timers were aghast "the war of ideas has been demoted to the battle of the bands " noted one participant at a mccormick tribune conference earlier this year on the future of u s international broadcasting the quality and professionalism of the stations have come under attack as well most notably at radio farda the iranian service until recently run jointly by rfe rl and voice of america alhurra the television broadcaster to the arabic speaking world got into political trouble earlier this year for airing interviews with terrorists its director resigned the final strike is structural government run agencies tend to be bureaucratic and inertia bound in other words wholly ill suited for the fast paced media world marc ginsberg an arabic speaking former u s ambassador says "public diplomacy needs to evolve" and tap the best of americas private sector expertise in hollywood or on madison avenue mr ginsberg cofounded a nonprofit television production company layalina which makes shows that are then sold to arab language networks in the middle east its "on the road in america " which followed four arabs on a week trip across the u s was one of the most popular shows in the arab world this year mr gedmin spent a chunk of his career at the american enterprise institute and then ran the aspen institute berlin before taking his current job in prague he agrees with a lot of this criticism early on he shuffled personnel and pushed rfe rl back toward its original "surrogate radio" role with the caveat he says that when appropriate the stations shouldnt shy from trying to explain america to a world so rich with anti americanism "our mission is news " he says "its not psy ops its not u s g government line its news but we tell local staff two things it has got to have a purpose to be promoting democratic values and institutions we also tell them to shoot straight its indispensable for credibility in our markets the moment that any country like iran thinks that we are a front for the bush administration or for u s policy we will lose credibility " he acknowledges some people in the u s wont like it aware of the political damage done by alhurra to the reputation of u s international broadcasting mr gedmin quickly adds that anti americanism isnt tolerated and dares anyone to provide proof of it at his shop but emigre run stations are prone to factionalism and to broadcast what sometimes sounds strange to american ears "youve got to create space to let them find their own voice to talk to their own people " mr gedmin says "it is not my voice my voice doesnt translate well into persian " radio farda is the priority fix he wrested full control over the station from voice of america upon taking office and put in new iranian management next he looked at the programming "the editorial content was very weak and very underwhelming and in some cases just downright misguided " mr gedmin says "when i came they thought oh my gosh washington bush neocon all i did was i sat down with them day after day and said what kind of groups do you want to reach inside iran and they said labor students women a political class open to political change and i said do we do that not really they said ok so what are the issues they care about i asked " the response "economy corruption are very big human rights " radio farda has moved to push these different kinds of stories more forcefully its news and commentary is now supposed to be geared at an elite audience there as elsewhere the idea behind surrogate broadcasting is to inform as well as to start a conversation and encourage critical thinking inside those countries by injecting independent news and ideas unavailable in the local media mr gedmin cites the coverage of fuel rationing this summer in iran which the state run broadcasters avoided "we sent reporters to gas stations who went up to people who said ive been waiting for five hours in my car and this government is giving my money to hezbollah im furious we put it on the web site we put it on the radio we had about three hundred calls " mehdi khalaji a former farda staffer now at the washington institute for near east policy who put out a critical report about the station just before mr gedmin took over says quality control and training remain a problem "mr gedmin needs to hire impartial journalists to monitor radio farda " he says mr gedmin says attracting top journalists to prague and on contracts paid in the sinking u s dollar is a challenge but he says the station is now on the right track most of the region covered by prague based stations is on the wrong track marked by rising authoritarianism and anti americanism particularly in russia prague has reprising the role played by munich become one meeting point for people interested in championing the free press and democracy in russia the caucasus iran and central asia in october the station marked the one year anniversary of the assassination of russias best known journalist anna politkovskaya with a large conference a small research team though a shadow of its cold war self looks at media and political trends in its new region its probably too small the mccormick tribune report notes "substantial analytical research capability" is a "prerequisite for fully effective surrogate broadcasting " mr gedmin says the radio needs to push further into cell phone texting podcasts and other new technology to deliver its programming he hired a new editor for its dowdy internet site with the crackdown on independent voices in vladimir putins russia the russian language radio liberty will have to find new ways to broadcast radio television and written news and analysis into the country through the web "the russians are kicking us off the air " mr gedmin says "pretty soon were going to have to go to an internet strategy if we get it right it could be the refuge for liberal thought in russia " its effect is hard to gauge and a source of dispute in the target countries and in budget battles on capitol hill radio farda is listened to by about of the radio audience according to telephone surveys for all services the average is "we care about audience size " mr gedmin says "never misunderstand me but you cant measure our success by audience size alone " as far as its importance goes mr gedmin cites all the efforts made by governments to jam the radio signal block the web site and publicly denounce rfe rl its journalists as others in repressive countries take considerable risks to do their jobs this year two rfe rl reporters have been killed and one kidnapped and freed after two weeks in iraq two went missing for several weeks in turkmenistan two fled russia one was detained in iran for eight months and two afghans were threatened with beheading by the taliban and one kidnapped a year old reporter for the uzbek service was shot and killed in october in front of his office in kyrgyzstan he had told colleagues in prague that he had been followed by uzbek security skeptics notice the early changes "jeffs the best thing to happen to rfe rl in a decade " says enders wimbush a vocal critic who headed radio liberty in and currently works at washingtons hudson institute yet the outcome of mr gedmins battle to convince congress that american taxpayers ought to pick up more of the tab wont be known for a while its budget at &# million this year is down from &# million in when the u s cashed the "peace dividend " none of mr gedmins successors managed to get capitol hill to commit any new resources in years how to put american public diplomacy in support of democracy back in high gear is an immediate challenge no matter who ends up living in the white house mr gedmin wants to get international surrogate broadcasters back into the discussion "at a time when everybody is arguing soft power is so important this kind of broadcast is the ultimate in soft power " he says "it costs peanuts and it has a measurable impact of success " mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
