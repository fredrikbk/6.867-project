weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes something completely different melon wine anyone right now as a new year is set to begin you should resolve to try different wines in winemakers all over the world are experimenting with interesting varietals in different places and its always fun to try them consider melon many years ago we enjoyed a wine called muscadet from daniel gehrs wines in california muscadet is the name of the inexpensive seafood friendly white from the loire valley of france and wed never seen an american wine called muscadet this one was lovely and perfect with shrimp when we met mr gehrs some years later and complimented him on his muscadet he sighed and said he didnt make it anymore he explained that federal officials had allowed him to use the name for three vintages but then rescinded their approval after the third american vintners arent supposed to use place specific names from other countries this has been reinforced through recent trade agreements and while there is no town called muscadet it is a specific region the authorities told him he could label it with the formal name of the grape that muscadet is made from melon de bourgogne but he declined "i didnt want to call it melon who would buy melon wine i decided i didnt want to fight that battle " actually we have had a couple of american melons over the years we especially liked one from an old winery called merlion but they are rare all of this came back to us recently when we were in a store and saw a melon wine which is actually pronounced meh lohn it was made by elemental cellars in oregon it was the it cost &# and it was quite good fruitier and less neutral than muscadet but with a similarly earthy lovely acidic and dry finish it was excellent with stone crab claws it turns out that a small band of american winemakers especially in the northwest feel pretty passionately about melon one small winery in washington called perennial vintners even has a charming web site devoted to the varietal in the u s at melondebourgogne com so we called elemental cellars to ask why do you make melon wine and what is it like trying to sell it steven westby who owns elemental cellars with his wife sonja and who is its winemaker has been making melon since and produces to cases a year "theres not much fruit to be had " he said after we told him mr gehrs story mr westby said "its even more complicated here in oregon where we are not allowed to use place names the grapes name is melon de bourgogne so we just called it the melon " actually he says "we call it our lucy and ricky wine because theres so much splaining to do" because of the name "whenever im presenting it like at an event people always ask if its made from melons " but he enjoys making it anyway "the wine is melon and it is barrel fermented in neutral cooperage because it rounds the mouthfeel out tank fermentation can really narrow a wine the aromas might be brighter but the neutral oak helps to flesh out the middle and it also has beautiful aromas i think theres no oak in the wine " elemental cellars wines which he says are made from "esoteric" grapes are made at witness tree vineyard where mr westby is also the winemaker elemental also makes pinot gris viognier and syrah judging your elders i started cellaring wine about seven years ago and im just now starting to drink some of the wines do you have any guidelines for judging an older wine were used to drinking more recent vintages and im wondering if thats causing us to dislike some of the older wines im trying to avoid the inevitable fight when my wife says "the wine has turned" and i say "it tastes good to me " chuck mcgrath cherry hills village colo first dottie says its important to keep in mind that your wife is right just in general actually you might be surprised how often were asked this question we had a friend once who cellared a few wines and when he finally opened them poured them all into the sink because he was sure they had turned bad for people who are used to drinking young fruit forward lively wines older well aged wines can be something of a shock its the difference between a wine that comes to you and a wine that you have to go to put another way if youre entirely used to outgoing people it might take some time to understand shy people older wines tend to be subtle often with "browner" and earthier tastes that some people associate with wines that are over the hill in fact like shy people these wines are actually often far deeper more complex and more interesting than young wines in any event even if an older wine is not to your liking at first taste give it time sometimes older wines need a little while to pull themselves together and show their best of course its also possible that the wines really are bad but wed give them every opportunity first to show that they are not melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com
