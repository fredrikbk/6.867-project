weekend journal sports golf journal teeing off on from lorenas rise to dubious aces a year on the links in trolling through the usual end of the year golf roundup articles which i always enjoy doing it struck me this week how small the overlap was with my personal highlight reel despite a job that takes me to some of golfs most interesting places and situations only one of my top three memories of had anything to do with the big time games that was the experience i had in september of closely observing as tiger woods played four rounds at east lake during the tour championship this beat even the special privilege i had earlier of following and interacting with him during a practice round for the u s open at oakmont because at east lake he was competing in and winning an actual tournament at the top of his form i knew with every step i was witnessing history next on my list comes the two lessons i took in february with ben doyle an eccentric old teacher in carmel calif he taught me much that was useful but mostly the pleasure was being in the presence of the man whose passion for the game and hands on style took me back to what i imagine were the simpler hard dirt delights of golf circa the s or s and finally the nine hole round i played in june with my daughter at a funky course near the beach golf is the least of her year old interests but for those few hours i could see by the spark in her eyes that she was caught up in the spirit of the game but even when it comes to the top media driven golf stories of the year i like everyone else have my own personal takes here they are the fedex cup in the absence of any multimajor winners this was probably the main tour story of despite dire predictions of disaster the new four event regular season ending fedex cup series succeeded in its main objectives golf held our interest into the september start of football season which it had never done before all of the worlds top players participated although several skipped an event and the series produced worthy winners in steve stricker phil mickelson and the cup champion mr woods twice my take the tour lucked out that the individual tournaments were so exciting because the overall format lacks drama only the top handful of players have a realistic chance to win the cup and unfortunately given the tours often conflicting obligations to its players sponsors host cities charities and the ryder cup and presidents cup schedules an immediate overhaul is about as likely as congress quickly passing a universal health care bill lorena ochoa in april she replaced annika sorenstam as world no and she dominated the lpga tour more convincingly than mr woods did the pga tour her eight wins included her first major the british womens open played for the first time at st andrews in scotland the year old from mexico is tiny but tough in the off season she pursues extreme sports like triathlons and mountain climbing and makes a point to talk to mexican workers at the tournament sites when she plays and she is just part of the lpgas fresh new appeal tiger woods he started the year with his seventh win in a row and finished with four wins in his last five events including his th major at the pga he exactly tied the lowest ever stroke average he posted in but this time the differential between first and second place strokes was even bigger the year also marked the birth of his first child daughter sam alexis the start of his new tournament the at&amp t national and the launch of his course design business colin montgomerie suggested it would be nice for the other players if mr woods took next year off and i agree he could spend the first three months fixing up the katrina situation in new orleans the next three months solving the mideast crisis and still have time with his family before hosting the target world challenge in december phil mickelson quite a year as usual for sitcom phil the worlds no player he won three times including the players but spectacularly blew late tournament leads three other times as only he can driving the ball like a whirling dervish and taking risks he switched coaches weirdly blamed the course setup at oakmont for injuring his wrist and testily complained about tour commissioner tim finchem in his brief moment on television after winning at the bmw more and more mr mickelson reminds me of jerry mathers as the beaver every week at eastern time central you can pretty much count on the rascal making some kind of lovable mess for himself other characters on tour a banner year we got woody austin aka aqua man who as a year old rookie at the presidents club stole the headlines with his face plant in a greenside pond good old boy boo weekley who came into his own with pithy comments about this great wall they got there over in china and how scotland isnt part of the united kingdom and foot shooter rory sabbatini who not only called mr woods "more beatable than ever" before getting shellacked by him but also grew bored and left mr woodss target tournament a day early the majors given the roster of monsters for this years major tournaments oakmont for the u s open won by angel cabrera carnoustie for the british open won by padraig harrington and southern hills for the pga championship won by mr woods its ironic augusta national home of the masters should have produced the tournament that was the most painful to watch zach johnsons victory was one of attrition more than brilliance and it could be even worse next year if the horrible drought in georgia continues my favorite majors stat south african tim clark made the cut at the u s open with eight bogies and not a single birdie the u s golf associations proposed ban on square grooves little noticed but significant mainly because when it goes into effect as expected for high level competition in and for the rest of us in a decade or so it would be the first actual equipment rollback in years in theory the square grooves make it too easy to spin balls from the rough and thus control how the ball lands and holds on the green at the rate golf technology has been improving more aggressive regulatory action from the usga is long overdue and may continue on other issues affecting how far balls fly some critics contend there is a natural limit to how far things will go without more supervision but thats also what they said about britney spears the hole in one lady a golfer named jacqueline gagne of rancho mirage calif claimed to have made holes in one in seven months this year not since north korea announced that its supreme leader kim jong il in made five aces during the first round of golf he ever played has so much skepticism surrounded hole in one claims bill murray in august the actor was detained for erratically driving a golf cart through the streets of stockholm and afterward declined to take a breathalyzer test i dont really have a take on this story it just makes me laugh to think about email me at golfjournal wsj com corrections &amp amplifications tiger woods won the bmw championship golf tournament and woody austin played in the most recent presidents cup golf tournament the golf journal column in saturdays weekend journal incorrectly said phil mickelson won the bmw and called the other tournament the presidents club wsj jan
