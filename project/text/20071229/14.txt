how turmoil melted a money fund investors with appetite for risk have loads of options to ponder for adventurous investors there may be deals hiding in the rubble of this years market turmoil opportunities are cropping up in beaten down sectors such as financial stocks high quality municipal bonds and even risky high yield or "junk " bonds even "closed end" mutual funds a niche corner of the investment world that usually doesnt see much action may be worth a closer look one of the most beaten down sectors lately has been that of financial stocks which have lost value in recent months as banks such as citigroup inc and brokers such as merrill lynch &amp co have announced multibillion dollar write downs because of their mortgage exposure the financial segment of standard &amp poors stock index is down this year it is always a dangerous game to try to predict a bottom and many analysts believe there might be more trouble for these companies in coming months at the same time they point out that the banks and brokers underlying businesses are relatively sound and over the next few years they should produce decent though not stellar earnings and provide their stocks a boost some large international investors are taking that view in recent weeks government funds from singapore to china have bought stakes in large u s financial companies including merrill lynch and morgan stanley mutual fund firm davis selected advisers lp known for buying cheap or value stocks also recently bought a stake in merrill and upped its holdings in troubled bond insurance firm mbia inc as of sept the jurys out on whether they are the smart money for mutual fund investors looking to make similar bets "the question is do you want to bet on the broad sector or on the specific financial sectors " says ross levin a fee only financial planner in edina minn given uncertainty among larger banks mr levin prefers an exchange traded fund an index tracking fund that trades on an exchange focusing on regional banks which have healthy yields currently these include the kbw bank etf and the ishares dow jones u s regional banks index etf for a broader bet morningstar inc analyst sonya morris suggests looking at the financial select sector spdr or the vanguard financials etf they could "experience significant amount of volatility in the near term " says ms morris but she expects them to do well over the next three to five years within financial oriented mutual funds investors should pay attention to the managers track record over the longer term morningstar recommends davis financial managed by davis selected which is down this year through dec but up an average a year over the past five years and t rowe price financial services fund which is down so far but up a year over five years high quality municipal bonds have been hurt because of worries about bond insurers as well as nervous investors shifting out of them and into very safe government oriented bonds unlike mortgage related securities the muni bonds themselves havent had significant defaults thats causing some financial advisers to jump in the best place to start looking is in high quality short or intermediate term bond funds from families such as vanguard group t rowe price group and allianz global investors pimco funds another way to play munis or other beaten down sectors is to dabble in closed end funds a type of fund that can trade at a price lower than its net asset value partly because of the way they are structured and also to low demand for niche funds like these in some cases this "discount" has touched historical highs this presents an opportunity because if that discount reverts to normal levels as the overall market calms down that is a profit for investors in that fund of course thats never a sure thing in addition it can be tough to pinpoint exactly why funds like these are trading at a large discount in order to filter the good ones from the dogs the key is to first try to identify the funds holdings and what is causing the discrepancy web sites like etfconnect com and cefa com give a breakdown of funds top holdings and credit quality of bonds held for people in diversified portfolios but willing to take on more risk some advisers suggest dabbling in junk bond funds in the first quarter of until earlier this year yields from these bonds were not much higher than treasury yields even though they are far more risky since the summer the gap between the two yields has widened mr levin the minnesota financial planner says he hasnt held these bonds since but might go in early next year but only in small amounts such as of a portfolio "thats an area that can be very dangerous " he says see related article "mortgage problems hit a credit suisse
