weekend journal television inside the wire in the post sopranos world the gritty cop show takes on new importance for hbo the best tv ever broadcast in america come new years wine guru robert parker rapper mims and pulitzer prize winning playwright tony kushner all expect to be in the same place curled up on their couches at home watching the premiere of the final season of "the wire " says mr kushner "its my favorite tv show and i watch tv a lot " the hbo series which begins it fifth season jan and will be available on the networks on demand channel starting monday tends to inspire this kind of manic devotion what the show lacks in numbers last season averaged million viewers per episode premiere hbo says compared with million for "the sopranos" at its height or say million viewers for an "american idol" season finale it makes up for in cachet a favorite among the hip hop world and the intelligentsia "the wire" doesnt have casual fans those who watch watch obsessively in the post "sopranos" world "the wire" is more central to hbos strategy than in years past the networks looking to the series to retain subscribers at a time when many in the industry say its on shaky ground in many ways "the wire" is hbos closest cousin to "the sopranos" theyre both gritty dramas and theyre loved by critics slates jacob weisberg has called "the wire" "the best tv ever broadcast in america " it doesnt hurt that the season will be premiering in early january against other lineups weakened by the writers strike much of whats being scheduled is reality television and reruns "the stakes are higher this time " says brad adgate a media analyst with ad buying agency horizon media "the golden age of hbo is over back when they had sex and the city six feet under and the sopranos " named for the wiretap that a special police unit uses to listen in on members of a baltimore drug ring the shows title doubles as a metaphor for viewers experience of listening in on worlds theyre not usually privy to when the show first aired in it focused on a police investigation in the four subsequent seasons the programs scope has spiraled out to include the stevedores union local politics the school system and the media in short its a portrait of a struggling american city its also storytelling at its most stunning heartbreaking wry and novelistically complex "the wire" has run roughshod over practically every television convention while the police drama typically honors formula see bad guy run see good guy catch him "the wire" is content to let questions go unanswered investigations get bungled and characters escape being pigeonholed the would be hero officer jimmy mcnulty may be "good police " but hes short tempered and reckless when it comes to whiskey and women drug soldier roland "wee bey" brice is one of the citys toughest gangsters and the loving owner of a roomful of tropical fish series creator david simon spent years as a crime reporter for the baltimore sun and draws on his own anecdotes and grievances his decision to tell "the wire" as a hour movie rather than one hour episodes gives him room to expand characters and threads that develop texture more than plot on a network that depends on advertisers a show with the low audience numbers of "the wire" would typically be canceled but a subscription service like hbo stands to benefit from the prestige and buzz of airing such a critics darling another example larry davids improvisatory comedy "curb your enthusiasm " averaged a mere million viewers per premiere last season "if we were going only by numbers then maybe this show isnt what we would go with " says carolyn strauss president of hbo entertainment a unit of time warner inc "but this is the kind of show thats important to the hbo brand we are not selling soap were selling ourselves and theres no better advertisement for what we do than the wire " the network is also using the series to experiment with new viewing models last year hbo started making episodes of certain shows including "the wire" available on hbo on demand a service available on digital cable six days in advance of the scheduled premiere and thats being continued this season this promotional push doesnt work with a plot driven show like "the sopranos " where a leaked spoiler can infuriate fans but "the wire" is different the week the network started offering advance viewings of "the wire" it received orders that number tripled by the final episode and helped push the shows total viewership which includes re airing of episodes up to million from the previous season the watertight writing of "the wire" is often singled out as what distinguishes it from the pack "in a lot of tv shows and movies they twist the truth " says rapper mims who says he grew up in the new york drug world he calls the show "a strong depiction of the reality of the street drug game " mr kushner who won a pulitzer prize for his play "angels in america " adapted into an hbo miniseries in says the show is "smart and its unflinching and its emotionally difficult " the programs stable of writers reads like a whos who of american crime fiction mr simons book "homicide a year on the killing streets" inspired the s tv show "homicide" he wrote over episodes and he co wrote "the corner" with year baltimore police veteran ed burns which became an hbo miniseries the "wire" writing team includes novelists dennis lehane "mystic river" richard price "clockers" and george pelecanos "hard revolution" bill zorzi former political writer and editor for the baltimore sun adds local expertise mr simon is married to another top crime writer laura lippman who has not written for the show but has a brief cameo in the upcoming season as a reporter who coolly watches a building go up in flames when they set out messrs simon and burns were determined to create a five season arc with each season devoted to a different theme mr simon said at the time that if hbo ever decided to pull the plug on the series he would tell the rest of the story in novels the network waited until each new season had aired to commit to the next one mr simon saved the media his most personal subject for last last winter when hbo first committed to seeing the series through it ordered eight episodes mr simon lobbied for they finally settled on "its not a lot of time to tell the fifth season story and to wrap up all the story lines " says executive producer nina k noble "the story is somewhat accelerated and youll feel that in every episode " while some have praised the show as an actors showcase "the wire" has never been a star factory like "e r " which produced george clooney frankie faison the actor who plays commissioner burrell is doing regional theater in new jersey and chad l coleman the actor who plays cutty was recently spotted working a volunteer shift at the food co op in brooklyn n y s park slope neighborhood the decision to base the final season on the workings of a real newspaper proved challenging the producers secured the right to use the suns name but were forbidden from showing the faces of any current sun employees because the newspaper office was never empty long enough to shoot in production designer vince peranio went to the shows art and production office in columbia md pushed the contents of the office into a corner and recreated the newsroom "we visited the suns office about seven times and took thousands of pictures " says mr peranio who says the newsroom set was the most expensive one he created for the show "we do a lot of work but in the end it looks real like a documentary " his team copied everything from the suns office down to reporters stuffed animals and the obituary editors model hearse mr peranio had the incentive to get it right many former sun reporters played extras in the newspaper scenes "it was great having them come in the first time and say oh theres my desk over there " he says when mr parker the wine critic and die hard "wire" fan received a fan letter from series regular dominic west earlier this year he didnt know of mr parkers love for the show the two arranged to meet up for a dinner it was also attended by mr simon and cast members sonja sohn wendell pierce and andre royo mr parker followed up the meal by sending mr simon magnums of california chardonnay and chateauneuf du pape mr parker had suggested that he play a sommelier in the series but that didnt work out he did however get a consolation prize mr simon told him via email that the cast and crew drank his wine at the season wrap party mr parker says "i was thrilled " tapping into the wire jumping into "the wire" midstream isnt easy even fans whove been watching since season struggle to keep track of the sprawling
