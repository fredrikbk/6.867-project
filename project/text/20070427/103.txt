weekend journal review theater poor richard frost nixon bernard b jacobs theatre  w th st &# &#  closes aug biography pearl theatre company  st marks place &# &#  closes may new york whatever else he was or wasnt richard nixon must surely have been the strangest human being ever to serve as president of the united states deformed by unappeasable ambition and visibly ill at ease in his own skin he was the polar opposite of the blow dried focus grouped mannequins who now dominate american politics roger ailes who worked as a media consultant for nixons campaign summed him up in one steel shod sentence "he looks like somebody hung him in a closet overnight and he jumps out in the morning with his suit all bunched up and starts running around saying i want to be president " such a creature was made to be put on stage and frank langella plays him to the hilt and back again in peter morgans "frost nixon " a slick superficial and staggeringly entertaining british docudrama about the making of the tv interviews in which david frost persuaded nixon to admit his involvement in the watergate cover up and apologize for having "let the american people down " mr langellas performance is all the more remarkable given the fact that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to tricky dick weirdly enough he looks much more like gore vidal and the nixonesque voice he assumes in "frost nixon" is not so much an impersonation as a very free caricature hes so far off the mark that it takes about five minutes to get used to him but once you do youll hang on his every twitch part of what makes it all work is that mr langella has created a character who if not exactly like nixon is sufficiently peculiar in his own right to recall the man himself his stiff torsoed walk actually reminded me of peter boyle in "young frankenstein " as for nixons personality mr langella wears it like a catsuit blending self pity and vanity in just the right proportions his final speech in which he admits to frost michael sheen that he envies the younger mans "facility with people " has the bleak finality of an epitaph "that lightness that charm i dont have it never have makes you wonder why i chose a life which hinged on being liked " like mr langellas performance "frost nixon" is heavily fictionalized and at no point should it be mistaken for a factually accurate recounting of the events leading up to the nixon frost interviews nor is it a particularly adept piece of playwriting relying as it does on a narrator stephen kunken who escorts the viewer from scene to scene like an over solicitous tour guide who keeps nudging you in the ribs to make absolutely sure you get the point but michael grandage has staged "frost nixon" with such silken finesse that all you notice is the can you top this acting of mr langella and mr sheen whose portrayal of david frost is slightly less showy but equally bedazzling except for the acting the most interesting thing about "frost nixon" is the fact that mr morgan has presented nixon as a sympathetic even pitiable character though he tries to have it both ways assuring us that the nixon frost interviews drove a stake into the black heart of richard the bad "richard nixon never again held public office of any kind nor achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved his name continues to be synonymous with corruption and disgrace " in fact the interviews were the first step in nixons re emergence as a best selling author and eminence grise whose counsel was sought by presidents of both parties why because the nixon to whom frost introduced us just like the one mr langella portrays was not a one dimensional liberal punching bag but an all too human being full of pain and remorse he made a public act of contrition and the american people most of them anyway forgave him s n behrman used to be one of the hottest names on broadway but that was a million years ago id never seen any of his odd plays on stage until tuesday when the pearl theatre company revived "biography " which ran for performances on broadway in and thereafter dropped from sight very much to my surprise and delight it turns out to be a winner a scintillating light comedy wrapped around an unexpectedly tough core of emotional seriousness at first glance the plot of this exceedingly well made play looks like purest philip barry marion froude carolyn mccormick a bed hopping portrait painter decides to write a tell all memoir thus unnerving one of her old lovers a prudish tennessee lawyer tom galantich who fears that his budding political career will go bust if their youthful romance turns up in her book but the laughter of which there is plenty soon gives way to rue and by evenings end you realize that marion and her friends are deeper than they seem this was my first visit to the pearl theatre company and i was decidedly impressed by the outstanding performances of the ensemble cast which has been tautly directed by j r sullivan but the real star of the show is the script like the mint theater companys equally fine off broadway revival of rachel crotherss "susan and god " this marvelous production serves as a highly pleasurable reminder that more than a few of the now forgotten american stage comedies of the s are still capable of charming modern audiences dont let "biography" slip past you its a gem mr teachout the journals drama critic
