mit admissions dean lied on resume in quits the dean of admissions at the massachusetts institute of technology was forced to resign today after the school confirmed an anonymous tip that she had lied about graduating from college herself the dean marilee jones is prominent in higher education circles as an author and outspoken advocate of reducing the stress of college admissions at mit she redesigned the schools application to include fewer lines for extracurricular activities saying that too many students were puffing up their credentials to fill the space but as the university learned last week ms jones had embellished her own credentials she attended college for one year as a part time student at the rensselaer polytechnic institute in but never received the bachelors or masters degrees that she claimed from rpi nor did she receive a degree she claimed from albany medical college the university found registrars at rpi and albany confirmed that ms jones didnt receive degrees there "its amazing that she only spent that much time in college shes really smart " said michael behnke the admissions dean at the university of chicago and ms joness predecessor at mit "shes really been a leader in the profession she was a leader when she worked for me very creative obviously too creative " he said ms jones who is years old is described as a "scientist by training" on an mit web site for applicants and her nonexistent degrees are listed on her publishers site in a statement released by the university ms jones said she first fudged her resume in when she was hired in a junior position in the mit admissions office when she was promoted to the deanship in she "did not have the courage to correct my resume " she wrote ms jones didnt respond to messages left on her home and cell phones "this is a very sad situation both for the institute and for marilee " mit chancellor phillip clay said in an interview "we take integrity very seriously and it was on that basis that as soon as we determined that these facts were not true we dismissed her even though she has done a great job " mit officials said that daniel hastings dean for undergraduate education and ms joness boss received the anonymous tip about her resume last week setting off an internal investigation school officials arent saying whether they have since learned the sources identity ms joness sudden resignation comes at an inopportune time for mit because tuesday is the deadline for students admitted for this falls freshman class to decide where to enroll its also another blow to the image of higher education which is suffering a crisis of trust in its financial aid offices amid state and federal investigations recently financial aid directors at elite schools including columbia university and johns hopkins have been placed on leave because of revelations that they accepted payments from a lender they recommended to their students at many colleges though not mit admissions deans also oversee financial aid "it certainly has been a bad year for higher education " mr behnke said "obviously our profession is built on trust its an inexcusable thing " bruce poch the dean of admissions at pomona college in claremont calif said the financial aid scandals and revelations about ms joness falsified degrees will likely prompt mit and other universities to check resumes more closely such scrutiny can be "fairly casual" in academia he said particularly in lower level jobs such as the one in which ms jones began her mit career ms jones was a dominant presence at mit she sometimes signed letters to incoming students as "your mom away from mom " after joining the admissions office in she focused on increasing female enrollment at the historically male dominated engineering school as at other top colleges the number of women at the school has surged from of undergraduates in to this year in ms jones was promoted to dean of admissions and launched a national career as a spokeswoman for easing the stress of college admission with a philadelphia pediatrician she is the co author of a book "less stress more success a new approach to guiding your teen through college admissions and beyond " in a statement the books publisher the american academy of pediatrics said it "continues to stand behind the information and positive messages presented in the book " ms jones also served on numerous higher education boards including a regional council of the college board and the national association for college admission counselings commission on standardized testing mr poch said ms jones was "one of the people who was trying to bring sanity back to the whole admissions world shes spoken persuasively and thoughtfully both to parents and admissions deans about restoring the humanity to this process and taking some pressure off kids shed been unbelievably well received " reflecting ms joness prominence mit was scheduled to co host an institute in june to train college admissions staff from around the country to serve as the next generation of deans and leaders in the field lloyd thacker director of the nonprofit education conservancy the other host of the event said he isnt sure whether it will go on as planned ms jones is the latest of several leaders in academia and business who have been caught embellishing their credentials in for example mount holyoke college suspended pulitzer prize winning historian joseph ellis for a year without pay for falsely telling students that he had fought in the vietnam war last year david edmondson resigned as chief executive of radioshack after it was disclosed that he had lied about having a college degree in jeffrey papows quit as president of ibms lotus unit after discrepancies emerged regarding his military and educational record and last month motivational speaker denis waitley was forced off the board of usana health sciences after a private investigator discovered that he hadnt received a degree he had claimed in her statement ms jones apologized saying she was "deeply sorry for this and for disappointing so many in the mit community and beyond who supported me believed in me and who have given me extraordinary opportunities " the university said that it will begin a search for ms joness successor and has appointed an interim dean stuart schmill mit said that its "process of admitting the incoming class continues without disruption " in a wall street journal article earlier this month about colleges checking applicants credentials ms jones noted that colleges had helped to ratchet up the pressure on applicants she said in an interview for that article "the way the whole college application system is set up now it really does encourage cheating and lying " john hechinger and jon weinbach contributed to this article see related letter "letters to the editor driven from job despite years of excellence" wsj may
