commitment to freedom and democracy we discussed ways we can continue to partner together theres no more important partnership than that through the six party talks we spent a lot of time talking about north korea and our mutual desire for north korea to meet its obligations our partners in the six party talks are patient but our patience is not unlimited we expect north korea to meet all its commitments under the february th agreement and we will continue working closely with our partners in iran we speak with one voice to the regime in iran our nations have fully implemented the sanctions imposed by the u n security council in response to irans pursuit of nuclear weapons further defiance by iran will only lead to additional sanctions and to further isolation from the international community japan is the second largest donor to the people of iraq and the third largest donor nation to the people of afghanistan and i thank you shinzo and i thank the people of japan for helping these young democracies survive in a troubled world i firmly believe that were helping lay a foundation for peace for generations to come over lunch the prime minister and i will discuss his upcoming trip to the middle east i will remind him hell be traveling into an important region where extremists and radicals are trying to prevent the hopes of moderate people trying to stop peaceful societies from emerging im looking forward to hearing about your trip before you leave and im looking forward to hearing from you after youve been there shinzo and i talked about trade and the doha round we have a lot of bilateral trade between our two nations last year it totaled more than &# billion and thats positive for the american people and the people of japan any time you have a lot of trade theres always complicated trade issues one such issue of course i brought up to the prime minister is im absolutely convinced the japanese people will be better off when they eat american beef its good beef its healthy beef as a matter of fact im going to feed the prime minister and his delegation a good hamburger today for lunch but we also talked about the world trade organization and the doha round and how japan wants to be constructive in getting this round completed not only to enhance the prosperity in our own countries but to help the developing world help lift millions of people out of poverty we talked about the environment and energy i appreciated very much shinzos vision of using technologies to help our energy security our economic security and at the same time be responsible stewards of the environment theres a lot of work that japan and the united states can do together particularly in fields like emission free nuclear energy nuclear power the truth of the matter is if people really want to solve the issue of greenhouse gases civilian nuclear power powering our energy grids by nuclear power is the best alternative available we can work on new technologies through our joint nuclear energy action plan and through the global nuclear energy partnership to bring technologies on the market as quickly as possible to assure people that we can deal with the waste for example in a responsible way over lunch im going to also remind shinzo about my deep desire to have our folks driving automobiles powered by ethanol and biodiesel im going to share with him our strategy about reducing gasoline consumption in the united states by percent over the next years as a result of ethanol as well as our cellulosic ethanol technologies that are hopefully coming to market quickly all in all weve had a very constructive strong dialogue and i am really pleased you came mr prime minister prime minister abe as translated last night we were invited by george and laura and myself and my wife were able to enjoy a very wonderful time together and today we had one on one meeting and also had a larger meeting and we had very substantive discussions the biggest objective of this visit this time was to reaffirm the irreplaceable japan u s alliance and to grow this stronger as an unshakable alliance i would like to thank the president and the american people for their very warm welcome yesterday i visited bethesda navy hospital and the arlington cemetery and prayed for the repose of the souls of those who died for the cause of stabilization and reconstruction of iraq and afghanistan and prayed for early recovery of those injured and i would like to pay respect and express gratitude for the noble sacrifice the united states is making and in our meeting the president expressed his strong determination to carry through the task of iraqs reconstruction and i told the president that japan understands and supports u s efforts of further stabilization and reconstruction of iraq and japan will carry on its own efforts to the same end i also told him that japan will be with the united states at all times and that we feel proud as an ally of the united states through this meeting ive renewed my determination to work with the united states on various challenges facing the international community on the basis of our common values we were able to speak our minds with regard to our respective political convictions in the midst of this very open and free atmosphere at camp david and deepen our mutual trust i explained to the president that as the mission that my administration i will strive to move japan beyond the post war regime as part of this endeavor i explained to the president that i launched on the eve of this trip a blue ribbon panel for the purpose of reshaping the legal foundation for national security in a way that will benefit that will befit the times now that the security environment surrounding japan is undergoing major change with regard to the economy i told the president that im determined to carry it through structural reforms in japan because japans growth is important for the growth of the united states as well as the entire world and i received strong words of support from the president for this direction that japan is seeking we agree that we need to build on response to we agreed that we need to build our response to the north korean nuclear issue and the numerous challenges in east asia on the japan u s alliance and we agreed to step up cooperation in security economic and cultural exchanges and many other areas to further strengthen this irreplaceable alliance between japan and the united states and i welcomed the conclusion of documents that provide for the strengthening of concrete cooperation in such areas as the economy cultural exchange and nuclear energy we did take a lot of time to discuss north korean nuclear issues we agreed to work together to realize a more peaceful and stable korean peninsula by making north korea completely give up its nuclear weapons and programs through the six party talks with regard to the abduction issue president bush once again expresses unvarying commitment to support the government of japan saying that to this day the strong impressions he got when he met mrs yokota around this time last year still remains i told the president that before my departure this time mrs yokota had told me ever since she last heard from her daughter megumi that the most moving moment was her meeting with the president so the president expressed his as i said unvarying commitment to support of the government of japan on this abduction issue we agree that the current state of the six party talks as well as north koreas attitude towards the abduction issue are regrettable and well work for closer coordination between our two countries to achieve progress let me also point out as the president mentioned earlier that an important progress has been made on the climate change issue and i finalized with the president a joint statement on the subject matter it is gratifying that we agreed japan and the united states agreed at the leaders level to study jointly an intensified dialogue on ways and means to make progress towards the ultimate objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to resolve the environmental issues and to resolve the greenhouse gas issue i believe this represents an important progress it is essential that the world community act on the climate change issue in concert and japan and the united states agreed to work together on this front thank you bush two questions a side deb would you start off please question thank you mr president some people are concerned that youre going soft on north korea you said you had bush said what did you just say theres an echo in here question some people say youre going soft on north korea you said you had unlimited patience with the regime theyve missed their deadline on shutting down their nuclear reactor bush no i said our patience is not unlimited question not unlimited my question sir is how long are you willing to wait to have them shut this down are we talking days weeks months and bush no i appreciate that very much do you want to ask the prime minister something too its an old u s trick here keep plowing through it laughter question are you worried that america is softening its stance on kim jong il bush i have always believed that the best way to solve these difficult problems is through diplomacy thats the first choice of the united states to solve difficult problems diplomatically i also believe that the best way and the difficult problem of course was to convincing the leader of north korea to give up his nuclear weapons program i also felt the best way forward was not for the united states to carry this diplomatic mission alone and therefore worked very hard and closely with our japanese allies to convince others to come to the table beside the united states and now we have what we call the six party talks which is the united states japan and china and south korea and russia all saying the same message to north korea that we expect you to honor agreements you made which include not only stopping locking down their plant but also dismantling their programs and all programs giving up weapons programs and weapons thats what theyve said they would do we recently had a bump in the road to getting them to honor their agreement and that is there is a financial arrangement that were now trying to clarify for the north koreans so that that will enable them to have no excuse for moving forward and thats where we are right now the interesting thing about our position is that if it looks like the north korean leader is not going to honor his agreement if it looks like that there are reasons other than the financial arrangements that will cause him to say well i really dont mean what i said we now have a structure in place to continue to provide a strong message to the north korean we have the capability of more sanctions we have the capability of convincing other nations to send a clear message so i like our position in terms of achieving this mission in a diplomatic way and i want to thank the prime minister for being a strong advocate of sending a clear message to the north korean leader that theres a better way forward than to defy the world on all issues there is a whether its this issue or any other issue is that we will work with our partners to determine how long but as i said our patience is not unlimited and thats the operative word for the leader in north korea to understand we hope he moves forward soon obviously just like in somebody asked me the other day how long in darfur well the leaders will find out the definition of how long when we make it clear were moving in a different direction theres still time for the north korean leader to make the right choice abe today this issue had very candid exchange of views our understanding of the issue and the direction we are pursuing we completely see eye to eye on this matter and weve had completely the same attitude well continue to deal with the north korean issue we have to make the north koreans understand that unless they keep up their promise the difficult conditions they find themselves under the food situation and economic situation theyll not be able to resolve those difficulties and in fact the situation would only worsen so they need to respond appropriately on these issues otherwise we will have to take a tougher response on our side in agreement with the procedures set down by the six party talks well have to continue to watch whether the north koreans will actually act in our negotiations with north koreans we now have learned full well their negotiating ploys and between japan and the united states well maintain close coordination for the resolution of this issue question once again allow me to ask questions related to north korea in japan the interpretation is that the united states have become softer on the bda banco delta asia issue and some people are concerned now mr abe in your meeting today did you ask president bush to step up the american pressures on north korea and a question for mr president i understand the united states has agreed with north korea to start negotiations on lifting the terrorist state designation is it right to consider that a precondition for lifting would be the abduction issue resolution abe to resolve the north korean issue of course dialogue is needed but in resolving those issues and in negotiating with north koreans there is a need for pressure and on that score george and i fully agree we reaffirmed that point today should the north koreans fail to keep their promise we will step up our pressures on north korea and on that point again i believe we see eye to eye as for the importance of the abduction issue george and our american friends im sure are fully aware and they understand our thinking and they support our position in resolving that abduction issue as well japan and the united states will cooperate with each other when we need to cooperate with each other and the president thinks the same way bush we have shown the north korean leader that obstinance on this issue that theres a price to pay we have come together as a group of nations all aiming to achieve the same objective and that is for the leader to north korea to verifiably give up the weapons program that he has just like he said he would do and we have proven that we can work in collaboration to deny certain benefits to the north korean government and people thats what weve shown so far i think its wise to show the north korean leader as well that there is a better way forward i wouldnt call that "soft " id call that wise diplomacy its his choice to make ultimately not our choice as to whether he honors the agreement he agreed to our objective is to hold him to account but hes got different ways forward and we have made that avenue available for his choice so the meeting today of course is to hope for the best and plan for the worst were hoping that the north korea leader continues to make the right choice for his country but if he should choose not to weve got a strategy to make sure that the pressure weve initially applied is even greater thats our plan and so it is he ought to know that if he makes right choices there is a way for him to be able to deal with a listing that our government has placed on him in other words theres a way forward and this is what youre referring to is the beginning of a process its the beginning of an opportunity for him to be in a different position vis a vis the united states government on a variety of fronts any discussion about ways forward however shouldnt should not obscure my strong sentiment about the abductee issue the prime minister mentioned how mrs yokota was affected by her visit to the oval office well i was affected by her visit to the oval office it broke my heart to be in the presence of a japanese mother whose love for her daughter has not diminished over time and her grief is sincere and real i remember her bringing the picture of the child as she remembers her right there where i go to work every day and sitting it on the couch next to her so im deeply affected by her she needs to understand that her visit added a human dimension to an issue which is obviously very important to the japanese people and i will never forget her visit and i will work with my friend and the japanese government to get this issue resolved in a way that touches the human heart in a way that its got more than just a kind of a diplomatic ring to it as far as im concerned its a human issue now to me its a tangible emotional issue and thank you for bringing the question up toby question mr president the democrats have voted for a withdrawal timetable from iraq which you have said that you will veto what ideas do you have for breaking this logjam going forward and would you be willing to veto a second bill bush well first of all i havent vetoed the first bill yet but im going to and the reason why im going to is because members of congress have made military decisions on behalf of the military theyre telling our generals what to do theyre withdrawing before weve even finished reinforcing our troops in baghdad theyre sending in my judgment a bad message to the iraqis and to the enemy and most importantly to our military folks so i made it clear id veto and by the way theyre adding spending that shouldnt belong in the bill in the first place maybe theyre important issues but they ought to be these spending bills ought to be or spending issues ought to be debated in the normal course of business so ive said this all along my position has been consistent im sorry its come to this in other words im sorry that weve had this you know the issue evolve the way it has but nevertheless it is what it is and it will be vetoed and my veto will be sustained and then the question is the way forward and my suggestion is that and i invite the leaders of the house and the senate both parties to come down soon after my veto so we can discuss a way forward if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept a timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of the sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is i really think its a mistake for congress to try to tell generals our military experts how to conduct a war furthermore the idea of putting all kinds of extraneous spending on a bill the purpose of which is to fund our troops i just dont accept that so if they want to try again that which i have said was unacceptable then of course ill veto it but i hope it doesnt come to that i believe we can work a way forward i think we can come to our senses and make sure that we get the money to the troops in a timely fashion its important to have a political debate but as ive consistently said we dont want our troops in between the debate and congress needs to get this money to the pentagon so the pentagon can get the money to the troops so our readiness will be up to par training missions will go forward i know congress no matter what their position is on the war doesnt want to affect readiness and they dont want to affect the military families i understand that but theyre going to if they keep trying to pass legislation that is that just doesnt that withdraws troops or micro manages the war so im optimistic we can get a bill a good bill and a bill that satisfies all our objectives and thats to get the money to the troops as quickly as possible question a question on the wartime comfort women issue mr prime minister on this issue did you explain your thoughts to president bush and on this matter did you talk about further factual investigations on the matter and any intent to apologize on the issue also a question for mr president on the comfort women issue from the perspective of human rights and asian history perceptions i wonder if you could express your thoughts or views abe well in my meeting with the congressional representatives yesterday i explained my thoughts and that is i do have deep hearted sympathies that my people had to serve as comfort women were placed in extreme hardships and had to suffer that sacrifice and that i as prime minister of japan expressed my apologizes and also expressed my apologizes for the fact that they were placed in that sort of circumstance the th century was a century that human rights were violated in many parts of the world so we have to make the st century a century a wonderful century in which no human rights are violated and i myself and japan wish to make significant contributions to that end and so i explained these thoughts to the president bush the comfort women issue is a regrettable chapter in the history of the world and i accept the prime ministers apology i thought it was very i thought his statements konos statement as well as statements here in the united states were very straightforward and from his heart and im looking forward to working with this man to lead our nations forward and thats what we spent time discussing today we had a personal visit on the issue he gave his he told me what was on his heart about the issue and i appreciated his candor and our jobs are to obviously learn lessons from the past all of us need to learn lessons from the past and lead our nations forward thats what the prime minister is doing in a very capable way listen we thank you all for coming appreciate your time have a nice weekend mr prime minister thank you source the white house
