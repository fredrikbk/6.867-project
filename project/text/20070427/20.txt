certified madness one of the more interesting sections of the war funding bill congress will soon send president bush is its provision for "readiness " the bill prohibits spending funds "to deploy any unit of the armed forces to iraq unless the chief of the military department concerned has certified in writing that the unit is fully mission capable " john murtha d pa chairman of the house subcommittee on defense appropriations is mainly responsible for the clause mr murtha is a marine vietnam combat veteran and hes concerned that u s forces dont have all the resources they need to complete their missions u s navy ensign george gay would have been bemused ensign gay became famous in world war ii as the sole survivor of torpedo eight a squadron flying off of the uss hornet in the pivotal battle of midway if ever there was a unit of the armed forces that wasnt "mission capable " it was torpedo eight in june the navys new torpedo bomber the grumman tbf avenger wasnt ready so ensign gay and the other americans had to fly old douglas tbd devastators an aircraft that was inadequate for the task of taking on japanese fighters a devastators top speed was about mph the japanese interceptors zeros could do around mph thats correct the japanese pilots had an advantage of about miles per hour but ensign gays bigger problem was training "when we finally got up to the battle of midway it was the first time i had ever carried a torpedo on an aircraft " he later told a navy interviewer "and was the first time i had ever taken a torpedo off of a ship had never even seen it done none of the other ensigns in the squadron had either " ensign gay and the others got the attack plan in "chalk talks" and then rehearsed the attack by walking through the steps on the flight deck not a single tbd flying that day from the hornet made it back ensign gay was the only one of the men in his squadron who survived the attack and he had to be fished from the sea a day after the battle the tbds from the other two american carriers suffered similar losses but by drawing the zeros to themselves the slow low flying devastators gave u s dive bombers a clear shot to strike from above the dive bombers sank three of the four japanese carriers a loss that decided the outcome of a battle that proved to be turning point in the war in the pacific which gets us back to mr murthas readiness provision lieutenant gay he was promoted later briefed the events to a navy interviewer he described the situation succinctly as "a difficult problem " "we had old planes and we were new " the pilot recalled "we had a dual job of not only training a squadron of boot ensigns " he said "we also had to fight the war at the same time " in fact training and fighting became one and the same ensign gays squadron leader told him and the others to follow him to the target and then they figured out a way to get through the flack when they got there ensign gay and the other pilots knew they were ill equipped and under trained but they flew the mission anyway because they also knew that something larger was at stake like losing the war if they waited until someone was willing to "certify in writing" that they met official readiness standards its unfortunate and often tragic but thats what happens in war or at least one that you are serious about and thats the issue are we serious about the war can anyone imagine congress in passing a provision like the one in the current bill would they constrain gen dwight d eisenhower the way they propose to constrain gen david h petraeus mr murtha has good intentions but hes got it exactly wrong if u s forces lack the equipment or training they need its his job as the chairman of the one subcommittee specifically responsible for originating defense appropriations to make sure they get it if legislators really dont believe we should continue in iraq they need to come clean shut down the war and accept the risks and take responsibility for the consequences otherwise they need to provide u s forces the means to carry out their missions mr berkowitz is a research fellow at the hoover institution at stanford university see related letters "letters to the editor desperate heroic missions of world war ii dont apply to iraq" wsj may
