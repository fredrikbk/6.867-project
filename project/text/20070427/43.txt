gene therapy over the past years biotechnology has come to represent an american success story with public and private companies employing tens of thousands of people the u s is universally considered to be the global biotech leader america can brag that its biotechnology companies capture about of the global revenue have a highly educated well paid work force conduct most of their research development and manufacturing here at home and are a net exporter in foreign trade in fact in the pursuit of scientific excellence several of the larger european pharmaceutical companies have chosen to "outsource" biotech related r&amp d operations to the u s how many industries can make such claims but perhaps the most important metric for americas biotechnology industry is the impact on the lives of real patients for years we have been helping patients suffering from cancer to multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis to rare genetic disorders simply put the industry has helped transform science into real cures which has meant less death and disability for our patients yet while we have seen great progress the unmet need is considerable about people die every day in this country from cancer an estimated million americans have alzheimers disease this number has doubled since there are approximately ms patients in the u s every week about more patients are diagnosed thousands of patients today suffer from rare genetic disorders many of us have never even heard of these diseases but they traumatize patients and leave behind a trail of broken frustrated families what will the next years mean for our industry and the patients we serve the answer will depend in large measure on what happens in washington over the next two years unfortunately in recent months our lawmakers have stirred up a witchs brew of initiatives that is cause for some concern not only for the biotech industry but for all americans congress should take care when enacting new legislation that may squander americas global leadership in biotechnology this is especially true as it relates to pricing safety and generics historically biotech innovation in the u s has benefited from relatively free pricing this invisible hand has allowed us to attract patient investors to fund research projects that take approximately to years and &# billion apiece to bring to market that is why the early steps by the house of representatives to repeal the new medicare drug benefits noninterference clause are so problematic for biotechnology companies forcing our companies to negotiate directly with the federal government sends a clear signal to investors that prices will be dictated not negotiated by the agency that runs medicare weve seen price control attempts before on biotechnology and the results were not pretty during the health care reform debate the biotech stock index fell approximately the retreat by investors was felt by large and small companies alike actually repealing medicares non interference clause could have similar results driving investors out of the industry would inhibit our efforts to turn new scientific tools and pathways such as those emerging from the human genome project stem cell research and information technology advances into real medicines to help patients in need while the senate recently blocked a repeal of medicares noninterference clause this issue may well surface later in the year the better option is to continue to support the medicare part d drug benefit independent polls suggest choice and competition among plans is driving up the quality of care for senior citizens while driving down costs at the same time we are dealing with an irrational drug safety scare the vioxx panic started the drumbeat for tougher drug safety laws and an overhaul of fda oversight but consider an exhaustive analysis of drug safety data recently conducted by ernie berndt of mit and tomas phillipson of the university of chicago with their team of researchers they concluded among other things that congressional efforts in the s to speed up fda review times did not fuel a drug safety crisis rather the data indicate that about to of approved drugs continue to be withdrawn the same rate as before passage of these reforms so a very careful balance has existed at the fda for decades that looks at the benefits and risks of potential treatments to determine if they should be approved it is not a perfect system but then again in the real world ones appetite for risk depends in large measure on the disease from which one suffers in fact every day patients make this "risk risk" calculus they decide whether the potential risk of a therapeutic option outweighs the risk of a given disorder thus cancer patients are willing to tolerate chemotherapy in an attempt to rid them of their disease i have recently seen this risk risk proposition up close in february biogen idec and our partners at elan withdrew from the market a highly promising ms therapy called tysabri because we had suddenly seen a very rare and serious potential side effect we immediately heard from ms patients who were disappointed frustrated and scared some had limited therapeutic options and many of them knew that their future involved disability to the point of requiring a wheelchair they organized made their voices heard and demanded a return of this treatment today tysabri is back on the market in no small measure because of the efforts of these ms patients the experience reinforced to me that while our patients want to be warned of known risks they also understand their disease and want even demand the right to choose their own therapies congress would be wise to keep these ms patients in mind when crafting new drug safety legislation that may place roadblocks between doctors and their patients care if the intent is to really improve drug safety we should provide robust steady funding for the fda approximately of the agencys operating budget currently comes from drug company user fees that is too high and it fuels a perception problem for an agency that regulates of the u s economy and almost everything americans put into their bodies finally we need a strong predictable patent framework that protects the work of our scientists while rewarding innovation in the rush to embrace all things that appear to drive down health care costs congress should step back and move very thoughtfully on any legislation concerning generic versions of biotech drugs more accurately termed "biosimilar" legislation getting this wrong could result in reduced r&amp d spending or possibly unsafe drugs being pushed through a scientifically flawed regulatory process could this happen yes because unlike traditional pharmaceuticals which typically come in pill form biotech products are large protein based therapies that are usually injected by patients they have a complex three dimensional structure and their manufacturing process involves living cells in bioreactors to help illustrate the difference in complexity one can compare the approximate molecular weight of the popular pharmaceutical zantac d to that of epogen d one of the leading biotech drugs used to help cancer patients to be clear when the science is ready biosimilars should be approved in the u s but the science should be demonstrated through rigorous clinical trials to help ensure patient safety in fact the european approach may serve as a model they have taken early and prudent steps to ensure that benefits risks and incentives for innovation are weighed in the process in short they have constructed a framework predicated on sound medical science not on political science now there are important signs that congress is concerned about the future of biotechnology and the impact on our future patients additional funding for basic biomedical research for example will be a boost for our industry so will additional resources for science education at all levels and there is some reason to hope that moderate voices in congress will temper the early rush to embrace troubling legislation but if we stumble china india singapore and other emerging countries will gladly seize the leadership role they are actively courting global biotechnology firms and offer a potent blend of financial incentives improving intellectual property laws and a vast pool of scientific talent and expertise who are the patients of the future we see them every day in the mirror in our neighbors our spouses and our children directly or through our families and friends we will all face death from cancer or a rare genetic disorder or the frustration of alzheimers or parkinsons diseases or an ms relapse that may put us in a wheelchair for the first time what congress does and does not do over the next two years may well impact the future of biotechnology and all of us for decades to come mr mullen is president and ceo of biogen idec inc and chairman of
