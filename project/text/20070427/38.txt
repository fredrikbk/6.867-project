dropped call how motorola fell a giant step behind as it milked thin phone rivals sneaked ahead on the next generation a year ago motorola inc appeared headed for a third straight year of rich profits under chief executive ed zander driven by its hit cellphone the razr "a lot of you are always asking what is after the razr " mr zander said in an april conference call after another quarter of plus growth "i say more razrs " but behind the scenes motorola was working furiously to get a successor phone to market by the second half of according to people familiar with the matter when it failed to do so profit margins on handsets narrowed and the company swung to a loss key executives left and as the stock slid activist investor carl icahn built up a position and began campaigning for a board seat to address what he called motorolas "operational problems " motorolas travails illustrate the risks for a company that rides high with a big consumer hit amid its success with the razr it fell behind on developing a phone with the next generation of technology missing a beat is especially hazardous in cellphones where it can take two to three years to develop a new line meanwhile motorola faced corporate infighting during the transition to a new ceo from outside the industry which interrupted new product development mr zander has also struggled to bring his silicon valley ways developed from years in the computer business to the cellphone world mr zander years old took the reins in january with a mandate to bring a fresh vision to motorola the year old schaumburg ill company had been run for most of its history by the galvin family but the board ousted christopher galvin as ceo in after problems including a shortage of cellphone cameras the snafu disappointed motorolas biggest customers the wireless carriers that sign customers up for cell service in silicon valley mr zander had risen to president at sun microsystems inc his straight talking feisty manner earned him the nickname "fast eddie " at motorola he set about changing a culture he saw as inward and bureaucratic he tried to bring a west coast vibe to headquarters replacing wood paneled executive offices with open spaces that encouraged interaction he also began carrying around a silver prototype of a skinny phone in development since the razr "id go to a restaurant with my wife and lay it on the table and the waitress would go what is that how can i get that " mr zander said when the marketing chief at the time geoffrey frost said the razr could inject pizzazz into motorola mr zander authorized a big launch in appearances for the razr in a gwen stefani music video and the razrs own television commercial but things were unsettled in the cellphone division its chief tom lynch wasnt high on the razr according to mr zander saying carriers werent interested in it and it was too expensive challenging mr lynch was ron garriques head of european handset sales and a man who had lost out to mr lynch to lead the cellphone division mr garriques began campaigning for mr lynchs job after the camera phone problem which occurred on mr lynchs watch mr garriques told the new ceo he was concerned about the quality of cellphones in the pipeline and "petrified" about what would follow the razr at the end of its run say people familiar with the matter motorolas president at the time mike zafirovski suggested making mr garriques cellphone division chief according to testimony in a recently settled suit about an unrelated matter but mr zander was annoyed by this attempt by the president who had lost out for the ceo job to influence a high level personnel move according to testimony from mr zander in the suit which was in federal court in chicago instead of promoting the ambitious mr garriques mr zander berated him for trying to undermine mr lynch "you know ron youre being belligerent youre not supporting your boss " mr zander told him at a conference in cannes france according to testimony from mr garriques in the suit a motorola spokesman said the purpose of the cannes meeting was for mr zander to meet mr garriques and disputed that mr garriques warned him about the lack of razr successors messrs zafirovski and lynch declined to comment mr zander began to warm to mr garriques after he saw how motorolas market share had improved in europe under mr garriques now when mr lynch left for a job elsewhere in august mr zander replaced him with mr garriques the switch affected both how the razr was positioned in the market and how ready motorola would be for the next industry development known as third generation or g phones which can send and receive larger amounts of data and play video and music mr garriques was unimpressed with products under development and scrapped many of them according to people familiar with the matter the phones he dropped were motorolas attempt to develop a new "platform" a common set of phone design software and components which would include g technology scrapping the products and starting over on the g work at that late date meant motorola would have to rely longer than usual on its existing phone platform it dated all the way back to mr garriquess move meant motorola would try to create a g phone in an unusually short time of less than two years if it failed it would fall behind rivals such as samsung electronics co lg electronics inc nokia corp and sony ericsson in delivering g phones at the time motorola was booming driving sales was a group of three flip top phones dubbed the triplets plus the new razr the company had initially expected to sell only around two million units of the costly razr priced at its launch in late at &# but mr garriques because of his dim view of other products in development decided to boost volume in spring motorola began lowering the razrs price the company has since sold close to million razrs the phone changed the industry forcing others to play catch up with their own ultra thin cellphones mr zander was the razrs biggest supporter motorola hired tennis star maria sharapova to promote the skinny phone among other new products and sent razrs to most of the oscar nominees for acting and directing awards in early as the razr grew hot some former designers and engineers say motorola repeated mistakes it had made a decade earlier with another big hit the compact flip top phone known as the startac that phone was a huge seller but it also was an analog phone and its popularity blinded the company to an industry shift to digital technology similarly while motorola was selling countless razrs competitors were hard at work on more sophisticated products for g networks motorola put engineers and designers who could have been working on new products on the razr and its derivatives some former executives say "all resources went to feeding the beast " says a former motorola designer "suddenly you created this thing that requires a lot of energy and attention " other former executives dispute that the focus on the razr diverted work from other products and contend motorola was right to ride the still popular razr as long as possible mr zander tried to come up with other hit phones using existing non g technology by tapping contacts in silicon valley at his first meeting with industry analysts he had apple inc s steve jobs patched through on wide screen television soon after motorola and apple announced the first of what was to be a series of phones created together a music cellphone called the rokr but it was delayed when wireless carriers tussled with apple over how to share revenue from song downloads when it was finally available in september the rokr drew negative reviews for its design and limited song storage although it was a disappointment mr zander viewed it as just the first in a line of rokrs but the name had been tarnished by the poor launch underscoring that what might work in the computer software world where version can be followed by version doesnt necessarily apply to the cellphone business according to former executives motorola says the product line didnt die after the first version pointing out a successor rokr was sold in the u s mr zander began to resent the notion that wireless carriers rather than consumers were his primary customers according to former executives this meant he had little control over pricing and distribution to the people who ultimately use the product on one occasion he burst into a meeting of the handset division and threw a pile of newspaper cellphone ads on the table demanding to know why motorola phones were selling so cheaply according to someone who was present executives told him carriers decide the price and would go elsewhere if motorola didnt want to lower its prices "i love my job i hate my customers " mr zander shouted according to people present the phrase became a favorite of mr zanders these executives say and he joked that when he eventually wrote his book he would use it as the title motorola says mr zander may have used a similar phrase in a teasing manner but only to point out what he viewed as a lack of customer focus at the company when he arrived the company says mr zander meets with customers constantly and has instituted bonus pay based in part on employees treatment of customers while motorola was recording impressive numbers strains were growing the company suffered a blow in november when mr frost the marketing chief and champion of the razr died suddenly at it took the company almost a year to find a successor executives of motorola have acknowledged its marketing and product launches suffered after the death its work on g phones also faced problems a semiconductor unit motorola had spun off was having trouble developing new chips for g cellphones that slowed work on them because motorola had pledged to buy all cellphone chips from the spun off unit through the deal also meant motorola couldnt shop for cheaper chips elsewhere squeezing profit margins of existing phones by last summer executives realized that their hopes of developing a g cellphone in a fast two years were probably too ambitious it would take at least two quarters longer the product wouldnt be available until summer when cingular wireless one of motorolas biggest customers launched g service in late motorola had no handsets to offer cingular got them from samsung "we let that customer down " mr garriques later said at an analyst meeting mr zander grew testy with those doubting the companys direction at a conference in september a money manager began a question by observing that many of motorolas products were already there when he arrived the ceo cut her off a transcript shows accusing her of posing questions fed by his predecessor "shes a troublemaker so lets just move on " mr zander said to get through the difficult quarters motorola brought out higher priced razr like models with more capabilities but many consumers ignored them in favor of the original by now far cheaper razrs profit margins plunged on jan of this year the third anniversary of mr zanders arrival the company sharply lowered its estimate of fourth quarter earnings the stock fell nearly the next day later that month mr icahn disclosed he had acquired control of about of motorolas shares he demanded the company sharply step up stock repurchases mr zander became more involved in the handset division he suggested a new strategy in several key markets particularly in the developing world the company would no longer match competitors price cuts mr garriques disagreed with the change and resigned in february moving to dell inc motorola reported a loss for the first quarter lowered its outlook for all of and agreed to step up its stock buybacks mr zander declined re election to the board of time warner inc which he had just joined to focus on the problems mr icahn says he will closely monitor mr zanders performance and if the company is still struggling by the end of year the board should hold management accountable "the results up to now have been unacceptable " he says proxy advisory firm institutional shareholder
