politics &amp economics world bank discord threatens u s sway selection process for chief executive gets wider scrutiny washington as paul wolfowitz fights to keep his grip on the world bank presidency he has reopened a long festering question should the u s continue to handpick the poverty fighting institutions chief executive and give the job to an american for the banks critics mr wolfowitzs turbulent reign underscores the need for a more open selection process and a choice that reflects the huge changes in the world since the end of world war ii when this tradition began "this should be the nail in the coffin of this system " says nancy birdsall president of the center for global development an influential antipoverty advocacy group in washington had mr wolfowitz been chosen through a process crafted to find the best candidate he would have had the "great benefit of more legitimacy and more widespread support " says ms birdsall who is among those calling for him to resign if the selection process doesnt change the wolfowitz controversy will put the spotlight on the credentials and character of his successor should one be needed soon "if president bush doesnt move fast enough to replace wolfowitz with a much more credible candidate possibly a credible non american the u s risks losing any vestige of control over the job " said harvard universitys ken rogoff a republican who has served as chief economist at the international monetary fund the world banks sister institution mr wolfowitz insists he is staying has vowed to change his management style and is engaged in a test of wills with the banks board which is deliberating on allegations that he had showed favoritism in securing a compensation package for his girlfriend also a bank staffer mr wolfowitz who complained in writing to the board that he is being treated "shabbily " declined a request to appear before a special board committee this week saying he needed more time to prepare and complaining the panel wouldnt allow his high powered washington lawyer robert bennett to participate the panel has agreed to wait until next week "there has been a rush to judgment which is not fair to him " mr bennett says president bush shows no signs of backing away from mr wolfowitz international criticism about mr wolfowitzs place as world bank president began with his nomination because of his previous role as an architect of the u s war on iraq and as a symbol of u s unilateralism now questions about his girlfriends pay have broadened into criticism of his management his credibility as a corruption fighter and the banks governance since he started there in many current and some senior former world bank staffers are calling for him to go a group of officials who advise governments on reducing corruption yesterday circulated a statement saying "the credibility of our front line staff is eroding in the face of legitimate questions from our clients about the banks ability to practice what it preaches on governance " the statement came from members of the drafting and implementation team for the banks governance and anticorruption strategy and from officials involved with the banks public sector governance board a spokesman for mr wolfowitz declined to comment on the statement amid the din expectations are growing that mr wolfowitz will go if he does the u s hasnt shown any signs of letting go of its privilege of picking the banks president a tradition established by a gentlemens agreement between the founders of the bank and the imf technically the president is hired by a member board that represents the countries that own the bank the u s with a capital share of has the largest vote and by tradition always has selected the banks top executive the same arrangement gives the europeans the top job at the imf which gives europeans reason to hesitate over abandoning the custom at the world bank but the practice has bred resentment among asian nations that have gained economic might and among poor countries that receive aid robert holland the u s representative on the board from to sees a "philosophical argument for a more open process" at both the world bank and imf if changes are made in tandem but as a practical political matter he says the ability to name the banks president ensures the u s remains interested "if we lose that then u s politicians and taxpayers are really going to question the value of what were getting for our contribution to that institution " he says one option if mr wolfowitz goes voluntarily or otherwise is for the u s to push for an american who would be less divisive and more popular with other countries one possibly less divisive candidate floating around now within the bank and in washington is stanley fischer a zambian born u s citizen who did a stint as world bank chief economist and is now israels central banker other american possibilities include jim leach a former republican congressman from iowa who once worked in the state department indiana sen richard lugar the senior republican on the senate foreign relations committee and robert zoellick a former bush trade representative and deputy secretary of state the u s could retain its privilege of nominating the next president but choose someone other than an american possible candidates being mentioned include ashraf ghani credited with overhauling the economy of afghanistan after the u s drove out the taliban in and trevor manuel the south african finance minister and a former chairman of the development committee the senior
