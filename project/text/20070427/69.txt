politics &amp economics canadians grow war weary afghanistan death toll puts heat on harper more than a year after deftly elevating his conservative party from the political hinterlands to minority control of parliament canadian prime minister stephen harper is facing an unpredictable complication on the road to a majority afghanistan a growing prisoner abuse scandal followed by the deaths earlier this month of eight soldiers in six days the highest weekly death toll for canadian combat troops since the korean war is pushing the war in afghanistan to center stage in canadian politics support for the war among canadians has dwindled to half from two thirds in a poll this week by the globe and mail newspaper and ctv television network found that believe the price in afghanistan where canadian soldiers and one diplomat have been killed and soldiers injured has become too high up six percentage points from october that has cut into mr harpers popularity the opposition meanwhile is increasingly critical on tuesday parliament narrowly defeated a motion by opposition leader stephane dion calling for canada to guarantee the withdrawal of its troops by february "we suspect that the government wants to have an open ended war " mr dion says "we have no evidence that canada has the military capacity to continue for so long this is a clear signal of the difference of our points of view " mr harper who took office in february has criticized mr dions call as an attempt to capitalize on the deaths of the soldiers "we did not hear a lot about this in the last few months because canadian troops had not suffered casualties " he said in parliament last week "we see some unfortunate casualties and they are back to attacking the mission the leader of the opposition likes to talk about what is unfair that is unfair to the men and women in uniform " beyond the immediate circumstances the war debate touches a nerve with which all canadian leaders must contend the always tricky task of working with the u s a leader in natos multilateral effort in afghanistan without seeming like its junior partner president bushs unpopularity in canada and the duration of the fighting have made the job tougher for mr harper when mr harper ran for office he presented himself as a man with clarity of vision and moral purpose willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with the u s to defeat terrorism after being sworn in he began a five year plan to boost spending for the military which has about troops active and reserve by billion canadian dollars us&# billion he also articulated a new more aggressive vision for how the military should be used earlier this month at the rededication of vimy ridge in france where canadian soldiers died during world war i mr harper linked the sacrifice of soldiers in afghanistan with their sacrifice in france but in the past half century canadians have become more accustomed to a military that works on peacekeeping missions and rebuilds villages than one whose soldiers chase insurgents through mountain strongholds in canada didnt join the u s led coalition formed for the iraq invasion peacekeeping is embedded in canadas self image it is portrayed on coins and bills the peacekeeping monument near the national gallery in ottawa is the only major government military memorial erected since world war ii last year polls showed that canadians widely believed their troops were on a peacekeeping mission in afghanistan still canadian forces have been on the front lines for the past two years taking part in nato offensives recently mr harper has toned down his and his cabinets rhetoric earlier this year a series of reports commissioned by the foreign affairs office advised mr harper to avoid using the phrase "war on terror" and to emphasize the humanitarian aspects of the campaign in his first report to parliament on afghanistan in february mr harper stressed the development projects under way ahead of the military campaign this week mr harper defended his government against charges that the canadian military turned taliban fighters over to afghan military prisons where they were tortured an economist by training who first made his name as a right wing politician from alberta mr harper originally ran largely as a reformer the beneficiary of a patronage scandal that blackened the eye of the liberal party after years in power he crafted a socially and fiscally conservative family values platform designed to appeal to a broad swath of suburban and rural voters after his party won the most seats in parliament but not enough for a majority he began tacking steadily toward the center with an eye toward majority control in the budget he unveiled last month he increased transfers from the federal government to the provinces by about in the fiscal year from to &# billion he also proposed &# billion in environmental initiatives such as tax breaks for hybrid cars to address concerns about global warming mr harper who turns on monday has brought a vigor and political savvy to his office that has both impressed and polarized his countrymen he has inserted the phrase "canadas new government " into the public realm and changed the color on the governments web site to conservative blue from traditional red canadian news outlets have reported that the portly prime minister travels with an image consultant and has taken care to avoid being photographed anywhere except behind a podium after photographers snapped him in afghanistan last spring with his belly hanging over his belt last fall mr harper deftly disarmed longstanding separatist tensions by calling quebec canadas second most populous province a nation within a nation then he funded a tax cut of c&# per person there the subsequent belly flop of the once powerful separatist parti quebecois which came in third in the quebec provincial election last month opened the door for the conservatives in quebec that progress is critical to mr harpers ability to gain a federal majority but the provinces support for the war in afghanistan is typically or more points weaker than in the rest of the nation says darrell bricker of ipsos reid a polling firm in canada that weakness is a central concern in mr harpers strategy to force an election says nelson wiseman a political scientist at the university of toronto in august about soldiers from quebec are due to head to afghanistan "one rogue bomb inside the wire" of the base camp says mr wiseman "and afghanistan could be the issue "
