fed official cites heightened risks on growth and inflation the recent puzzling disconnect between slowing economic growth and falling unemployment has "significantly increased" risks to both the economy and inflation a fed policy maker said federal reserve bank of san francisco president janet yellens remarks were the most detailed analysis from a fed official on one of the most important questions in the current economic outlook her analysis though not necessarily shared by all her colleagues suggests the feds decision on what to do next with interest rates has become more treacherous in recent months "with heightened risks to both growth and inflation the best course for policy is watchful waiting " ms yellen told the money marketeers of new york university an academic group that promotes economic education and discussion she reiterated the feds march statement that its main concern remains inflation while also indicating an interest rate increase isnt on the table "we must be careful not to tighten too much thereby posing unnecessary risks to continued expansion " ms yellen noted that economic growth slowed last year and has been "notably weaker" this year reflecting in particular weak business investment by most estimates recent growth is below the economys long term "potential" growth rate which is the rate needed to maintain a steady unemployment rate given growth in the work force and worker productivity the fed had wanted the economy to grow below potential to create extra capacity that would help damp inflation pressure but ms yellen noted instead of rising unemployment has fallen she said one benign explanation for this disconnect is that unemployment lags growth and that the disconnect will disappear "with a little more patience " another is that growth is stronger than the official data show she said another explanation is that long term growth in worker productivity has also fallen if so the economy "would have to grow at a slower rate than we previously thought was necessary to generate more slack " ms yellen said she wasnt sure which explanation was correct and it was possible all play a part regardless they have added weight to "the worrisome side of things " especially on the state of underlying inflation pressure
