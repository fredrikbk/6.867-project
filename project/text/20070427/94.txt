vive la similarite paris for more than two decades socialist and gaullist leaders have frozen the french state presidents francois mitterrand and jacques chirac both belonged to a political tradition of authoritarianism and economic interventionism they ruled like elected monarchs they increased public spending they opposed "american imperialism " "to lead the french diplomacy " mr chirac famously declared "you only need to do the reverse of what the u s government does as it is always wrong " but france is changing in sundays initial round of our presidential election the french picked two relatively young political leaders both in their early fifties on the left segolene royal belongs to the socialist party but has thrown out the marxist rhetoric thats been its staple while she is vocally hostile to big business small and medium entrepreneurs are just fine and her hatred toward george w bush aside ms royal has nevertheless pulled her party closer to the center sometimes even right of center than any previous socialist politician tony blair is clearly on her mind as a confirmation of this tectonic shift of the french left the unreformed and eternal communist party managed only of the votes an unprecedented defeat we still have trotskyite parties three under various denominations but they belong to our political folklore actually the aim of these far left parties is not to start a revolution but to forever safeguard the benefits of the public sector trade unions which they represent significant as well is the severe defeat of the ecologist and anti globalization candidates trounced at the polls despite garnering huge media coverage and a lot of sympathy from our radical chic journalists their anti progress stance anti biotech food demonstrations and alarmism about global warming all played well on television but did not sell to the french people this remains the country of pasteur after all a similar shift has occurred on the right which is much deeper in conservative territory than it ever was in the history of the gaullist movement nicolas sarkozy officially a gaullist is not afraid of looking tough on law and order he said he would send illegal immigrants back to their native lands this has helped him bring down the national front a far right party to a historically low ebb as part of a vicious campaign organized by the left mr sarkozy part hungarian and jew has repeatedly been called racist even though he has never displayed any form of xenophobia mr sarkozy constantly refers to his christian values and says pope jean paul ii is his hero ms royal hints that her four children have been baptized this in the secular anti church french republic more provocatively mr sarkozy is not anti american he proved it by obtaining a photo opportunity with george w bush at the very beginning of his campaign true enough he sometimes tones down his pro american stance by sending some barbs toward washington but far less frequently than any u s democrat would mr sarkozy has disappointed diehard free market advocates by his cautionary approach often times he sounds more like a u s liberal than a milton friedman disciple but this is france where any politician fears provoking the entrenched interests of the public sector more revealing is mr sarkozys record as president of the hauts de seine local council which has a budget the size of belgium he has skillfully introduced the privatization of public services as the best way to run this wealthy region near paris but the shift in the political landscape is only part of the story looking at france only through its political life and the chattering class would be a major mistake in real life the civil society is ahead of government reforms higher education is one example the teachers unions have always resisted any modernization of our centralized anti elitist universities as a consequence a huge number of students receive a poor education and obtain degrees which do not lead to economic opportunities tired of expecting reforms which are never implemented entrepreneurs have opened hundreds of small private universities mostly in academic fields which faculties despise like marketing with a degree from those private universities each student is almost sure to find a rewarding job there is also change in the immigrant ghettos small shops thrive for example in the marseille suburbs the immigrant population does not wait for the central government to find a solution for their economic problems rap singers with arab or african origins have become entrepreneurs in entertainment and fashion they openly advocate capitalism in their lyrics too often it is said that france is in a crisis the french state certainly is running a huge deficit and employing far too many in the public sector but french society is finding its way out of the crisis while politicians run behind after this presidential election hopefully the gap between the french people and their government will become more narrow and the state more in tune with the times the french people already are mr sorman is the author of books on french politics and international affairs
