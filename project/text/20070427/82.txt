the daily fix sharks defense dominates quiets sparse detroit crowd online edition the detroit red wings have ranked in the top in scoring the last three nhl regular seasons until thursday theyd been shut out just once over the last games spanning nearly three years and that was a loss on the road but in game one of a western conference semifinal not a single one of the red wings shots made it past sharks goalie evgeni nabokov another shots were blocked by san jose defenders before they could challenge mr nabokov a stunning total shot blocking has become a crucial if dangerous hockey skill as michael farber wrote in sports illustrated in february meanwhile the sharks played it safe after two quick goals and were content to take fewer shots than theyd blocked en route to a win "the tedium was the message a waltz of uninspired hockey between two of the nhls most dynamic teams " yawns mr farber on si com part of the boredom stemmed from a surprisingly sparse and quiet detroit crowd michael rosenberg attempts to remind the city about its once beloved franchise "surely you remember the red wings hockey team perennially in the playoffs the guys like to skate around with the stanley cup every few years does any of this ring a bell " mr rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "there were thousands of empty seats at joe louis arena on thursday the wings gave the official attendance as but i suspect they meant limbs " mr rosenberg wisely apportions much of the blame to the franchise and not the fans many of whom are suffering along with detroits puttering economy "in the last few years we have seen the state unemployment rate rise the pistons become one of the best franchises in sports the tigers make the world series steve yzerman retire and the wings payroll drop from almost &# million in to &# million this year " mr rosenberg writes "yet the wings expect fans to open the checkbook as they did in playoff ticket prices have dropped from their peak but they remain too high the wings have clearly misjudged the market and its sad because all kidding aside i think a lot of people would jump on this bandwagon if the prices were reasonable " mr rosenberg suggests detroit might have to be downgraded from its moniker of "hockeytown" to mere "hockeyvillage " and virginian pilot columnist tom robinson is ready to nominate norfolk va to take its place at least until tonight the local admirals of the ahl are hosting the penguins of wilkes barre scranton pa in a first round playoff series tied at two games apiece if the admirals fail to win the series it will be their final home game in norfolk after a remarkable year run of playoff appearances or two years longer than the red wings next year theyll be replaced by the tampa bay lightnings less successful ahl affiliate "admirals die hards arent abundant norfolk was th in attendance this season with a per game average " mr robinson writes "but they are a loyal vocal and spoiled in a good way lot who will make their feelings known should rotten hockey enter their lives " unlike the orlando magic who lost by points last night to fall behind in their playoff series against the detroit pistons the los angeles lakers wont be swept behind points from kobe bryant l a recovered from an early deficit to beat the phoenix suns "give it up to the lakers " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic "left for dead by nearly everyone in the basketball universe phil jackson held an airing out session on wednesday he let the team do some crying he let them do some whining then he made them take responsibility for their previous six quarters of basketball and then vowed to bench any player who refused to hustle in game the lakers responded with a nifty show of pride and force and as usual the aggressor got the benefit of the calls " but to san diego union tribune columnist tim sullivan the lakers remain an awkward sum of kobe and a below average supporting cast which suggests success isnt sustainable "kobe bryant is wasted here " mr sullivan writes "he is elvis playing a las vegas lounge to the rhythmic indifference of the slot machines he is picasso confined to a canvas the size of a matchbook cover he is a singular talent stuck on an inadequate stage the most brilliant basketball player of his generation relegated to spectacular solo riffs and collective mediocrity " the utah jazz also staved off a series hole in more convincing fashion utahs victory over the houston rockets "may have been the ugliest basketball in the history of mankind but it was good for a win " gordon monson writes in the salt lake tribune what a strange april its been for the new york yankees alex rodriguez begins a season on a blistering pace but the pitching implodes and the team stumbles toward last place its so unusual it happened last two years ago those yankees recovered from an start to win the al east new york post columnist joel sherman is doubtful this years last place team can replicate that feat at least not in the same fashion "do the yankees really want to see if they can get two players from their minors to excel instantly the way chien ming wang and robinson cano did " mr sherman asks "do they really believe aaron small type lightning will strike twice or that a shawn chacon will pop on the scene to pitch like an ace " the yankees are hoping that year old phil hughes can help out but his major league debut last night ended in a victory by the toronto blue jays nonetheless he showed promise and three strong pitches "judging from the early look hughes can certainly become one of the games next generation of stars but as in all phases of life there are no guarantees " richard griffin writes in the toronto star speaking of no guarantees the nfl draft starts on saturday how good is mel kiper jr espns draft prognosticator on football outsiders david cohen reviews mr kipers record at identifying overrated and underrated players and finds that hes wrong about as often as hes right despite the onions satirical report that saturdays draft is in chaos because mr kipers big board has been knocked over mr kiper has no monopoly on draft misfires any nfl fan can recount his or her teams list of first round draft busts and few teams have a longer list in recent years than the washington redskins washington post columnist thomas boswell explains why the trade value of first rounders often surpasses the contribution that might be made by the player being drafted nfl teams cant afford to focus all their scouting on players on field performance to determine the next star from this years draft class not after the nfls crackdown on bad behavior away from the field but even in this new environment tailing likely no pick jamarcus russell with hour surveillance as the lsu quarterback has claimed one unnamed team was doing is going too far "what a standard he had to follow " dan wetzel writes on yahoo sports "what was the team or teams looking for a trip to a campus bar a pool hall a sorority house a visit with an old friend from back home who may be a little rough around the edges imagine what would have happened to joe namaths draft status had they tailed him for a couple weeks back in the s " of course if an aspiring nfl player doesnt make it he could just invent a pro career thats the disturbing path taken by larry laverne jacobsen who according to a column two years ago by the oregonians john canzano frequently pretended to be former nfl lineman larry paul jacobson mr canzano catches up with larry laverne in todays sad
