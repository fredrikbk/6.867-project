weekend journal review television a primer on mormonism in the pbs documentary "the mormons " the first two hours are presented as part of "the american experience" series and the second two hours constitute a "frontline " monday and tuesday p m et but check local listings the spirit that stands out is that of the former gentler series in fact "the mormons" is such a respectful biography of a religion that when some of its officials pointed out in advance that the church did not help pay for or have editorial input into the documentary i first assumed that they were defending themselves in advance against possible criticism that it is a puff piece it turns out that the disclaimer was meant to assure members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints that while lds leaders cooperated with filmmaker helen whitney this doesnt mean that they endorsed the producers take on every aspect of their religion a segment on polygamy does end with speculation that while the church formally believes that the revelation from god which once encouraged the practice has since been divinely rescinded many nonpolygamous mormons secretly admire the estimated to practitioners who believe they are keeping true to the original commandment then there is the section on the mountain meadows massacre when on september about men women and children in a non mormon wagon train were slaughtered in utah by a militia of mormon men and paiute indians the show allows speculation along with denials that brigham young himself either ordered or set in motion the massacre on balance however the documentary presents even these particularly sensitive topics in an understanding way overall depicting mormons more as victims than as anything else by the time we learn about the massacre for instance we have heard how for decades mormons were attacked killed harassed and driven ever further westward from their homes by other americans and in some instances by threats from the government itself whatever really happened at mountain meadows viewers are left with the sense that as awful as it was the massacre was the result of decades of persecution and the paranoia this created much of the other history recounted here could be described as a profile in courage of a misunderstood people the origins and tenets of the faith are less easy for outsiders to relate to they spring from revelations to joseph smith who was born in and raised in new york state when he was he later wrote god and jesus appeared to him in a grove of trees when when he was he was visited by the angel moroni who sent him to discover golden plates that were the book of mormon which he eventually translated from egyptian hieroglyphics the details of how all this happened are bound to sound peculiar to non mormon ears yet two concepts alone may be enough to explain why this new religion so small at first aroused both fear and animosity one was the prospect of mormons creating a theocratic state within a state wherever they lived the other not dwelt on in the pbs series yet troublesome even shocking for people of more mainstream faiths is the assertion that we can all become gods tuesday nights segment focuses on contemporary mormonism themes include missionary work said to gather in some souls around the globe each year church rituals and beliefs in traditional family structures as one interviewee puts it its hell to be mormon and gay but we already knew that and whats fresher here is the suggestion that the rest of us had better not judge mormonism lest we be judged ourselves time and again were reminded that what sounds nutty or extreme to our ears may not be with their dancing for instance early mormons celebrated the physical that mainstream christianity repressed ex mormon margaret toscano even allows that in advocating polygamy joseph smith was trying "to bring together spirituality and sexuality " which most major religions she says christianity included have been "really bad at " the timing of "the mormons" with harry reid leading democrats in the senate and co religionist republican mitt romney running for his partys presidential nomination couldnt be better compared to the average media portrait of other religious groups e g evangelical christians the treatment of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints

and a number of social activists who knew and were in awe of marlon brando analyze his genuis and praise his commitment to civil rights friends meanwhile explain how the torment of his childhood spilled over into his relationships with men and in particular women and found expression in his acting even the hagiography is mostly riveting stuff although viewers of a less reverential frame of mind may be forgiven for watching many of these movie scenes and asking themselves was this not the biggest ham who ever lived highlights include a clip of tennessee williams looking and talking like a character being played by brando and lawrence olivier telling an interviewer that he and brando were alike although he probably was not referring to the collection of excruciatingly bad movie
