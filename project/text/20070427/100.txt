weekend journal review books nirvana by the sea esalen by jeffrey j kripal university of chicago press pages &# situated on a stretch of breathtaking pacific coastline between san francisco and los angeles the esalen institute in big sur has been a household word and sometimes a household joke since the late s the institutes cliffside hot baths encounter groups experimentation with psychedelic drugs and a form of massage that its web site touts as "empowering each individual to regain a sense of harmony reverence and balance and to awaken inner resources for healing" have made esalen an exemplar of hedonistic california living since its founding in but esalens early reputation as a bastion of hippiedom is no more after nearly a half century the institute is still going strong and has achieved a degree of respect during the cold war esalen engaged in hands across the ocean outreach to the soviet union some people from all over the world have journeyed to big sur to experience what esalen calls its "olympics of the body mind and spirit " its online catalog lists hundreds of offerings that give the flavor of the place a sampling "eidetic imagery training program" "spiritual massage lightbody infusion" "finding your deepest purpose" and "be here wow a buddhist workshop for cynics in recovery " let it be noted that in the late s i wrote a novel that made fun of the excesses of the human potential movement which is generally thought to have originated at esalen i wasnt alone in being amused according to jeffrey j kripal author of the voluminous "esalen america and the religion of no religion " even michael murphy one of the institutes co founders made fun of the human potential movements excesses all these years later i approached this book with curiosity and some writerly envy what a subject encompassing the social history of the past four decades and major shifts in thinking about spirituality but mr kripal chairman of the department of religious studies at rice university has confused exhaustive with exhausting the human elements of esalens history which is where its fascination lies for non insiders get lost in masses of detail for starters an explication of the institutes theological underpinnings occupies pages before we learn much about what the people who come to esalen leaders and seekers alike actually do there and we never learn much more co founder murphys writings are examined both minutely and reverently throughout the book in fact one suspects that mr murphy is being nominated for sainthood tantalizing references pique ones interest then leave it at that regarding a visit by albert hofmann the swiss scientist who discovered lsd were told "his psychedelic bike ride home is the stuff of legend " end of anecdote writer leo litwaks essay on esalen "joy is the prize " in late "would spark a media blitz " no explanation why finally mr kripals prose is relentlessly dense and academic words such as "gnosis " "hermeneutic " "mythologification" and ouch "totalizing" fall short of music to the ear so does language that verges on coy as in "a certain john steinbeck " after the first mention of henry miller he becomes the overly chummy "henry" and aldous huxley "aldous " although mr kripal didnt know either man miller or as mr kripal calls him "the banned eroticist " frequented the areas natural baths in the s long before esalen existed huxley visited big sur just once and met esalen co founders richard price and michael murphy only briefly although the author believes that "his intellectual personal influence on the place was immense " so whats left to like in a book that took prodigious dedication to write but almost sinks with the weight of its exegesis quite a lot particularly in the passages when mr kripal a true believer turns eloquent in describing esalens goal of increasing the human capacity for joy and its core belief in "the religion of no religion " in essence his explanation suggests esalen throws out the bathwater but not the baby having recognized at its beginning that "the deepest problems of the world could not be solved by moving the religious pieces around on the board here or there or by pointing a finger at this or that player " the institute chose to operate with "secular notions of religion as a primarily private affair of personal choice " amen to that and then there is the large cast of flamboyant often brilliant people parading through these pages richard price is the books most intriguing figure prodigiously charismatic as mr kripal portrays him price was also subject to psychotic breaks and wild enthusiasms such as one for "the automatic writing of a british psychic named jenny oconnor " at one stage price called upon the "nine immortal beings" that oconnor channeled to help him with the administration of esalen we also meet gestalt therapy founder fritz perls "the way of zen" author alan watts apollo ix astronaut rusty schweiker writer hunter s thompson and musician ravi shankar the human stories that do get told are huge fun take for example the incident when ida rolf of massage therapy fame thinks that she has accidentally killed fritz perls during a rolfing session but no when revived perls says that "he knew perfectly well that hed been unconscious " fascinating details not related to esalen also surface such as the mention that as a novice seminarian jerry brown the future governor of california made the heavy cord whips used in flagellation rituals then theres outright weirdness the young michael murphy is in an automobile accident he has just broken his vow of celibacy and connects the two events mr kripal who calls this "murphys sexual car wreck " writes that "there was something there that day a certain decision or command to incarnate to descend into the flesh and the world in order to fulfill the deeper vow that is the calling to cofound esalen and help create the human potential movement " to incarnate where was murphy until then and in what form in leo litwaks l essay the one that sparked the mysterious media blitz he wrote of the catharsis that he experienced during a soul baring session in an esalen encounter group the piece ends with his feeling exhilarated by "that tingling sense of being wide awake located in the here and now feeling freely and entirely all constraints discarded " if only "esalen america and the religion of no religion " a first rate piece of scholarship had managed to capture the excitement of what huxley called "the doors of perception" swinging open ms mcfadden is the author of the novel "the serial a year in the life of marin county" and "rain or shine a family memoir" she lives in the san francisco area
