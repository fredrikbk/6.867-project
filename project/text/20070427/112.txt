weekend journal the home front catalog critic flowers a mother could love hydrangeas get easier to find and last longer or should the repot or not question cut flowers are nice and theyve long been a popular option for mothers day you havent forgotten its on may right but this year we wanted a token that wouldnt wilt after a week we chose potted hydrangeas with their round cheery colorful blooms the flowers can last for two weeks retailers say and if mom has a green thumb she can transplant her gift into the garden until recently most hydrangeas grown for gifts in the u s market came from california says brittany streufert brand manager for retailer calyx flowers now growers in south america are producing them making the flowers cheaper and easier to get year round theyre showing up in more gardens too "mophead" hydrangea plants the most common type in the u s came from japan and have been popular in the west for several hundred years beloved by gardeners in seaside areas where they thrive they can be temperamental in northern regions where they often wont bloom because the winter cold kills their flower buds but since the plant industry has introduced newer varieties including one called endless summer whose ability to bloom isnt affected by winter freezes we chose five potted versions with blue flowers all appropriate for replanting outdoors their retailers promised but potted mail order hydrangeas we learned may not be best for replanting unlike those sold by nurseries and intended for the yard hydrangeas grown for houseplants often have been forced into bloom through a combination of light fertilizer and other factors as vendors typically didnt identify their plants varieties we werent sure how theyd fare in extreme temperatures we didnt try replanting them white flower farm for one said its plant could survive winter temperatures down to minus degrees fahrenheit but smith &amp hawken said its plant is not suited for very cold climates as houseplants they were generally beautiful even if as we discovered mom would have to dote on them as if they were children many required water every day sometimes more than once if hot or dry the flowers will wilt the redenvelope plant had a pretty blue and white pot but was in a near constant state of swoon another drooper the calyx flowers plant arrived with unopened blossoms and one eventually shriveled stymied we sought advice from bridget montgomery who tends the hydrangeas at the wauwinet inn on nantucket mass her diagnosis the pots might not be big enough relative to the plants to hold enough water a spokeswoman for calyx flowers suggested watering via a dish at the plants base but then youd have to take it out of its cute blue and white cachepot a redenvelope spokeswoman says its plants inner and outer pots have a special wicking system to deliver more water to the plant best overall and value go to the jackson &amp perkins hydrangea it was relatively wilt
