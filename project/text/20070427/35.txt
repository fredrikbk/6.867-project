economists react economists blame housing but cheer u s consumers online edition the first reading on first quarter u s gross domestic product showed an anemic growth rate of well below the annual pace economists had expected the biggest culprit was the housing sector which dragged down growth even as consumers did their part on spending and key gauges of inflation accelerated following are some economists reactions the housing sector and the trade deficit were the main culprits the falloff in residential construction subtracted percent from growth new home construction should bottom out in the second quarter and then contribute to stronger gdp growth in the second half of the year the trade deficit subtracted from growth this loss was held down by a dramatic drop in crude oil and refined petroleum product imports in february that cannot be sustained the trade deficit will subtract from gdp growth for the balance of peter morici university of maryland there is no indication in these data that the weakness in housing has adversely affected consumer spending at least not yet economic activity slowed sharply in the first quarter because substantial strength in consumer spending nearly offset substantial weakness in housing net exports and inventory investment despite the spurt in inflation with economic growth well below trend for the fourth consecutive quarter core inflationary pressures should recede unless the weakness in housing spills over into consumer spending the fed is likely to keep their target funds rate steady for the rest of the year steven wood insight economics  got off to a slow start but there are reasons for optimism the figure was held back by weak trade and government spending in addition to continued headwinds from housing the former items are candidates for upward revisions while the impact of the latter should diminish over time inflation indicators suggest the core personal consumption expenditure deflator may move back to the top of the feds target range opening the door to a possible change in bias if the fed is so inclined drew matus lehman economics we cant be sure which gdp components undershot economists consensus but wed bet that most forecasters had bigger estimates for government spending which rose only and inventories which rose &# b nearly &# b less than we had expected inventories pulled off the headline gdp number consumption rose a hefty better than we expected though it will be much weaker in the second quarter as gas prices bite ian shepherdson high frequency economics the year over year gdp growth rate dipped to the lowest since the second quarter of and now flirting with the economys historic recession tipping point this markedly sub par rate of year over year gdp growth implies a significant rise in the unemployment rate in the next few months janet yellen today characterized the labor market as going gangbusters that is unlikely to last richard iley bnp paribas the first quarter estimate overstates the weakness of the economy probably the best estimate of the underlying growth rate of the economy is the pace of final sales to domestic purchasers which excludes the volatile inventories and net exports components this measure has been growing at about in each of the past three quarters the composition of gdp bodes well for a slight rebound this quarter consumer spending grew by a strong business investment spending rebounded and inventories were a much smaller drag nariman behravesh global insight we now have four consecutive quarters of subpar growth is the fed paying attention the huge restraints from housing should start fading but dont expect consumption to be so robust going forward i do expect business spending to remain cautious for the rest of the year put that together and it is very likely we will see additional subpar growth rates through the summer the feds stay the course policy is based on faulty intelligence when the inflation data were revised and it turned out we never had core inflation below the range should have been adjusted at that point it would be nice if the fed members simply admitted that they goofed changed the range and indicated that inflation really wasnt a major problem then we could get back to a more realistic evaluation of the inflation threat and some realistic monetary policies joel naroff naroff economic advisors compiled by cindy perman
