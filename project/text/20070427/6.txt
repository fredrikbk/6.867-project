africans for wolfowitz one of the most revealing subplots in the european coup attempt against world bank president paul wolfowitz is who is coming to the americans defense the rich european donor countries want him to resign while the africans who are the banks major clients are encouraging him to stay you wouldnt know this from the press coverage which continues to report selective leaks from the bank staff and european sources who started this political putsch the latest "news" is that the european parliament has asked mr wolfowitz to resign thus sustaining that bodys reputation for irrelevant but politically correct gestures if mr wolfowitz leaves no doubt some of the europols will angle for the job the more telling story is the support for the bank president from reform minded africans at a press conference during this months world bank imf meetings in washington four of the more progressive african finance ministers were asked about the wolfowitz flap heres how antoinette sayeh liberias finance minister responded "i would say that wolfowitzs performance over the last several years and his leadership on african issues should certainly feature prominently in the discussions in the liberian case and the case of many forgotten post conflict fragile countries he has been a visionary he has been absolutely supportive responsive there for us we think that he has done a lot to bring africa in general into the limelight and has certainly championed our cause over the last two years of his leadership and we look forward to it continuing " the deputy prime minister for mauritius rama krishna sithanen then piped in that "he has been supportive of reforms in our country we think that he has done a good job more specifically he has apologized for what has happened " sub saharan africa is the worlds poorest region and mr wolfowitz has appropriately made it his top priority on his first day on the job he met with a large group of african ambassadors and advocates his first trip as bank president was a swing through burkina faso nigeria rwanda and south africa he has also named what we are told are the banks first two african born vice presidents if youre surprised by that last fact then you dont appreciate that the world bank has always been a sinecure for developed world politicians they get handsome salaries tax free and their performance is measured not by how much poverty they cure but by how much money they disperse mr wolfowitz has upset this sweetheart status quo by focusing more on results and especially on the corruption that undermines development and squanders foreign aid yet many of the poor countries themselves welcome such intervention at the same april press conference zambian finance minister ngandu peter magande endorsed the anticorruption agenda "we should keep positive that whatever happens to the president if for example he was to leave i think whoever comes we insist that he continues where we have been left in particular on this issue of anticorruption that is a cancer that has seen quite a lot of our countries lose development and has seen the poverty continuing in our countries and therefore we want to live up to what wolfowitz made us believe" that "it is important for ourselves to keep to those high standards " the real world bank scandal is that mr wolfowitzs enemies dont care much about africa the french and brits who want him ousted have never entirely shaken the paternalism they developed during the colonial era their real priority is controlling the bank purse strings and perquisites as for the coup attempt mr wolfowitzs fate now rests with the member bank board europeans dominate while we saw only two africans listed on the banks web site these profiles in buck passing have asked mr wolfowitz to meet with them on monday his lawyer can join him but wont be allowed to speak the noisy leaking and staff protests are aimed at getting mr wolfowitz to make their life easy by resigning but that would only validate their campaign to oust him for giving his girlfriend a raise that the banks own ethics committee advised him to deliver after he had tried to recuse himself since our editorial reported on all of these "ethics" details two weeks ago no one has even tried to dispute our facts the critics have shifted to a new line that because his "credibility" has been damaged by these selective smears mr wolfowitz must now resign "for the good of the bank " lets hope the white house doesnt fall for this rot and by the way its about time treasury secretary hank paulson spent some of his political capital and defended mr wolfowitz hed be in good company among africas progressive leaders see related letter "letters to the editor our tents getting full but are they friends " wsj may
