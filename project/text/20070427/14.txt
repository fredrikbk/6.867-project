brazils urban ants may predict reaction to warming trends its getting hotter in the human hive and in some ant colonies but the ants are learning to live with it in sao paulo brazil leafcutter ants are thriving in temperatures up to degrees farenheit higher than in the countryside biologist michael j angilletta jr and his colleagues at indiana state university reported last month the urban ants acclimated to heat that in recent experiments all but killed their rural relatives under any circumstances these leafcutter ants are hard to ignore they can strip a citrus tree in a day single file they parade in living ribbons of green hoisting banners of leaf and grass often times their body weight they compost the clippings to help feed subterranean nests of up to eight million ants all tended by the insect equivalent of a public works department and squads of sanitation engineers ants in the brazilian metropolis have a head start on global warming because all cities from atlanta to hong kong are heating up faster than the planet as a whole which itself is responding to rising levels of greenhouse gases that trap the suns heat every city is a man made microclimate asphalt glass and other building materials absorb and reflect the energy of sunlight sometimes in surprising ways the temperature of artificial playground turf can reach degrees these higher temperatures mean hotter days warmer nights less frost longer growing seasons altered rainfall patterns and more smog at the same time big cities trap concentrations of carbon dioxide that the planet as a whole may not record for decades last year new york city alone emitted as much carbon dioxide as all of ireland or portugal three quarters of it from buildings such islands of heat are the galapagos of global warming a natural laboratory of selective pressure and adaptation "these urban ecosystems can be used as models to understand what will happen in global climate change " said dr angilletta all told land use changes have been raising the temperature of the continental u s by about half a degree every years university of maryland researchers calculated in in california the urban sprawls of los angeles san diego and san francisco have been warming faster than the state as a whole since nasa scientists reported last month more recently the urban building boom in china has been boosting the temperature there by one tenth of a degree fahrenheit every decade according to a estimate by researchers at the georgia institute of technology "the impact of global warming is amplified just because of what we have done to where we live and work " said climate oceanographer bill patzert at nasas jet propulsion laboratory sao paulo south americas largest city generates one of the worlds most intense urban heat island effects temperatures along its ant trails can reach degrees when the heat is its most severe the ants "wobble when they are walking they will crouch down and not get up eventually they will lose complete mobility " dr angilletta said to compare the heat tolerance of urban and rural ants of the same species the researchers exposed hundreds of ants to degree temperatures inside a walk in test chamber keeping the city ants and country ants in separate petri dishes they then timed how long it took for the insects to be overcome by the heat what researchers called the "knockdown time " as the experiment wore on scientists dropped moist cotton balls into the dishes to keep the ants from merely getting dehydrated after four hours the sao paulo ants had yet to succumb in the end the urban ants took longer to drop from the heat than their country cousins the scientists sweltering inside the chamber meanwhile barely made it through four hours of observation no one knows yet whether ants survive higher heat through changes in behavior or whether urban warming has modified their genetic code since the beginning people have survived climate change by altering the world around them to engineer is human as temperatures continue to rise however humans keep cool in ways that intensify urban warming scientists led by yukitaka ohashi at okayama university of science in japan reported in january that on a warm day tokyos office air conditioners generate enough waste heat to raise the citys temperature almost degrees all told cities consume of the worlds energy and produce of its greenhouse gas emissions inadvertently we have made ourselves part of a climate change experiment on a planetary scale no one knows how quickly our species will adapt no one knows whether rising temperatures may be altering us already in unsuspected ways whats the knockdown time for a global society of city dwellers this month u n climate experts warned that as many as a quarter of the worlds plants and animals may become extinct as temperatures soar in coming decades since aesop though the smart money has been on ants
