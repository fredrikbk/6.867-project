restaurants react to investor criticism chains are bending to shareholder concerns about locations cash activist shareholders and private equity firms are reshaping the restaurant industry as it retrenches after years of overbuilding and struggles to lure cash strapped diners with applebees the latest chain to respond to a big shareholder big investors have been pressuring restaurant chains to build and own fewer locations and use their steady flows of cash to reward shareholders after bristling at some of their suggestions large restaurant companies are increasingly ceding to demands and in some cases getting out in front of investors before they put on the heat yesterday applebees international inc the nations largest sit down restaurant chain said it had received several "non binding preliminary" proposals to buy the company after its board said it began weighing a sale in february the company also said it is putting investor richard c breeden on its board along with one of his affiliates after the former securities and exchange commission chairman spent months criticizing the chain saying it owned too many of its restaurants and spent too much to build new ones on wednesday wendys international inc said independent directors on its board formed a special committee that will consider among other things selling the company or changing its capital structure that move comes as investor nelson peltz whose affiliates have three seats on wendys board has shown signs he may be moving toward orchestrating a purchase of the no hamburger chain by number of locations after mcdonalds corp and burger king holdings inc for several years private equity firms have been buying large restaurant chains including dominos pizza inc and dunkin brands inc what is new now is that vocal investors are pushing restaurants to consider a slate of more creative alternatives to selling themselves as a way of rewarding shareholders these include leveraged recapitalizations which typically involve taking on debt and making a cash distribution to shareholders shifting company owned restaurants to franchisees or other separate entities and simply pulling back on building new locations part of the reason companies are listening is that they are watching competitors make these moves dominos recently borrowed &# billion to pay shareholders a hefty special dividend mcdonalds last week said it would sell most of its restaurants in latin america to a licensee and funnel the &# million in proceeds to investors as part of a broader plan to reduce the number of restaurants it owns "ten years ago the restaurant industry was more focused on simply cooking a good meal " mr breeden said in an interview "youve seen major companies adopt various forms of those proposals and its increased returns and generally worked pretty well " now some restaurant companies are pre empting vocal investors by making changes without being asked on tuesday brinker international inc which owns chilis said it would cut capital spending by about next fiscal year and build fewer company owned restaurants as it reported weak sales and earnings for its third quarter these moves are an attempt to appease investors as many big restaurant chains in particular the mid priced sit down chains that line suburban streets are entering their second year of a slump for years restaurants drove earnings by building lots of new locations each year that grew their sales but last spring that building spree caught up with them when higher gas prices and softer home values prompted consumers to cut back suddenly there were too many restaurants that all looked the same those struggles have made chains even more attractive to private equity buyers over the past several months private equity firms have agreed to buy osi restaurant partners inc which owns the outback steakhouse chain and lone star steakhouse &amp saloon inc taking on debt includes its own set of risks but analysts say restaurant companies are more able to handle it because they have strong cash flows stables of valuable real estate and in some cases low levels of existing debt for wendys one logical buyer is mr peltzs triarc cos a franchiser and owner of arbys restaurants last week triarc said it was selling its controlling stake in investment adviser deerfield &amp co turning triarc into a restaurant company "we believe that arbys will be able to significantly increase value through both organic growth and the acquisition of other restaurant companies " mr peltz said mr peltz is more likely to acquire wendys through triarc where he is chief executive than via trian fund management lp the firm that owns a big stake in wendys of its shares and where he is a principal his affiliates on the wendys board arent part of the newly formed strategic review committee according to people close to the company which could help mitigate any conflict of interest of having the board recommend a wendys sale a spokeswoman for mr peltz didnt return a call seeking comment john glass an analyst at cibc world markets said that a leveraged recapitalization may be more feasible for wendys in one scenario he estimates that wendys could borrow &# billion refinance its current &# million in debt and have the remainder plus &# million of the cash on its balance sheet to pay a dividend of roughly &# a share at applebees mr breeden also joined the committee that is considering a sale or other strategic options for the chain he didnt elaborate yesterday on what he is going to recommend but he has said in the past that he doesnt think applebees should sell itself when the chain is "at the bottom " mr breeden complimented the board and management and said the chain is a fundamentally strong company for many restaurant companies these complex financial moves arent something their investors are used to hearing about wendys held a folksy annual meeting yesterday that featured a presentation about the adoption charity established by wendys founder dave thomas company executives tried to reassure shareholders about the drastic moves on the table "dave thomas always said that profits not a dirty word " ceo kerrii anderson told the audience
