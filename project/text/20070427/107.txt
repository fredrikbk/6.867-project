weekend journal taste false advertising literature is not often kind to business whaling was fatal for captain ahab "the jungle" was an argument for socialism as well as vegetarianism and the glove business in philip roths "american pastoral " fits the hero like a straitjacket but no business has taken as many cultural lumps as the ad industry advertising receives its most recent thumping in "then we came to the end " a tour de force by a youthful former adman named joshua ferris who chronicles the last harrowing and hilarious days of a fictional chicago ad agency at the end of the dot com boom as fresh as the novel feels its roots spring from the familiar cultural soil of madison avenue a favorite dante esque setting of postwar novelists and filmmakers james b twitchell a professor of english and advertising at the university of florida says that the use of the adman as a scapegoat in popular culture started with "the hucksters " a novel by frederic wakeman mr twitchell describes it as "the cauterizing text for this view of advertising as evil and manipulative " in it a veteran returns to his old job in advertising and takes up with a married woman he ultimately is revolted by the industry into which he has fallen and leaves it behind but advertising remains a cesspool the novels success prompted a wave of similar fiction showing advertising as predatory and slimy such harsh attitudes were intensified by critics like vance packard and john kenneth galbraith who suggested that the industry had the power to control our desires as mr ferriss first person plural narrator puts it "we were the hired guns of the human soul we pulled the strings on the people across the land and by god they got to their feet and they danced for us " it was the movies that really drove home the image of the adman as the ultimate manipulator advertising figures usually negatively in " angry men" "marriage on the rocks" "the arrangement" "madison avenue" "the wheeler dealers" "will success spoil rock hunter " and "days of wine and roses" hollywood produced a sanitized version of "the hucksters" starring clark gable and deborah kerr but it still had a sting sidney greenstreet is the villainous soap tycoon who illustrates an admiring if cynical view of advertising by spitting on the conference table "ugly word spit " he says "but you know youll always remember what i just did " its not surprising that audiences were open to these negative portrayals of advertising it is after all a line of work whose ephemeral output is based on the mysteries of brand allegiance consumer psychology and marketing voodoo but the adman holds the potential for a good story as well like the public relations men in "sweet smell of success" and "the man in the gray flannel suit " the adman trades in superficiality and may feel deep down less than happy that he does he offers a vehicle for observing not just the corruptions of business but also those of the soul hired to fool everyone else he just cant fool himself of course there is no part of american culture that cannot redeem itself sooner or later shifts in taste and the rise of new cultural icons the stock in trade of advertising itself gradually helped to give the adman a vaguely heroic cast advertising started to seem respectable and even in a tidy white collar way cool in the movies madison avenue offered stars a chance to be seen doing glamorous big city work without coming off unmanly cary grant played a new york adman in two of his best films "north by northwest" and "mr blandings builds his dream house" advertising matured during the s and so did the cultural attitudes about it perhaps it started with the volkswagen ads of doyle dane bernbach which caused an instant sensation for their candor brevity and wit in "the mirror makers " his fine history of american advertising stephen fox notes that around this time madison avenue also began to grow more diverse with jews and italians bringing a fresh perspective to what had long been the preserve of white protestant men mr ferriss characters in "then we came to the end " include a woman boss a gay second in command a black novelist and various jews italian and korean americans and what about the manipulative image that had once given the adman a hollow soul and a sinister edge it got lost in the sheer volume of late th century marketing and in the publics amused awareness of how it all worked by the s a generation of americans had grown up with commercial drenched tv which didnt seem threatening to them at all ad agencies had long since relinquished direct control of programming the pre eminence of account executives began to wane as the "creatives" gained ascendancy the suits as exemplified by darrin the hapless adman in the tv show "bewitched " came to be seen not as deceptive but as harmless and even ridiculous "he was a doofus " mr twitchell says by contrast the hip ad guys of the s television drama "thirtysomething" were warm imaginative and in touch with their inner junior high school student they sat brainstorming in offices filled with toys even someone as nice as mike doonesbury went into advertising but this was no longer your fathers ad industry "during the s " mr fox reports "three major technological refinements cable tv videocassette recorders and remote controls became routine accessories in most upscale america homes " americans could no longer be counted on to sit still for cheesy commercials advertising had to work harder to hold the fugitive attention of viewers advertising in other words had to become fun or at least it had to look fun if anything the ad business today is even more emblematic of the postindustrial work life most of us lead nowadays than it was in the s technology may be better offices more hip and audiences more savvy but ultimately mr ferris reports the advertising business can be just as soul draining manufacturing in this country occupies an ever smaller proportion of the work force leaving the impression that hardly anyone makes anything concrete here anymore instead we all just labor to sell one another stuff made elsewhere spending our work lives in a labyrinthine network of cubicles that throb with grievance and intrigue the epic of our labors if it is ever written would begin "call me dilbert " mr akst writes often about consumerism and literature
