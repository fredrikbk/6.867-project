weekend journal the drivers seat mini cooper s a model upgrade after the new mini cooper s was dropped off at my house i called a friend who had recently sold his mini our conversation went something like this "ive got the new mini this weekend " i said "theres a new mini " he replied excitedly "yes " i explained "its a completely different car you should check it out " "really " said the friend "whats it like " "just like the old one " i answered "you mean the old mini the s mini " "no the new one it looks just like your old car " "so the new new mini still looks like my old new mini " "yes " "then whats the point " good question the new mini was an instant hit when it made its debut in the u s in a favorite of fashionable hipsters and driving enthusiasts alike given that corporate parent bmw has seen strong mini sales every year since it launched the car a good case could have been made for letting the mini continue to motor after all the original mini zipped on mostly unchanged from through before bmw completely reinvented the diminutive british car and the brand alas government regulations meant the new mini wouldnt be allowed to stay in production for more years since at least part of the car needed to be reworked to meet impending european pedestrian crash standards the germans thoroughly attacked the rest as well the result is an impressive upgrade of nearly every aspect of the vehicle without harming its substantial charisma consider the top of the line mini cooper s isnt only faster and more powerful than the car it replaces but also weighs less and gets better gas mileage if only other car makers would follow the last half of that formula for improvement this is all made possible largely thanks to a new four cylinder engine its liters of displacement are now abetted by a turbocharger rather than the old models supercharger that helps turn out horsepower and much more importantly pound feet of torque under full throttle acceleration the turbo will even boost torque output to lb ft for a few seconds thats enough to pull the front wheel drive cooper s to miles per hour in seconds transforming the mini from a sporty little car into a little sports car strangely enough theres reason to bemoan this upgrade as the new cars surfeit of power actually makes it less fun to drive in some circumstances where the old cooper s allowed for plenty of exuberance behind the wheel while remaining reasonably within the boundaries of whats prudent not to mention legal the new car so effortlessly blows past those limits that you wind up caught in the supercar conundrum of being all revved up with no place to go still with a starting price of &# the cooper s rates as a performance bargain sports cars must do more than accelerate quickly they also must brake turn and handle all of which the cooper s still does well enough testing by road &amp track shows the new model stops from mph in feet one foot longer than the old cooper s did when the magazine tested it in the old model also did better in carving through a slalom course achieving a speed of mph against mph for the version one reason for the lower slalom performance the suspension on the cooper s is no longer race car stiff seat of the pants evaluation says the combination of a more comfortable ride and a inch increase in the vehicles length mean its handling isnt quite as sharp when pushed to the limits but honestly unless youre strapped into a five point harness and wearing a helmet youll not miss the little bit of handling edge that was left on the table to make the new cooper s less brutal for everyday use you will however grieve for the wonderful noise of the supercharged minis muffler yes that raspy burble of the fuel rich fumes detonating after you abruptly let off the gas is gone replaced by an exhaust note twice smothered and the efficient hum of the turbocharger the difference is like switching from ac dc to enya literally doing that is now even more difficult in the mini thanks to a stereo system thats both dumb and dumber first someone at bmw thought it would be neat to integrate the audio controls into the minis speedometer which sits atop the center console bad idea then someone dreamed up an illogical arrangement of buttons to resemble the winged mini logo even worse if there was one area of the old mini in which bmw had room for improvement it was this center console if there is one area in which bmw has made the new mini worse this is it at least now the car has legitimate cupholders just as critically it still looks like the mini weve all grown so fond of over the past five years if bmw didnt succeed in making the car perfect this time around it has unquestionably made it better is there any other point to a redesign
