delicate balance colleges culture of privacy often overshadows safety laws allow disclosure of troubling behavior but many schools resist fearful of litigation supportive of students independence and often citing privacy laws colleges for years have zealously guarded the confidentiality of their students but the massacre at virginia tech last week is raising questions about what many view as an excessive culture of privacy on u s campuses colleges often hesitate to contact outside authorities about mentally unstable students preferring to take care of disciplinary issues quietly on their own students are legally considered adults at age and college administrators say federal and state privacy laws generally prohibit them from sharing details about a students health or academic record with parents or outside authorities the privacy laws include explicit permission to intervene in case of danger but some say colleges are too cautious about using that exception one of the largest college risk management and insurance companies united educators which insures educational institutions in the u s believes that school administrators too often err on the side of privacy "i think theres been a hesitancy to share information in deference to student privacy probably more than the law requires " says karen ann broe senior risk analyst at the company she advises client schools that they may be freer to intercede than they think "can not going to class be a health or safety emergency " she says "it depends on the circumstances " nancy tribbensee general counsel for arizonas university system holds training sessions on the issue for arizonas campus attorneys and registrars office staffs to make sure they understand their options "the law isnt black and white " she says and "too narrow or restricted an interpretation" can lead to a failure to make perfectly legal disclosures often she says the college administrators making decisions havent read the laws that apply at virginia tech cho seung huis strange behavior set off enough alarm bells in that he was declared at "imminent risk" of causing harm and ordered by a judge to seek counseling faculty members have told reporters they complained about mr chos behavior to school authorities but didnt know about other complaints about him from students some families have complained that students exhibiting suicidal tendencies dont even attract that level of intervention in ferrum college in ferrum va agreed to pay an undisclosed sum and admitted some shared responsibility to settle a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of a student who hanged himself in his dorm room in the lawsuit alleged the school knew that the student michael frentzel had written a note indicating he was going to harm himself and had self inflicted bruises the school said allegations in the suit were incorrect but declined to comment further this week in year old paul kraut jumped off a manhattan balcony after his freshman year at babson college in wellesley mass his mother pam kraut had asked the school early in the year to have a counselor speak to him because his parents marriage was breaking up and he had begun behaving erratically and driving recklessly ms kraut says she was told that privacy laws prevented the school from reaching out to students in distress and from informing parents about their behavior and that they couldnt send a counselor to him her son would need to seek counseling on his own she says she learned only later that he stopped attending some classes and says after his death she overheard friends discussing how he had tried to kill himself once at school and had been taken to the hospital "no one could ever tell me anything " says ms kraut years old an interior designer in white plains n y "i was always in the dark " his father robert kraut says "the question is what constitutes privacy versus the well being of the child " babson college officials say they have no record that mr kraut tried to kill himself before leaving school and was taken to a hospital they say that the school does not notify parents if their child is missing classes but instead has an academic adviser reach out to the student "for parents the laws are very stringent " tim mann the colleges then dean of student affairs said late last year "these are young adults " a spokesman for babson declined to comment further this week in fact the laws have big loopholes that let colleges alert parents and authorities the family educational rights and privacy act or ferpa adopted in protects the educational records of students which often include grades transcripts and reports of disciplinary action and campus violations but it allows schools to break confidentiality and notify parents or authorities in the case of a "health or safety emergency " or notify parents if there is a drug or alcohol violation and the student is under years old they can also choose to share any information with parents who claim students as dependents on their tax returns which is common and if a potential danger stems from behavior on campus thats not part of academic records schools dont have to apply the privacy law at all state laws protect the privacy of medical records including mental health counseling records but those laws allow mental health professionals to share information with police or other authorities or even call for forced hospitalization if there is a risk of imminent harm in the case of virginia techs mr cho a judge decided more than a year before the shootings that the "imminent risk" threshold for intervention was reached but an outside mental health facility that evaluated mr cho recommended outpatient counseling rather than hospitalization its unclear what the school did to monitor his mental health after that but school officials told reporters they were not responsible for doing so the school did not respond to requests for comment for this story the killings by mr cho are prompting some universities to re examine how they balance respect for students privacy against campus safety at the university of maryland college park administrator gary pavela has been busy drafting a memo to advise faculty members on what to do if they are worried that a student may be troubled over the past week he says many administrators have discussed creating new mental health response teams faculty members housing and security staff counselors and deans to monitor problem students about half the colleges in the country already have such groups which typically meet every week so each member can share details about any students or events on campus he or she is worried about ferpa allows such discussions among school officials with a legitimate educational interest and counselors dont share confidential information in the sessions the groups typically keep lists of problem students that get updated each week some members of congress want to make the ferpa exceptions clearer to encourage college officials to take advantage this week republican rep tim murphy of pennsylvania who is a psychologist and co chair of the congressional mental health caucus proposed spelling out that the "health and safety" exception includes concerns of suicide homicide or threats of physical violence his amendment also would absolve college officials of liability if they contact parents to discuss concerns about a dependent student as long as they consulted first with a licensed mental health professional "universities can find parents when it comes time to pay the tuition or co sign a loan " mr murphy says "lets get them involved when their child is in danger " colleges say they are seeing an increasing number of students with psychiatric diagnoses such as attention deficit and eating disorders addiction bipolar disorder and severe depression the numbers may be going up partly because the stigma attached to mental illness is fading and partly because new medications are allowing students to function better student outpatient mental health claims rose between and according to the chickering group a college health insurance provider which also says antidepressants are now among the most prescribed drugs on college campuses more than of college counseling center directors reported an increase in the number of students they saw who were diagnosed with severe psychological problems according to a survey conducted by the american college counseling association and the university of pittsburgh about of counseling center clients had severe psychological problems including with disorders so serious they could not remain in school the survey said one big obstacle for colleges in keeping track of troubled students many dont have psychologists or psychiatrists on staff often they have therapists with masters degrees some are primarily guidance counselors without advanced training in suicide or other extreme behavior more accustomed to discussing grades or roommates problems staffers dont always know when it is legal or even advisable to break students confidentiality says richard kadison chief of mental health services at harvard university some small schools dont even have counseling centers on campus the average ratio of counseling staff members to students on u s campuses is about one for every according to a soon to be published survey conducted by the association for university and college counseling center directors privacy at colleges and universities wasnt always held in such high regard for centuries schools were bound by the legal doctrine of in loco parentis which required them essentially to take on the responsibilities of parents but starting in the s spurred on by the free speech and civil rights movements a series of court decisions began to award college students more legal rights michael crabtree a psychologist and professor of psychology at washington &amp jefferson college in washington pa says that years ago he freely talked to parents about their childrens class work now "all you can do is have a cup of coffee you cant talk about anything with substance " he says the school like many says it asks students to sign a waiver to allow their parents to have access to their educational records and give professors and campus officials permission to contact their parents if they see a need gerald rosss year old son james shot himself in may just before the end of his senior year at the state university of new york at buffalo after that mr ross began writing members of congress suggesting that colleges should have a system to notify parents if they notice that something is wrong "a lot may not be a violation of the privacy law " says mr ross a lawyer who lives in manhattan because he wasnt allowed to see his sons grades mr ross says he did not know that james had dropped courses taken one class twice without passing it and wasnt likely to graduate "the counseling department already had a checklist of possible signs of suicide risk " he says "not going to class is one of them " the schools web site lists poor school performance as a risk factor for suicide but a spokesman for suny buffalo says there can be other reasons for students missing classes he says administrators call parents or authorities quickly if they feel a student is a threat to himself or others as ferpas health and safety exception allows but that no one at the university saw james display any warning signs in the years since ferpa was adopted many colleges and universities have emphasized helping students grow into independent adults and helping parents accept this development "i dont think students are given enough credit for knowing what is best for them and being trusted as adults " says jessica barker a psychology student at the university of minnesota in minneapolis st paul who has battled an eating disorder many college counselors believe that breaching one students privacy even if warranted will scare other students away from seeking help "these kids are over and its important when they go to the counseling center that they know that what they say is confidential " says joanna locke a program director at the jed foundation a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide and promote mental health among college students "no student would go to the counseling center otherwise " college officials also note it can often be hard to tell what constitutes an emergency situation most troubled students who are withdrawn depressed or angry do not end up hurting themselves or others colleges and universities fear being sued over not protecting students privacy well enough but they also have been sued for being too protective at george washington university in washington d c and hunter college in new york students have won settlements over being required to leave dorms or campuses after exhibiting suicidal behavior on the other hand in the parents of elizabeth shin sued the massachusetts institute of technology for millions of dollars for failing to notify them of the emotional deterioration of their daughter a sophomore whose death in a dorm room fire was ruled a suicide by a medical examiner the case was settled out of court last year for an undisclosed sum ann h franke an attorney and president of wise results a consulting firm in washington d c says she advises schools to be prepared that they can face either kind of legal action "sometimes you have to pick your lawsuit " she says she tells college officials if theyre forced to choose try to head off violence and risk a suit over privacy rather than one over wrongful death or injury when eva turnipseed went to parent orientation with her daughter hilliary at american university in washington d c three years ago officials outlined the schools privacy policy she says they told her she wouldnt be able to get her daughters grades find out if she was going to class or even if she was in trouble unless her daughter gave permission "they made it clear we could not call or raise a concern about a student " says ms turnipseed who lives in berkeley calif still when hilliary called her from school last september and sobbing said she thought she would be better off dead ms turnipseed immediately called the schools counseling center to see why they hadnt been returning her daughters calls the doctor who spoke with ms turnipseed told her she couldnt discuss her daughter but she agreed to wait by the phone so the young woman could call wanda collins director of americans counseling center said counselors who have concerns about students encourage them to talk to their parents hilliary a year old junior says she was relieved her mom intervened she began seeing a therapist at school and a psychiatrist who prescribed an antidepressant now she says she feels much better "i know im technically an adult " she says "but i wouldnt call myself a full adult yet " file sharing federal law bars college officials from sharing information about students if the information is in an educational record but there are important exceptions those include when a student has a health or safety emergency commits a drug or alcohol violation and is under is claimed by parents as a dependent on tax returns
