weekend journal taste houses of worship a jewish artist haunted by the face of jesus last month i gave a talk on marc chagall in seattle a large part of what i had to say was devoted to the artists ambivalence about his jewishness and his obsession with the image of jesus afterward a few members of the audience approached me the topic of chagall usually elicits a strong jewish response reproductions of his works are ubiquitous in jewish homes images that seem to evoke shtetl life but these people were members of an unusual local christian congregation who referred to jesus as yeshua and who blew the shofar whenever a new family joined their church they gave me an illustration that merged jewish and christian iconography an explanation on the back presented some surprising symbology the torah scrolls were said to represent jesus chagall with his own mixing and merging clearly held a special interest for the group as indeed they might have had for him after all the emblematic jewish painter of the th century had insisted that the museum built to house his paintings in nice france be called the national museum of the marc chagall biblical message not exactly an art gallery or a house of worship but a place committed to a universalist and utopian religious philosophy and aesthetic and one designed to transcend the borders of any particular religion in the autumn of marc chagall took a short trip from his hometown of vitebsk in belorussia to zaolshe the summer seat of the lubavitcher rebbe shalom dov ber schneerson chagall then a year old painter with a burgeoning reputation reports in his memoir "my life" that he had been haunted "for a long time" by "the pale face" of jesus and he wanted some guidance although he had grown up in a hasidic milieu chagall had abandoned religious observance at the age of and by the time that he met schneerson he was thoroughly secularized with a resume that included four years in paris on the front lines of the revolutionary art wars chagalls choice of instructor an orthodox rabbi might seem surprising after all chagall himself was irreligious although he clearly felt linked umbilically to the hebrew bible and yiddish culture but these were elastic times in the worlds of art science and religion twelve years earlier in a crisis of depression and anxiety schneerson himself had consulted with freud according to chagalls account of their meeting it wasnt a profound conversation he didnt even reveal the matter that was troubling him his feeling of being haunted by the "pale face" of jesus instead he asked the rabbi a question to which he already knew the answer should he stay in vitebsk or move to petrograd chagall had already been drafted into the army and ordered to petrograd as payback for wasting the rabbis time he got a noncommittal answer it is more than likely given jesus levantine place of origin that he did not have a "pale" face and that the image chagall had in mind was drawn from the russian orthodox icons that he had seen as a child in and around his native vitebsk but what exactly was haunting him throughout his life even when he briefly held a position as soviet commissar for art in vitebsk after the revolution chagall was drawn to what we might call a "pre christian" jesus a jewish jesus who would not have understood himself as in any way existing beyond the boundaries of the normative judaism of his time in his letters and interviews chagall lamented the schism that detached jesus from the jewish family and he was deeply attached to "christ as a poet and a prophetic figure " he painted crucifixion scenes throughout his long life a uniform interpretation of these works however remains unattainable after kristallnacht nov the night on which jewish businesses throughout germany were looted synagogues burned and jews attacked chagall who was living in france produced his own "guernica" with a painting titled "white crucifixion" it shows the martyred jesus wearing a prayer shawl around his waist representing jewish suffering under nazi persecution as news of the destruction of the jews reached the u s where chagall had fled in he executed a dozen more crucifixion scenes and yet chagalls oeuvre features multiple jesus figures there is jesus portrayed as a version of chagall himself with "marc ch" where we might expect to find "inri " the latin initials that so often appear above jesus head on crucifixion scenes referring to pilates mocking reference to jesus as "king of the jews" the most striking example is "descent from the cross" there is jesus without any visible jewish accouterments as we might expect to find him in conservative christian representations finally there is jesus on the cross serving formal imperatives a cross chagall once claimed is from a compositional point of view an irresistible way to divide up a canvas chagalls relationship to the figure of jesus christ is ultimately mysterious and unclassifiable it is the jesus of a jewish child who grew up in an environment of russian orthodox churches of a jewish painter both attuned to and rebelling against a year tradition of christian iconography in art of a jew in love with the stories of the hebrew bible and yet well versed in the parables of the new testament drawn to the poetry of that book and excited by its gaunt philosophy of a jew who wanted to argue christ with the lubavitcher rebbe but who soon after as a soviet revolutionary decried religion of a pagan who illustrated the hebrew bible of a jew in mourning via images of jesus for nazi murder and the destruction of the world he had grown up in all this takes us a long way from "fiddler on the roof " mr wilson is the author of "marc chagall" schocken nextbook
