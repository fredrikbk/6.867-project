weekend journal review film telling details quiet insights deepen daley tale of accused youth shrink is finely acted jindabyne dulls carver quiet carries the day and haunts the nights in "stephanie daley " no histrionics here and no action sequences unless you count a collision between a car and a deer with a calmness that bespeaks confidence this small spellbinding second feature by hilary brougher brings together two women trapped in separate states of denial and distress who manage to end each others entrapment amber tamblyn plays the title role a year old high school student accused of killing her newborn baby tilda swinton is a forensic psychologist lydie crane whos been hired by the prosecution to evaluate stephanies competence to stand trial when the sessions with stephanie begin lydie is halfway through her own pregnancy a parallel thats immediately noted by the young woman "is that why they hired you " she asks the answer is no but another question is whether the parallel seems too convenient for artistic comfort again the answer is no and not because the similarities are handled subtly or allusively but because theyre handled forthrightly this is a study in parallel lives at the same time its a richly specific and deeply affecting story of two very different women at different stages of life struggling to come to terms with who they are what they have or havent done and how much responsibility they should take for it the running time of "stephanie daley" is a mere minutes thats two minutes longer than the filmmakers debut feature "the sticky fingers of time " within it though ms brougher creates a remarkably intimate portrait of vivid personalities solitary souls ambiguous relationships troubled marriages and small town america flashbacks to a teenage party a high school ski trip a biology class or stephanie playing the flute in marching band feel like life caught on the fly at first the script threatens to stretch credulity with a competency hearing that evolves into something close to therapy why would a bright girl like steph confide in a shrink whos been hired by people who want to put her in prison but steph and lydie are drawn together by emotional logic each senses that the other has something she needs to get whole in order to move on "stephanie daley" is beautifully made the cinematography by david rush morrison is both sharp eyed and self effacing with particular emphasis on shooting faces in what seems to be natural light david mansfields music turns minimalist tones reminiscent of lou harrison into tactful but forceful punctuation naturalism and tact are equally the hallmarks of a supporting cast that includes timothy hutton melissa leo dennis ohare and jim gaffigan ultimately though ms brougher has hitched her wagon to two stars and they complement each other perfectly ms swinton who has given so many remarkable performances starting with "orlando" in throttles back in this one without ever powering down lydie can speak volumes with an urgent phrase or a questioning glance and ms tamblyn best known until now for her work on the tv series "joan of arcadia " is simply breathtaking and heartbreaking as a girl child estranged from her pregnant self in repose stephanies face is that of a madonna in extremis she summons up visions of munchs "the scream " in between which is to say most of the time steph is lost while lydie is far from found jindabyne jindabyne" started with a bad idea and the finished film doesnt do well by it despite the presence of laura linney gabriel byrne and several excellent australian actors the idea was to take a short story by raymond carver "so much water so close to home " transplant it to a remote corner of contemporary australia then retell it within the context of that nations concern with its racist past the result is a discomfiting mixture of ghost story murder mystery marital drama and borderline polemic with an american woman played by ms linney urging racial reconciliation on the australians the woman claire is a classic stranger in a strange land stuck in a shaky marriage to stewart an irishman played by mr byrne and surrounded by amiable rubes the story starts in earnest when stewart and three male friends go off fishing for the weekend come upon a young womans body floating in the stream and essentially ignore it until their weekend runs its undisturbed course how could they be so insensitive two reasons are advanced because they are men and because the young woman was black thats not to make light of the ethical issues or of the whole production in which the earnestness is mitigated by big sky scenery the director was ray lawrence who did a first rate film called "lantana" six years ago "jindabyne " like the carver story seeks to get at the differences between men and women while stewart and his obtuse buddies come to be haunted by their indifference claire is horrified by it from the moment word gets out and its not just racial reconciliation that shes concerned with claire is a stickler for personal responsibility she wants her man and the other men to own up to what theyve done or failed to do she wants them to see that irrespective of color theyre part of a community unassailable sentiments all but insufficient to sustain two slow hours dvd tip the mother that tilda swinton plays in "the deep end" moves heaven earth and everything in between to protect her teenage son this hurtling drama is deeper than it first seems to be scott mcgehee and david siegel directed from mr mcgehees adaptation of a novel by elisabeth sanxay holding
