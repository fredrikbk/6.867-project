the afternoon report gross domestic puzzle online edition the u s economy couldnt overcome the continued cave in of the housing sector in the first quarter but persistent inflation means that policy makers wont soon be pulling back the throttle on interest rates gross domestic product the broadest measure of economic output expanded at a annual rate during the period dragged down by the housing markets travails the reading marked the slowest rate of expansion in four years and trailed the growth seen during last years fourth quarter by a broad margin a nosedive in residential fixed investment snatched away a full percentage point of growth economists also said the trade deficit shaved half a point from the expansion as exports dropped by and imports increased and that a meager showing from government spending also threw a hurdle in the economys path businesses also built up stockpiles at a slower than expected pace had the inexhaustible consumer not stepped up to the plate the picture might have looked a whole lot worse consumer spending which accounts for better than two thirds of all economic activity increased by a bit behind the fourth quarters but still a respectable pace of shopping business spending increased by in a touch of optimism some observers said that the first quarter may turn out to be a low point for this year rbs greenwich capitals chief economist stephen stanley pointed to strong consumer spending a pickup in investment on equipment and software by business and a decline in housing that was actually somewhat better than what had happened in the fourth quarter then residential fixed investment dropped by the "most important sectors of the economy all posted results better than we had forecast " he wrote and "if the data stand as they are second quarter gdp should do better not worse " but others were less hopeful economist joel l naroff said the drag from housing will fade but he doesnt think that consumer spending is going to keep chugging at its current pace he also thinks businesses will remain cautious in their spending "put that together and it is very likely we will see additional subpar growth rates through the summer " he wrote in a note to clients the most vexing part of the report may be the news that as growth was slowing down prices were picking up speed the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose by after decreasing in the fourth quarter the pce price gauge excluding food and energy which is keenly watched by the federal reserve grew after increasing by in the fourth quarter though that seemed to raise the dreaded specter of stagflation or higher prices at a time of stumbling growth mr stanley said some technical factors like pay raises for government workers played a role still the evidence that inflation is hovering in a range that is stronger than the feds reported "comfort zone" of to suggests that policy makers will be reluctant to reduce interest rates even if the economy shows further signs of slowing down adding to inflation worries was an jump in wages and salaries during the first quarter that report reflects a tight job market "and is pointing to
