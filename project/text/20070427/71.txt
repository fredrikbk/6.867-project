politics &amp economics tiptoeing around frances economic ills presidential rivals wary of discussing painful remedies whoever wins frances presidential election may the country will get a new generation of political leaders who speak more frankly about domestic economic malaise than their patrician predecessors but will that talk translate to change center right candidate nicolas sarkozy promises a "rupture" with the past two decades of political promises center left rival segolene royal has challenged many of her socialist partys taboos even praising britains tony blair and is viewed by many in her party as a traitor to socialism yet both candidates have been wary of discussing the painful medicine many economists argue france needs to regain competitiveness mr sarkozy for instance has warned the french they have to work more hours if they want to earn more but he also has made a long list of promises to increase social welfare in terms of economic expansion employment and business dynamism france is falling behind other european countries most of which have better adapted to rising competition from low cost countries in asia and europes east the french economy expanded by last year well behind the growth of the nation euro zone of which france is the second largest member behind germany while europes economy as a whole is accelerating frances isnt the long stagnant economy of germany has overtaken frances in terms of expansion outside the euro zone the united kingdom has left france behind in terms of gross domestic product french unemployment at is among the highest in the european union lower than only polands and slovakias economists business leaders and many policy makers in france agree that the worlds fifth largest economy needs a smaller more efficient state machinery and more flexible markets for labor goods and services but french voters antipathy to "liberal" economics which in europe unlike in the u s means free market ideology has prompted both presidential candidates in the runoff election to be cautious lest they seem too pro business only of the french think a free market economy is the best system while disagree easily the highest level of skepticism about markets in any major economy according to a study by the university of maryland many voters think the desire of businesses to profit is the cause of not the cure for unemployment "in a country where the president jacques chirac has said that liberalism like communism is a perversion of human thinking you cant win an election with a free market platform " said jean michel fourgous a lawmaker affiliated with mr sarkozys center right ump party although some commentators say france has taken over from germany the title of "sick man of europe " the country is far from a basket case its yearly expansion rate is unspectacular but steady and many of its biggest companies are globally successful frances robust consumer spending has been one of europes main sources of expansion in recent years when other economies in the region were struggling yet french multinationals such as tire maker michelin and beauty products group loreal do the bulk of their business outside france consumer spending is luring imports while domestic industries are stagnant frances share of european and world export markets has fallen steadily and its medium and small companies are seeing profits eroded by rising labor costs private sector hiring and investment are expanding too slowly to keep up with immigration and more than half the population lives off the state through jobs or benefits like elsewhere in europe job protection rules designed to prevent layoffs also deter new hiring in france it is easier in theory to dismiss a worker than in some other parts of europe but workers can challenge the decision in court leading to lengthy legal battles with unpredictable settlements frances highest court once ordered construction materials maker saint gobain to reinstate workers it had laid off two years earlier even though it had shut the plant where they worked "its so complex to cut jobs in france youd better have good lawyers and experts to walk you through the procedure " says jean francois duthel co chief executive of duthel maintenance moules a small maker of molds for the plastics industry based in eastern france like many french businesspeople mr duthel says frances hour working week also remains a burden despite limited measures that allow for overtime "in our trade workers used to make a lot of money through extra hours with the hour workweek they have lost their drive to work " he says economists say the challenges faced by frances business sector have led to the biggest problem voters expect the next president to resolve a lack of job opportunities especially for young people ethnic minorities and those with lower skills and qualifications youth unemployment is around resentment at social exclusion festers among minorities and many young educated people are leaving the country to pursue careers but whether either presidential candidate has a solution is unclear mr sarkozy who emerged from sundays first round election with the largest number of votes has made jobs the opportunity of getting them and the need to work hard to make money a major part of his campaign he has criticized the hour workweek and said that hours worked on top of the weekly quota would be paid with a bonus he also has proposed that companies pay no additional social charges and workers pay no income tax on those extra hours yet mr sarkozys rhetoric has lurched between free market liberalism and gaullist economic nationalism state protection of key industries that has left many puzzled ms royal has stayed vague about where she stands on practices such as the hour workweek both candidates have talked at length about increasing consumers spending power mainly through tax perks and easier credit but economists say this approach doesnt address the real problem of a declining business sector "french consumption has been strong for quite a while thats the one bit of the french economy that works well " says jean philippe cotis chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development in paris restoring french businesses to strength would require the sort of labor concessions that german companies have wrung from unions in recent years including mass layoffs and longer working hours for no extra pay frances stricter laws make such labor changes harder and neither candidate has proposed anything close to a rethink of those laws mr sarkozy however has proposed to introduce a new single work contract that would provide more generous benefits as workers gain seniority economists say both mr sarkozy and ms royal could throw frances public finances further off balance because their platforms are based on additional welfare spending and in the case of the conservative candidate tax cuts that is a dangerous path in a country that last recorded a budget surplus in analysts warn french budget minister jean francois cope who makes no secret of his ambition to become finance minister if mr sarkozy wins the election said in an interview that additional spending would be offset by deep cuts in administration costs mr cope said mr sarkozys plan is to not replace about half of the to civil servants who retire every year "if someone is sitting behind a punch machine im not going to replace him once the punch machine is gone " mr cope said
