man in a stiff collared shirt but his papers at the brown archives suggest he was a prankster theres mention of things tossed out of windows as a member of the class of he played guard on the only brown football team ever to reach the rose bowl was refreshment chairman for the last senior class party before prohibition and graduated with a reputation as an average student he earned a law degree from harvard joined a providence r i law firm never married and lived the rest of his life with his aunt in her victorian mansion across george street from the brown campus when mr lanpher died in he left shares of national lead co stock to brown with the suggestion that the school use them if it wished to fund a scholarship for needy members of his fraternity in an age of billion dollar philanthropists the lanpher scholarship barely registers in the &# billion brown endowment and represents only loose change in the universitys &# million financial aid budget this year it provided &# in aid to one brown student about one fifth the &# cost of tuition room and board and other fees thousands of donors make similar gifts every year moved by memories of their own college struggles or the satisfaction that they have money to give nationwide individuals gave &# billion to colleges in including about &# billion to endowed scholarships says the new york based council for aid to education typically those gifts arent much larger than mr lanphers the average alumni gift was &# and the average gift in stock or other securities was &# individual giving "is the bedrock" of financial aid says matthew hamil vice president of the national association of college and university business officers mr lanpher was my husbands uncle in in a new outreach program to past donors brown sent us an update on that years lanpher fund recipient that was the first wed heard of the scholarship in years and i set out to find other recipients to see what became of their lives in years the gift has helped students through school including scientists teachers lawyers a professor of psychiatric nursing in scotland a texas cattle rancher and a maryland based software engineer whos designing a missile defense system for u s navy landing craft this year the money went to an aspiring childrens book author for most of the recipients the scholarship wasnt big enough to be pivotal they would have gone to college anyway others though can imagine an alternate history steven skov holt who grew up outside of hartford conn didnt have enough money for college when he graduated from high school after two years working as a bus boy attending architecture classes and nursing an interest in industrial design he applied to brown and was offered aid in his first term in he was diagnosed with kidney failure he received a transplant but he developed cataracts from his medications and didnt return to school for two years he earned a degree in cognitive science in and a design career followed the lanpher fund provided about &# in his senior year out of total fees of &# financial aid "meant being at brown and brown opened up the world to me " he says his troubled health has caused him to focus on the "blessed side of things " he says and he regularly contributes to browns annual fund in a way he adds the scholarship is like his donated kidney "i never found out much about the donor but it let me go on " since mr lanpher died both brown and his fraternity alpha delta phi have gone co ed other aspects of college have changed too nationwide full time college enrollment is million this year up from million students in with most of the increase among working class immigrant and minority students to meet soaring college prices students borrowed &# billion in the academic year more than twice what they borrowed a decade ago public university students who receive aid typically graduate with about &# in debt for private school students the figure is &# nonrepayable grants are also up but account for far less than loans last academic year colleges gave out &# billion of their own money in scholarships and the federal government gave another &# billion in grants to million students says the college board this year brown gave need based scholarships to of its undergraduates almost half that money came from named scholarship funds including one that began with a &# million gift in and several others that date to the th century and provide just a few hundred dollars a year brown now requires a minimum &# to endow a scholarship because of the cost of administering it still the university says it has received money for three more named funds since november when mr lanpher died at age his will distributed most of his estate among his friends and family his calling card tray has passed down to me and my husband has his silver handled hair brushes to brown he left some of his shares of national lead co which made lead based products including solder and paint and has since been reorganized as nl industries inc his requirements were fairly loose that the recipient be a junior or senior and preferably a member of alpha delta phi brown sold the national lead shares and put the proceeds into its endowment as universities typically do including a few thousand dollars from mourners in lieu of funeral flowers the gift came to &# the money "bought" shares in the endowment a bookkeeping arrangement that allows a university to manage its endowment as a single fund yet still keep track of individual gifts that may have specific purposes or restrictions as the brown endowment has appreciated so has each of its million shares the lanpher fund shares now are worth &# universities typically spend between and of the value of their endowments each year in when brown awarded the first income from the lanpher fund to robert matzke it covered about half his college costs mr matzke spent most of his career as a business development director for monsanto co and retired to colorado six years ago to ski the rise in browns tuition has outpaced the rising value of the lanpher fund so it covers far less than it once did still here are a few stories of the people it has helped after david katz graduated from a virginia high school in financial aid including &# from mr lanphers fund in his senior year "made the difference " he says to cover the rest he worked summers for the coast guard and winters in the brown engineering lab took out federal loans and got help from his father a manufacturers representative he left brown in with two engineering degrees and then earned a ph d at the university of california at berkeley working on problems in building storage facilities on the moon but the theoretical work paled in the late s social tumult so he turned his research to reproductive biology and eventually to the gels foams and other so called microbicides to block sexually transmitted infections he now heads a team at duke university thats trying to design a system to deliver microbicides to tissues where hiv initiates infection kate sackton from the class of made a similar journey from shrewsbury mass the daughter of a telephone operator and a substitute teacher ms sackton says she worked summer jobs bused tables in a brown cafeteria and took out &# in loans with her parents brown scholarships including about &# from the lanpher fund in her junior year and &# in her senior year made up the rest after graduation the biology major spent a year with volunteer program americorps "i wanted to give back to the world " she says she is now a ph d candidate at cornell university in ithaca n y where she is trying to determine whether a gene that controls cell division in fruit flies performs the same function in humans she hopes her research "this tiny detail " she calls it will improve in vitro fertilization technology about two thirds of browns scholarship students become donors after they graduate the university says on her &# yearly stipend from cornell ms sackton says she gives brown less than &# a year plus another small gift to alpha delta phi "but when i make more money ill give more money " she says "these are things that contributed to my life " the son of stamp dealers who had fled europe for morocco and cuba to escape the nazis bob krausz earned an economics degree in and then a law degree from duke but he had dabbled in amateur theatrics at brown and that rather than economics set him on his current course now he writes commercials speeches and industrial films and this summer will be seen in a small role cursing actor matthew broderick in the film "finding amanda " he also heads meredith vieras production company which is developing tv programs and films for young teens he first met the "today show" host while he was an intern and she was a reporter at a providence tv station the lanpher money paid about &# of his &# in fees his senior year the rest came from his father a job as a janitor at brown and &# in loans the loans took a decade to repay and he frets that student debt is channeling students away from the arts "if you go into the creative fields its already tough enough " he says once goaded by the university he says he wrote a thank you note to mr lanphers family however he says "i never knew anything about this man " a year after mr krausz graduated mark lacatena earned a degree in applied math to help pay his way through college he spent summers doing computer odd jobs but in his sophomore year he took a modern dance class and began down what he calls "a twisted road " after graduation he performed with a dance company in washington and worked free lance computer jobs he had hoped to teach dance at college but with young children to support he returned to technology and now manages computer archives in connecticut for a reinsurance company the &# he received from the lanpher fund covered about one quarter of mr lacatenas fees but the scholarship "motivated me to give back to the school " he says he started by giving &# a year but now sends &# yearly to brown and &# to the state university of new york at brockport where he earned a masters degree in dance dance "is in the box in the attic" for now he says the funds most recent recipient katherine jovin was in junior high school when she saw a video of czech animated surrealist films and wondered "what kind of culture would produce art that most people would think is so weird " she will graduate this spring with a degree in slavic studies ms jovin plans to work as an unpaid intern at the atlantic monthly this summer and then find a job paying at least &# a year roughly the amount she and her parents who are teachers borrowed to pay for her education she says wary that theres little call for czech language instructors she wants to return to brown in to earn a teaching certificate her ambition though is to write childrens books "the books you read as a child are formative " she says last year brown sent her a letter about the lanpher fund as a way to personalize the aid making her one the few recipients to have heard of the man behind the scholarship ms jovin says she wonders how her benefactor would have felt "im sure mr lanpher never thought it would go to a girl " she says "and lo and behold thats me "
