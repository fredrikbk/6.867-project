accusations based on partisan politics your april editorial "republican residue" alleged that i am being investigated by the fbi regarding whether i properly reported and paid taxes on a real estate transaction i would like to set the record straight about this assertion which has been misreported so many times that it now seems to be accepted as the truth when it couldnt be further from it the documents surrounding this real estate transaction absolutely prove that the accusations made against me are false for the record i have properly filed all of the necessary paperwork and paid all taxes associated with this transaction as far as i know there is no fbi investigation into this matter i have not been contacted by the fbi nor has any other credible individual come forward to say they have been contacted the fact is what i have been alleged to have done wrong is not even a criminal matter this is a routine tax matter that has been blown entirely out of proportion the alleged transgression is that i improperly claimed a tax deferment if the irs has questions about my ability to claim deferment of taxes on this real estate transaction i like any other taxpayer would merely be asked to provide additional information and in the worst case be asked to pay interest on the money they said i could not defer i did not evade taxes i did not avoid reporting the transaction to the irs i claimed a deferment that i believe i qualify for based on the tax code and the terms of the real estate transaction i have documentation that clearly demonstrates the validity of my tax deferment claim the unfortunate reality here is that the attack against me is based purely on partisan politics the source of this attack is a former city official who now conveniently works for a democratic member of congress the claims by this individual regarding the circumstances surrounding this real estate transaction have been totally discredited through both documentation that she signed and statements by the city democratic operatives have used the press to perpetuate rumors against me that have been shown to have absolutely no basis in fact enough is enough i have done nothing wrong and resent these baseless attacks on my character rep gary g miller r calif washington
