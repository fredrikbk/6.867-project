maybe u s markets are still supreme study finds no proof that sarbanes oxley tarnishes the allure in recent months policy makers and business groups have argued that post enron regulatory burdens have made u s markets less competitive citing as proof the many foreign companies that list their shares in london instead of new york now three academic pioneers in the field are casting doubt on the assertion in a new study they conclude there is no evidence the much criticized sarbanes oxley act which beefed up corporate accounting and financial disclosures among other things increased londons appeal to foreign companies at new yorks expense the study looked at thousands of companies that either listed or didnt list their stocks on various u s and london markets from to the research also found that investors are still willing to pay a sizable premium for foreign company shares listed in the u s in return for meeting tough u s regulatory standards foreign company stocks in london receive no similar premium they said the researchers also say the decline in new foreign listings on u s stock markets since isnt due to regulatory overkill rather today there are simply fewer foreign companies that fit the historic profile for listing abroad namely larger faster growing and less indebted companies from countries with stronger legal protections relative to historical patterns the u s attracted more foreign companies since than would have been predicted while london attracted slightly fewer "all of our evidence is consistent with the theory that there is a distinct governance benefit for firms that list on the u s exchanges " say the authors andrew karolyi and rene stulz of ohio state university and craig doidge of the university of toronto "there is no evidence this benefit has weakened over time " experts and policy makers have been arguing over the impact of the post enron crackdown for months treasury secretary henry paulson new york city mayor michael bloomberg and others have cited the shrinking number of foreign new stock offerings and company listings on nyse euronexts new york stock exchange and nasdaq stock market inc s nasdaq stock market as proof that regulatory burdens and legal risk are driving that activity to competing markets the securities and exchange commission is moving to loosen sarbanes oxleys internal auditing guidelines for small companies and recently made it easier for foreign companies to shed sec oversight it is also moving to loosen the requirement that u s listed foreign companies use u s accounting standards the latest study is unlikely to end the debate but it may carry added weight because the authors are authorities on foreign company listing decisions they were the first to identify a premium for foreign firms that list shares both at home and in the u s in an interview mr karolyi said he doesnt question the merits of revisiting the u s regulatory burden but he cautioned against a "rush to judgment if our paper does nothing else maybe it should cause some critics to pause and take a good look at the data " some economists dispute the conclusions "there might be a premium for those who issue stock in the u s but the companies are hesitant to grasp that premium " said paul bennett the nyses chief economist mr bennett noted that foreign companies have significantly stepped up their stock issuance in the u s s so called rule a market which is restricted to large institutional investors and not subject to most sec disclosure and governance rules in prior research the studys authors attributed the "cross listing premium" in other words the additional valuation relative to book value that foreign company shares listed in the u s earn relative to noncross listed peers to the greater trust investors place in a company that has met the u s s strict regulatory and disclosure requirements last year a blue ribbon committee headed by harvard university law professor hal scott using the same methodology concluded the premium had recently declined especially for companies from countries with strong corporate governance standards the committee called that evidence that the cost of listing in the u s increasingly exceeds the benefits but the new study finds no significant change in the premium from to foreign shares listed on the nyse nasdaq or the closely held american stock exchange on average traded at above their noncross listed peers or when s anomalously high figure is excluded from to it averaged the difference they say isnt statistically significant they also found no cross listing premium on the london stock exchange londons trend hasnt changed since either they say mr karolyi said foreign companies that list on the lse dont need to meet the same governance standards as british companies which may explain why their shares dont earn a premium he said those findings suggest policy makers should be cautious about easing oversight of foreign companies in the u s
