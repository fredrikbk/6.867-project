weekend journal tastings destination wine on a caribbean cruise a hunt for treasure austria in the caymans by now youve probably made plans for your summer vacation and youre counting the days until you take off in our case as you draw up your itinerary wed urge you to consider wine discovery a part of your trip not just looking for wineries but for good unusual wine wherever you are by searching for good wine youre also likely to find good food and interesting people you could even have once in a lifetime austrian wines in grand cayman no seriously thats what happened to us on a recent cruise heres the story and some tips on how you can have a similar experience we try to take a cruise once a year its relaxing and we havent found any other experience that allows us and our teenagers to enjoy such separate vacations within the same secure surroundings they go their way we go ours and we meet at dinner where they always arrive fashionably late this year we booked adjoining rooms on royal caribbeans explorer of the seas a seven day cruise from miami with stops at belize city costa maya and cozumel mexico and george town grand cayman cruise ships offer all sorts of shore excursions from swimming with dolphins to shopping for diamonds we prefer to search for restaurants with good wine of course the wine aboard the ship is important to us too on other cruise lines we have taken our own precious bottles aboard and paid corkage to drink them with dinner royal caribbean doesnt allow any alcohol to be brought onto the ship however so we ordered from the wine list which turned out to be interesting and reasonably priced with more than wines during the course of the trip we tried wines on the ship ranging from a chilean carmenere to a new zealand pinot noir to a spanish tempranillo the single most interesting wine we had on the ship was a south african rose from fort simon estate made from two thirds pinotage and one third merlot it was the vintage and cost &# pinotage is south africas special red grape but we rarely see a pinotage rose and this was quite something with the peppery qualities of the grape and a very serious backbone this rose could stand up to just about any food we had never seen it before and indeed couldnt find it when we returned were glad we had a chance to try it we struck out looking for good wine restaurants in belize city and costa maya although it might have been that we were still too tired from our real world experiences to take a good look interestingly though we did find local wine in belize made from pineapples and mangoes because we couldnt take them back to the ship we didnt buy them but any winery that makes both a semisweet and dry pineapple wine certainly deserves a chance a saleswoman did allow us to taste what she had open a cashew wine from the same winery it was a little brown like a wine we once made and tasted nutty before we left on our trip we asked our web savvy assistant melanie grayce west to look around the internet to see if she could find some wine friendly restaurants along our route she explained later how she does this "i always start my search by reading what food smart people have to say my favorite first hand food review web sites are chowhound com egullet com and mouthfulsfood com with these web sites you will have to sift through information but what you will find are timely opinions written by average people who enjoy food and traveling if you have time before your trip you can create a free account on chowhound com or mouthfulsfood com and post your dining question to the message board egullet com is a paid membership site if you want to post to the message board but free if you just want to search archives "set aside a good hour to do your homework start by plugging the location of where you will visit into the web sites search box sift through the reviews and keep a running list of places that get mentioned repeatedly or places that receive enthusiastic reviews when i have a good list usually at least restaurants i start googling restaurant names to find online menus other published reviews or even pictures that a traveler took and then posted to a personal blog pay special attention to well organized travel web sites or sites developed by locals some locations like grand cayman have detailed web sites like caymangoodtaste com with a database of restaurant listings cozumels cozumelmycozumel com has a dining guide with great ideas for travelers on a budget " one restaurant melanie found on her search was a place in cozumel called le chef we went directly from the ship to the restaurant and it was perfect small and charming with wine displayed everywhere clearly our kind of place unfortunately it was closed for lunch that day the restaurant had said earlier that it might be open our daughter media using her fluency in spanish confirmed with an employee that the restaurant would indeed be open but after our ship left so we were on our own we walked down the main tourist area and to our surprise ran into a restaurant that featured a display of mexican wines right at the front door in a universe of places that tout their potent margaritas and many kinds of beer this was a surprise so we dropped in it was called pepes and it was lovely fancier and more expensive than other places but nicely air conditioned with a good second floor view of the harbor it offered the best list of mexican wines weve seen and our waiter was very proud of them we tried a lovely earthy sauvignon blanc from monte xanic winery and a light pleasant chardonnay from santo tomas the biggest surprise however was dessert media and zoe ordered crepes suzette which were made at the table just like in the old days in a week of endless eating on the ship and on land they later declared this the single best dish of the vacation we were ready for the main event when melanie was searching for restaurants in grand cayman she stumbled on a brief mention of a place called the lobster pot by a chowhound member named "sloppy eater " sloppy said simply "the lobster pot was excellent " and based on that and some other reviews it made her short list before our trip a man we met at a wine tasting who lives in grand cayman also recommended a place called the grand old house which sounded great but when we looked at the web site of the lobster pot lobsterpot ky we were struck that not only did it include its wine list but also said "our own imports directly from austria " and indeed what followed was one of the more remarkable lists of austrian wines weve seen as weve written austrian wine is coming on strong these days especially its signature grape gruner veltliner but this was special we dont know about you but we dont often see lists that include a blaufrankisch eiswein clearly we had to go we walked down a main street for a long time leaving the rest of the cruise people behind and soon wondered if we were lost finally there near a burger king and a beach spot where fish caught that morning were being filleted and sold was the lobster pot an informal looking upstairs haven on the water we had made reservations even on a caribbean island and even if youre getting off a cruise manners like making reservations and dressing appropriately are important we went in and looked at the wine list which said at the very top "go ahead try some wines youve never had taste it if you dont like it we take it back no problem " then we met gunter gosch the restaurant manager and the austrian responsible for the list he didnt know we are wine writers when we enthused about his list he disappeared and came back with small tastes of four austrian whites welschriesling grauburgunder unoaked chardonnay and sauvignon blanc he explained that the restaurant orders wine directly from austrian producers twice a year and that a shipment of bottles had just arrived the freshness showed the wines were gorgeous with tastes as pure as sunshine and ripe flavorful fruit although austria is best known for its whites and we were at a seafood restaurant there was a red on the list that we had to order kapazunder cuvee from johann schneeberger &# the most amazing thing about this wine is that its made partly from a grape called blauer wildbacher thats so rare its pretty much only grown in one part of austria being able to have this wine which we would never see otherwise was a treat and it was indeed special clean fresh and vibrant with great acidity as we wrote in our notes "light yet earthy very real and very very clean " it reminded us of a light pinot noir but with such pinpoint tastes it had the focus of a white wine when we got back home we called mr gosch to ask why we had such great austrian wines in grand cayman he said he came to the lobster pot in after working in the restaurant and cruise industries for many years at the time the restaurant had a small generic wine list but he thought the restaurants patrons generally business people and long time cayman islands tourists would be willing to try something new especially if it was priced well so he began to bring in austrian wines and told people they could send back any bottle if they didnt like the wine "we appreciate them taking the risk to order a wine they have no idea what it tastes like " he told us "if you dont like it well take it back not that it has to be corked or anything it takes the risk factor away " he added "we all enjoy austrian wine here if someone doesnt like it were happy to share it later in the evening " he can only remember one bottle being sent back now he says the lobster pot is widely known for its austrian wines which sell quickly we really had a wonderful vacation well always remember the promenade on the ship the nights on our balcony and finally after all these years winning a game of bingo but our most lasting memory will be about austrian wine on a caribbean island to us memories like that are
