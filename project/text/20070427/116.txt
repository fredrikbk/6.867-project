weekend journal the weekend adviser chabons amazing rewrite adventures it was the end of and michael chabon was rushing to finish his latest novel the blurb was in his publishers sales catalog the on sale date was set then his editor slammed on the brakes "i shudder now when i think that i would have published the old draft " says mr chabon author of the pulitzer prize winning novel "the amazing adventures of kavalier &amp clay " instead after consultations with his editor he spent about eight months reworking the entire book a murder mystery set in a fictional yiddish speaking jewish homeland in alaska he added a flashback structure and pared down the language into a hard boiled yiddish inflected patois "i felt like i had to invent a whole new dialect of english to finish it " he says next week after five years four drafts two trips to alaska and a title change "the yiddish policemens union " will arrive in stores while long gestation periods and multiple drafts arent unusual in the publishing industry the time and effort expended on behalf of mr chabons vision are illustrations of the books importance to harpercollins which won it in a four way seven figure auction in when it was little more than a one and a half page proposal now the company has again bet big printing copies of the finished product mr chabons first full length adult novel since winning the pulitzer in "the stakes are high " says jonathan burnham harpercollinss publisher "for michael and all of us " mr chabon says he has been thinking of writing a novel set in a yiddish speaking homeland for at least a decade since he found a yiddish phrase book in a chain bookstore but he didnt start writing until after securing both a book deal and a movie deal the latter with producer scott rudin who also adapted mr chabons novel "wonder boys" into a film the first draft of the alternate history novel more than pages long and in the first person "didnt work " he says in part because the narrator a homicide detective was too garrulous "i wanted to have more distance from him " mr chabon says so he started over with a different plot and in third person over the following drafts mr chabons editor courtney hodell would mail manuscripts overnight from new york to mr chabons berkeley calif office with detailed notes penciled in the margins mr chabon describes them half jokingly as "vandalized " after harpercollinss decision to delay publication ms hodell flew to berkeley and spent the day with mr chabon they ordered sandwiches and went through the manuscript page by page "hes a writer of terrific extravagance in the language but great subtlety on the emotional side " says ms hodell "a lot of what i was doing was coaxing him to come a little closer to the reader " early reviews of the final work have been positive the novel has also generated interest among mystery booksellers according to mr burnham who says that should help increase sales and while mr chabon says he sometimes had a "defensive reaction" to edits he is thankful in retrospect that ms hodell challenged him throughout the process calling her the "redeemer of this novel" in his acknowledgments "i do overwrite " he says "and this book needed a lot of chopping " contact us at adviser wsj com quick hits music one man orchestra precocity sells patrick wolf a year old londoner is a star in his
