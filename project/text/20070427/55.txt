missile defense mischief one of the bush administrations quiet successes has been missile defense from the negotiated demise of the cold war abm treaty to initial ground based deployments but that progress is suddenly in jeopardy from opposition in russia and congress and just when we might really begin to need it against the likes of iran the immediate dispute concerns the u s offer to extend missile defenses to europe the czech republic has expressed interest in providing a site for a tracking radar while poland is considering whether to host the interceptors that would destroy incoming missiles linked to upgraded radars in britain and greenland and a command and control system in colorado the polish and czech sites could protect europe from long range missiles launched from iran it would also provide an additional layer of defense for americas east coast tehran is expected to have long range missiles by or sooner and since the world cant seem to muster the resolve to halt its nuclear program missile defense would seem a logical and urgent priority if only after warsaw and prague announced negotiations with the u s some europeans notably the french and the germans accused the u s of acting unilaterally moscow has called it "destabilizing " and democrats in congress have vowed to kill it representative ellen tauscher chairman of the house subcommittee on strategic forces is opposing the pentagons &# million request to begin construction next year the arguments against the "third site " as the polish czech contribution is known are updated versions of the anti star wars rhetoric of the reagan years ms tauscher claims the missile defense system isnt "fully tested " but the initial system the bush administration has fielded in alaska and california and now wants to extend to europe isnt the final architecture the idea is to follow the models provided by the jstar military surveillance plane and predator spy plane both were still in the experimental phase when they were called into service in the gulf war and afghanistan respectively the missile defense system is constantly being tested and upgraded critics also argue that the third site wouldnt protect all of europe from iranian missiles because the southern flank would remain exposed but the site is designed to defend against missiles with ranges of more than kilometers which means greece turkey romania and bulgaria arent at risk from this specific threat the iranian threat against southern europe is from medium and short range missiles which require different kinds of defenses and the u s is prepared to work with individual countries as well as nato to install patriots or other systems against those missiles moscows objection is that the third site is somehow intended for use against russian missiles this is untrue as the russians well know because u s officials have briefed them repeatedly on how the system would operate and have even offered to bring russia under the missile defense umbrella an offer moscow has so far rejected no one believes interceptors based in poland could deter the thousands of missiles in russias arsenal and its unclear what game moscow is playing here perhaps it hopes to forestall u s missile defenses for georgia or other former soviet republics or maybe it sees an opportunity to drive a wedge between washington and warsaw where the government is already facing heat over polands role in iraq democrats claim that the third site creates "divisions" among our european allies and should therefore be subject to natos multilateral seal of approval and a consensus process that would mean the kiss of death but why should bilateral agreements between the u s and the sovereign nations of poland and the czech republic be subject to nato approval any more than u s agreements with denmark and britain over the radars located in their territories or agreements with germany the netherlands or italy on other kinds of missile defenses in any case nato may acquire theater missile defenses which could be deployed to protect against medium and short range missiles irans not the only potential missile threat more than nations including north korea and syria have ballistic missiles and their proliferation is sure to continue the third site is part of the bush administrations vision of missile defense with a global reach since the u s withdrew from the abm treaty in nations have been lining up to get under the new missile defense umbrella the u s and its allies are safer for it
