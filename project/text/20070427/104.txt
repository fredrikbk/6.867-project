weekend journal sports by the numbers playing the nfl draft whats the biggest day of the nfl season if you picked tomorrow youre not far off the mark months after the super bowl and long before the training camps the nfl draft which starts tomorrow will play a big part in determining pro footballs balance of power this season and in years to come and while its almost certain that top prospects such as lsus jamarcus russell notre dames brady quinn and oklahomas adrian peterson will go early in the first round and get rich in the process the guarantees stop there sometimes being picked first as carson palmer of the cincinnati bengals was in is a first stop on the road to stardom but thats not always the case just ask david carr picked first overall in by the houston texans and released after five disappointing seasons so in general how well does the nfl draft do in finding future stars a look at the all pro teams of the past five years reveals some surprises of the position players who made the all pro teams since or were not drafted in the first round that means that practically every nfl team passed on them at least once and all pros werent picked until the third round or later how many no draft picks were all pros over that period one peyton manning of the indianapolis colts five players who went totally undrafted running back priest holmes tight end antonio gates fullback mack strong center jeff saturday and offensive lineman brian waters earned that honor but obviously some teams do a better job of identifying talent on draft day than others one way to figure out which teams they are is to count the number of all pros a team has drafted or signed as a free agent after the draft by that count the baltimore ravens come out on top between and they put seven draftees on all pro teams just behind were pittsburgh and san diego with six each and indianapolis with five its no coincidence that these teams have all had big successes on the field the ravens steelers and colts have each won the super bowl while the chargers had the nfls best regular season record in the top nfc team the carolina panthers nfc champions in with four all pros even more important than spending first round picks wisely is being able to tab superstars in the later rounds to measure that well use apda or all pro draft average which averages the overall draft slot for a teams all pros undrafted players are ranked as if they were taken after the last player drafted that year which team found the most diamonds in the rough the san diego chargers with an ranking they selected four all pros after round two including mr gates a three time all pro the ravens were next at thanks largely to drafting linebacker adalius thomas in the sixth round and signing undrafted running back priest holmes who would achieve fame with the kansas city chiefs the nfc leader the panthers followed by the new york giants in terms of positions the draft day bargains players taken in the second round or later were well distributed six defensive linemen and six offensive linemen its only fair to say that linemen rarely go in the first round six cornerbacks and safeties five linebackers two quarterbacks six running backs and four wide receivers so if your favorite team doesnt have a top pick dont sweat it apda reveals that in todays nfl potential superstars are available in the second round or second day of the draft the trick as the leagues most successful teams know is to find them
