the iraqi threat " he writes adding that he also knew of no "significant discussion" about containing mr hussein without an invasion according to the new york times which got a hold of a copy the times notes the book "at the center of the storm " is the first about and the war in iraq from a member of president bushs inner circle and says it is by turns "accusatory defensive and modestly self critical " mr tenet is especially disparaging of dick cheney writing that he had to plead with mr bush to kill a pre invasion speech by the vice president that sought to link iraq and al qaeda "way beyond what the intelligence shows " mr tenet also plans to use a series of television appearances aimed at promoting the book to accuse the white house of making him a scapegoat and of ignoring cia
