eurolinks daily view france wont recover with candidates current policies online edition in terms of economic growth employment and business dynamism france is falling behind other european countries most of which have better adapted to rising competition from low cost countries in asia and europes east yet both candidates for the countrys presidency have been wary of discussing the painful medicine many economists argue france needs to regain competitiveness center right candidate nicolas sarkozy promises a "rupture" with the past two decades of political promises center left rival
