unusual buyout offers a piece to shareholders all harman investors have chance for a stake in kkr goldman deal amid growing complaints from investors that private equity firms are buying public companies on the cheap so they can sell them off later at a hefty profit two of the biggest buyout players have crafted a novel deal that offers shareholders a piece of the action yesterday stereo maker harman international industries inc agreed to be acquired by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and goldman sachs group inc for &# billion under the deal which would put the company in private hands harmans current shareholders could elect to receive either &# a share in cash a premium to wednesdays closing price or exchange some of their shares for stock in the new privately owned company thats a major departure from the typical buyout in which private equity buyers acquire a public company refurbish it outside the public spotlight and then sell it off within a few years often for a big profit under this time honored wall street system most of the companys public shareholders are bought out at a set price per share and dont get to participate in any future gains or risks the harman deal provides another example of how privately managed capital is reshaping public markets and how they in turn are reshaping private equity if successful the deal could be a landmark putting pressure on other private equity firms to offer small investors a stake in their multibillion dollar investments over the past decade private equity firms like kkr and blackstone group have become the most powerful force on wall street they have raised tens of billions of dollars from wealthy individuals pension funds and endowments and have used that money to borrow still larger sums to fund buyouts of bigger and bigger companies texas utility txu corp and student lender slm corp or sallie mae recently became targets of buyout proposals valued at &# billion and &# billion respectively the harman deal would create an unusual public private entity controlled by kkr and goldman but in which existing shareholders could own as much as a stake those holders would have no voice in how the company was run essentially acting as minority partners of the two private equity buyers "we might be ending up in a hybrid world " said jean manas deutsche banks head of mergers and acquisitions for the americas "its not just pure public ownership or private ownership " existing holders who elected to receive shares in the new company would be given registered securities called "stub equity " those shares wouldnt trade on an exchange rather they would probably trade in thinly trafficked over the counter markets that could make them difficult to value and thus to buy or sell one person involved in the transaction said the harman deal was constructed in part to avoid being "clear channeled " a reference to the shareholder rebellion at the radio giant clear channel communications inc where holders have resisted an &# billion private equity offer as underpriced these investors have forced the potential buyers to make a better offer though it still isnt clear whether a deal will be approved in other similar cases such as the planned buyout of auto parts maker lear corp the potential buyers have refused to budge yesterday harmans investors seemed unimpressed with the buyout price in p m trading on the new york stock exchange the companys shares were up &# or at &# slightly above the deal price that signals investors belief that kkr and goldman will have to raise their offer or that another bidder will materialize the company has days to solicit higher bids whatever the outcome its clear that kkr and goldman are offering a change that has implications for both shareholders and private buyers "private equity investors have to learn to co exist" with shareholders said jeremy hosking a partner at london investment firm marathon asset management in an interview earlier this year "the idea that they have got to hold of the company doesnt hold there has got to be conversions between these asset classes " harman which is based in washington d c is widely regarded as one of the most innovative companies in the consumer electronics business it was founded just over years ago by sidney harman and now has employees its stock has more than tripled in the past five years as earnings nearly quadrupled the company whose brands include harman kardon jbl and infinity had revenue of &# billion and net income of &# million mr harman years old is the companys executive chairman and a major shareholder with of the shares outstanding he has sold stock over the past few years and will sell more as part of the deal though he will retain an equity stake yesterdays deal could create conflicts among the companys shareholders who are essentially being asked to be on both sides of the transaction as seller and ongoing owner while some may demand a higher deal price to maximize the value of their current holdings others might want a lower price so that their stakes in the private company have more potential gains however the deal offers an opportunity to invest alongside some of wall streets acknowledged best through for example kkr has returned about per year before fees according to a memorandum reviewed by the wall street journal in recent years shareholders have shown more tolerance for accepting debt on their public companies pushing managements to borrow cheaply and pay out special cash dividends in accepting the stub equity shareholders would own the same type of highly levered company while also getting cashed out of a majority of their shares harman is expected to carry nearly equal levels of equity and debt according to a person familiar with the transaction however the deal raises the question of whether large institutional investors such as fidelity management &amp research and t rowe price associates inc will want to hold and process securities that dont trade on a large stock exchange when a spanish buyout group proposed stub equity last year in the takeover of englands airport operator baa shareholders rejected it the harman deal also creates a whole new set of dynamics for private equity firms many of which are advantageous as one merger arbitrager put it yesterday firms like kkr "dont give up nothing for nothing " stub equity allows a buyout firm to put more of its own money to work on a deal by reducing the amount of capital it needs to raise from other buyout funds that is an important factor these days given how hard private equity shops are trying to make the most of their spending power estimated at &# trillion by morgan stanley goldman sachs for instance just closed on a &# billion buyout fund such deals also minimize some of private equitys reliance on wall street investment banks which are increasingly being asked to put in their own equity "bridge loans" to backstop larger transactions in return for fees these arrangements are deeply risky for the banks adding public holders also extends the buying range of the private equity firms which are closing in on transactions valued at upward of &# billion each if they cant raise enough financing from wall street on a huge transaction they may be able to tap existing investors to reinvest their stakes says jim abbott partner in the business transaction group at law firm seward &amp kissel should stub equity catch on it might cause some deeper soul searching in the financial markets thats because shareholders would largely be keeping their positions but essentially jettisoning the oversight of a public board of directors with so much private equity investing "american financial markets are moving toward nonregulation in which we will confront all of the old issues of people overextending themselves " said morton j horwitz a professor of american legal history at harvard university who has written on the distinctions of the public and private realms bank of america credit suisse goldman sachs and lehman brothers are financing and advising the potential buyers on the harman transaction with legal advice from simpson thacher &amp bartlett bear stearns cos and law firm wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz advised harmans special board committee with jones day providing legal advice to the company
