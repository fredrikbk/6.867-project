real time is radioheads move revolutionary british band releases in rainbows online but eliminating labels is still just a dream online edition at first glance radioheads decision to release its latest album as a digital download and let fans pay whatever they wish seems like another hammer blow to the reeling music industry and the next step in a media revolution after all a major band is going it alone and eliminating the record label as middleman in favor of dealing directly with its fans but careful as you rush to the barricades music fans things may not be changing as quickly or as thoroughly as you might hope radiohead began offering downloads of "in rainbows" last week letting fans download the cd for a price of their choosing or to just take the song album for free the results people close to the band told various music news outlets that the album was downloaded million times in the first two days its a fascinating experiment one that touches on any number of conundrums for the music world what role will record labels play in a digital world how will musicians make money in that world whats the proper price of an album when distribution is a matter of bits and bandwidth instead of cds and stores and trucks are people inherently fair minded or will they pay nothing if they can get away with it in wondering about the answers to those questions dont expect many other bands to follow radioheads lead when youre a band as big as thom yorke and co the rules change yet even radiohead isnt completely leaving the old ways behind "eliminating the middleman" has become information age gospel but however distasteful artists may find middlemen in theory in practice theyre not so easy to do without radiohead isnt the first band to use the web to reach fans or to rely on their sense of fairness in compensating artists to name two seattle rockers harvey danger released their album "little by little " as a free download in the fall of and boston indie rocker juliana hatfield has given away demos on the honor system giving it away is a lot easier if youre not signed to a major label the offspring tried to give away their album "conspiracy of one " but sony music then embroiled in a legal battle with napster put the kibosh on that idea posthaste as chronicled in this long ago tech week column granted none of those bands was a musical colossus like radiohead but radiohead wont be the last to try disintermediation trent reznor has said hes ditching his label interscope to sell nine inch nails music directly to fans oasis will soon release a single on its web site and jamiroquai is reportedly exploring web releases add it up and it sounds ominous for the record labels as one european a&amp r executive told time magazine "if the best band in the world doesnt want a part of us im not sure whats left for this business " forgive that a&amp r exec for being gloomy but a pretty big point is being missed radiohead is at the top of its game in terms of potential earnings and critical acclaim and one of the rare bands to unify musics various tribes good luck finding a music blog not dissecting "in rainbows" this week radiohead has the money name recognition and loyal following the vast majority of bands can only dream about harvey danger by comparison had recently reformed when it released "little by little " and its ambitions were smaller as guitarist jeff lin told me in this real time the band wasnt interested in another big album and a length tours rather mr lin and his bandmates were seeking a cost effective way to maintain their fan base and lay the groundwork for occasional short tours during work vacations and even then harvey dangers resume included a hit single and album and fans who remembered them a level of success few bands will ever reach superstar bands like radiohead can go it alone bands with name recognition and modest ambitions like harvey danger can go it alone but few other bands will be as lucky just ask any of the thousands and thousands of local acts with myspace pages hoping to get play counts above for the songs they stream there are bands building buzz on web outposts such as myspace of course but the vast majority of bands hoping to follow in the footsteps of fall out boy and cold war kids dont dream of continuing to rely on the web theyre hoping to snag a deal with a record label maybe even myspace records which relies on interscope for manufacturing and marketing do they have it backwards not really if you want to quit your day job as most young musicians do youll need to sell a lot of cds merchandise and tickets to do that your best bet remains having a record labels money and muscle behind you is relying on the labels an uncertain business given their increasing impatience and all or nothing mentalities of course can dealing directly with fans through the net take their place not yet a band like radiohead could probably go it alone but wouldnt they be better off spending their time making music the same dilemma applies to writers the likes of danielle steel john grisham and stephen king could probably sell e books directly to fans as mr king did with his serial "the plant " but shouldnt they be writing instead by the way mr king saw the percentage of readers who paid on the honor system decline from about for part of the serial to for a later installment he never finished "the plant " are there lots of bloggers out there hard at work honing their writing building traffic and creating a community absolutely heck im one of them whats the goal of them are striving for a book deal the internet has given artists of all stripes an ability to create distribute and promote their wares that would have been unimaginable a few years ago but at a certain point most artists with big ambitions are wise to hand off distribution and promotion to a middleman and those middlemen are well established as for radiohead they reportedly plan to release "in rainbows" as a conventional cd next year perhaps even with a major label as the bands management told british radio radiohead wants to get "in rainbows" to a mass marketplace "thats why we need a record company who have that infrastructure to deliver the cd " as fans excitement has cooled a backlash has set in why did radiohead release "in rainbows" as kbps mps was it to preserve cd sales guitarist jonny greenwood told rolling stone that the band "just wanted to make it a bit better than itunes its never going to be cd quality because thats what a cd does " was this a noble experiment a marketing ploy or a warning shot in advance of negotiations with labels maybe its all of the above and if thats disappointing maybe you started off expecting too much the internet is redistributing power among big labels small labels concert promoters witness madonnas potential blockbuster deal with live nation and artists nobody knows how that will shake out but its revolution enough whats the principal way you find and acquire music today do you think radioheads experiment will change the music industry if so how join me and other online journal readers in an ongoing discussion on the real
