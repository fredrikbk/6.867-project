affordable senior housing a waiting game the search for housing for an elderly loved one is challenging enough on its own throw in a limited budget and it can seem like an impossibility the good news is there are extensive government programs to help provide a home and care for seniors with lower incomes new resources are available to help track down living options in addition it may be possible to get help that will enable some seniors to avoid moving the bad news is that multiyear waiting lists for space at many residences are the norm patience and planning ahead is generally the only way to contend with the waiting lists but often this is a search thrust upon a family on short notice a parent or spouse can have a medical issue such as a stroke or bad fall and go from living comfortably in a longtime home to needing other arrangements overnight "you have to anticipate what the need is going to be and thats very hard to do because you dont know how fast somebody may deteriorate " says allynn smith executive director of bishop sheen ecumenical housing foundation in rochester n y just how challenging it can be to find affordable housing was made plain in a january report from the aarp and the american association of homes and services for the aging the groups found that on average a senior has to wait more than months for space in government subsidized housing for those with low incomes worse these waiting times are likely to only grow in the future as demand further outstrips the availability of housing the report said the first stop in the search for affordable senior housing should be the comprehensive web site run by the u s department of housing and urban development at www hud gov groups seniors cfm hud offers several programs including so called section housing where the government provides subsidies to builders and operators of low income housing and "section " housing where vouchers are provided to help pay the rent to be eligible for these programs individuals or couples have to fall below certain income limits which vary by region and household size people generally need to have income that is less than of the area median income includes social security wages and interest income for specific figures from the hud seniors page click on "find affordable rents" and then in the "more from hud" box click on "income limit " to help with the search hud provides a list of approved housing counselors mainly local agencies and charities across the country its also possible to do a search for low income housing in an area denver for example is listed with low income options for the elderly state chapters of the american association of homes and services for the aging can also help locate housing start from the www aahsa org web site another online resource whether affordability is an issue for your family or not is snapforseniors com which offers an easy to use database of what it says is every licensed senior care facility in the country roughly of them snapforseniors com founded in allows a user to screen for detailed services offered by a senior housing property and other options for example a search can start by choosing between independent living and assisted living facilities then a searcher can screen for locations where medicaid payments will be accepted or those that are hud subsidized facilities can be screened by whether they offer specific services such as housekeeping medication management or transportation services for people with special needs such as those with alzheimers or dietary conditions can also be selected providers dont pay to be included on snapforseniors com and dont pay for leads or referrals they do pay to list if they have openings or to have photos included other organizations license the database and some make it available to the public on their web sites among them seattles senior services agency www seniorservices org the unfortunate reality however is that once an appropriate housing solution has been found chances are there wont be an immediate opening especially in more heavily populated areas "we have two year waiting lists at a lot of the properties " says charles gould president of volunteers of america which operates over affordable housing communities "we open the communities up and theyre full in a matter of weeks because there is such a need for affordable housing " home modification given the shortage of affordable housing other options may make more sense than just sitting on a waiting list a number of organizations such as volunteers of america in a colorado program and bishop sheen in new york state will go into a home and fix it up to make it safe and user friendly for a senior often they make simple changes such as putting in brighter lights installing grab bars in bathrooms or adding railings to a homes front steps so seniors have something to lean on while getting out their keys widening doorways to accommodate a wheelchair is common "sometimes well bring a bathroom from upstairs to the downstairs " says bishop sheens ms smith email encore wsj com
