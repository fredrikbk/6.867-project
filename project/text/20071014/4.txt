eyes on the road electric car maker aims for the top with sports car tesla readies &# roadster and looks to expand downward online edition tesla motors is a car company thats both decades ahead of its time and a year behind schedule soon it will become clear which is more important to teslas long term future and the future of the disruptive ideas the company represents for those who somehow missed the blizzard of publicity that has swirled around this company for the past months or so tesla www teslamotors com is a silicon valley start up bankrolled by some of the same people who brought you the internet boom of the late s the companys stated ambition is to develop over the next several years a full array of electric cars teslas fans many of them influential leaders of silicon valleys "clean tech" green technology movement see tesla as an icon of the broader effort to make big money by unshackling the u s economy from petroleum teslas first model will be a &# electric roadster developed around the architecture of a lotus elise that uses lithium ion batteries similar to those used in laptop computers a patented electric motor system and a highly sophisticated package of controllers and software to deliver an exotically attractive car that zaps from standstill to miles per hour in under four seconds and can travel up to miles on a single charge tesla isnt planning any traditional advertising but if it did one slogan could be "you cant kill an electric car you cant catch " tesla and its approach to electrifying the automobile may well redefine the car industry but first tesla needs to actually deliver the car that was once supposed to have happened by early this year now company co founder martin eberhard says the first roadsters should come off the lotus assembly line in britain sometime during the first quarter of "our plan is to ramp up very gently " he says the run of cars produced during the first quarter of could be only about vehicles with a goal of building a total of about cars in the model year tesla recently told potential customers that it can no longer guarantee delivery of models newcomers to the waiting list might well get s during an interview last week in his modest office in one of the nondescript warehouses tesla occupies in the san francisco suburb of san carlos mr eberhard says he has gained respect for the challenges that conventional auto makers face among the problems tesla has encountered the cars body had to be redesigned because the door sills were so high that getting in and out of the vehicle required excessive acrobatics especially for women in skirts a supplier for the cars original transmission failed and a subsequent decision to move from a one speed transmission to a two speed proved more difficult to execute than expected in august the car flunked a mile per hour side impact crash test necessitating more last minute design changes the logistics of getting components produced in thailand taiwan and the u s to arrive at the right time at the assembly plant in england have proven challenging to manage this effort tesla in september hired michael marks former chief executive officer of contract manufacturing giant flextronics international ltd to become its ceo replacing mr eberhard who remained as president of technology "silicon valley engineers find it easy to think they know everything and rust belt companies dont know anything " mr eberhard says "more often than not the knee jerk reaction that these guys in detroit dont know what they are doing is wrong " that said mr eberhard says conventional car makers did get it wrong on electric vehicle technology in the s and early years of this decade big car makers led by general motors corp and toyota motor corp responded to a california mandate in the late s by producing vehicles that were supposed to prove that electric vehicles could be affordable and oh so politically correct unfortunately the gm ev and the electric toyota rav struck mainstream customers as geeky slow and impractical "electric cars had a terrible black eye " mr eberhard says as far as the general public was concerned "they sucked and they were dead " teslas big idea was to start with an electric car that appeals to the id not the superego from the start mr eberhard says he wanted a car that could outrun a porsche in a trial and would go miles on a charge he says the production roadster will hit the under four second target for the dash and will get very close to the original goal on range more fundamentally the tesla roadster is designed to ride the technology curve from the high end of the price ladder down the direction that has worked for most other forms of technological innovation from the vcr to the laptop but after the roadster is launched and the high tech elite have shown off their status defining models at silicon valleys finest restaurants and clubs what can tesla become tesla so far has raised &# million from venture capital firms and chairman elon musk the paypal founder who was a ground floor investor thats a lot for a tech startup but its chump change in the auto industry where car programs with century old conventional technology can easily cost &# million to &# billion "our ambition is one step at a time to become a real car company " mr eberhard says tesla plans to develop more practical and more affordable electric vehicles expanding its potential revenue but the time frame for that is now not as once proposed last may mr eberhard told a senate committee that the companys second model would be a &# sedan built in new mexico followed by an even more affordable car now mr eberhard is cagier about exactly what teslas "white star" model line will be and exactly when it will appear "we are deep deep into that " he says "we are planning on building cars in albuquerque its possible we might want to do something different " tesla is named for nikola tesla the godfather of alternating current and radio who nonetheless died poor in part because his weirdness wound up obscuring his genius in recent years tesla has become a patron saint of silicon valley but theres another ghost hovering over tesla motors one whose name mr eberhard brings up before a visitor can get around to it john delorean mr delorean who died in was the charismatic general motors executive who left gm after clashing with its stolid hierarchy and who later founded a company to build what he called the "ethical sports car " the dmc with its stainless steel body panels and gull wing doors was designed to appeal to wealthy enthusiasts with a taste for the exotic but mr deloreans company collapsed in and he spent several years fighting and beating charges of drug dealing and fraud the delorean companys failure is one of several examples of how hard it has been for upstarts to challenge the automotive oligarchy since world war ii "what problem was delorean solving " mr eberhard asks in response to the inevitable question about how tesla avoids deloreans fate the delorean car when it appeared was not any better in some ways not as good as a chevrolet corvette that gm was offering for less money he says by contrast tesla is offering a product unlike any other "nobody produces a real electric car " he says what will define success for tesla big car makers have tools capital and experience in dealing with the harsh environment of the global auto market that silicon valley doesnt possess even with its abundance of rich smart technology visionaries and venture capital firms mr eberhard says selling out isnt the plan even though "weve been approached by many many car companies " "we are rolling everything we can back into growing the company " he says "if we wanted to be a fancy sports car company we could do that next year " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
