investors dumped stocks the reality in hindsight there hasnt since been a better day to buy than "black monday " oct indeed that day marked the bottom of a decline over two months the dow went on to finish with a gain from yearend through this week the benchmark gained an average a year and even more if dividends are included one lesson for investors the long term investors who continued to buy small blocks of stocks or mutual fund shares at regular intervals rather than indulge in panicked selling collected big profits following the crash and two decades on that kind of investor is still reaping solid gains to be sure the dows ascent to the s has been riddled with painful declines just this year the benchmark plunged points in february and points in march and gyrated wildly during july and august and the declines have come amid signs that many people fear are harbingers of recession today as in the u s economy appears to be slowing the dollar is trading low against other major

appropriate asset allocation and to keep their cool no matter what the dow delivers when the market tanks for instance the gut reaction of many investors is to sell just in case things get worse but a

times and bad is to make steady regular investments a strategy often referred to as "dollar cost averaging " its also a good idea to spread money across a variety of different investments from u s stocks and bonds to foreign issues a diversified portfolio that considers an investors time horizon getting more conservative as the need for cash draws nearer was crucial to weathering the crash and the volatility experienced this summer these days small investors can easily get an age appropriate asset allocation by buying "lifecycle" or "target date" mutual funds that become more conservative

investors a shot at big gains while limiting downside risk but the strategy which had never been tested in a crash broke down and investors who had cavalierly taken on extra risk because they had "insurance" suffered major losses one hot offering lately has been quantitative or "quant" hedge funds and mutual funds which bet that one group of stocks will climb while hedging against loss by
