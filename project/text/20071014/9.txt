love &amp money whats our son saving for uh well my son has had a pretty good october so far at least financially after getting his monthly allowance of &# &# a week for each year of age as well as a &# birthday check from one of his great grandmothers he received his monthly statement for one of his savings accounts it reported a hefty balance of &# not bad for a kid whos about to turn he has plans to spend his birthday cash as well as the part of his allowance that hes allowed to spend but he knows he must stash a meaningful slug of that allowance into the savings account because as his mom and i have told him repeatedly through the years "this is money for the future " but what future exactly the truth is that while my wife amy and i have our son regularly saving part of his income im not really sure what hes saving for i know he certainly has no clue and that has me wondering if none of us know why hes saving is there any point to his effort the savings im talking about here is long term savings not the cash that kids put aside over a few weeks or months so they can buy a videogame or a trendy pair of jeans classically we parents have our kids saving over the long haul for some undefined big ticket item maybe in the back of our minds were thinking college or a car or a first house most likely were not thinking anything at all we just know its for something a long time away but for a kid that time scale is meaningless for them next week is forever ten years will never get here they see the money basically disappearing into the black hole of savings never to re emerge i recently received a letter about this from a reader who said she has been struggling with this issue with her two young sons while she pays the boys an allowance she wrote "i have never started them on a regular savings program because we can never agree on what they should be saving for should they be expected to save for college should the savings be allowed to be used on large purchases such as a wii videogame system or even cars i want my children to learn the value of saving money but if they never see what money can obtain within a few years of saving will they lose interest and thus understanding" of the need to save we parents struggle with this in part because "saving for the future" is a nebulous concept for us as well sure there are concrete reasons we all squirrel away a few dollars for the long term a new house a new car a dream vacation retirement but there are just as many nonreasons that all boil down to a very limp "just because " amy and i have several accounts unrelated to anything in particular except maybe our own notion of "financial security " but thats not a concept that will ever resonate with the preteen set try telling your year old that a fattened savings account will help if lean times strike at or then watch the eyes glaze over amy and i started our son on a savings account when he was about years old in part because he had reached an age where he was familiar with spending but knew nothing about saving which was all done electronically he never had to step into a bank with mom or dad except to hit the atm opening a bank account would teach him that the flip side of spending is saving a message we wanted to instill and one he has subsequently learned based on his bank balances but now what i asked amy why she thought our son was saving and she fell back on the traditional reasons "hes saving for college or a car when he gets older " she told me maybe but weve got money put away for his college as does his grandfather similarly i have a car for him my original miata that he wants and my son when asked doesnt have any idea what that money is supposed to be for hed like to spend it now so what reason should we be giving him the more i think about it the more i come back to "just because " i dont think kids need a specific reason to save and i dont think parents need to contort themselves to fashion goals that kids must strive for if you want your children to save for college fine just dont expect them to truly grasp that until theyre teenagers if you want kids to experience the pleasures that saving can allow such as occasionally splurging on an expensive item great allow your kids to reclaim some percentage of their savings once a year to buy whatever they want but saving is a goal in itself because it is an essential life skill i need only look around my immediate family to know that an inability to save can create financial headaches for all those involved the only point to saving is that you do it regularly because you never know when youre going to need the money thats a pretty good reason for a kid to learn to save jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
