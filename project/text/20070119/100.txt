weekend journal review books the freedom that failed toussaint louverture a biography by madison smartt bell pantheon pages &# the events that took place in haiti then a prosperous french colony known as st domingue between when the great slave rising began and december when the countrys independence was proclaimed probably changed u s history napoleons defeat in haiti meant that he could no longer secure louisiana which he wanted to use as a base for his imperial designs in north america so he ended up selling it to the u s that sale the louisiana purchase opened a big national debate in america about whether the states to be created in the newly acquired territory would be slave states or free states haitis successful slave revolution lit up the imagination of both abolitionists and slave owners in the u s contributing to the turmoil that in the decades that followed led to the civil war it is surprising given these umbilical connections that americans have paid a lot less attention to haiti than to other parts of the western hemisphere madison smartt bell a novelist who wrote a fictional trilogy based on haitis independence struggle a few years ago is an exception he now returns to haiti with a well researched and elegantly written biography of the hero of that struggle toussaint louverture his subject did not initiate the slave rebellion nor was he the man who years later proclaimed the countrys independence but unlike the names of the leaders who sparked off the rising louvertures did not fade away into oblivion and unlike jean jacques dessalines the man who went on to declare haitis independence he was much more than a megalomaniacal blood thirsty tyrant he was a complex and contradictory character in whom it is possible to identify as many edifying traits as unpleasant ones and in whose biographical tale there are enough lacunae to warrant the intuition of the novelist rather than the erudition of the historian louverture was the grandson of a tribal leader from africas dahomey coast and the son of a slave who had been sold to the count of breda in st domingue the breda plantation was one of the many estates that produced haitis abundant sugar exports making haiti the most valued colony in the western hemisphere the island colonized by spain in the th century had gradually come under french control by the th century as spains attention shifted to peru and mexico which had vast reserves of gold haitis colonizers responded to the decline of the native population by importing slaves from africa by the end of the th century those slaves numbered nearly a half million comprising by far the largest segment of the population although there had been previous episodes of rebellion the french revolution and its claims to the "rights of man" triggered the first organized attempt against the prevailing system by the time louverture was approaching the age of a free citizen and even a property owner he had been manumitted by the count of breda in the island was in a state of agitation the rebellion was a bloody one eventually claiming hundreds of thousands of lives and leading to a succession of brutal regimes in slaves in the north of the country inspired by a religious leader named boukman rose up against their masters slaughtering thousands the fighting evolved into a civil war that would continue until the defeat of napoleons troops years later louvertures role was pivotal he was a natural leader and military strategist who managed to unite under his command many blacks whites and mulattoes the former slave confronted the republicans at first allying himself with the royalists including the spanish monarchy it controlled the western half of the island the present day dominican republic and had its eyes set on french st domingue after france abolished slavery louverture switched sides helping crush the spaniards and eventually brokering a deal with the british who had also invaded haiti thus liberating his country from foreign intervention but louvertures attempts to enforce a constitution that granted him power for life and in effect severed haiti from france led napoleon to send an army against him the french captured louverture and sent him to a prison near the swiss border but the toll of the war was so heavy on the french that napoleon would eventually come to regret having ordered the invasion the island then fell under the control of dessalines who destroyed the remaining french forces louverture died in prison a few months before the declaration of haitis independence mr bells portrait of louverture is as honest as his overall assessment of his actions is generous louverture was indeed full of contradictions he was a former slave who had owned slaves himself before the black rising he imposed forced labor on his countrymen after when he managed to gain control of a country that until then had been over the centuries a theater of war between royalists and republicans between whites mulattoes and blacks and between france spain and england he made a life cause of the fight against tyranny and yet proclaimed himself governor for life in he expressed disgust with the exactions of his rivals notably the mulatto leader antoine rigaud and yet he ordered a massacre of spaniards in when he put an abrupt end to his alliance with the iberian monarchy and embraced the french republicans he also tolerated the extermination of mulattoes at the hands of dessalines then one of his lieutenants in mr bell does not conceal any of these episodes but his favorable inclination toward louverture leads him to relativize his conduct "for a citizen of what we are pleased to call the first world the apparent contradictions of toussaints personality can be difficult to resolve within haitian culture there are no such contradictions but simply the actions of different spirits which may possess ones being under different circumstances and in response to vastly different needs there is no doubt that from time to time toussaint louverture made room in himself for angry vengeful spirits as well as the more beneficent lwa " the irony of this observation is that although toussaint sporadically used vodou for political purposes voudou was the religion of most of haitis inhabitants and continues to be practiced by half the population today he was a self proclaimed catholic and a very "westernized" haitian in passing judgment on toussaint one should take into account his legacy the political actors and the institutions that he helped bring about and that survived him and here is where mr bell is perhaps too lenient after defeating the remnants of the french army toussaints successor the delirious dessalines went on to crown himself emperor and to establish a genocidal tyranny only to be followed by new dictators in effect frances oppressive colonial rule was replaced with homegrown despotism toussaints cause had been liberation and yet despite his relative moderation his efforts to welcome back white plantation owners and his intelligent dealings with the u s and britain he failed to establish the foundations of a more participatory and just society what had started as something more ambitious than the american revolution which as mr bell reminds us had not intended to overturn an entire socioeconomic system in the way haitis slaves set out to do ended up creating a dysfunctional state part of that tragedy stems from the fact that haitis most enlightened leaders like toussaint but with fewer redeeming qualities continuously betrayed the hopes of ordinary people up to this day one of them is jean francois aristide who in recent times probably had the best shot at founding a new republic but opted instead for behaving like a thug the coup that deposed in has brought only a slight amelioration to haitis fortunes the island continues to suffer a lack of social and political stability the work that best captures haitis abundant charms and maddening history is alejo carpentiers famous novel "haiti the kingdom of this world " which describes the surreal atmosphere of the revolution with poetic prose upon finishing mr bells compelling biography of toussaint louverture one can do no better than to pick up carpentier to understand even better just why dictatorship has been a recurring fact of haitis modern history mr vargas llosa is the director of the center on global prosperity at the independent institute and the author of "liberty for latin america "
