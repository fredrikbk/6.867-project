weekend journal taste de gustibus ambushing the bush legacy in an interview sunday night on " minutes " president bush told scott pelley that he is "not the kind of guy who sits here and says oh gosh im worried about my legacy im more worried about making the right decisions to protect the united states of america " its a noble sentiment but with less than two years left in his presidency mr bush and his supporters do have to make some decisions about his legacy or at least where it will be housed in december the committee charged with selecting a location for ws presidential library announced that it had narrowed down the candidates from three to one eliminating baylor university and the university of dallas in favor of southern methodist university laura bushs alma mater the proposed library will include in addition to presidential papers and artifacts a public policy institute to further "domestic and international goals " among the goals mentioned by the selection committee are "compassionate conservatism the spread of freedom and democracy throughout the world and defeating terrorism " it all sounds quite worthy but certain members of the smu faculty did not react well to the news of their campuss selection in an op ed article for the college newspaper two professors from the universitys theology school asked "do we want smu to benefit financially from a legacy of massive violence destruction and death brought about by the bush presidency in dismissal of broad international opinion " a letter sent to smus president last week signed by current and past members of the faculty echoed this theme it expressed concern about "certain actions and attitudes of president bush during his term in office " including draw a deep breath here "the erosion of habeas corpus denial of global warming disrespect of international treaties alienation of longtime u s allies environmental predation disregard for the rights of gay persons a pre emptive war based on false premises and other perceived forms of disrespect for the created order and the global community " which raises the question why would mr bush want to have anything to do with such hostile not to mention graceless and cliche obsessed people why not look elsewhere for his librarys site admittedly the professors who signed the letter make up less than of smus faculty but presidential libraries inevitably bring a degree of prominence even prestige to the universities that host them why should mr bush and his friends give smu the satisfaction one can easily imagine cindy sheehan parading around the university grounds for years to come with hordes of sociology professors and student activists following her locating presidential libraries at universities has become "de rigueur" only recently according to richard norton smith the former director of five presidential libraries up through eisenhower mr smith notes such libraries were located at places of "special significance" to the president and for good reason "if you want to understand fdr " says mr smith "you have to understand hyde park " where roosevelt grew up typically campus sites mean controversy herbert hoovers library started at stanford but he moved it to his home state of iowa out of fear that left wing faculty would tarnish his legacy when lbjs library opened in at the university of texas austin thousands of protesters showed up duke rejected nixons library altogether and the reagan library was chased out of stanford for largely ideological reasons mr smith believes that faculty objections are shortsighted "with rare exceptions presidential libraries have contributed to the intellectual and cultural life of universities they expose students to a whole range of history and policy makers and its very bipartisan exposure " it is true that such libraries serve in part as monuments to particular presidencies but scholars and students are free to use the library contents as they please of course and the librarys own exhibits may well change as new sources of information become available mr smith cites the way in which the newly discovered johnson tapes showing his ambivalence about the vietnam war changed the way that library presented the presidents role in the conflict for a faculty sick with bush rage none of this seems to matter the negotiations with smu are moving forward but what are mr bushs options one suspects that baylor an evangelical school and the university of dallas a conservative catholic school would both be more hospitable environments but why bother with universities at all the bush presidency owes very little to them compassionate conservatism spreading democracy and defeating terrorism are hardly at the top of most academic agendas why not offer the library to the american enterprise institute or the manhattan institute or why not raise a little more money and just put it on the ranch in crawford texas whatever else you can say about president bush his administration has rarely been "de rigueur " ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
