solipsize it it happens with clockwork regularity though the clock is lopsided every so often there is a discovery of a new group or groups who have never had contact with modern societies and then there is a flurry of excitement that perhaps now at last examples of pure human nature await revelation at the same time there is concern for the welfare of the people suddenly unveiled not only because of the violation of their culture but because of the bitter medical impact of diseases such as those of the upper respiratory tract for which they have no immunities and of course the choppers from newsonthehour are quick to arrive to record the astonishing spectacle of human beings unaware of remote controls low fat yogurt and the greatness that was rome as if the newcomers are exotic not us i had a friend who had just graduated from berkeley and one day announced "i am so solipsistic that when i pass a garbage dump i think i stink " solipsism is us our incredulity deems it remarkable that anyone can have avoided "the west " and even more so when some fair number of them are eager to learn nothing about us and in fact want nothing more than nothing to do with us the latest iteration of the long running fascination with what used to be called primitive people are some folks in the amazon rainforest of brazil who can you believe it have made no apparent effort to socialize at ipanema when several years ago a helicopter flew over an elderly woman shot arrows at it the authorities tried with some bizarre notion of animal husbandry to induce the last survivor of a tribe in the state of rondonia to meet and procreate with an indian woman but his arrows sent her running after the military dictatorship fell in the anthropologists of brazil secured the cooperation of the government which tries firmly if not always successfully to protect the isolated groups from the illegal miners and loggers who swarm the area foreign groups such as survival international in the u s add their weight to efforts to protect the special character of isolated human groups who elect to maintain their special and diverse character its worth remarking that diversity in this case means not joining the dominant culture unlike our own use of the term which involves different folks who want to join right in in any event the groups of amazonian indians now become part of the long running western fascination with "uncontacted" people who might reveal some inner secrets about human beings surely they possess some rousseauist form of original non sin they exist in a state of nature and all that and we cant forget the hottentots and others exhibited in zoos and museums years ago and the various humiliating travesties put on by impresarios of the exotic to titillate the bored who assumed that the truth of life had to be different than the truth of their lives as if there were an anthropological version of antimatter somewhere providing a picture of real homo sapiens its a lengthy tragiromantic story involving the likes of gauguin lawrence of arabia the myth of the african heart of darkness and various psychological theories about the throbbing unconscious stifled by the niceties of victorian england the rules of russian royalty or the rigmaroles of proper boston we know better now uncontacted people are first and mainly just people they are unlikely to possess either a magical gift of eco efficiency or a special wild depravity like everyone else they merit the opportunity to live in banal and predictable ways people end up living in ways recognizable to nearly everyone else even if in one tribe men wear hats in sacred places and in another women do there is as much to learn about human nature in new york city as in the amazon dont overestimate the importance of costume in either place and in both watch out for them arrows mr tiger is the charles darwin professor of anthropology at rutgers university
