weekend journal review film the italian tale of russian orphan is raw but unreal dickensian details help ground quest for mom dead girl is short on life the italian of "the italian" is not italian thats only the nickname hes been given in a moldering wreck of a russian orphanage his real name is vanya hes six years old and if other people play his cards right he will be whisked off to mediterranean warmth by italian adoptive parents this debut feature was directed by andrei kravchuk and stars kolya spiridonov in the title role the film flirts frequently with sentimentality falling for it heedlessly at a couple of crucial junctures still the overall style is more astringent than moist and the hero is a little toughie of endearing tenderness the ostensible subject could hardly be more topical international adoption is big business and often dirty business an unregulated chaos of shining promises tawdry realities and thwarted hopes as well as happy endings theres tawdriness to spare in "the italian " the director of the orphanage is a cheerless drunk trading in the currency of his realm reasonably healthy children with a worldly intermediary who in her ruthless way makes matches that benefit all sides in the transaction yet the real subject and the only card that vanya has to play is the orphans timeless fantasy of being reunited with his real mother thats what drives him to pull away from the likelihood of a better life in italy and to run off on a desperate quest according to the production notes the script which was written by andrei romanov is based on the true story of a russian orphan who taught himself to read so hed be better able to find his mother the fictional vanya learns to read though all too quickly and precociously true stories dont necessarily make for believable drama especially when the drama leads to the sort of ending that this one does the plotting with its climactic chase is realitys enemy but "the italian" creates its own reality with a strong sense of place even though the place an unnamed provincial city is blighted by rust rot and dirty snow and a dickensian tapestry of grungy details the orphanage is nominally run by its bibulous director but day to day power over childrens lives resides in a shadow government of older boys most of them played by real life orphanage wards who send the younger boys out to cadge and steal and the older girls to work the streets one thinks of course of "oliver twist" and dickens yet little vanya on his journey of self definition made me think of "a death in the family" and james agee writing as the boy he was in knoxville in a six year old still at home with both parents he lamented that even those who love him "will not ever tell me who i am " the dead girl "the dead girl" was written and directed by karen moncrieff who made her feature debut three years ago with "blue car " in that distinctive and promising film a high school teacher reads a students poem about her turbulent life then advises her to "go deeper " in this her second film ms moncrieff has followed that advice by going deeper into darker areas of the soul but she does so at such a glacial pace and with such tonal monotony most of the first minutes are either grim in the dark or both that audiences will follow at their peril the girl of the title is both a corpse discovered in a field and the dramatic nexus of several stories the film suffers not only from its own bleakness which deepens as the stories wear on but from the dramatic diffusion of most of the currently fashionable everything and everyone is connected scripts at the same time ms moncrieff directs her cast with exceptional skill and she has brought together an impressive group of actors to direct toni collette as the already haunted woman who discovers the corpse rose byrne as a forensics student who believes the corpse to be that of her long lost sister mary beth hurt as a wife with deepening doubts about her husband marcia gay harden as a mother in search of her runaway daughter kerry washington as a prostitute who may have information for her and brittany murphy as a woebegone waif trying to deliver a present for her daughters birthday michael grady did the cinematography which like the film as a whole is stylish highly accomplished and thanks to its severely restrained palette mostly off putting dvd tip a seven year old boy flees to coney island in "the little fugitive" after being tricked into believing he has killed his brother its hard to see this unassuming independent production for the revolutionary piece of work it was but the filmmakers morris engel ray ashley and engels wife ruth orkin used location photography and hand held camera techniques that helped open the floodgates of cinema art for the new wave directors in france their film also serves as a time capsule record of what coney island looked like more than a half century ago
