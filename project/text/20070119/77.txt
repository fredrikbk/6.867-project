small cap funds the big case for thinking small investors weighing mutual funds that invest in small companies might want to think well small for the past three years the best performing small company funds which generally invest in stocks with market values of &# billion or less are those managing smaller pools of money according to research firm morningstar inc funds with billions of dollars under management tended toward more middle of the road performance over the three year period ended dec for example five of the top small company funds based on annualized performance had roughly &# million or less in assets and none of the largest funds by assets ranked in that group according to morningstar by comparison the average small company fund had &# million in assets yet many investors may overlook smaller small company funds in some cases because they arent offered by the largest or well known investment houses additionally many tiny funds dont show up in investment listings even if they achieve strong returns because of their small size investors shouldnt ignore the small fry when shopping for small company mutual funds says morningstar fund analyst andrew gogerty smaller funds can dive into the smallest stocks called microcaps which have performed particularly well in recent years he says by contrast larger funds with more assets typically shy away from microcaps because investments in tiny companies have less impact on a larger portfolio some caveats smaller small company funds more concentrated bets can cut both ways yielding high returns if they pay off or losing big if they dont investors also need to pay attention to the fund managers track record particularly to see how they perform in different market conditions that is because many small company funds havent been around that long just four of the top small company funds in for example are old enough to have five year track records at the same time fees for the smallest small company fund managers can far exceed those of bigger peers they also may hit investors with hefty sales charges some of the best performing small company funds also quickly close their doors birmiwal oasis fund the top performing fund in morningstars small company category in and on a three year basis doesnt accept money from new investors even though it has just &# million in assets the fund also has a hefty expense ratio according to morningstar fund manager kailash birmiwal declined to comment plus the run up in small company stocks in recent years means the best times for these funds might be over for the past five years for instance the russell share index a leading benchmark for small stocks returned annualized compared with for the standard &amp poors stock index investors still enamored with the sector though shouldnt overlook the potential returns of smaller funds consider that birmiwal oasis generated an annualized return of over the three years ended dec by contrast the largest actively managed small company fund at the end of vanguard explorer fund with &# billion in assets and also closed to new investors returned an annualized for the same period of course gauging how big is too big is an age old issue that even bedevils fund managers george henning manager of pacific advisors small cap fund has fretted about size since his fund grew to about &# million at the end of from about &# million at the end of so far growth hasnt crimped his value oriented investment style if assets rise to &# million he may close the fund to new investors pacific advisors fund which has existed since is the no small company fund on a three year basis with a annualized return through dec according to morningstar because of his investment style mr henning says he cant imagine running billions of dollars in a small company fund "youre either owning much larger positions in companies or you are spreading your assets around so much that it dilutes the impact any one company has on the portfolio " says the manager whose holdings usually have market values of &# million to &# million other small company managers dont share his concern tim keefe co manager of john hancock funds jhancock small cap intrinsic value fund believes his fund currently with about &# million under management could handle &# billion while "small caps certainly dont have the same amount of capacity" as some other areas mr keefe says there are plenty of investment opportunities to handle larger amounts of cash mr keefes two year old fund was in morningstars top small company funds for
