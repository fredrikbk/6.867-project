bushs wiretap surrender the iraq war has been hurting president bushs poll ratings for a couple of years now but keeping him from political free fall is the fact that the united states has suffered no terrorist attacks since and the widespread belief that white house policy might have something to do with it so count us baffled by mr bushs surrender wednesday on warrantless wiretapping authority that even the carter administration believed was well within the constitutional power of the executive branch the recent al qaeda wiretaps at issue provoked little public outrage after all most americans outside partisan media circles or libertarian think tanks understand whats at stake although congress whined about not getting enough information about the program it always does it didnt dare try to shut it down either but now and for reasons that seem shortsightedly political the justice department has announced that future domestic surveillance of al qaeda would be conducted within the confines of a law called the foreign intelligence surveillance act no administration and no serious court has ever recognized fisa as a binding limit on presidential authority we dont know the details of the deal the administration says it struck with the special court that grants fisa warrants but even an eased and expedited process is likely to prove an unnecessary impediment to meeting u s intelligence needs fisa is a cold war era law that was written primarily to enable surveillance of suspected soviet bloc spies operating out of embassies it is ill suited to the realities of todays fast moving antiterror battlefield in particular fisa warrants require that the government show that an intended subject of surveillance is an "agent" of a foreign power which raises the important question of what happens the next time we pick up an al qaeda bigwig with a list of u s cell phone numbers on him are those numbers to go unmonitored because they dont fit fisas "agent" paradigm and we cant know in advance to whom theyre attached or what about known individuals who are not al qaeda "agents" but active sympathizers are they out of bounds the administration has some explaining to do not least to its own officials who spent months saying fisa warrants were dangerously restrictive all the more so because the legality of the warrantless wiretaps was not really in question there is all the difference in the world between wiretaps for criminal surveillance and prosecution and wiretaps for gathering intelligence on our enemies just as the president doesnt need a warrant to listen to enemy communications on a foreign battlefield such as iraq he doesnt need one simply because one end of an enemy communication happens to take place in the u s thats why carter attorney general griffin bell made a point of emphasizing when fisa was passed that the law "does not take away the power of the president under the constitution " and its why the fisa appeals court itself wrote in that it and "all the other courts to have decided the issue" believe the president has "inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information " as for the possibility that presidents might abuse that power federal judge laurence silberman has argued that fear of exposure is an even stronger disincentive than legal constraint by contrast he noted "there is no self correcting mechanism" to remedy abuses of power by politically unaccountable judges this gets to the fundamental problem with fisa which is that it replaces an elected official with a judge on intelligence gathering matters that may have life or death implications in other words its fisa not warrantless wiretapping that is arguably unconstitutional the bush administrations decision to accede to this congressional and judicial power grab is all the more shocking given recent history remember the commission and all the talk about "the wall" well that intelligence sharing barrier was a product of executive branch attempts to deal with the demands of the fisa court its almost certain this new attempt to operate through fisa will lead to the production of nonsensical guidelines of its own for the most part well never know what valuable information is lost as a result the white house may think this fisa concession will allow it to escape more onerous legislative restrictions but congress may now merely take this concession and codify it anyway if democrats wanted to fight him over wiretapping mr bush should have relished the prospect given that he had the law and the public on his side instead hes offered to dilute executive powers in a way that will damage the antiterror efforts of his own administration as well as those of his successors
