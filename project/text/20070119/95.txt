we support a paygo policy that enforces real spending discipline your jan editorial "tax as you go" professed puzzlement that the heritage foundation would call on house speaker nancy pelosi to honor her pledge to enact a "paygo" rule that would require all new entitlements to be offset by cuts in other entitlements or tax increases and net new tax reductions to be "paid for" with entitlement reductions you suggest that we are so "obsessed" with ruinous entitlement spending that we would support a form of paygo that would make it difficult for speaker pelosi to slash taxes properly understood our position should evoke your applause not puzzlement heritage is unalterably opposed to new taxes we take a back seat to no one the journal included in our desire for spending cuts and our support of pro growth tax cuts if we had our druthers congress would enact a paygo law that enforced fiscal discipline through spending cuts alone unfortunately such an ideal paygo stands no chance of passage in this house can we afford then to do nothing under current law taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product will rise automatically and dramatically in future decades even if congress acts to keep the bush tax cuts from expiring in addition to blocking new taxes we must work tirelessly to stop the scheduled long term tax hikes built into current law we are also determined to fight the rising tide of entitlement spending and of course speaker pelosi is far more likely to press for new entitlements than to slash taxes a supposedly conservative republican congress passed an &# trillion medicare drug entitlement after all just imagine what liberal congressional leaders might propose that nightmarish vision led us to call for a paygo strong enough to block new entitlements the enforceable paygo we suggested would force lawmakers to propose a major tax hike for any new entitlement they want to create political suicide for democrats who won in conservative districts by pledging budget discipline even if liberal leaders could convince vulnerable freshmen to fall on the sword of tax hikes any house passed tax increase should be stone dead on arrival with a tax cutting president in the white house and a veto sustaining cadre of republicans in the senate unfortunately the paygo rule adopted in the house was not the paygo policy we advocated rather than enacting an enforceable law that establishes real discipline the house approved a nice sounding rule with a huge loophole it can be waived by a simple majority so when the going gets tough the house can just ignore its own rule thats no way to limit government growth no way to get entitlements under control and no way to fight tax hikes and its not at all the meaningful enforceable paygo policy heritage recommended a key point omitted from your editorial edwin j feulner president the heritage foundation washington
