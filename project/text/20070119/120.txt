wonder land give top teachers a bonus is there a bigger scandal in america than the low state of inner city schools oprah winfrey utterly frustrated with the problem last month discussed the &# million she has spent building the oprah winfrey leadership academy for girls in south africa ms winfrey said south african students want to learn but in u s schools "the sense that you need to learn just isnt there " whered it go there are multiple choice answers to that question and most of them are right mayor mike bloomberg of new york offered one answer in his state of the city speech wednesday the desire to learn disappeared down the bottomless well of centralized public school bureaucracies mayor bloomberg proposed greatly increased autonomy for school principals one irrefutably proven answer to making a school better he also wants teachers to prove they deserve tenure an idea so obvious that it probably has no chance one measure of the tenure decision for new york city teachers would be their students test scores news accounts said the city teachers union is "certain to fight" linking test scores to tenure this too is among the multitude of correct answers for why students have no incentive to learn in big city schools mike bloomberg a name difficult to keep out of conversations about national politics has been known to make visits elsewhere in the country on what we political gamesters would call "exploratory" trips let me suggest that the mayor explore a southern strategy in little rock ark where five grade schools are continuing an experiment in linking teacher merit pay to student test scores first described in this space in october that column "how one school found a way to spell success " described how teachers at the meadowcliff school formerly full of student underachievers were promised bonuses linked to improvements in the standardized test performance of each student the size of the bonus increased relative to the students year over year test gains a improvement earned a &# bonus rising to &# if the student gained some did everyone in the school was in the bonus plan including the cafeteria ladies who started eating with the kids rather than in their own lounge it worked scores improved twelve teachers got bonuses from &# to &# the checks were handed out in a public ceremony oprah would love meadowcliff last year they added wakefield school to the bonus program after the schools unionized teachers voted overwhelmingly for it and this year three more grade schools geyer springs mabelvale and romine all are urban schools of the sort everyone in america professes to be concerned about notwithstanding that public concern gets a d+ for achievement every year the first formal attempt to analyze the little rock merit pay experiment was released earlier this week by the department of education reform at the university of arkansas the study led by the universitys gary ritter focused on the results in a single school wakefield which had consistent student test scores across three years the ritter study also summarized the expansion and refinement of the incentive program since its inception at wakefield and the three newest schools the bonuses are awarded for the average growth in test scores of each teachers class rather than per student achievement as at meadowcliff at the fall start of wakefields first year in the program its students tested in the th percentile at years end they were in the th percentile its teachers got &# in bonuses meadowcliffs second year bonuses totaled &# for consistency the study looked at results on a standardized math test given at wakefield school the past three years to each student ending in the fourth and fifth grades the schools teachers were covered by the bonus program last year the students math grades improved by a standard measure called nce of points while those in three little rock comparison schools declined that point gain equals about one sixth of the normally cited national average gap in math scores between black students and white students if compounded for six years the gap would close too hopeful it seems to be for the little rock teachers union a man versed in the downward slope of many such good intentions warned me last year to watch for the counteroffensive from either little rocks bureaucrats or its teachers union the union has made its move in last falls school board election the union ran a slate of candidates and gained control of four of the boards seven seats it hopes to capture one more school board seat this september by june however little rock will have five grade schools inside the merit bonus program if standardized test scores rise in these three new schools as well it would take a special brand of community self destruction to throw out the bonus program at the unions behest thered be one more bitter irony in that too just a few days ago the school board in rogers ark in the affluent northwest corner of the state voted to apply for federal funding of a merit pay program under the u s department of educations teacher incentive program where do you think at least some the highest performing bonus earning teachers in little rocks urban schools will migrate to if the unions school board flattens their merit pay program the university of arkansas education researchers incidentally plan to work with rogers from day one to measure outcomes if the plan goes forward the original money for the bonus program at meadowcliff school and its design came from the hussman foundation of little rock since then walter hussman jr has been able to solicit support for the plans expansion to the other grade schools from the walton family foundation and the brown foundation of houston if the program isnt killed he expects to find funding for more schools from other out of state foundations building a school for girls in south africa is fine by me but imagine how electrifying it would be if a u s citizen could ever believe in the efficacy of starting a leadership academy for girls in arkansas who said something about having a dream write to henninger wsj com mr henningers wonder land column will appear on thursdays starting next week jan
