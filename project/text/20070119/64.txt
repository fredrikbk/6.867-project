prime minister brown in the great british gangster film "the long good friday " harold londons top crime lord considers the possibility of a plot to topple him "whos big enough to take you on " asks his minder "well there were a few " harold says "theyre all dead " gordon brown heir apparent to tony blair now finds himself in much the same position hes desperate not to drop his guard in the months remaining before mr blair finally leaves office yet all his rivals are indeed politically dead only john reid the popular and impressive home secretary holds out refusing to rule himself out of the race but he has yet to establish the momentum needed even to challenge mr brown the way things look nobodys "big enough to take on" the chancellor of the exchequer the prize will be his by september at the very latest when labour holds its annual conference probably well before for all his determination not to take anything for granted the chancellor is making explicit preparations for a move into downing street his behavior resembles that of a president elect working with his transition team his allies speak confidently of a plan of action long prepared and meticulously choreographed that will stamp his authority and style upon the pms office it will they say distinguish him sharply from his predecessor and knock the stuffing out of the young tory leader david cameron who has given his party its first consistent poll lead over labour for years the two tasks are not the same first mr brown will want to make clear that hes not akin to mr blair and that he will govern very differently from his former friend turned deadly rival hes already signaled that he wants "a new settlement for our times " a package of constitutional reforms that may stop short of a written constitution but would certainly include greater powers for parliament the curbing of the royal prerogative reform of the house of lords and he says more decentralization this last claim has provoked laughter from critics who regard him as the most centralizing power hungry chancellor of modern times what is certainly true is that hed have to utterly transform his political style to make good this promise for a decade he has operated via a tiny group of lieutenants destroying his foes and accumulating power with ruthlessness and all this simply to hand power back to others well we shall see the brownites promise a more "humble " more "austere" no to translate an end to the blair era of luxury holidays showbiz friends and alleged freeloading with this comes a much more substantial promise not to be dazzled in any way by money or power even if the power is that of the president of the u s in a recent interview mr brown was asked if hed be as close to president bush as is mr blair he conspicuously declined to say yes saying "people who know me know that i will speak my mind ill be very frank" and that "the british national interest is what i and my colleagues are about " decoded i wont be bushs poodle like tony for those who see the war on terror as an global struggle in defense of democratic values mr brown set off alarm bells he implied that there is a clear separation between whats at stake for america and for britain this is a tempting course for the chancellor he and his party are sick of iraq and would love to withdraw from the fray entirely concentrating on the domestic reforms that labour was elected in to enact the chancellor loves the america of think tanks economic forums and policy wonks few books have made such an impact upon him as gertrude himmelfarbs analysis of the enlightenment "the roads to modernity " but it is doubtful that he shares mr blairs vision of a seamless conflict involving the threat of islamist terror rogue states and wmd its likely that he will seek an a la carte approach to the u s u k "special relationship" which means a less close relationship one that may be tested sooner rather than later by the threat of nuclear weapons in iran mr brown is much less tolerant of eu bureaucracy than mr blair whose failure to lead britain into the euro counts as one of his greatest disappointments expect prime minister brown to take a lead in global trade aid debt relief and perhaps environmental policy but is "i am not tony blair" enough in itself to defeat the resurgent tories financially solvent and emboldened by their performance in polls and local elections the conservatives are back in serious contention and believe they can win mr browns challenge is one which famously exercised bill clinton how to renew a party in office the chancellor is already a very familiar political figure respected as a custodian of the nations finances but not yet hailed as a charismatic leader in waiting to counter mr camerons aura of freshness and to resist the new tory generation mr brown will have to persuade the public that his politics is a more dynamic response to the problems britain will face in than mr camerons compassionate conservatism as a start he proposes to sack many older cabinet colleagues and replace them with bright young things ed balls ed miliband liam byrne james purnell and others he will say constantly that the first phase of new labour to is over and that a new agenda is needed but what exactly the challenge ahead of mr brown is immense but nobody knows that better than him it is no accident that all of his potential rivals for the top job have been politically destroyed he is as even mr blair would concede the most gifted political strategist of his times mr dancona is editor of the spectator
