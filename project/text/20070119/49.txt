insurers see a potential cure with enrollment lagging some firms support california health plan when californians tried and ultimately failed to pass a referendum requiring employers to provide health benefits to their workers the reaction of most of the states big health insurers ranged from skepticism to stony silence but since california gov arnold schwarzenegger proposed a sweeping plan last week to mandate universal health care in the countrys most populous state the industry has been quick to voice its qualified support despite some "worrisome provisions " executives at wellpoint inc said theyre willing to work with the governor speaking to analysts and investors yesterday unitedhealth group inc s chief executive stephen hemsley called the california plan "an interesting set of proposals that represent real opportunities for our business " the difference suggests how much the political momentum behind health care reform efforts has intensified in three years and how health insurers plan to cope or even benefit as the ranks of uninsured americans have swelled to nearly million a number of states have passed or are drafting similarly ambitious plans health insurers are wary of appearing obstructionist especially after several years of record profits the latest round of earnings reports suggest another reason for their new attitude though profits remain robust health insurers are struggling to expand their traditional business of selling insurance to employers yesterday unitedhealth kicked off the reporting season for fourth quarter earnings with net income of &# billion thats a increase from what it reported a year earlier though the company has said it may have to restate up to years of previous earnings because of the backdating of stock options but growth in medical plan enrollment in fell far short of unitedhealths original forecast of between one million and million new members this year the company expects to enroll roughly to new members in plans that employers finance themselves and pay unitedhealth to administer but it expects only new employer financed plan members in the first quarter compared with earlier projections of unitedhealth and other insurers have been falling short of their enrollment targets because the overall market isnt growing new areas of businesses such as the medicare drug benefit for senior citizens are fueling much of the new profit growth but as health care costs continue to soar more employers particularly small ones are giving up or reducing benefits and fewer consumers can afford to buy them on their own insurers like unitedhealth whove been reluctant to sacrifice profits to win new business have lost some accounts to smaller hungry regional insurers if successful the california proposal could expand the industrys market by four million to five million currently uninsured californians something health plans have been unable to do despite heavily marketing new products to some segments such as relatively healthy but uninsured twentysomethings because of its size california could galvanize universal health coverage initiatives in other states where many in and around health care see such reform experiments playing out at the federal level the debate over such reform has long been bogged down in political infighting and the special interests of various business lobbies but that could change as state initiatives gather steam particularly ahead of the presidential election under gov schwarzeneggers proposal employers and individuals would be required by law to buy coverage businesses that opt out would pay of their payrolls into a state insurance fund doctors and hospitals would contribute to of revenue to subsidize people who cant afford coverage on their own and to boost state medicaid payments to physicians "if we dont seize the opportunity here it will get worse still " said bruce bodaken chief executive of blue shield of california a not for profit insurer that competes against wellpoints blue cross unitedhealths pacificare and other rivals in the state "theres no question the plan broadens the opportunity for the industry to provide not only the basic products but others we think can benefit consumers and employers " insurers and their investors have had a more mixed reaction to some of the plans details including a provision that would put a tight leash on health plans profits and administrative costs by requiring them to spend cents of every dollar in premiums on health care most health insurers in california already spend at least of premiums on medical costs particularly its not for profit and private medicaid plans according to analyst estimates but a few particularly wellpoint the market leader spend less overall on employer and individual plans health insurance companies also wouldnt be able to deny people coverage based on their health problems age or line of work wellpoint shares fell on the day gov schwarzenegger unveiled his proposal while unitedhealths shares fell while skirting the details of gov schwarzeneggers plan unitedhealths mr hemsley yesterday voiced optimism that parts of it were still up for discussion and change "there may be some elements that go forward and i fully expect some elements will not " he said whats more some of the proposals provisions to reduce red tape could lower the insurers administrative costs making it easier to live with the restriction analysts say that traditional blues branded plans such as wellpoints which already sell heavily to small businesses and individuals stand to gain market share "its a different skill set not every insurer has that makes the plan an opportunity for them " said joe france a health insurance industry analyst at bank of america both wellpoint and unitedhealths shares have rebounded since last week other insurers caution against the industry trying to change or lobby away too much of the proposal "we believe it should hang together close to its current form " says mr bodaken of blue shield one of the few insurers to openly support previous california efforts to mandate universal coverage "its important going forward politically that there are no freeriders in paying for it once you start to cherrypick the plan it falls apart " dinah wisenberg brin contributed to this article
