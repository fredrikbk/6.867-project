weekend journal the drivers seat suzukis four wheel sport bike are our cars as much fun as our bikes " thats the question posed in a new commercial from suzuki part of a daring ad campaign that uses the japanese companys well regarded motorcycles to help move the metal on the four wheeled side of its business of course the answer is a resounding "no not even close " which shouldnt surprise anyone whos ever saddled up one of the companys sport bikes after all suzuki builds one of the fiercest production motorcycles money can buy the miles per hour hayabusa but after spending a week behind the wheel of the new for sx the query isnt nearly as laughable as it first seemed this small wagon is stylish and sporty enough to succeed in the econobox segment and its the first suzuki in over a decade that someone might buy for reasons other than price of course the price is still right the sx is the least expensive four wheel drive vehicle sold in the u s with a base sticker of &# including destination charge that suzuki is risking the infinitely better image of its motorcycle division by letting its gixxer and boulevard bikes co star in car ads speaks to the strength of its automotive business in the company had its best sales year ever in the u s cracking the mark in cars sold for the first time but the duo of dullards suzuki calls the forenza and reno rebadged models formerly known as daewoos that are conspicuously absent from the commercials accounted for nearly half of those sales as excited as suzuki is about the potential of new models like the sx and the seven passenger xl sport utility vehicle to capture buyers based on merit alone the company still needs to drive sales by emphasizing its low prices the sx competes in the tough and growing market for small inexpensive cars among the long list of contenders are the chevrolet aveo dodge caliber nissan versa and the standout of the segment hondas fit this bottom end of the car market has recently become much more difficult for consumers to navigate as some venerable models like the honda civic and nissan sentra have grown in size while new ones like the toyota yaris and kia rio have pushed entry level prices down to the &# range to further confuse things some of these cars are classified as compacts some as subcompacts and others fall in between on that note the epa considers the pound cylinder bentley continental gtc a subcompact based on its passenger and cargo volume go figure the standard content in some of these "cheap" cars such as antilock brakes power windows air conditioning and cd mp stereo systems would have been unthinkable a decade ago the base sx comes with all of the above plus six air bags a tire pressure monitoring system and alloy wheels among other equipment more interesting is its take on the functional "five door" hatchback design this small wagon body style is one of the coolest automotive trends going which is why even luxury car makers such as audi are using it to help the sx carve out its own identity suzuki is offering it with standard all wheel drive a feature whose desirability should be well understood by anyone whos recently visited the snowbound denver area the system offers three modes front wheel drive full time all wheel drive which automatically diverts more power to the rear wheels in slippery conditions and locked four wheel drive operation which is designed for driving under mph in snow or mud all wheel drive is a boon in inclement weather but it also can add quite a bit of sporting character to a fairly mundane front wheel drive car that it does in the sx though not quite up to the standard set by the front wheel drive fit the sxs five speed manual transmission is fun to shift in a retro kind of way but the fit offers an automatic with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters a rare and cool feature for a &# car the sx does have four wheel disc brakes not offered on the honda that the sx can even be mentioned in the same sentence as the fit is no small victory for suzuki as much as all this would seem to bode well for sales of the sx the car has its achilles heel and its a vulnerability as bad as they come despite being just slightly larger than the fit the suzuki has an epa combined mileage rating of just miles per gallon a whopping mpg lower than the hondas and a week of test driving produced just mpg over real world miles the automatic transmission version is also disappointing with an epa rating of mpg in the city mpg highway and mpg combined suzukis explanation for the low mileage is that the sxs transmission gearing is set up to provide the sort of powerful acceleration american drivers crave but were talking about a horsepower car the sx is as likely to win a stoplight drag race as you are to win time magazines person of the year suzuki says that for the model year the manual transmission equipped sx will have revised gearing that could eke out a improvement in fuel economy truth be told gearing and the added weight of the all wheel drive system certainly share some responsibility for keeping such a small car out of the plus mpg range thats common to this class but much of the blame has to lie in the power plant as the sxs liter four cylinder engine is far from state of the art if suzukis motorcycle engineers can drain plus horses from the hayabusas liter inline four perhaps they ought to have lunch with the car guys sometime contact us at driversseat wsj com owners manual heres how the suzuki sx compares with other new small five
