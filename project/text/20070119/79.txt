teed up health insurance gap surges as political issue democrats governors business push change but fixes vary widely suddenly the long festering issue of providing health coverage to the one in six americans who lack it seems to have leapt to the top of the national to do list on tuesday an unlikely coalition of the business roundtable aarp and the service employees international union called for "affordable quality health care for all " on wednesday pennsylvanias governor became the latest to offer a way to cover the uninsured in his state yesterday another strange bedfellows coalition ranging from a health insurers trade group to a liberal advocacy group unveiled a plan to subsidize health premiums with a mix of tax credits and federal spending and oregon sen ron wyden dusted off a plan to make people buy insurance with employers chipping in on tuesday president bush is expected to talk about his ideas for shrinking the ranks of the uninsured thrusting the long running issue to the fore are political and economic forces that have been building for years but are given new force by political events not only have the democrats taken over congress but state political leaders including republicans such as california gov arnold schwarzenegger are moving on their own to change the system and u s companies increasingly complain that the current employer paid insurance system puts some of them at a disadvantage either globally or vis a vis firms that wont provide insurance all this increases the chances that washington will try to tackle at least a piece of a health care problem that has only grown bigger since the clintons failure at comprehensive reform back in but it still doesnt necessarily mean anything big will happen at least nationally in the next couple of years the primary reason theres nothing approaching a consensus on what to do there is for sure a growing consensus that the rising number of americans without health coverage is a problem not just for them but also for employers and governments that pay the bills u s auto companies "are paying for the emergency room treatments of people who cant afford it " complains tom lasorda chief executive of daimlerchrysler ags chrysler unit "im paying for it because the rates go up because i have to cover the cost " but there is a splintering of approaches to the problem some favor bigger government others would bolster the decaying system of employer sponsored insurance still others would make health insurance more like car insurance and have people buy their own aided by various subsidies those who are optimistic that the recent talk portends action see a harmonic convergence of interests that suggests the latest round of news conferences and plans offered by coalitions will produce something tangible andrew stern president of the service employees international union or seiu says that when the clinton health initiative failed "business believed that they could somehow manage health costs and the economy was far less global " the world has changed "having had more years of increasing costs " he says "people realize that you cant manage this as a company we have to manage this as a country " the problem has long been apparent and is getting worse the number of americans without health insurance is growing and rising premiums have lessened employers willingness to provide it though a majority of americans still get insurance through the workplace a practice tracing to the s when businesses offered fringe benefits in lieu of higher wages the fraction of employees offered coverage at work fell to in from in at last tally the census bureau said of americans million in all lacked health insurance government programs medicare medicaid and the year old state childrens health insurance program pick up the elderly the disabled and the very poor nearly of the uninsured are in families with at least one full time worker in some cases the employer doesnt provide coverage in others the employee cant afford it or doesnt take the coverage that employers offer according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured a private foundation backed effort so by no means are the uninsured all poor more than a fifth live in families with incomes above &# and it would seem they or their employers can afford to pick up a part of the tab an important factor in making some of the proposals floating around feasible the heightened political focus on the issue reflects pressure from two sources one is voters anxieties both about the cost of care and about the risk of losing insurance for reasons such as changing jobs "a member of congress goes home and two issues come up every time you get together with folks one of them is iraq and one of them is health care " says sen wyden an oregon democrat "a lot of people who have coverage think theyre one rate hike away from losing their coverage " the other is an ever louder complaint from u s businesses that they cant compete in a global economy when companies from other countries dont have to pay for health care deere &amp co chief executive robert lane told congress last year that failure to act could result in a "limiting of covered services loss of employer provided health care and even a loss of american jobs both in the manufacturing and service sectors " the uninsured of course make up only one of the u s health care systems issues alongside quality and especially rapid rises in costs but confronting the uninsured problem is politically appealing and it seems not quite as intractable "dealing with cost is really hard it means leveling with the public it means telling people you cant have everything you want or your doctor wants " says paul ginsburg president of the center for studying health system change a foundation backed think tank in washington then theres raw partisan politics democrats believe they have the political wind at their backs and that one reason they do is public anxiety about health care republicans feel a need to respond and often look for approaches that rely less on government and more on market forces at the same time some proponents of free trade seek ways to ease workers anxieties about globalization so they might be less hostile to it recent initiatives at the state level reflect the public pressure for some kind of governmental action and at the same time increase the pressure for some federal action "legislators and governors are feeling pressure from small businesses " says katherine swartz a professor at the harvard school of public health she has another idea for dealing with the problem government subsidized reinsurance pools that might make it more affordable for employers to offer insurance ms swartz says that "nobody believes anything is going to come out of washington states are more willing to say lets try something " flush state budgets help a survey by the kaiser family foundation found that one third of states in all increased access to health coverage in often to low income children for the first time in four years no state restricted income eligibility in medicaid or in the state childrens health insurance program last year the then governor of massachusetts republican mitt romney helped by democratic sen edward kennedy cut a deal with democratic leaders of the states legislature it required state residents to obtain insurance created a state sponsored "connector" where they could go to buy it and required all but the very smallest employers to provide insurance or pay a penalty vermont and maine also have enacted universal coverage plans vermont aims to have of state residents insured by through a mix of subsidies and employer contributions plus a tobacco tax maines program aimed at insuring all by is grappling with inadequate funding fewer people enrolling than anticipated and lawsuits from business over the financing mechanism several other states are mulling ways to increase coverage for their residents some mix expanded government programs with mandates on individuals to purchase insurance along with subsidies for low income people new insurance pools to share risks and mandatory employer contributions last week california gov schwarzenegger outlined a plan that would make uninsured residents purchase insurance and require businesses with or more employees to either offer insurance or pay of their payroll into a fund for the uninsured the plan would levy new taxes on doctors and hospitals to help pay for the states estimated million uninsured a number that includes illegal immigrants on wednesday pennsylvanias democratic governor edward rendell became the latest recruit with a plan to cover his states nearly one million uninsured he stopped short of a massachusetts style mandate instead proposing to phase in a requirement that those with incomes above of the poverty level &# a year for a family of four purchase health insurance along with full time college and graduate students his proposal would also penalize employers that didnt offer insurance and would provide money to help individuals afford it as things stand mr rendell said "it is a tremendous deterrent for businesses that are considering locating in pennsylvania to know that in addition to paying for their own employees health coverage they will be subsidizing the costs of the uninsured" as hospitals charge them more to cover the free care the hospitals must give from the perspective of big companies the mandatory employer contribution programs at least level the playing field within the u s though they dont do much to ease the problem of competing globally in washington its far easier to get agreement on the goal "affordable quality health care for all" is the mantra than on the way to get there one camp almost entirely democrats sees the current turmoil and dissatisfaction with job linked insurance as hastening a single payer national system its an idea many democrats have pushed since the days of franklin roosevelt and harry truman sen kennedy head of the committee on health education labor and pensions is proposing to expand medicare beyond the elderly and disabled to all americans beginning with children and those aged to to many that still seems politically unrealistic especially given problems that canada and britain have run into with their national systems including long waits and rising costs but expanding the state childrens health insurance program which was created in to help states provide coverage to more low income children strikes some democrats as a feasible step in this direction another camp including some bush administration officials sees the turmoil and decay of job linked health insurance as a reason to go in a very different direction they would let individuals shop for health care much as they do for other things they would use tax breaks and vouchers to help people afford insurance preferably high deductible policies that prod citizens to make wise choices the government already is taking steps to make americans better consumers of health care to encourage people to be more cautious in using health care the bush administration is seeking ways to wean americans off generous schemes that pay for almost anything in their place it favors high deductible policies that cover the big expenses plus ways to let people pocket the savings if they avoid unnecessary treatment or shop for lower priced care health savings accounts are a way to do this offering tax breaks to people who take high deductible policies and allowing them to escape taxes on wages set aside for health care keeping the money if they dont spend it mr bush is expected to continue pushing in this direction among possible proposals ways to make the market for individually purchased insurance more efficient and encouragement to small businesses to help employees buy bare bones policies administration officials argue that current tax law imprudently encourages employers to provide unlimited amounts of health care to workers who arent taxed on that as income one possible change would be to limit that tax break and devote any revenue raised by the change to subsidizing coverage for lower income americans in a recent op ed piece in the wall street journal mr bush listed "affordable health care" among the biggest issues facing the american people a third camp borrowing from whats going on at the state level essentially would widen existing sources of health insurance government employers and individual policies so that they cover everyone such plans sometimes require that everyone get insurance penalize employers that dont offer it and subsidize coverage for people who cant easily afford it yet dont qualify for programs for the poor although state experimentation is in favor now one obstacle to state by state reform is a federal law the employee retirement income security act or erisa that limits states maneuvering room it has thwarted an attempt by maryland to force wal mart stores inc to offer health insurance to employees this week the fourth u s circuit court of appeals upheld an earlier decision that maryland had violated erisa legal experts said the decision could pose problems for states considering health care changes but suggested that it wouldnt cripple efforts in states like massachusetts where the overhaul is broad and not targeted at a single employer some veterans of health care battles past smile at the enthusiasm for tackling the problem recalling high profile news conferences of years past and proposals shredded by partisan politics or budget realities they say the most likely federal action is none of the above theres also likely to be a big debate over health care in the coming presidential campaign but mr stern the union leader thinks that view underestimates the current ground swell and unusual political opening "im not sure congress is yet recognizing the tidal wave that is building " he says "its the perfect time you have an evenly divided congress in democratic control and a presidency in republican control you have everyone lined up on the side of universal coverage " doing nothing is costly too says henry simmons president of the national coalition on health care a collection of companies and interest groups that has agitated for major health care change since "we can afford health care reform " he says "what we cannot afford is a continued failure to address the crisis in health care " kris maher contributed to
