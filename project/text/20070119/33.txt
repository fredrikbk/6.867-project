fda mulls birth control standards saying that pregnancy rates in studies of some newer lower dose birth control pills appear higher than with an older generation of the drugs federal regulators said they are reconsidering their standards for reviewing the widely used products the food and drug administration raised the issue in documents made public yesterday in advance of a meeting in which the agency will seek its advisors input for guidelines it is developing for reviews of new birth control pills the issue of what represents an acceptable failure rate was only one topic in an array of questions the agency is reviewing including how to make clinical trials more reflective of real world use the questions are important because drug makers are increasingly rolling out new oral contraceptives with various tweaks generally hormone doses have dropped over the years in an effort to reduce side effects such as blood clots the fdas standards will affect the prospects for future products among the products on the market now with low doses of estrogen are ortho tri cyclen lo from johnson &amp johnsons ortho mcneil unit barr pharmaceuticals inc s mircette and yaz from bayer ags berlex the fda document didnt say what particular pills had higher pregnancy rates in studies in the posted materials the agency said that in the s it set a limit on acceptable contraceptive failure rates in trials of birth control pills approving those only with rates less than per woman years of exposure under a measurement called the pearl index a woman year represents one year of a woman taking the drug but more recently the agency has approved some pills with failure rates of more than two per woman years within the fda the agency said there is disagreement about whether the agency should have a cutoff for acceptable failure rates the fda said that as the dosage of the hormones in the pills estrogen and progestin has dropped the number of pregnancies in trials even if the drug was being used correctly has apparently increased the agency said this shift was "consistent with less sustained ovulation suppression in newer products as compared to the earlier higher dose regimens " there may be other reasons the agency said fda officials said direct comparisons between different trials are of limited value because the studies vary and the older pills if tested in todays studies might have higher failure rates the variations "may not be statistically different " said scott monroe acting head of the agencys reproductive drugs division a spokeswoman for berlex said yaz had a pearl index of in a study and the company welcomes the meetings scientific exchange barr said it was interested in hearing the experts views an ortho mcneil spokeswoman said ortho tri cyclen los pearl index rate was in a study of more than women but measured a different way in the same study the drug was effective when used according to its label such results are "difficult to compare" between pills without head to head trials she said because of different study designs
