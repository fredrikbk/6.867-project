for two brothers colombias war is family affair guillermo is a guerrilla with a price on his head roberto is a peacemaker bogota colombia roberto and guillermo saenz were the youngest and middle of seven children born to conservative schoolteachers half a century ago as a war between the army and marxist guerrillas gathered force roberto recalls being sheltered by guillermo and his other siblings in a childhood full of "studying futbol and fiestas " then when roberto was entering the university and guillermo was nearing graduation guillermo broke some news "man i dont see any sense in all of this " roberto recalls his brother saying "im going " guillermo fled into the jungle to join the largest leftist guerrilla group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc eventually rising to the rank of "ideological leader" of the seven member ruling secretariat today hes one of the most wanted men in the americas with a price on his head of &# million from the colombian government and &# million from the u s roberto pursued a political career one that brought him to a quite different leadership position hes the designated peacemaker for the government of this capital city the municipal agency he heads the reconciliation network works in bogotas barrios promoting nonviolent solutions to social conflicts holding candlelight vigils and petition drives encouraging young people to express their opinions peaceably in graffiti art and rap music "our mission is showing that creative protest is more effective than picking up a gun " says roberto who is years old millions of colombian families find themselves divided by the countrys interminable conflict but few are at such odds as the saenz brothers while roberto collects signatures to put a disarmament referendum on the ballot guillermo faces criminal charges from the colombian government of blowing up pipelines and bombing villages while roberto manages a program to aid families of those kidnapped by the farc guillermo is charged with masterminding abductions while roberto uses politics sports and music to try keeping youths out of the orbit of violent drug traffickers guillermo faces a u s indictment alleging that he helped "set the farcs cocaine trafficking policies" and arranged the murder of hundreds of people who got in his way the indictment handed up in washington last march accused senior farc guerrillas of shipping cocaine valued at more than &# billion to the u s and other countries roberto says he tried without success to get guillermo to renounce violence in their last meeting back in when farc leaders left the jungle for peace talks with the government held in caracas venezuela "to my brother i say i hope youre in good health and dont have problems" roberto says "but to the guerrilla i say give up this war because its the wrong path " though roberto says he hasnt tried to contact guillermo since their meeting years ago he has found that having a rebel comandante in the family is a hard thing for an antiviolence activist to live down "even though in colombia nobody gets surprised by anything anymore " the newsweekly semana said last year robertos position "doesnt fail to attract attention " roberto believes his phones are tapped by intelligence operatives hoping for some clue that could lead them to guillermo who is generally referred to by colombians including roberto himself by his nom de guerre alfonso cano in revenge for abductions carried out by guillermo another saenz brother jose ricardo was kidnapped in by right wing paramilitaries which oppose the guerrillas and are involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities the kidnappers had intended to seize roberto he says but he had already left colombia for a diplomatic post in europe after getting death threats hoping to win his brothers release guillermo from hiding issued a statement saying jose ricardo a teacher had no links to the farc "my intense fraternal pain is mingled with the pain of many colombians wearied by similar or worse tragedies " guillermo wrote jose ricardo was freed after eight months in captivity the family drama doesnt seem to have shaken guillermos revolutionary fervor in position papers and interviews with colombian journalists over the years he has maintained that violence is justified because of inequities that are built into colombias economic and political systems "we guerrillas have been obliged to take up arms to find peace " guillermo once wrote "its the great contradiction and a terrible truth " roberto allows that while violence is one truth in colombia the country also has a peacemaking tradition that is often overlooked he and bogotas leftist mayor luis eduardo garzon set up the reconciliation network in to train people for making peace even as a military boot camp would train people for making war in classes the reconciliation network has started offering for community leaders there are lessons about colombias pacifist paez indians who once halted a firefight between guerrillas and rural police by walking into the no mans land carrying only ceremonial palm staffs in addition the network encourages activities such as golombiao a variation of soccer pioneered by other peace promoting groups with a scorekeeping system that weighs teamwork and respect for opponents as well as the number of goals put in the net teams must be coed and for it to count the first goal must be scored by a female player the network also helps run a protest and public information campaign to press conservative president alvaro uribe to swap farc prisoners held by the government for hostages held by the guerrillas deyanira ortiz whose husband an ex legislator was kidnapped by the farc five years ago and is still missing doesnt hold robertos brother against him "colombia is an odd place " mrs ortiz says "its possible for a single family to produce a soldier a priest and a guerrilla we all appreciate mr saenzs support " the networks staff of social workers from philosophy graduates to ex guerrillas who now renounce violence work on projects in rough neighborhoods like ciudad bolivar in paramilitary gangs murdered bolivar youths who violated their curfews and other directives "nice kids go to bed early " read the chilling paramilitary graffiti "and those that dont well put to bed " the networks man in the barrio jairo vargas worked with youths and community leaders on a campaign of marches late night parties held in defiance of curfews and painting sessions in which youths covered paramilitary graffiti with murals the number of youth killings in bolivar fell to just last year bolivar young people like year old jhon castro are enlisting in the nonviolent cause about a year ago jhons best friend was killed by paramilitaries but rather than seeking vengeance jhon says he channeled his anger into a network protest last september aimed at getting a local university to admit more poor youths who otherwise might be drawn to armed gangs the first couple of days no one noticed the demonstration involving scores of students then they brought in a rapper and a sound system "it was still a nonviolent protest just much louder " jhon says in no time the university dean came out to cut a deal expanding access to poor students guillermo however continues to cast a shadow over robertos peacemaking efforts with president uribe escalating the offensive against the guerrillas roberto has to deal with refugees streaming to bogota from war torn provinces like tolima the very operating area of the central bloc of the farc that guillermo helps command last month the army announced that it had killed a guerrilla fighter who had been guillermos chief bodyguard and was on the trail of the comandante himself roberto says both his parents died resigned to the path guillermo had taken and roberto himself holds out little hope for a late life conversion "hell likely die fighting " says roberto
