loaded up on &# billion in new debt between and the latest year for which data are available the represents households with net worths including primary residence of at least &# million economists say that debt number has probably continued to grow since because interest rates remain low by historical standards just as the rich control a disproportionate share of national wealth they also account for a disproportionate share of debt the richest now hold of the nations debt with a total of &# billion in borrowings up from in debt for this group grew faster than for any other group in the fed survey total debt held by the top increased between and compared with growth of about for those in the th to th percentile wealth range the rich in short have joined the great american borrowing binge call them the leveraged elite after buying up second and third and fourth homes and funding ever more lavish lifestyles todays risk friendly rich are embracing debt as a way to expand fortunes and fund increasingly acquisitive lives there are of course some differences in how the rich use their borrowed funds unlike many lower income americans who rely on credit cards and home equity and other loans to meet living costs the rich often use debt as a financial tool most of their debt is for mortgages on their primary or nonprimary residences according to the fed data they may have plenty of cash to pay for that &# million mansion but theyd rather keep the money in higher returning investments or businesses this "strategic debt" involves taking out a loan at say and investing the money in the financial markets for a return of say debt may be a necessity for the middle class but the wealthy are "making a sophisticated economic decision " says arthur kennickell an economist with the

to groups todays rich are more comfortable with risk in a world awash in cash many of todays wealthy made their fortunes by leveraging and making big bets with their businesses theyre applying the same principles to their personal wealth eric hadar owner of a new york private real estate investment firm borrows from u s trust for both his real estate business and his personal finances "real estate is really about leverage " he says "so i apply some of the same principles to my personal finances " whether its buying a house or other personal asset mr hadar first calculates whether a loan makes economic sense "its an arbitrage i wont just go out and borrow money to buy a boat because theres no economic justification for using debt for that " he says "but if i can make more than my borrowing costs from a loan ill consider it " for instance hes thinking about buying a jet for business and personal use and says he may borrow up to of the purchase price since the jet saves him time and adds value to his business he adds "my litmus test is if i cant pay it back in a worst case scenario i dont borrow " with some measures showing prices for high end goods outpacing the broader inflation rate the wealthy are increasingly looking beyond mortgages to use debt for buying beachfront homes yachts cars and other collectibles private bankers say loans for jets are among the most popular in fact some sociologists and economists say the rise in wealthy peoples debt stems in large part from the growing pressure among the elite to keep up with richer peers the biggest disparities in wealth today are among the rich with mere millionaires getting shoved aside by decamillionaires centimillionaires and billionaires so the haves are borrowing more to keep up with the have mores those in the th percentile to th percentile of wealth have almost twice as much debt as the top as measured against assets economists and wealth managers say its the single digit millionaires who are becoming the most stretched as they borrow to match the lifestyle of even wealthier people the result says dalton conley a sociologist at new york university who studies status is even more debt "what were seeing is the top struggling to keep up with the top th of " he adds "and those people trying to keep up with the top th of there is a drive by the merely rich to keep up with the obscenely rich
