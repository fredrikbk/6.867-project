its called the forbidden city for a reason latest web crusade threatens a starbucks inside chinese palace hong kong before going to sleep on thursday night last week rui chenggang wrote a post on his blog about an issue that had been bothering him for years a starbucks cafe sitting inside beijings hallowed forbidden city the year old tv news anchor wrote that starbucks "is really too inappropriate for the worlds impression of the forbidden city this isnt globalization this is the erosion of chinese culture " mr rui said he liked starbucks just not inside a national landmark in the space of a week mr ruis post has been viewed more than half a million times according to the blogs counter and his demand to shut the cafe has turned into a national cause journalists camp out in front of the tiny starbucks kiosk in a distant corner of the majestic year old home of chinas emperors whose english name refers to the exclusion of commoners now authorities at the forbidden city say they are deliberating whether to force starbucks to leave after six years "blogging is giving ordinary grassroots chinese people a chance to express themselves " mr rui says increasingly it is also giving companies a headache in a key market that is laden with unique cultural and business challenges china is home to million internet users second only to the u s and according to one government estimate there are million chinese bloggers of whom million write actively all of the spin control issues that have made blogging a problem for brands in america are only compounded in china "there is not a precedent for solving consumer grievances in china if you are not happy with what you buy you dont call up customer service " says scott kronick the president of wpp group plcs ogilvy public relations worldwide in china instead chinese consumers now mobilize and gain access to information not all necessarily accurate using the internet the chinese government strictly censors the internet for political content but generally doesnt restrict the sort of discussion mr ruis post spurred starbucks is only the latest example of a personal beef escalating into a national issue last april yum brands inc s kfc had to replace an ad that bloggers complained insulted students in june outrage among bloggers led to a class action lawsuit against dell inc after the company inserted the wrong processors in laptop computers that lawsuit was thrown out by a court in december and in september procter &amp gamble co faced an online uproar over its handling of concerns over trace metals in its pricey brand of sk ii cosmetics public anger in that case was less motivated by worries over product safety than by p&amp gs decision not to apologize to its customers and make speedy refunds chinese bloggers have even adopted a phrase for these online scandals men or "gate" a derivative of the american habit of appending " gate" to scandals ever since the watergate imbroglio an industry is developing both to help companies deal with these online crises and to take advantage of the internet space for marketing researchers dig up everything from the latest lingo "" means "go to h " to online only celebrities like two lip synching college students called the back dorm boys whom marketers turned into spokesmen for motorola inc and pepsico inc the starbucks case highlights what makes the chinese style of consumer blogging particularly challenging for companies the popularity of group bulletin boards and readers commentaries can quickly amplify the voice of a single blogger the kiosk first opened in to a storm of attention but the issue went away after starbucks took down some of the signs around the kiosk today starbucks is joined in the forbidden city by signs sponsored by american express co but mr rui hadnt forgotten about the cafe and decided to email starbucks corp s chief executive jim donald whom he says he had met on a panel at yale university and then blog about it "jim how are you doing " mr rui wrote according to an email mr rui posted on his blog "we talked about why starbucks should move its shop out of the forbidden city am curious to know if you have a plan to have it removed " a few days later he says he got an emailed response from mr donald and with his permission posted it to his blog "we have shown and continue to show our respect for local history culture and social customs and have made serious efforts to fit within the environment of the forbidden city " the email response on his blog reads the response just brought mr ruis blog more readers and more than posts so far authorities at the forbidden city museum declined to answer questions from the wall street journal and instead referred to comments they gave to the state owned xinhua news agency on wednesday according to that report the museum is reassigning the shops inside the imperial palace including starbucks as part of an overall face lift "whether or not starbucks remains depends on the entire design plan that will be released in the first half of the year " feng naien a museum spokesman told xinhua still the xinhua report indicates that government officials are heeding the online protesters "the museum is working with starbucks to find a solution by this june in response to the protests " mr feng said starbucks which hopes to someday turn china into its biggest market outside of the u s declined to answer questions about the incident but in a statement the company reiterated that it has operated "in a respectful manner that fits within the environment " the xinhua report noted that in authorities removed a kfc store from beihai park a scenic imperial garden north of the forbidden city after a local political advisory body objected at the forbidden city yesterday sun yu a year old visitor said "i dont think there should be any commercial operations in the forbidden city much less a starbucks " wei shanshan a year old tour guide who also thinks starbucks doesnt belong on the grounds added "some foreign tourists are curious to see a starbucks outlet in the forbidden city and ask me about it " even blog crisis advisers dont entirely agree on how companies should respond to bloggers in these cases "the best strategy is to monitor for these crises to catch them early before they get so big " says sam flemming the chief executive of shanghai based blogging consultancy cic which works for pepsi and nike inc "and then you should react quickly consumers feel like they should be listened to if they feel like theyre being ignored it makes things even worse " but what begins as a one on one conversation between a company and a blogger can quickly escalate online says tony ip the china general manager of wpp group plcs g relationship marketing "when bloggers have the chance to talk to the ceo of starbucks they will want to show their power then an individual consumers point of view can become a public agenda " roland soong author of the popular eastsouthwestnorth blog which charts greater chinas internet culture says companies real problem is that their methods of dealing with traditional media dont help them with bloggers "even when starbucks knows about this there isnt a thing they can do about it " he says "bloggers are writing for personal reasons " among the most prevalent of those is nationalism and the chinese in the past have been quick to jump on perceived transgressions against chinese culture or history in recent years they have helped to force off the air and the pages of newspapers ads from nike toyota motor corp and others that they felt offended national pride "nationalism defines the individual in china " says tom doctoroff the north asia ceo of wpp groups jwt ad agency while china may appear to be embracing some foreign traditions its a fine line "chinese people view celebrating christmas as a mark of progress but when you deal with the pride of the nation like the forbidden city in a disrespectful way it becomes much more dangerous " he says mr rui posted his remarks on his personal blog although as an anchor for china central television he works for the government mr rui says he is a regular starbucks customer and that his goal wasnt to whip up anti american sentiment "this became an issue because starbucks is a symbol of western popular culture " he says "the question is how do we absorb and embrace the western world without losing our own identity this is an issue that everybody is thinking about i just happened to write about it " zhou yang and sue feng in beijing and jane spencer in hong kong contributed to this article
