and supervisory board members at the frankfurt based company fear and in london yesterday london stock exchange plc took new steps to fight off a bid by nasdaq stock market inc saying it sees opportunities for deals with rival exchanges and promising to return as much as gbp million &# million to shareholders through a share buyback a move that could make it harder for the u s exchange to buy it lse chief executive clara furse said the london exchange continues to talk to a variety of partners about possible cooperation and more "strategic moves " she said in an interview "there is a world of opportunities beyond nasdaqs wholly inadequate offer " ms furse declined specifics but said the lse was in discussions with other parties that are similar to conversations she held with british broker icap plc last summer those talks were preliminary and never led to formal merger discussions the idea of a second bidder has been dismissed by most analysts while lse is desirable because trading across its electronic platform has exploded with the arrival of more active investors like hedge funds and london has become a favored destination for companies looking for a foreign listing it isnt clear who is in a position to be a major partner they say lse shares are trading at gbp almost higher than nasdaqs offer of gbp a share or about gbp billion total nasdaq said in a statement that the lses document added little that is new failed to provide a long term vision or take future competition seriously and offered a "marginal" return of capital nasdaq also brought forward its timetable slightly saying that after jan it wouldnt revise its offer unless a rival bidder emerges this move will put further pressure on lse shareholders as some might have hoped that nasdaq could increase its offer after this date if a new price was recommended by the lse nasdaq is hoping that some of the lses largest investors will put pressure on ms furse to talk rather than risk seeing the exchanges price collapse if nasdaq withdrew its offer and sold down its near stake in the lse exchanges across the world are looking to carve their place in the current round of

spokesman for deutsche boerse declined to comment he referred to mr francionis comments earlier this week at a banking congress in frankfurt where the ceo reiterated that the companys integrated business model should remain intact and that it was pursuing mainly an organic growth strategy many current executives dont support a breakup although mr francioni is considering a plan to legally separate one of the companys most capital intensive units clearstream the firms settlement and custody arm from the rest of the group separation would be a way to change the firms credit rating which could in turn free up capital for shareholders another person familiar with the matter said clearstream which makes money by processing share and bond trades and by taking legal responsibility for holding a customers securities or bonds needs a higher level of capital than the rest of the group to maintain its credit rating the moves follow similar moves by lse to re engineer its balance sheet other executives within deutsche boerse fear the potential changes in management structure could open the door for activist investors to force a breakup of the firm at a later point despite numerous potential regulatory and political hurdles analysts also are talking about a breakup particularly after a report by morgan stanley on jan which said that "more fundamental value creation could be
