high prices prod developed world to curb oil use big consumers register first drop in years crude retreats to &# mild winter weather has something to do with it so does heavy selling by financial funds but a largely overlooked factor in the recent plunge in oil prices may portend an end to the multiyear rise in crude for the first time in years the developed world is burning less of it fresh data from the international energy agency show oil consumption in the member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development fell in though the decline appears small it marks the first annual drop in more than years among the oecd countries which drain close to of the million barrels of oil used globally each day industrialized nations demand tiptoed into negative territory in but the dip was so slight that it registered as flat yesterday u s benchmark oil for february delivery settled at &# a barrel down &# or on the new york mercantile exchange earlier in the day futures fell below &# a barrel for the first time since may hitting a fresh month low after the energy department said u s crude oil stockpiles rose the most in more than four years oil has been sliding since peaking above &# in july this year prices have fallen the tipping point where oil prices begin to erode demand was reached last summer several industry analysts said the fall in oil use by the industrialized world is a sign that the reactions to higher oil prices by businesses and consumers from the u s to germany to japan may be adding up to a cycle turning downdraft in demand the resulting shift in global cash flows could mean a big boost for oil consumers economies at the expense of producers and exporters other signals both economic and psychological have been popping up for some time demand for gas guzzling sport utility vehicles has been falling while investment in and sales of alternative fuels such as ethanol are booming even the bush administration is vowing to reduce americas dependence on crude gasoline prices in the u s are also falling both because of swelling inventories and the slide in crude oil prices which can take four to eight weeks to fully pass down to retail pumps yesterday the aaa automobile club reported regular grade gasoline below &# a gallon in michigan and at &# a gallon in missouri and oklahoma the energy information administration of the energy department said the national average price of a gallon of gasoline was &# as of jan the national average may continue to fall in coming weeks the eia said in a weekly review published yesterday it said prices could get close to &# a gallon by the end of this month or early in february noting the possibility that the national average could fall below that level to be sure global oil demand grew in owing to steady growth in china and the middle east but that was down from growth of in and in and the price fluctuations highlight the role played by expectations rather than simple supply and demand in determining the price of oil on world markets many analysts are just starting to review and lower their price forecasts for this year though a fair number still expect crude to rebound to &# a barrel or even higher so do some investors who have placed big bets with their own money including texas oilman t boone pickens for some this stems in part from a belief that &# is the price the organization of petroleum exporting countries aims to defend though the cartels de facto leader saudi oil minister ali naimi seemed to cast doubt on that notion this week when he said he saw no reason to support further output cuts but a few analysts say oils four year surge could be ending "the bubble is bursting " said frederic lasserre head of commodity research at societe generale in paris "the sentiment has changed and for the first time since january the hedge funds are going short at the start of the year " news of the oil demand drop comes as the debate over how to curb energy consumption is reaching a fever pitch in the u s the worlds biggest oil consumer next week president bush is expected in his state of the union address to expand on a call he issued last year for the country to end its "addiction" to oil in congress bills are circulating to impose cap and trade programs which amount to putting a price on global warming emissions produced by the combustion of fossil fuels while this government debate goes on the oecd data suggest the market itself is having an effect when energy prices go up people consume less energy a lasting downdraft in oil prices would trigger a profound redistribution of wealth around the world putting more money in the pockets of consumers in the west and ending the bonanza enjoyed by oil company investors and by petro states such as venezuela and iran currencies of some bigger oil exporters including the mexican peso have faced downward pressure in line with falling oil prices airlines including british airways plc and cathay pacific airways ltd have begun removing fuel surcharges imposed on passengers nations with significant oil industries including saudi arabia russia and the u s the top three producers stand to take a hit to employment profit and tax receipts in their oil sectors the signs of waning demand for oil began bubbling up early last year saudi arabia began to quietly cut back its output in april because it couldnt find buyers for all its crude iran opecs second largest producer after saudi arabia was forced to store unsold oil in tankers last summer yet oil prices were sending contrary signals peaking on july at &# a barrel because of fears that geopolitics or natural disasters were bound to reduce supplies at the time supplies were perceived to be tight with little spare production capacity available globally to offset sudden losses since then oil prices have fallen by despite supply cuts by opec to shore up prices mr lasserres take on the situation is that prices of close to &# a barrel they averaged &# a barrel for marked a turning point "people wanted to know the point at which oil prices would affect demand now they have the answer " he said one factor that could insulate the world from a big price rebound paradoxically is opecs recent output cuts by trimming production the cartel has swelled the worlds volume of spare oil pumping capacity particularly in saudi arabia thus easing fears of a supply disruption in some part of the vast global oil chain in remarks to reporters in new delhi this week mr naimi said the kingdoms spare capacity cushion would expand to three million barrels a day by feb when the second round of output cuts agreed to by opec take effect that is a half million barrels a day more than is exported by iran whose nuclear research standoff with the u s has stirred jitters about supply disruptions in the persian gulf oil buyers are watching for signs of opecs next move some opec members such as venezuela and iran were clamoring for further production cuts though mr naimi shot down that idea this week some analysts see larger game changing forces in motion one is the rise of nonoil transport fuels "last year was a tipping point in a lot of ways " says philip verleger jr an oil economist who heads pk verleger llc "biofuels will take bigger and bigger bites out of petroleum demand " mr verleger said noting climate change and security concerns relating to the supply and use of petroleum "alternate fuels will take up all the growth leaving petroleum demand static in the next two or three years " forecasts by the iea suggest biofuels output could rise to the equivalent of more than five million barrels of crude oil a day by close to triple output of such fuels in global oil demand last year rose by barrels a day to million barrels a day the latest iea data show "virtually every day there is a new biofuels plant announced somewhere in the world " says lawrence eagles head of the ieas oil industry and markets division mr eagles said that in world output of biofuels was some barrels a day the equivalent of million barrels of conventional middle eastern crude oil biofuel output could rise to as much as million barrels a day or the equivalent of million barrels of conventional crude by if capacity expansion plans are taken into account according to data published yesterday by the iea oil demand last year fell in all three major oecd regions north america europe and the pacific the latter two regions have from time to time had weak oil demand when economic growth was weak but growth in u s oil demand had typically offset this weakness for the oecd as a whole but last year the picture changed more noticeably "maybe they started to use less when we hit &# a gallon gasoline " adam sieminski an oil analyst at deutsche bank said of u s consumers "perhaps toward the middle of we hit a tipping point " but mr sieminski questions whether people will forget the pain because oil prices have dropped and oil use will again start to increase
