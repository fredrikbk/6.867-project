weekend journal the finicky traveler bostons tale of two ritzes change in owners ends year era overnight a sibling with flaws by the time i arrived at the ritz carlton boston for one last ritz fizz it wasnt the ritz anymore in a changeover that erased three quarters of a century of tradition including the famed blue curacao and champagne cocktail invented in the bar the oldest ritz carlton in the u s was rechristened last week as the taj boston by its new owners taj hotels that makes it part of the sprawling mumbai india based tata group empire which bought the room hotel but not the rights to its name from millennium partners in november for &# million so the day after ritz carlton officially lowered the blue and white flag with the lions head logo the taj unfurled its white and gold banner at the year old beaux arts building at the edge of the citys elegant public garden the ritz carlton isnt giving up the fight for beantown it aims to lure guests across the park to the ritz carlton boston common a modern high rise also owned by millennium that opened in when the original closed for a yearlong renovation at least there wont be any more confusion about the two ritz names along with the swank recently renovated four seasons both the taj and the modern ritz carlton will be competing in a booming local market with new properties including a mandarin oriental and regent set to open later this year a hotel in the former charles street jail and the recently opened waterfront intercontinental boston and hip langham hotel formerly the parker meridien in the financial district hotels have been reflagged at a steady pace in recent years about properties or one in every six hotels have changed nameplates since according to industry tracker smith travel research though many of the swaps are at airport hotels or standard business chains a number have been high profile properties such as the san francisco park hyatt now a le meridien and los angeless century plaza hotel recently converted to a hyatt from a westin such changes can jar regular guests a few years ago i checked into my favorite seattle hotel four seasons olympic only to find it had just been transformed into a fairmont at the ritz carlton boston the changing of the guard made headlines across the globe from the times of indias "tatas go ritzy buy slice of boston history" to the boston heralds "taking off the ritz " the newer ritz part of a complex including a condo tower and a square foot sports club la hasnt won the hearts of local traditionalists boston globe columnist sam allis said it was "downright galling that the soulless place gets to keep the name " by coincidence my husband and i were staying at the ritz boston the day the sale was announced and since i had business in boston on the day the handover was to take place i decided to try the newer ritz for comparison the old one had been far from perfect once a fireplace flue broke down and sent smoke spewing through my room and my suite last november had frayed carpets and dingy upholstery and felt like a subway station shaken by an express train every time the elevator barreled through the old walls but the hotel had great charm and a traditional feel hard to find in modern hotels on the day of the taj announcement i had come down to breakfast in the light filled ground floor ritz cafe to find staff some of whom have been with the hotel for decades huddled and wondering what would become of them in years of staying at the hotel id come to appreciate their pride in the place and their tales of famous guests from winston churchill who visited after the war to tennessee williams who wrote part of "a streetcar named desire" in one of the suites according to company lore after delicious fresh fruit toast and scrambled eggs prepared exactly to order and served at a sunny banquette overlooking newbury street i bought a gift shop souvenir a red baseball cap with the ritz carlton boston logo about employees of some joined the new ritz carlton or transferred elsewhere in the empire since marriott corp has controlled the ritz carlton company but many longtime staffers accepted the taj offer to stay one night two months later with the hotel about occupied guests were quietly checked out of the ritz and into the taj and notified with an envelope under their door within hours the staff had erased most traces of the ritz and its famous lions head logo replacing towels bathrobes menus and napkins and hammering brass plates over plaques in the elevator housekeeping replaced bulgari toiletries with the molton brown brand for now though taj which also owns the pierre hotel in new york but mostly operates luxury properties in india asia and the middle east isnt planning any major changes general manager david gibbons says he will evaluate the need to "refresh redecorate and reconceptualize " sprucing up the rooms as necessary among other things he plans to upgrade the fitness center a rather dim place that he says "feels like some exercise machines in grandmas parlor " reopen the second floor dining room hire a new chef and refurbish the th floor club lounge reserved for guests who pay higher rates standard rooms are available currently at weeknight rates of about &# with suites ranging from &# to &# after current promotional suite rates expire rates here and at the surviving ritz vary with availability and dates as for my stay at the ritz boston common i found that refurbishments are definitely in order my one bedroom suite on a high floor was spacious and at &# about &# less than the comparable suite id stayed in at the former ritz boston but its sparse furnishings didnt offer much comfort and there were stains on the furniture and rug and clunky old tvs in cabinets the rooms and one bedroom suites are currently available online for weeknight stays from &# to &# the hotel has earmarked about &# million for renovations area general manager erwin schinnerl who moved over from the ritz boston promises flat screen tvs new bedding and fancier desks he also plans changes to the modern rather stark lobby and a small reception desk that makes privacy impossible but the desk will stay where it is so close to the front doors that i was shivering in a cold northeast wind while waiting to be checked in the generally helpful staff is trying hard to please when i got one heel of my brand new boots stuck in the elevator well and ripped off a big patch of leather trying to extract it they offered to find a cobbler i didnt have time for a full repair job so the front desk manager sent up a valet with black shoe polish to try to camouflage the damage friendly staff couldnt make up for the flaws at the hotel restaurant where i breakfasted with a colleague with large picture windows facing the street the new age themed ground floor space called jar ne like a "journey " the maitre d explained was even more frigid than the lobby our eggs came out undercooked they did bring out new eggs and took them off the bill and we had to flag down a waiter to get a cereal spoon mr schinnerl says the hotel is adding new banquet facilities is looking for ways to expand its dining and bar offerings and is planning to fix jar nes chill i had time just to look around the sports club which has an impressive lap pool with natural light and acres of exercise machines and class space a health food cafe and a fancy restaurant blu with free access for hotel guests its a definite draw for a return visit at one point i headed across the park to bid farewell to the old ritz you could still get a ritz fizz at the bar they wont be called that anymore but mr gibbons promises you can still get a blue drink i went into the gift shop to see if i could buy another ritz boston hat but they were sold out
