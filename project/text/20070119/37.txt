eu offers plans for accounting firms audit liability caps european union officials offered four proposals to cap the liability accounting firms potentially face when auditing public companies a move that could help a push by the biggest firms for similar protections in the u s the eu initiative came a day after u s treasury secretary henry paulson announced plans for a spring conference that will examine u s market competitiveness and in particular the issue of auditor liability winning a legal shield is a long sought goal of the biggest accounting firms which claim a major firm could soon be felled by an outsized court damages award so far the big four accounting firms pricewaterhousecoopers deloitte &amp touche ernst &amp young and kpmg have made more progress in europe in the united kingdom for example a recently adopted revision of company law allows accounting firms to negotiate liability caps with public companies so long as they are approved by shareholders and disclosed the publication of auditor liability proposals by charlie mccreevy commissioner for internal markets in the european unions executive arm would potentially extend protections across the eus member countries in publishing the proposals mr mccreevy opened a consultation period on the issue it is expected the eu could offer this year a nonbinding recommendation that member states adopt one or more of the suggestions while such a move in europe wont address the big fours u s liability concerns they feel it could bolster their arguments in washington "i think what europe does inevitably raises the issue in the states " said jeremy jennings global director of regulatory and government relations with ernst &amp young global in brussels "im sure there are those in the u s who have been watching what mccreevy is doing and think maybe this is an issue we should move on " adoption of a european auditor liability shield even if member countries werent required to enact it would potentially add to a sense that u s markets are increasingly at a competitive disadvantage to those in europe and in particular london however the big four face a tougher fight over protections in the u s because share ownership is far more widespread than in europe and because tort reform efforts likely would face stiff opposition from plaintiffs attorneys the four proposals published by the eu yesterday suggest a fixed monetary cap on damages that could be sought from auditors a cap based on a companys market value a cap based on a multiple of audit fees charged or the introduction of proportionate liability which would hold the auditor responsible for only those damages that could be specifically attributed to them ernst &amp youngs mr jennings said caps in particular an outright monetary limitation on damages could prove difficult in practice due to the widely differing sizes of accounting firms and companies in eu countries "proportionality is fine as far as it goes but it doesnt protect you against a catastrophic claim " he added the biggest firms "would probably want to see proportionality with some form of absolute limitation " adam cohen contributed to this article
