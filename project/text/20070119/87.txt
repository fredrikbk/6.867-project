the truth about rome adrian goldsworthys biography "caesar life of a colossus " published by last fall by yale university press may get a bump in sales this month through a stroke of serendipity the book is on store shelves just as hbos popular "rome" series has this week started its second season a former university lecturer who is now a full time writer mr goldsworthy years old appeared in five episodes of "time commanders " a tv game show broadcast on the bbc based on famous ancient battles "the idea was to present the historical background " he says "people watched with their grandchildren " the author has seen the entire first season of "rome " "its definitely fiction and theyve taken a lot of license " says mr goldsworthy who earned a doctorate in ancient history at st johns college oxford "the true story is better than the stuff they invented " mr goldsworthy who lives in wales spoke to the wall street journals jeffrey a trachtenberg by telephone the wall street journal online why does the roman republic continue to resonate when it seems to have benefited mostly the rich adrian goldsworthy for one thing we know quite a lot about it the founding fathers of the united states used rome as a model hence you have a senate the ancient greek and roman civilizations are held up as the epitome of western culture in caesars day everything had broken down but cicero talked about how great it used to be about the ideal republic there was a sense of rational educated men trying to create a perfect system and the roman republic did work for a quite a long time in the third century b c and much of the second century b c the republic benefited much of the community as the size of the state got larger and the number of people grew it increasingly became a system where the elite could manipulate the elections wsj com how would you summarize the life of a well born woman in ancient rome at times they seem like chess pieces swapped back and forth mr goldsworthy almost the frustrating thing is that we never have roman women speaking for themselves nothing survives in any significant length written by aristocratic women from that period we only see them in sources written by men its so easy to forget we have a tiny fraction of of the literature written in the ancient world this is the best documented period of roman history and we still have only a minute proportion of what once existed wsj com was it frustrating to have to use the word "probably" so often in the first third of your book when you discuss caesars first four decades mr goldsworthy absolutely but i wanted to be honest im trying to appeal to anyone who wants to know more about caesar but i also wanted to make it clear about what we know and what we dont know some of the sources were written down centuries after the events suetonius and plutarch caesars main biographers wrote around a d thats about years after caesars death and we dont know how well suetonius used the sources that existed when he wrote his book but which are now lost wsj com caesar as portrayed in the hbo series appears much like the man you describe generous ambitious calculating and brutal how would you judge their rendition mr goldsworthy i dont think they have a sense of his charm or charisma even his strongest critics such as cicero found caesar an incredible companion he could win over an army or a crowd and he was a lively person to have dinner with its very difficult to really get the power of his personality wsj com caesar sought a divorce after questions were raised regarding the fidelity of his wife pompeia but he himself appears to have been a serial adulterer what was the roman concept of sexual fidelity mr goldsworthy it was very much was one rule for men another for women in this case his marriage had probably failed and there werent any children women were allowed to keep property after divorce but it was usually their own property their dowries were effectively returned wsj com do you consider caesars "commentaries on the gallic war" factual reportage or press releases aimed at his backers in the senate mr goldsworthy they were intended for an immediate audience hes not writing for us for posterity hes writing for romans in rome he wants political support and to show that what hes done in gaul is heroic but also in the interest of the republic and that hes a servant of the republic so in a sense its like a press release it presents what he does in the most favorable way possible however many of his officers wrote to friends in rome all the time so caesar couldnt have invented things he could put a favorable spin on his work but his reports were basically factual wsj com caesar loved fine pearls but later made it illegal to have certain luxuries in rome what were his concerns mr goldsworthy we dont know all the details it seems to have been related to what people could serve at dinner various kinds of meats spices and flavorings you get a sense that soldiers were going into homes looking at the dinner table and removing things caesar didnt want luxury goods coming in at a time when there werent enough basic staples it may also have been a clumsy attempt at controlling the economy silks in particular were regulated because there was such a craving wsj com how do we know that he was assassinated on the ides of march the th of march b c mr goldsworthy we can be confident because caesar reformed the calendar it was the month of march as we understand it that date is correct but other information is lost for example we know he was born on july but we dont know the year because the first pages of suetonius and plutarchs accounts of his life are missing wsj com how does a historian make a familiar figure fresh and appealing mr goldsworthy the more you read of the different sources the more things start to join together and provide you with a rounded a picture you notice the significance of a random comment in one source that is picked up in another there arent many fictional characters that have done as much as caesar so in a sense the biography wrote itself the challenge is trying to explain his life to show what it meant what was unusual about it and what was normal sometimes historians of the ancient world forget how violent and disturbed the period was the higher you climbed up the ladder the more dangerous it became there was always the chance your career would end with your death write to jeffrey a trachtenberg at jeffrey trachtenberg wsj com
