the evening wrap palestinian calculus leaders from hamas and fatah will meet in syria this weekend in an attempt to close a gaping rift between the two most powerful palestinian factions and thus allow a suffering people access to international assistance trying to calm tensions that have led to terrifying public executions and other violence in the gaza strip palestinian president mahmoud abbas will travel to damascus tomorrow for negotiations with khaled mashaal the supreme leader of hamas hamas scored an unexpected electoral sweep last year leaving it in control of the palestinian government to the annoyance of western states who condemn its refusal to recognize israels right to exist and perceive it as little other than a terrorist organization the west responded to the vote by throwing up barriers to global aid that economically crippled the already impoverished palestinian territories mr abbas has been scrambling to put together some kind of unity government that would ease western concerns and thus open the taps but hamas views his efforts as subterfuge designed to strip them of their power and place mr abbass fatah party in sole charge sympathizers on both sides have battled in the streets adding another layer of turmoil to the restive region if the damascus talks fail mr abbas intends to demand new elections after a meeting today with european union foreign policy czar javier solana he said that his calling for a new vote "doesnt mean we want to throw hamas into the sea " hamas "has been elected and can be elected again " he said israel may be eager to see hamas take a swim however and the country has openly moved to strengthen mr abbass hand in recent days first israel unlocked &# million in frozen tax revenue israel collected the money for the palestinian authority under the terms of existing peace accords but it had suspended payments when hamas climbed to power in thawing out the funds israel bypassed the hamas controlled finance ministry transferring the money to mr abbas himself to be distributed for humanitarian aid but also to bulk up mr abbass security forces it then handed him even greater leverage when defense minister amir peretz today rescinded what had been a highly controversial decision to allow a new settlement to be constructed in the west bank but if the palestinian government is at an advanced stage of entropy the israeli government isnt precisely the picture of stability and coherence a far reaching report on israels battle with hezbollah forces in lebanon last summer and the israeli militarys failure to stifle the terrorist groups rocket attacks on israel is set to see the light of day soon critics claim israel moved too hastily that its intense aerial bombardment led to the deaths of too many civilians and that the failure to stamp out the threat from hezbollah has emboldened israels enemies in the region nearly israelis and more than lebanese died in the fighting but hezbollah has arguably been strengthened by surviving israels campaign already lt gen dan halutz israels army chief of staff has resigned and pressure for prime minister ehud olmert and mr peretz to follow him out the door is growing even if hamas and fatah iron out their differences it may do little to help save an embattled israeli administration once again stocks go sideways with the first full week of
