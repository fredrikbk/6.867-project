weekend journal review tv a superbly faithful jane charlotte brontes novel "jane eyre" has been filmed for the cinema or tv at least times since even in hindi and portuguese thats more often than her sister emilys "wuthering heights" or jane austens "pride and prejudice " the latest version of what might be called the ultimate chick flick comes to pbs masterpiece theatre as a miniseries sunday p m et this week and next but check local listings its far more beautiful than its predecessors thats a compliment and a relief considering its dark subjects of child brutality insanity and arson set in an age when the rollicking glories of georgian and regency england had given way to the dour oppressiveness of the early victorian era the compelling tale of a poor girl who finds love with riches on the side has not changed in this version however jane played by the pink cheeked ruth wilson is not the wounded sparrow we have seen before but a strong willed warm young woman thornfield hall where she comes to work as governess is appropriately dim and spooky yet many moments of the movie are flooded with sunlight in the beautiful derbyshire countryside all this helps make the newest "jane eyre" seem less gothic and more modern although it is far more faithful to the original novel than the bizarre version filmed by franco zeffirelli in that some may shudder to remember starred william hurt as the tormented edward rochester the latest in a line of tormented rochesters that includes orson welles and timothy dalton hes tortured here too by the burden of a crazy wife foisted on him by her scheming family in jamaica years earlier like all mr rochesters hes a grouch at first and our modern sensibilities initially recoil whats so attractive about a man whos always in a bad mood and who speaks to jane in the same bullying tone he uses toward his dog hes even snide and insulting to his little french ward and janes pupil adelle even so in the company of jane this mr rochester toby stephens the son of actress maggie smith begins to melt like no other before him for the first time in the filmed telling of this tale perhaps we watch a man grow worthy of janes affection and devotion of course he treats her badly by not telling her that he is already married until her happiness is smashed at the altar when she learns the secret of his marriage to a mad woman in the attic of his house reading the novel in decades past many of us accepted janes subsequent flight from this horrible revelation no one thought what the heck why doesnt he divorce his wife or why dont they live together that we dont ask that even now is a testament to the films power because the betrayal of trust seems so profound the period jane spends with the clergyman st john rivers and his two sisters features some of the most fascinating minutes in the film because these characters come to life as never before so it is that when jane is reunited with mr rochester we understand that it is not only she who has redeemed him but her love for him that has made her whole purists may recoil at the sight near the very end of jane lying atop mr rochester although they are both clothed on the whole though the new "jane eyre" may be the truest to the novel precisely because it brings closer to the surface the passion ms bronte herself only dared to hint at a second season of "extras" has just begun on hbo sundays p m and it is even more excruciating which in this case means better than last years series co writer and creator ricky gervais plays the hapless andy millman a hollywood extra who has now climbed up the ladder of success to star in his own bbc sitcom back in england but the ladder in his case is rickety indeed and true success eludes him in every way the sitcom called "when the whistle blows" and featuring a group of bored factory workers is excruciatingly bad the comedy mavens of the bbc have taken andys original vision and made it even worse forcing him to wear a ridiculous wig and to utter humiliatingly lame lines he wants to quit in protest but and this is the noble little tragedy at the center of the "extras" farce hes fallen for the notion that nobody gets ahead in show business or in life without enduring whatever pain and embarrassment is necessary to get to the next level in andys case though pain never brings gain it only brings more horrors this week it comes in the form of david bowie playing himself at a bar where andy is initially welcomed as a new celebrity worthy of a seat in the vip room never mind that his sitcom is a disaster among critics one of whom has described it as "a tv program that makes you want to gouge out your eyes rather than watch it one more minute " andys on tv and when he sits down next to david bowie he feels like hes arrived in the fast lane until mr bowie sits down at the piano and composes an ode to the new star that includes the lines "pathetic little fat man the clown that no one laughs at they all just wish hed die " as amusing as it is to see poor andy stagger from one social or professional debacle to another the guest celebrities who play themselves on "extras" are a special delight last week we had orlando bloom bragging about his appeal to women and displaying jealousy of johnny depp next week andy works on a movie with daniel radcliffe aka "harry potter " who plays himself as a cigarette smoking sex fiend at one point leering at the white haired diane rigg "you still got that cat suit from "the avengers " great stuff although beware much of it is not suitable for kids a quick word about "pros vs joes" spike tv thursdays p m each week three normal guys compete against famous athletes including this week former nfl wide receiver michael irvin slugger jose canseco and nba rebounder kevin willis the pros may be past their prime but watching wrestler randy couture casually twist the joes into pretzels is a reminder that the deck is stacked even so you cant help rooting for the plucky amateurs
