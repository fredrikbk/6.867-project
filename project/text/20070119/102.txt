weekend journal review theater melancholy farce it says much about the artistic health of broadway that none of anton chekhovs plays has been seen there since and that two decades have gone by since "the cherry orchard" was last produced there unless you count the russian language roadshow version that ran for a week and a half in so when bostons huntington theatre cast kate burton as madame ranevskaya in chekhovs last and greatest play i knew i had to go see it and her nowadays ms burton is best known as a tv star but she is also one of the finest stage actresses we have and in "the cherry orchard" she made an impression so strong and vibrant that i can still see her clearly in my minds eye a week after the fact chekhovs tale of a family of feckless aristocrats at the end of their financial rope is notoriously tricky to stage hes known to have disliked the first production directed by konstantin stanislavsky for the moscow art theater in claiming that its unrelievedly tragic tone was ill suited to what he meant as "a comedy in places even a vodevil " scholars generally translate that last word as "farce " which leads most english speaking playgoers to expect something altogether different from the elusive commingling of comedy and melancholy that is "the cherry orchard " like "the tempest" or "the rules of the game " chekhovs masterpiece is many things at once a story of class conflict a bittersweet meditation on middle age and its discontents a parable of the coming of modernity and a production in which any one of its aspects is overemphasized will dissolve into caricature the marxist reading of "the cherry orchard" as a snapshot of russia on the eve of much needed revolution was fashionable throughout much of the th century but has grown less stylish of late "you can never make a play this great about politics " says nicholas martin the huntingtons artistic director who has chosen instead to stress the comic side of "the cherry orchard " he gets his laughs and then some but the broadness of his straightforward staging which borders at times on slapsticky crudity seemed to me to veer rather too far in the opposite direction presumably the cast has followed his lead will lebow for instance plays lopakin the arriviste merchant who buys the country estate of the cash poor madame ranevskaya at plays end as a fawning pushy counter jumper with a brooklyn type accent some two dozen english language translations and adaptations of "the cherry orchard" have been published to date a sign of the plays wonderfully unresolvable ambiguity the trinity repertory company recently produced it in a brisked up new version by curt columbus and mr martin has commissioned yet another performing version this one by richard nelson whose "franks home" is about to open off broadway mr nelsons rendering is for the most part direct and serviceable but also flecked with such naggingly contemporary sounding phrases as "nice knowing you" and "who knew " mr martin is about to leave the huntington reportedly to spend more time on broadway where nathan lane is currently starring in his revival of "butley " in he collaborated with ms burton on a huntington production of "hedda gabler" that transferred to broadway and ran for performances not bad for a turn of the century classic now that "greys anatomy" has made ms burton a familiar face it seems likely that their "cherry orchard" will be considered for similar treatment and despite my reservations about mr martins staging id love to see that happen herself a woman of a certain age ms burton conveys with great delicacy the poignant implications of madame ranevskayas reluctant decision to let go of her beloved past and embrace an uncertain future "you can see what is true and what isnt " she tells trofimov enver gjokaj the earnest young student who urges her to sell her estate "i lost this gift and see nothing youre confident you know what one should do but tell me dear is that because youre young and because you havent yet suffered for anything youve done " i very much hope that new york audiences get to hear her give that speech washington "the cherry orchard" has been translated adapted rewritten and on occasion mauled by everyone from joshua logan to david mamet one of the best english language versions is by michael frayn who knows a thing or three about farce seeing as how hes the author of "noises off " the brilliantly calamitous backstage comedy that in recent years has become a staple of american regional theater i dont know if "noises off" is the funniest play ever written but its definitely the funniest play ive ever seen and washingtons arena stage has given it a perfect revival i mean it i cant think of a single way in which this production could possibly have been improved jonathan munby has set mr frayns impossibly complicated plot in motion with exquisite exactitude every one of the doors in alexander dodges set is slammed at precisely the right nanosecond and the nine actors who hurtle through the script at twice the speed of light never once make the laugh killing mistake of behaving as if the preposterous disasters that befall them are anything other than deadly serious if "noises off" doesnt make you hoot until youre purple in the face youd better check your ticket stub and make sure youre in the
