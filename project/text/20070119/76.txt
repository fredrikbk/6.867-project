rethinking rehab treatment for prisoners draws fire over scientology new mexico program divides states judges hubbards sauna purge albuquerque n m last november in a cedar sauna cranked up to degrees a crowd of sweaty men read books and chatted amid mariachi music they emerged to nibble from a tray of raw vegetables or take shots of olive oil this is not a spa this is second chance one of the countrys most unusual alternatives to the nations prison systems founded by a scientologist and former real estate developer and funded partly by federal tax dollars second chance is a treatment program for nonviolent prisoners with substance abuse problems it is based on principles of l ron hubbard founder of the scientology religion who argued that toxins from drugs and pesticides accumulate in the bodys fatty tissues making it difficult for addicts to kick their habit saunas and vitamins are intended to purge these residues facing few options for successful long term ways to treat criminal defendants with serious drug problems of new mexicos district judges have sentenced more than prisoners to terms at second chance even before it opened its doors to inmates last september second chance and its unconventional methods had ignited a controversy in new mexicos legal community at the center of the debate are two former friends and sometime adversaries william lang chief district judge in the area that includes albuquerque doesnt want his colleagues to sentence inmates to second chance on the other side is judge langs predecessor w john brennan who was hired by second chance to convince judges to do just that "theres a dire need for a secure residential facility for defendants with substance abuse problems " says district judge ross sanchez he has sent three inmates to second chance where the minimum stay is six months but judge lang says he is "highly suspicious" of the program "if it is connected to scientology just say so " he says second chance officials and a spokeswoman for the church of scientology say there are no ties for most of his year career mr brennan was a highly respected member of the legal community he and judge lang were close mr brennan presided over judge langs wedding years ago but the men had a falling out in when judge lang unsuccessfully attempted to gather enough votes from judges to unseat judge brennan then late one night in may judge brennan was arrested within four months he had resigned as judge and pleaded guilty to drunk driving and cocaine possession he was sentenced to a years probation judge lang assumed mr brennans post as chief judge of new mexicos second judicial district now a consultant for second chance mr brennan believes that judge lang is cool toward the program because of his personal grudges "i think it has to do with me " says mr brennan who lobbies judges to send convicts to second chance "i dont think it has to do with the program " he adds judge langs own battle with alcoholism makes him skeptical of unorthodox treatment programs judge lang who attends alcoholics anonymous meetings says personal grudges have nothing to do with his skepticism about second chance judge lang says he believes funding for treatment should go to existing programs that have a track record now the &# in federal funds granted to second chance is running out last month mr brennan appeared with one state representative before new mexicos legislative finance committee and asked for &# million for the program second chance is the brainchild of rick pendery a former real estate developer who says he has spent decades studying world religions with a focus on the writings of mr hubbard in mr pendery opened the first second chance program in ensenada mexico using his own money and funds from the mexican government his first attempts to open a program in the u s failed then in mr pendery gave a presentation on second chance to a conference of women legislators in san diego and took about of them to ensenada anna crook a republican state legislator from new mexico came away impressed she says ms crook asked new mexicos department of corrections to work with second chance to establish a pilot project the department declined because second chance isnt a "good fit " according to a spokeswoman undeterred ms crook says she then went to washington and secured &# for second chance from the appropriations bill with federal funds approved mr pendery says the "overwhelming majority" of the remaining &# needed to start second chance came from businessman randall suggs a scientologist who owns a stake in the arizona diamondbacks baseball team the state of new mexico later allocated &# mr suggs didnt return phone calls second chances next challenge was to persuade judges to send addicts convicted of either misdemeanors or felonies to the program in september mr pendery approached mr brennan who had recently returned from two months of rehabilitation at the betty ford center mr brennan wanted to get back into the criminal justice field but says he initially wasnt sure what scientology was after trying some of the second chance treatments himself mr brennan was sold and signed on "in the back of my mind i thought five years down the line if this works ill have some sort of public redemption " he says in august mr brennan was scheduled to make a presentation about second chance to a panel of new mexico criminal judges judge lang made his opposition clear "i suggested it would probably not be a good idea" for mr brennan to give the presentation says mr lang "the whole pall that the arrest cast over the court and the great cloud of suspicion had not completely lifted " ultimately mr brennan didnt make the presentation he says he was told judge lang didnt want him entering the courthouse an account judge lang disputes last summer judge lang cautioned many of new mexicos district judges and kari brandenburg district attorney for the second judicial district about the program he says ms brandenburg argues any kind of treatment however unusual is better than no treatment at all "we need to have an open mind " she says "if it doesnt work well get rid of it " the center received its first inmate in september currently about half of the inmates who are qualified to go to second chance ultimately go to the program mr brennan says still some judges are balking "im not ordering or sentencing anybody to that program at this time " said judge denise barela shepherd at a nov hearing where she sentenced a probation violator to prison instead in an interview ms shepherd said there isnt enough evidence for her to conclude the program works mr hubbards principles have been taken to prisons before for many years a program called criminon also based on mr hubbards teachings has operated drug intervention programs in jails but second chance represents the first time in the u s that an incarceration facility has been designed around mr hubbards methods which involve not just behavioral treatments but saunas and specific diets as well located on a tumbleweed strewn patch of desert second chances cement structure is ringed by a chain link fence topped with barbed wire inside linoleum hallways give way to an open dormitory a nearby room houses the sauna which is used by every inmate for a four week period five hours a day inmates eat organic beef they choose from an array of vitamins to ingest including potassium pills if theyre feeling dizzy or bioplasma pills to offset salt depletion inmates addicted to heroin can get a massage called a "nerve assist " from another inmate scientologists believe nerve assists help drugs depart the body in addition to saunas and specific diets second chance focuses on helping inmates communicate more effectively on the belief that better communication skills will reduce offenders need to act out in negative ways one recent morning vincent gutierrez years old who has been in and out of jail for drug use since age sat with a group of other inmates working on a series of communication drills that are also based on techniques developed by mr hubbard one drill called bull baiting is designed to help participants learn how to tolerate verbal assaults mr gutierrez stared into the eyes of another inmate stationed three feet away as his partner yelled scripted statements at him like "you look like a frog " mr gutierrez was supposed to remain impassive another drill has inmates sit opposite each other look each other in the eye and read lines from lewis carrolls alice in wonderland mr gutierrez says the drills have helped him "figure it out the positive way instead of using my knuckles " mr pendery says that by addressing the root causes of drug abuse his program reduces the number of inmates who return to jail after being released he says a study shows that the second chance program in ensenada resulted in a drop in recidivism rates to from over a six year period the mexico program recently closed its doors after losing its government funding he says advocates say second chance also saves money because it doesnt require maximum security guards and doesnt administer pharmaceutical drugs it costs about &# a day for one inmate in the second chance program compared with about &# a day for an inmate at the county jail bill miller an addiction expert and a retired professor of psychiatry at the university of new mexico reviewed second chance at the request of the city of albuquerque "theres a lot of use of sauna with the idea that you sweat out toxins in the system i dont know of any scientific basis for that " he says "it wasnt clear to me what sort of scientific basis there was even for the conception of the program to begin with " does it work "basically we just dont know " he says
