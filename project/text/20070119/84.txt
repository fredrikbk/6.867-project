the daily fix with trip to miami on the line theres tension in four cities the conference championships are on the line sunday the new orleans saints will face the bears in chicago for the nfc title after which the new england patriots take on the colts in indianapolis for the afc crown winners go to super bowl xli losers go home the saints have arrived in chicago bearing the hopes of a battered region on their shoulders an inevitable storyline thats spawned an equally inevitable backlash not to mention the usual pressures of being cinderella playing on the road and enduring their own history which doesnt exactly bear evidence of higher powers looking out for them the bears they have to deal with their more immediate legacy off field issues and pretty shaky football in the chicago tribune rick morrissey psychoanalyzes da bears "heres how the bears see the world three quarters of the earths population will be rooting for the feel good new orleans saints in the nfc championship game sunday the other quarter will be doubting the bears " mr morrissey writes that "if an x ray of the teams collective brain could be taken it would show that the we dont get any respect lobe is seriously enlarged but i dont want to get too scientific the truth is the bears up and down play this season and nothing else has brought on that lack of respect its not as if some agitator crop dusted the country with the idea " in the chicago sun times jay mariotti notes the oddity of the bears playing fairy tale ogre "i can make a case that they have more fans than any team in american pro sports based on the nfls resounding popularity the global sprawl of chicagoans the gradual demise of the dallas cowboys and the fact many people outside new york view the yankees as toxic waste " he writes "most road trips find stadiums airports and hotels filled with bears folks and if the boys do reach super bowl xli miami will be inundated with so much cholesterol and so many neighborhood accents that sexy south beach might have to uproot yet the bears arent the story this week " the new orleans times picayunes chris rose in chicago for sundays game finds his emotions running high "i am here by the fortunes of my employment talk about perks but i can think of tens of thousands of people in and around south louisiana and mississippi who have bled more for this cause paid more money and more dues lived and died laughed and cried suffered and celebrated for so long all for the love of the sorriest franchise in sports history win or lose and almost always lose " he writes "and now this this charlie brown finally gets to kick the football my story is your story our story months of sorrow regret rage blame and anger looking for a channel to release and i am ready to blow my fingers are numb my eyes are bloodshot and my breath smells like chicory and onions my heart is a broken fleur de lis just learning how to bloom again " what more can be said about the latest showdown between peyton mannings colts and tom bradys patriots consider the history the pats beat the colts in s afc championship game a year later it was worse indy was sent home on the short end of a score in the indianapolis star bob kravitz serves as the voice for indianapoliss fears "he is the giant blue elephant in the room " he writes "the one wearing no the one with all the tv commercials nobody wants to talk about the giant blue elephant specifically nobody wants to commit the blasphemous act of considering the possibility that peyton manning is not a postseason quarterback that he is lacking as a big game player going all the way back to his college days cmon admit it youre wondering whether manning is going to crumble sunday " too harsh well mr manning hasnt exactly lit up the board this postseason either going from touchdown passes and nine interceptions during the regular season to one td and five picks "what we are waiting for and waiting for and waiting for is that moment of postseason magic that defines a career " mr kravitz writes "were waiting for mannings version of the drive or a bloodless joe montana style march downfield in the fading seconds were waiting for that unforgettable ethereal postseason moment that lasts forever a signature moment on his career maybe that happens sunday maybe he does something in this the biggest game of his life that makes all those whispers fade to silence maybe " one difference adam vinatieri whose kicking heroics for the pats should ensure hell never again have to buy a beer north of hartford is now a colt he was of in the regular season and is for in the postseason including all five scores last week as the colts beat the baltimore ravens "this will be the third time theyve met in the postseason in the last four years and the first time the colts havent had to dread the sight of vinatieri trotting onto the field to jam more points down their gullets " writes john powers in the boston globe adding that "this time vinatieris foot literally is inside the other shoe its a reverse image an odd through the looking glass sensation everything the colts once hated about the mild mannered man from yankton s d primarily his damnable consistency is now everything they love " mr vinatieris replacement in new england is stephen gostkowski whos been just fine so far for in the regular season for in the postseason but "so far" isnt sunday is mr gostkowski ready the washington posts sally jenkins cant tell you because the pats were keeping their kicker hidden away as one employee told her "you wont find him with a gps system " "an nfl kicker is a vulnerable subconscious with a big toe attached " ms jenkins writes adding that "gostkowskis locker has been the subject of mind wrenching attempts at telekinesis ever since some boston reporters spotted a bottle of pepto bismol in it a couple of weeks ago for some reason possibly a rookie mistake gostkowski left the bottle plainly visible in his locker the vivid pink liquid was like a homing beacon attracting all sorts of attention and leading to speculation that the pressure was getting to the kid how could it not gostkowski is a year old fourth round draft pick out of memphis yet he has been thrust in the position of replacing one of the greatest clutch kickers of all time in vinatieri whom he will face on the opposing sideline sunday " lets end with something completely different an appreciation of bowling by los angeles times scribe bill plaschke "bowling is the only professional sports event that smells like your first nice pair of shoes and feels like one of your first birthday parties " he writes good line but what the fix really liked was his surprising encounter with one of the contenders at a professional bowlers association event "hey how you doing i enjoy your work " says tony reyes leaving his lane sticking out his hand startling me reyes is one of the tours top money winners he is in the middle of a qualifying game he needs a bunch of strikes to advance to the next round its like kobe bryant running off the court to make small talk with a fan during a fourth quarter comeback "should you really be talking to people in the middle of the competition " i ask "why not " reyes says "shouldnt you be like over there holding your ball and stressing out " i ask "nah " he says "its just a game " tip of
