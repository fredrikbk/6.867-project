weekend journal schools turn down the heat on homework some affluent districts limit the workload a minute cutoff some of the nations most competitive schools are changing their homework policies limiting the amount of work assigned by teachers or eliminating it altogether in lower grades there is also an effort by some schools to change the type of homework being assigned and curtail highly repetitive drudge work the moves are largely at elite schools in affluent areas including the lower school at westminster schools in atlanta gunn high school in palo alto calif harvard westlake in los angeles and riverdale country day school in new york city the effort is by no means universal and in fact some national statistics show that the amount of homework is continuing to grow still the new policies at such schools are significant because moves by institutions of this caliber are closely watched by educators and often followed seventeen year old jacob simon endorses the new approach when he gets home from school he usually watches sports on tv but the senior at gunn high school isnt slacking off hes taking five advanced placement courses this year including calculus and physics whats changed is his schools efforts to in the words of one of its teachers "make the homework assignments worthy of our students time " mr simon says "its nice to be able to relax a little " last fall the greenville s c school district reduced the amount of time students had to spend on assignments each night the school district also limited how much homework could count toward a final grade this academic year sparhawk a private school in amesbury mass eliminated homework up to second grade delayed it for third grade until january and enacted time restraints for fourth through sixth grades getting rid of busywork is the focus at wellesley high school in wellesley mass which banished midterm exams this school year and for the first time juniors will spend days in history class writing a required thesis which they previously wrote at home the change will free up students evenings and will also ensure theyre doing the work correctly says social studies director diane hemond several new books and studies have documented the negative effects of too much homework and found no corresponding improvement in academic performance "theres been a sea change " says marilee jones dean of admissions at the massachusetts institute of technology who adds that a growing number of the more than schools she visits a year are addressing the issues of stress including homework stressed out students a stanford university program is working with schools across the country to help find ways to reduce pressure some other schools have asked for help "homework is a key component " says sos director denise pope dave deggeller mr simons math teacher at gunn high school has started giving students fewer problems for homework if he sees overlap in the exercises he now occasionally allows them to choose which problems to review and rather than assign all "drill and kill" problems he mixes in exercises that "force students to think at a higher level " harvard westlake an independent middle and high school in los angeles now has a three hour per course per week limit and gives out anonymous surveys every semester to gauge the workload english teacher larry weber says the revised policy might mean minutes a night of "jane eyre" instead of minutes which has resulted in fewer books assigned per course "wed much rather have them read slowly and more in depth " he says the hopkins school in new haven conn has had ongoing discussions with teachers to encourage them to think more carefully about the kind of homework they give "if five problems help students understand a concept then dont assign " says assistant head of school john roberts theres little disagreement over making sure the homework assigned is effective still some school administrators say teachers can have a hard time paring it down especially those who have higher level ap classes and think the students need to learn too much to squeeze into class time many schools have started requiring teachers to hold weekly meetings to coordinate assignments so students arent overwhelmed at her old school in merrimac mass year old sammi marden had up to three hours of homework a night "i felt really overwhelmed because we didnt learn any of that stuff at school so i didnt know what to do at home " she says when her mom sue marden switched her to sparhawk which recently cut homework at its lower school sammi says she stopped crying so much "now i have more time to play " sparhawks program coordinator for the lower school bethany nelson cites several reasons for the new policy research showing homework doesnt help elementary school kids learn the tendency for parents to help so much that students dont get the organizational practice that is the one real benefit of homework and the stress and conflict it creates during the increasingly fewer hours families have to spend together the university school in the cleveland area held parent coffees last week in part to discuss stress and homework the upper school of episcopal academy in marion and devon pa is considering new guidelines for how much work each course should have the national cathedral school an independent school for girls in washington d c is reviewing its curriculum and doing a time study that tracks how much homework students are doing to be sure plenty of schools have added homework over the years thanks to increased ap classes or more state mandated tests a survey by the university of michigan the most recent national comprehensive study showed that american students aged to spent nearly four hours on homework a week or just under minutes per weekday thats up over riverdale in new york is taking steps to address the steady increase the school recently set a limit of no more than minutes of homework in each subject area for the upper school if kids arent finished after that time theyre to stop working kent kildahl head of the upper school says the school wanted to help reduce pressure and ensure students led a balanced life leaving more room for activities like sports or music "homework is important but it should not be overwhelming " he said in a letter to parents in the fall mr kildahl says the experiment is working but there are kinks not everyone works at the same pace and teachers estimates of minutes of work can vary in addition kids tend to focus on upcoming tests and end up working longer hours students may have a hard time taking advantage of the relaxed standards needham mass high school senior ariana wermer colan approves of the recent "reduced homework" vacation this past winter break and the planned "no homework" vacation for april break but she spent a lot of time studying over this christmas break anyway "its too competitive not to " says ms wermer colan who has applied to colleges including yale brown cornell and the university of pennsylvania and spends anywhere from six to eight hours on sundays doing homework the movement is being fed in part by a growing debate both academic and popular over homework and how children spend their time two books out last year "the homework myth why our kids get too much of a bad thing " by alfie kohn and "the case against homework how homework is hurting our children and what we can do about it " by sara bennett and nancy kalish argue homework can even impair young kids ability to learn in october the american academy of pediatrics released a report saying federal programs like the no child left behind act of as well as parents who push children too hard and put too much emphasis on schoolwork have resulted in too little unstructured playtime which helps in emotional development ongoing research by harris cooper professor of psychology and neuroscience at duke university suggests a small amount of homework may help elementary school students develop study habits and skills that improve with practice like reading beyond that he says hes found little or no relationship between homework and achievement and while at home studies are more important for older kids he says after a certain point about minutes a night for junior high students and between and minutes for high school students the benefits of homework diminish current national pta and national education association guidelines say that for children in kindergarten through second grade homework is more effective when it does not exceed to minutes each day children in grades three to six can handle to minutes a day it says and in junior and senior high the amount of homework varies by subject the disagreement on how much homework is too much isnt new in the th century homework involved a lot of memorizing and recitation a backlash rose by the late s along with fears that not only was homework an ineffective learning tool but also it hurt children even physically many schools started to specify that any extra work was to be done at school under teacher supervision the pendulum swung again in the age of sputnik after the russians went into space schools increased the workload as americans worried their children might be behind other countries the movement shifted to less homework in the s and back again when u s test scores paled in comparison to japan in the s u s students continue to lag behind many countries academically a report released by the paris based organization for economic cooperation and development looked at test scores for year olds in countries u s students ranked th in math and problem solving and rd in science but most education experts say more homework isnt the solution the problem is that current classroom standards are too broad for one u s science textbooks cover more concepts than those in countries where students perform better on science tests "if we could make the concepts more focused then the homework could be more focused " says nancy butler songer professor of science education and learning technologies at the university of michigan ann arbor "just doing more isnt helping students understand concepts in a deep way " some surveys have shown the amount of homework assigned often doesnt correspond to academic achievement the third international study of mathematics and sciences by dr david p baker and dr gerald k letendre at penn state university which collected a large amount of data from schools in nations shows that many countries with the highest scoring students such as japan the czech republic and denmark have teachers who give little homework countries with very low average scores like thailand greece and iran have teachers who assign a great deal of homework even the most elite schools in asia dont pile on the homework the way the elite schools in the u s do says mr letendre in japan many high achieving schools banned homework altogether in the mid s still many students say their schools have no interest in easing the homework load james song a sophomore at henry m jackson high school in mill creek wash has three hours or more of homework a night his classes include ap calculus ap chemistry ap world history and honors english several times a month he skips sleeping to study for exams but he doesnt bother bringing up the issue "we know our school will respond with a who cares youre in high school now kind of answer " he says the schools principal terry cheshire says he hasnt heard many complaints about stress and homework however when students have concerns he says "we try to make adjustments " even schools that try to limit homework get complaints nuriel moghavem did notice a drop off in physics homework at harvard westlake after he and other students checked a box on a school survey this past fall indicating the course was taking more than the allotted three hours a week but the year old senior says he still has up to five hours of work some nights on top of going to track practices working at the school newspaper and participating in student government theres one advantage he says "ive learned good time management skills " less homework higher scores a new paper has found that world wide students with more homework often have lower math scores below data from for the u s plus countries with the
