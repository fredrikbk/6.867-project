weekend journal tastings a second look at first growths we revisit bordeaux to see if age becomes them the lafite conflict of after we wrote about the first growth bordeaux last year we thought they were outstanding and would age beautifully for a long time our editor said to us "have you thought about going back to the very first first growths you reviewed for your column the s to see if theyre meeting your expectations " we know its always dangerous to pay too much attention to your bosss whims but in this case we let him twist our arms his real question after all was a more basic one how well do wines age and how can you tell when they are at their peak we are asked those questions quite literally every day just a couple of weeks ago we received these two questions within an hour of each other "is there a rule of thumb for determining the peak year for drinking a wine based on the vintage year " and "i found out over the weekend that wine can reach a peak and then start to turn is this true " first its important to remember that most wines are meant for immediate consumption and even many wines designed for aging will only improve for a few years that doesnt mean they will soon turn to vinegar only that they will lose fruit and charm over the years and eventually hopefully a long time out become rather blah wines one of the great continuing debates in the world of wine during the past couple of decades has concerned the tension between winemakers in some regions who still make their wines in traditional ways that require very long aging and their counterparts who make wine thats more approachable sooner wine geeks can talk endlessly about the good old days when say barolo took decades to reach its peak and when drinking it too soon could cause hair to grow on your chest and make you growl now some vintners make it in a somewhat easier to drink style which satisfies those who prefer a simpler less complex version that doesnt require many years of patience traditionalists are of course outraged about this trend in their view its heresy to strip the potential from these wines of noble heritage just to satisfy philistines who crave instant gratification when wine critics write about fine wines that are meant to age fine bordeaux top notch california cabernet sauvignon outstanding white burgundies great german riesling sweet sauternes for instance they tend to say something like "best in years " but thats just a guess based in part on some history with the region the grape types the winerys previous bottlings and the growing season still nobody really knows when a wine will reach its peak it depends on many factors including not just the vintage or the kind of wine but the individual bottle and the conditions in which it was stored it also depends on the consumer one person might consider a wine at its peak when another thinks it could still use a year or two and another thinks its slightly over the hill especially when it comes to older wines with their nuances and complexities "peak" is very much a matter of opinion all that said its always worthwhile to try to taste fine wines at their peak because age does magical things to wine giving it a kind of depth and wisdom that nothing else can provide age tends to integrate the various components and heighten the whole delivering to the drinker an exalted expression of the grape the terroir and the winemakers vision much as we love all kinds of wine nothing makes the angels sing for us quite like tasting a wine that has been well aged and is truly showing all of its multifaceted beauty we tasted the first growths chateaux haut brion lafite rothschild latour margaux mouton rothschild when they were released in we thought they were excellent but we disagreed so thoroughly about them that we provided two indexes for that column with johns favorites and dotties favorites listed separately more than eight years later those five wines are still widely available at good wine stores though the prices have increased of course when we bought them in the five cost us &# this time we found that a fair representative price for the five was &# while thats certainly higher a gain of over more than eight years should give some pause to those who think theyll make a fortune investing in wine we bought our wines from a good store where the wines are well kept in cellar conditions anytime youre buying older wines this is important we didnt go back and read our separate tasting indexes from because we wanted to taste these with as much of a blank slate as possible we were also curious of course about which of our indexes has held up better hey were an old married couple and we do tend to argue about everything we didnt taste the wines blind instead as always with the first growths we drank the five on successive nights over several hours both with and without food to give these wines every opportunity to show their stuff we were surprisingly unimpressed with three of them we found the latour haut brion and especially the mouton rothschild ready to drink now and perfectly fine but lacking the kind of intensity wed expect from a first growth from a fine year these wines now are more than years old but thats still pretty young for fine expensive bordeaux from a good year they should not only still taste vibrant but should grow and change and offer new and unexpected tastes with each new sip as they open and warm these didnt if you own any of these wed urge you to try one soon and see what you think if you dont own one we wouldnt recommend buying one while some fine wines go through whats called a dumb period when theyre simply not showing their best these were well past that and simply arent aging well the lafite rothschild was outstanding elegant and structured though we would have expected a bit more drama ultimately though it was the margaux that really proved our point about the vagaries of aging when we tasted it we enjoyed it but it lacked depth it had marvelous tastes of minerals and was lovely to drink right now but didnt offer much complexity worse in a couple of hours it broke down into component parts alcohol fruit oak and such which isnt a good sign for the future we gave it a wistful rating of very good which at that point made the lafite our best of tasting we expected more from the margaux so we thought it would make a worthwhile experiment to try a second bottle we bought one from a different merchant and bingo this bottle was outstanding intense with tight rich fruit terrific acids and remarkable structure whats more it was still young interesting and classy until the final sip this is a bottle wed keep for at least another decade all in all though it was an expensive experiment with the happy outcome far from certain there was nothing wrong with the first bottle it wasnt corked and didnt taste like it had been abused and given our many years of experience with the merchant wed doubt that anyway it just didnt age as well as the second bottle you can never tell and thats one of the enchanting qualities of wine the mystery of each bottle the fact that each wine has its own personality its own history its own future thats the wonder of fine wine when our tasting was over we went back to check on our notes from johns ultimate list was margaux haut brion latour lafite and mouton dotties was lafite margaux latour haut brion and mouton in other words before we re tasted the margaux and still had lafite on top dotties list from anticipated our favorites more than eight years later even more interesting was how similar her notes turned out to be in she wrote of the mouton "this looked and smelled wonderful but the fruit seemed weak " thats exactly how we felt this time she also felt that the haut brion didnt have enough fruit to age well and she was right on target unfortunately she will be impossible to live with for a while as part of our tasting we also bought a small selection of less prized s to see how they are holding up we generally found that they are ready to drink we were especially charmed by our old friend chateau gruaud larose which is really lovely right now big and rich with chocolate covered raspberries dark earth and a little touch of mint it generally costs around &# where its available and if you happen to see it grab it remember in wine there are no guarantees but if you are able to experience a wine of some age that sings to you perhaps you have caught it at its peak a truly wondrous moment it is a quest well worth pursuing look for our wine notes column in the pursuits section of the journals weekend edition every saturday we answer questions from readers if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state the dow jones first growth index to determine how well the first growth bordeaux wines of are aging we tasted each over several hours with and without food these are listed in order of our preference these deserve elegant yet simple food such as a great steak the prices listed appear to be generally representative but prices are all over the map on these for instance we bought two bottles of the margaux from nearby stores and paid &# for one and &# for the other vineyard chateau margaux margaux price &# rating delicious tasters comments intense structured blackberry fruit still young and tight minerals sandalwood and all sorts of layers "this really sticks to all the right places " dottie said which isnt classic wine speak but gives a sense of the sensual pleasure of the wine a genuine first growth experience tasted twice the first bottle wasnt as good vineyard chateau lafite rothschild pauillac price &# rating delicious tasters comments great nose of cedar black cherries earth oak and even some black olives serious earthy wine with a dark hardness about it and some tight tannins that explode in the back of the mouth classy and elegant vineyard chateau latour pauillac price &# rating good very good tasters comments deep and dark with good earth and nice acidity but lacking intensity so it finishes slightly watery and simple with too much alcohol quite a surprise vineyard chateau haut brion pessac leognan price &# rating good tasters comments very pretty with sparkling highlights smells dusty with raspberry fruit tastes at first of lively young raspberry fruit but it gets tired very quickly soft and friendly but lacking backbone and structure vineyard chateau mouton rothschild pauillac price &# rating good tasters comments dark color with a lovely rich fruit nose but the taste is more dust and class than fruit nicely made but it seems like it never had enough fruit to go the distance drink up note wines are rated on a scale that ranges yech ok good very good delicious and delicious these are the prices we paid at wine stores in new york we paid &# for lafite &# for latour and &# for mouton but these prices appear to be more representative prices vary widely
