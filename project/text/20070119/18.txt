bernanke raises prospect of debt spiral warning could bolster attempts to overhaul entitlement programs washington federal reserve chairman ben bernanke warned that rising health care and social security spending could create a "vicious cycle" of rising debt and interest payments and an eventual fiscal crisis though mr bernanke lacks the stature of his predecessor alan greenspan his strong language coupled with what appears to be a growing respect for his views from lawmakers in both parties could add impetus to efforts to overhaul entitlement programs principally social security medicare and medicaid they currently amount to almost half of federal noninterest spending and of gross domestic product or the value of all goods and services produced in a nation the congressional budget office assuming no change in the programs extension of mr bushs tax cuts and continued moderate growth in health care spending projects that will rise to of spending and of gdp by mr bernankes advice delivered at a hearing of the senate budget committee yesterday comes days before president bushs state of the union address and weeks before his budget request in the first six years of his presidency mr bush expanded medicare significantly while cutting taxes repeatedly he is seeking to preserve those tax cuts in the face of a democratic controlled congress while seeking through treasury secretary henry paulson to revive an overhaul of social security since taking office last year mr bernanke has met extensively with members of both parties and the outreach appears to be paying off budget committee chairman sen kent conrad of north dakota yesterday thanked mr bernanke for insights he provided over lunch a few weeks ago "youve sent a very clear message and one that i hope people are paying close attention to " mr conrad said the panels senior republican judd gregg of new hampshire called mr bernankes testimony "a clarion call " the bipartisan praise also reflects the fact that mr bernankes diagnosis was generally uncontroversial while that protects the feds reputation for political independence it may limit mr bernankes impact on the fiscal debate mr greenspan was influential in part because he made specific recommendations such as the passage of tax cuts in democrats often cited his support for paygo a budget rule meant to keep tax cuts and new entitlement programs from boosting the deficit in making it a key plank in their fiscal platform mr bernanke steered clear of specifics on entitlement overhaul in his testimony and anything that could be construed as criticism of president bush for whom mr bernanke previously served as an adviser despite senators praise it is unclear whether his advice will have much direct impact the fed chief noted that last years budget deficit spending and revenue were as shares of gdp close to averages that have prevailed since that is a point the white house often makes to deflect charges that its tax cuts have led to dangerously large deficits mr bernanke said this was the "calm before the storm " spending on social security medicare and medicaid are about to ramp up he said as the population ages while breaking no new ground mr bernankes testimony was notable for its emphasis on the consequences of a rising national debt the sum of all annual budget deficits rather than the annual deficit alone the debt he noted would reach almost of gdp by according to the congressional budget office a level previously reached only during world war ii the annual interest on that debt would be of gdp triple the current level "a vicious cycle may develop in which large deficits lead to rapid growth in debt and interest payments which in turn adds to subsequent deficits " he said similar "debt spirals" have contributed to financial crises in other countries a subject mr bernanke studied as an academic "ultimately this expansion of debt would spark a fiscal crisis which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases or both " he said mr bernanke didnt predict as more pessimistic analysts have that such a crisis would entail sharply higher interest rates or a sharply weaker dollar still he noted higher debts would divert capital from growth enhancing investments and funnel more of americans income to foreign bondholders this will "have an effect on the vibrancy efficiency and growth rate of our economy which will be palpable " he said mr bernanke took office promising to be less outspoken on fiscal policy than mr greenspan in his initial appearances before congress he irritated some legislators by refusing to comment on specific topics yesterdays appearance suggests he has refined his approach asked a year ago about restoring paygo he said the fed chairman "should not be involved in making specific recommendations about congresss internal decision making process " asked the same question yesterday he said "i dont really have the expertise to advise on those types of rules " see related letter "letters to the editor the debt spiral" wsj jan see related letter "letters to the editor avoiding fiscal ruin" wsj jan
