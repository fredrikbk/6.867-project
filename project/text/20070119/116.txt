weekend journal the year of the pigskin as sports leagues extend their global reach the nfl is tackling china one kicker at a time alan paul on importing a bone crushing game to a ping pong nation shanghai how many chinese academics does it take to explain american football to their countrymen eleven so far while u s football fans will spend the weekend watching two teams advance to super bowl xli the national football league is quietly laying the groundwork for domination of a different sort eyeing a toehold in a key growth market the nfl is plotting its expansion into china the league spent much of last year holding tryouts and training camps to find two chinese kickers qualified to attempt field goals on a pro squad next summer the country will host its first nfl game when the seattle seahawks and new england patriots meet for an exhibition game dubbed the china bowl in beijings workers stadium and to help the public make sense of the game they call "olive ball " the nfl has supported the efforts of academics who have created a page "american football encyclopedia " "when you dont understand the rules it just looks like big men running around wrestling " says china born kevin mo who lives in maryland and headed up the encyclopedia project "but once you know the game it begins to come into focus the strategizing and simulated war aspect is really attractive to a chinese perspective " the nfls efforts reflect the internationalization of sports as leagues around the world seek to profit from crossover success last week in a renewed effort to spark u s interest in soccer britains david beckham signed one of the richest deals in sports history to play with the los angeles galaxy and the nfl nearly two decades after bringing football to europe said this week it will hold its first regular season game there next year in london for international leagues china is a key growth market the u s may generate a tidy &# billion in pro and amateur sports revenues per year but china has five times the population major league baseball included china as a key player in last years inaugural world baseball classic the national basketball association already has a robust china operation with tv revenues and jersey sales revealing a population interested in more than yao ming the homegrown stars jersey is the no seller in china the nba says behind those of tracy mcgrady and allen iverson moving a sport across national boundaries is always a challenge its simple enough for foreign leagues to drum up temporary interest with exhibitions and clinics says paul swangard managing director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon creating long term significance is a different deal "you cant be like the circus odd and different and worth a one time visit to the stadium " he says the bar may be particularly high for bringing a bone crushing contact sport to a land where ping pong gymnastics and diving are king while basketball has been played in china for decades and even baseball gained a toehold in part from its inclusion in the olympics football is a new curiosity "its always difficult to sell something thats not deeply embedded in the culture " says major league soccer commissioner don garber who used to run the nfls international operations the nfl started its activities there in when it helped introduce flag football programs for a few thousand kids in five cities state channels began broadcasting weekly nfl games only this year taped in the wee hours tuesday even super bowl broadcasts have been spotty after national television stopped showing the big game after the scandal of the offending footage wasnt so much janet jacksons "wardrobe malfunction" at halftime but an introductory video montage that included an image from the tiananmen square massacre the league believes the country represents one of its best hopes "china is one of our six priority markets " says mark waller senior vice president of nfl international who explains the league is looking for short term growth in mexico and canada and medium term growth in the u k and germany china and japan it says are long range investments one crucial piece of the nfl puzzle was coming together or perhaps not recently at the shanghai sports stadium where a dozen young athletes were vying for a chance to become an olive ball hero the nfls plan within a year it hoped it would identify and train two kickers who would suit up for the aug exhibition between the seahawks and patriots take the field and with pound lugs closing fast kick a field goal or extra point after identifying mostly college age soccer and rugby players zou marketing a shanghai group working with the nfl brought them to camps in beijing and shanghai with no suitable goalposts in china zou had two sets built to nfl specs for &# two officials from nfl europe tony allen and richard kent oversaw the camps most of the athletes handled a football for the first time they balanced the pigskins on tees took a few steps back and then muffed kicks shanking balls to the left squibbing them to the right and occasionally sending one in the direction of the uprights "im used to working with soccer and rugby players " says mr allen the director of international player and football development "but they usually have watched the game and know what the ball looks like the chinese kickers didnt " the coaches identified five finalists who traveled last fall to cologne germany for an nfl europe minicamp where players from countries competed for roster spots the kickers progressed from wearing shorts and booting balls off tees to donning helmets and working with long snappers and holders finally they kicked in a game situation with defenders bearing down "that was a little scary but quite satisfying when we succeeded " says gao wei a stocky year old converted goalie from shanghai institute of physical education home of chinas national badminton and table tennis associations "its an opportunity to be a historic person in china " he said through an interpreter mr gao and the three others a fifth hopeful dropped out with a knee injury are preparing to go to eugene ore for two more months of training weightlifting and english lessons if all goes to plan kickers will play the spring season with nfl europe teams then theyll be assigned to the seahawks and patriots and train with those squads teams will be under no obligation to use the players in the china bowl but mr allen is optimistic the kickers will have the skill to hit short field goals their challenge he says will be dealing with game time pressure "one step at a time " he says china also stands to gain in addition to the pride that is sure to accompany the first made in china field goal the nfl says the august exhibition game will be broadcast on u s television it will also end two days of celebrations marking the one year countdown to the xxix olympic games in the battle to explain football to the chinese one of the front line soldiers is mr mo the encyclopedist born in wuhan the year old now works as a research engineer for the washington d c based national association of home builders he caught pittsburgh steelers fever while he was studying architecture at carnegie mellon university he says and became excited when the nfl announced in it was launching a chinese language web site but when he visited it he found mistranslated names overly literal translations and little understanding of the game "everything was wrong " he says he contacted shanghais zou marketing which ran the site and offered his suggestions then mr mo decided there might be demand for a book introducing the game to a chinese audience he posted a notice on a web site seeking help and put together a team of other authors all chinese born academics in the u s most were ph ds in fields such as architecture chemical engineering and biotech the collaborators posted their passages online and honed them with communal input for position names they adapted soccer terminology such as defender midfielder and forward some concepts were conveyed more literally than in english with "punt" rendered as "give up and kick it back " others played up the games military shadings a sacked quarterback became a captured commander in chief "we went through fierce debates over some terms " says mr mo who has also provided color commentary for super bowl broadcasts on chinese tv "we had to settle by vote it was good that we had people " a chinese publisher is set to release the encyclopedia this summer before the china bowl the nfl has already released a shorter pamphlet version in china this isnt the nfls first foreign venture of course in the st louis cardinals and san diego chargers played the first foreign exhibition game in tokyo seven years later the cardinals and chicago bears squared off in a preseason game at londons wembley stadium the first nfl competition on european soil in the early s nfl owners supported a "world league of american football " with teams in the u s canada spain england and germany the league now known as "nfl europa " currently has five teams in germany and a sixth in amsterdam so far the nfl and other u s leagues represent a tiny share of chinas sports pie when chinas women competed in the gold medal volleyball game of the olympics of chinas tv owning households tuned in according to state run cctv sports channel chinas world cup soccer match against brazil reached by comparison the highest rated nba game on cctv this year reached of tv owning households or about million viewers the nfls high water mark has been one million viewers or about of the market broadcasts of chinese basketball and soccer teams typically marked by a lower level of play modest marketing and in some cases scandal plagued referees tend to draw fewer viewers still regardless of the nfls long term prospects in china for now the finalists in the kicker stakes are living the dream mr gao considered a leading candidate to win a china bowl spot is now on leave from school earning &# a month from the nfl his expenses and world travel are paid many of his friends are jealous he says his family however is a bit worried "my mother was curious about the sport so she watched it one week " says mr gao "she found it quite savage " jon
