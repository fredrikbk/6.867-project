the daily fix the world not quite upside down unranked duke tops boston college online edition boston college was ranked no duke wasnt ranked at all the first time the blue devils had fallen out of the top in the last years and dukes mike krzyzewski was in danger of getting his first ever five game losing streak as a th birthday present perhaps the shock of a college hoops world that had apparently turned upside down inspired duke which used a solid half court defense and points from josh mcroberts to beat the acc leading eagles in the boston globe jackie macmullan notes that bc forward jared dudley only got five field goal attempts all night he made four of them which tells you why duke put practically the whole floor on him "forget all that talk about the duke blue devils and their mediocre acc record and the fact that for the first time in more than a decade they are an unranked basketball team " ms macmullan writes "they are still a proud group of athletes who are tired of struggling tired of being criticized for failing to hold up the lofty standards of their hallowed school last night they took out their frustrations on the eagles in general and dudley in particular " before last nights game caulton tudor of the raleigh news and observer sought to reassure fans of the blue devils that yes the team will get an invite to march madness some of his reasons are basketball related duke isnt this bad and "krzyzewski will think of something " but one of those reasons will get duke haters blood boiling "win or lose duke is good for business as in television business the ncaa understands that so does cbs few teams in the country ignite more positive or negative passion than krzyzewski and his players there is no j j redick christian laettner bobby hurley or jason williams on this team for fans to love or love to hate but the name on the front of dukes jerseys carries more fuel than the names on the back even if the blue devils were a no or regional seed they would hang up a handsome ratings number " in the winston salem journal john delong chose valentines day to pen a love letter to dukes conference "my first torrid love affair came in grade school and it was with acc basketball " he writes "i can tell you the specific night it hit me it was dec the night duke beat ohio state in double overtime at st john arena in columbus i was a kid growing up in southern ohio and an ohio state fan through and through i had never heard of duke i didnt know what the atlantic coast conference was or who was in it but there was something magical about that duke team " tim hardaway was known for his candor as a member of the miami heat now hes taking the heat for that candor on a miami radio show yesterday miami herald columnist dan le batard asked mr hardaway how hed deal with a gay teammate a question sparked by last weeks disclosure by retired player john amaechi that he is gay mr hardaway said he wouldnt want a gay player on his team and would distance himself from such a player then he spoke his mind "you know i hate gay people so i let it be known i dont like gay people and i dont like to be around gay people i am homophobic i dont like it it shouldnt be in the world or in the united states " in his herald column mr le batard quotes mr amaechis powerhouse response "finally someone who is honest it is ridiculous absurd petty bigoted and shows a lack of empathy that is gargantuan and unfathomable but it is honest and it illustrates the problem better than any of the fuzzy language other people have used so far " "youve heard the fuzzy language " mr le batard writes "lebron james said hed have trouble trusting a gay teammate wide receiver andre johnson said he wouldnt want to share a shower with a gay teammate philadelphia er shavlik randolph said hed be fine as long as said player didnt bring your gayness on me hardaway always blunt turned mere discomfort into transparent hate talking in a way that was shocking to hear and now you know why amaechi is the first in the history of his sport thats a lot of players folks ever to announce he is gay " mr hardaway later said he was sorry and he shouldnt have said what he said though he didnt back away from his comments in fact he later told a tv station that he wouldnt talk to a family member who turned out to be gay nba commissioner david stern for his part has removed him from further nba related appearances the furor over mr hardaways remarks which the fix imagines is only just building puts the discussion of mr amaechis disclosure in new light a number of nba stars said last week that a gay teammate wouldnt be a big deal and dallas mavericks owner mark cuban said being the nbas first openly gay player would be the marketing opportunity of a lifetime such comments made those who doubted that the nba or american sports fans were really ready for an opening gay player look like pessimists now the doubters look more like realists on cbs sportsline ray ratto praised mr cuban for "fighting the good fight " but warned that "america isnt as open minded as it likes to think it is and the first one out is the one who will pay full retail for his or her courage maybe the second one cashes in or the third or the th we are also a society that can get used to societal changes albeit at a hideously glacial pace but the first one is falling on the grenade to save the platoon" espn coms jeff pearlman was even more skeptical citing a word hes heard over and over again in locker rooms of nearly every sport hes covered as a sportswriter floyd landiss positive test for synthetic testosterone was just the crowning scandal for cycling but there are efforts to repair the sports image among them what the riders for team slipstream endure blood tests and urine tests a year "antidoping scientists say the program is the new paradigm in the fight against doping because it tries to close loopholes in the current system " juliet macur writes in the new york times "cycling is not alone among major sports in trying to stem its doping problems but none of them use programs as aggressive as this one instead of relying on drug tests or police investigations this method tries to weed out those who use performance enhancing drugs by catching them before they win a trophy or wear a race leaders yellow jersey " but as ms macur writes proving a team is clean is expensive perhaps too expensive is jim caple of espn com happy that baseballs back well he wrote the sport a letter "i love you for the anticipation i feel opening a new waxpack of baseball cards even though i know i will get another ryan franklin instead of an albert pujols " he writes "i love you for the paperback copy of ball four worn and tattered from annual readings i love you for the home run roy hobbs hits into the light towers the durham bulls discussing candlesticks and rooster sacrifice on the mound and the black sox walking out of the cornfield i love you for whos on first and charlie brown and the chorus of centerfield i love you for babe ruth calling his shot or not and lou gehrig saying he was the luckiest man on the face of the earth i love you for bobby thomson leaping onto home plate with both feet after a foot home run and willie mays catching a foot fly ball with his back to the field " the fix will take that as a yes
