mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i leave my external hard drives turned on and plug them into my laptop when necessary i use one hard drive to run my manual backup and the other to hold copies of information i want to access but not regularly i understand that any hard drive has mechanical components am i reducing the life of my hard drives by leaving them running most of the time my wife says i should turn them on only when i need to use them a i agree with your wife hard disks dont wear out quickly or easily so running them all the time when you use them constantly or frequently isnt fatal but in your usage scenario theres simply no need to keep your external hard disks on all the time since you are using them only once in a while for specified manual tasks by doing so you are putting unnecessary wear on them and wasting energy it takes only seconds for them to turn on and become ready for use q is there a program for the mac that would limit a childs use of the computer to a specified amount of time per day for example a parent could permit one hour a day a yes there is its called mac minder and can be obtained at www lumacode com macminder it costs &# but theres a day free trial it allows you to set time limits specific to each child and you can limit overall computer time or set different time limits for types of programs a child uses for instance you might allow one hour daily for games but two hours for email you can even set up elaborate schedules governing how long a kid can use certain kinds of programs during particular hours each day for instance a half hour of games between and weeknights but two hours during the days on weekends the program also allows parents to view a time log of the childs activities i havent tested this program so i cant say how well it works q i need a new computer but dont want the new windows vista operating system instead i wish to retain windows xp as my operating system is it possible to buy a vista equipped computer and then reformat the hard drive and install windows xp instead a sure but you will need a full new boxed copy of windows xp not an upgrade version or the version that came with your old computer or a version that has already been "activated" on another machine and that may be hard to find also even if you dont want vistas new graphics or other features be aware that your machine will be less secure because you will lose some of the new security protections that vista provides which are absent in xp you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
