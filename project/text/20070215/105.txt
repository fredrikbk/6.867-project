wal marts radio tracked inventory hits static wal mart stores inc s next leap forward in ultra efficient distribution is showing signs of fizzling a pioneer in low cost practices widely copied by competitors wal mart has pushed its suppliers to use exotic radio activated tags to chop labor and inventory costs anew but tests using the tags arent showing any savings and suppliers forced to invest in the relatively expensive technology are grumbling wal mart once hoped to have up to of its roughly distribution centers using the radio frequency identification or rfid technology by january but so far it has installed the technology at just five plus stores wal mart expects to add a further stores this year the worlds largest retailer needs another breakthrough in its logistics operations the main driver of its pricing advantage while its costs are still the industrys lowest rivals such as target corp and cvs corp are catching up wal marts operating costs have risen sharply in recent years blunting its edge expenses rose to an estimated of sales in nearly two percentage points higher than in in contrast expenses at target and cvs rose less than one percentage point each from to to and respectively wal mart declined to make an executive available to comment on its rfid efforts in response to questions about whether it was saving money with the technology spokesman kevin gardner replied that the tags had improved product availability on store shelves and store managers worked more efficiently in replenishing inventories "we look for our rfid expansion to build on these results " mr gardner wrote in an email manufacturers and retailers have long wanted an efficient way to track individual items from production to sale and rfid seemed ideal for the task rfid was to replace the year old bar code technology printed on labels for everything from tubes of toothpaste to diamond rings the bar codes help track inventory and can match a product to a price but they lack the electronic tags ability to store more detailed information such as the serial number of a product the location of the factory that made it and when it was made and when it was sold while the tagging of individual products is still years away wal mart began setting deadlines in for its suppliers to start using rfid tags on larger shipments since then it has required its largest suppliers to affix the smart tags to cases and pallets sent to texas and oklahoma which have been the companys key test bed an additional suppliers soon will be added to the mandate when the technology works as envisioned product data are transmitted from the computer chip inside the tag to electronic readers through radio waves products can be scanned remotely and in bulk quantities while bar codes are more labor intensive because they must be scanned manually one at a time the tags are made by intermec technologies corp and motorola corp s symbol technologies among others using chips from suppliers such as texas instruments inc impinj inc and stmicroelectronics nv wal mart is pushing the rfid technology on the idea it will increase efficiency and eventually save everyone money manufacturers as well as wal mart yet as wal mart searches for an answer to its rising costs suppliers are saying rfid isnt it the current generation of rfid tags cost about cents apiece while bar codes cost a fraction of a cent beyond the tags suppliers have had to bear the cost of buying hardware readers transponders antennas and computer software to track and analyze the data the suppliers have had to pay for additional programming to integrate that software with their current inventory and manufacturing applications on top of that suppliers say that instead of saving labor rfid tagging actually takes more while bar codes are printed on cases at the factory because most manufacturers have yet to adopt rfid those tags have to be put on by hand at the warehouse suppliers are being careful not to publicly criticize a company that buys &# billion worth of products annually but they say they dont expect any return on their rfid investments for years if at all some say wal mart hasnt achieved any savings itself other retailers including target best buy co and albertsons and the u s department of defense are also pursuing rfid projects and facing similar hurdles to finding cost savings the lack of any discernible return on investment has manufacturers pulling back last summer vf corp the maker of wrangler jeans and nautica sportswear curbed internal development efforts concluding a payback wasnt on the horizon "well let others drive the technology " says martin schneider vfs recently named global chief information officer another early supporter navin chandaria chief executive of lepages inc began tagging a line of fireplace products in and committed &# million to outfit factories that served wal mart the project languished when wal mart never expanded the program significantly beyond its original test facilities says mr chandaria "we expected them to say guys were moving forward but everything just fell between the cracks " last year he sold the product line to another company a wal mart supplier who doesnt want his company identified laments the lack of any clear savings despite investments of &# and up a year "its a big black box with nothing out there for a return on investment a lot of people if given a true choice would not be in it " he says of the mandate raymond blanchard co founder of truedemand software inc a los gatos calif company whose products analyze rfid data to help retailers improve delivery efficiency says suppliers have told him they would have preferred to move more slowly in adopting the technology using it only occasionally to identify opportunities for savings "it doesnt make sense to tag everything " he says john fontanella a vice president at amr research inc a boston firm that studies supply chains counsels most businesses to wait for the development of off the shelf software that will make rfid easier and more profitable to use "the rfid payoff is reducing human labor and replacing it with technology for most companies there are no software applications that can even approach the problem like that " he says to some wal mart suppliers achieving a return on their investment comes second to keeping the retailer happy executives at beaver street fisheries inc blyth inc s blyth wholesale group and thomasville furniture industries inc say they dont expect to recoup their rfid investments for several years but each hopes the effort puts it in good stead with an important customer "do you want to risk the business by not being in the game " asks howard stockdale beaver street fisheries chief information officer wal marts slower than planned rollout has some rfid advocates revising their view of the technologys prospects more problems have come into play in recent years including the high cost of retrofitting warehouses and stores with electronic readers and consumer concerns that once the tags are on each item on a stores shelves from tubes of toothpaste to personal computers that they could be used to track individual buyers wal mart says it has already endorsed industry backed guidelines for notifying consumers the tags are in use david donnan a manufacturing consultant and former president of radio frequency device maker checkpoint systems inc says the technology faces a catch to get the cost per tag down to an affordable level every retail product would have to be tagged but there is currently no financial justification for a manufacturer to tag every product he says as a result the enthusiastic announcements two years ago of new rfid pilot programs have become a wall of disappointed silence retailers are expected to move more cautiously in expanding their use of the technology "theyre not going to say stop" to suppliers says mr donnan "theyll say go slower " see related letter "letters to the editor wal mart no static on radio tracking" wsj march
