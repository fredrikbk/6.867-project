japan cellphones get security check biometric matches of fingerprints to facial features protect mounting data tokyo mobile phones in japan have never been more convenient the latest phones can be used as train tickets prepaid cash cards and credit cards as well as to check email take photos and of course handle calls many businesspeople check email make appointments and work on documents via their phones but as more japanese replace the contents of their wallets and briefcases with their cellphones the protection of information inside the handsets is becoming increasingly important losing personal information is bad enough but it can also mean exposing data about business contacts and others which can carry heavy consequences in japan under a tough privacy law enacted two years ago companies can face prosecution if information about their clients leaks out "especially since the phone began taking on the function of a wallet theres greater demand for protection measures " says hitoshi itakura a director in ntt docomo inc s product department wallet like services offered on many of the companys phones enable customers to store money or credit card information to make purchases at stores or restaurants docomo japans largest mobile operator has made a big push in the security area by offering identification methods such as fingerprint voice and facial recognition on nearly all of its high end phones these features are now made possible in large part because the processing chips in handsets have quadrupled in speed in recent years so phones can recognize authorized users and unlock themselves very quickly biometric technology which uses the characteristics of a body part to confirm a persons identity isnt new to japan for example bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj made a splash in when it issued cash cards with images of the holders blood vessels stored inside them but it is only recently that this security technology has gained a higher profile in mobile phones as more users especially companies no longer feel comfortable relying on simple pin codes used to protect many phones in the past many users never change their default pin code setting and those that do often pick easy to guess numbers such as birthdays and while japanese cellphone service providers also offer a locking mechanism that can be triggered remotely users must take the time to set it up further each handset can be locked only when dialing from a couple of designated phone numbers docomo is the most aggressive of japans three mobile operators to offer wallet phone service with million subscribers or about of its total customers fujitsu ltd japans fourth largest electronics conglomerate has been at the forefront of security related technology and was the first to incorporate it into phones four years ago as docomo was about to introduce wallet phone service a tiny chip identified and processed the ridges on a users fingerprint to decide whether a phone should be unlocked the technology isnt without problems the phone can fail to recognize the owner if the finger that is being used is dirty sweaty or wet fujitsu and docomo decline to say how expensive the technology is but say it adds a significant cost making the fingerprint phone one of docomos more expensive models still fujitsu says its phones are very popular about half of its users employ the feature and some companies even require its employees to use the fujitsu phones while fujitsu is the only company with fingerprint recognition in its phones the company owns fingerprint technology other companies have followed with other biometric security features phones by matsushita electric industrial co nec corp and sharp corp come with facial recognition technology that identifies the owner by using the camera to read the distance between eyes nose and mouth as well as facial contour a voice recognition phone by mitsubishi electric corp picks up on voice patterns when a user says a previously designated phrase these technologies can be added at a much lower cost than fingerprint identifiers because they are based on software but they also have a lower rate of recognizing authorized users facial makeup and shadows can interfere with the picture recognition systems while voice identification could be interrupted by surrounding noise a phone owner may have to try several times before the phone successfully identifies the user among some of the more intuitive ideas is a new panasonic brand phone by matsushita that comes with a separate slim square key similar to a car key both the phone and the key contain a transceiver like technology that emits radio waves the phone locks up when it is separated from the key by a certain distance the setting can be chosen by users depending on whether they want to limit the area to around the desk in the home or in a building docomo said it plans to go even a step further a new phone this spring will come with an option allowing users to request that all its data be erased remotely if the phone is lost
