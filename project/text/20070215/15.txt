bernanke calms worries over rates washington federal reserve chairman ben bernanke alleviated recent fears of higher interest rates by signaling growing confidence that inflation is headed lower as economic growth remains moderate but mr bernanke speaking before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee said yesterday that he remained concerned that tight labor markets and limited spare capacity could yet force inflation higher suggesting that interest rate cuts are not yet being contemplated markets had expected more hawkish testimony that is more concern about inflation in part because several fed policy makers last week suggested rates could rise again the more balanced tone of mr bernanke whose opinion counts considerably more sent both stock and bond prices sharply higher the dow jones industrial average jumped points to a new record close of and the year treasury bond yield which moves in the opposite direction to price fell to "there are some indications that inflation pressures are beginning to diminish " mr bernanke said "a waning of the temporary factors that boosted inflation in recent years will probably help foster a continued edging down of core inflation " which excludes food and energy two factors in particular should nudge down core inflation he said oil prices have dropped and that will indirectly relieve some cost pressure on a range of goods and services second tenant rents which determine both renters and homeowners shelter costs in the main inflation measures should rise more slowly as demand shifts to homes from apartments and the supply of rental units rises the forecasts of the members of the federal open market committee which sets interest rates also displayed greater confidence about inflation they see core inflation as measured by the price index of personal consumption expenditures falling to between and by the end of this year from in december and then further to between and by the end of thats at or below the level that many policy makers consider stable prices and within the to "comfort zone" other policy makers prefer in spite of this mr bernanke said the fed "has continued to view the risk that inflation will not moderate as expected as the predominant policy concern " he didnt explicitly say that that concern could yet lead to higher interest rates but by reiterating the bias to worry about higher inflation rather than weak growth mr bernanke also indicated that rates are unlikely to be cut anytime soon the fed has kept its short term interest rate target at since last june and markets expect it to stay there through the middle of this year after mr bernanke spoke futures markets priced in a higher probability that the fed would cut its rate target to by december despite the more sanguine inflation forecast mr bernanke suggested that the fed must remain vigilant on inflation because the economy is operating close to and possibly above its normal capacity "upward pressure on inflation could materialize if final demand were to exceed the underlying productive capacity of the economy for a sustained period " he said "the high level of resource utilization remains an important upside risk to continued progress on inflation " that said fomc members actually expect slower growth this year at to in the months through the fourth quarter than they did last july when their forecast was for to mr bernanke attributed this to a larger than expected decline in home building he suggested that home building could remain a drag on growth through the end of telling one senator that it could take that long to bring the inventory of unsold homes down to normal levels in one sign affirming mr bernankes forecast of an economic slowdown the commerce department yesterday said retail sales were unchanged in january from december and up excluding automobile dealers the biggest dampers were a decline in sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and a drop at electronic and appliance stores those decreases offset healthy gains for apparel and department stores revisions to prior months suggest that the economy grew at an annual rate of between and in the fourth quarter rather than the governments initial estimate economists say christopher conkey contributed to this article
