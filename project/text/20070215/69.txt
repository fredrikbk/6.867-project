violated federal contracting rules or were offered in exchange for official acts by mr gibbons people briefed on the investigation said mr gibbons a republican represented nevada for five terms in congress where he served on the house intelligence and armed services committees he was sworn in last month as governor of the nations fastest growing state the close ties between the congressman and the contractor warren trepp were disclosed in a nov wall street journal article which revealed that mr gibbons accepted private jet flights and a caribbean cruise from the software company owner mr gibbons says accepting the cruise and flight didnt violate house ethics rules new evidence has emerged that includes emails to mr trepp the majority owner of etreppid technologies llc and the former chief trader for convicted junk bond dealer michael milken discussing a payment or gift to then rep gibbons they also show mr gibbons repeatedly using his congressional office to help the firm seek classified military and civilian contracts the emails show that since at least mr trepp maintained close ties to mr gibbons who helped etreppid get no bid software contracts from the air force u s special operations command and central intelligence agency the software was used in video tracking of military targets and other classified applications messrs trepp and gibbons have denied any wrongdoing and no charges have been filed indeed such investigations sometimes end without official action in a sept email to mr trepp after mr gibbons had been particularly helpful on a recent contract etreppid executive len glogauer reports that "jim really hit the ground running on that one " he adds "we need to take care of him like we discussed " it isnt clear what mr glogauer meant and he declined to comment a second email cited in court filings by mr trepps former partner was more explicit on march days before mr trepp and his wife embarked on the caribbean cruise with the congressman and his family jale trepp sent a reminder to her husband "please dont forget to bring the money you promised jim and dawn " referring to mr and mrs gibbons minutes later mr trepp responds "dont you ever send this kind of message to me erase this message from your computer right now " mr gibbons failed to disclose the cruise and travel on mr trepps leased private jet as required by house ethics rules he later asked the house ethics committee for an exemption but left office before any action was taken the etreppid emails include dozens to and from then rep gibbons in one of the first such exchanges on sept mr gibbons said he was "greatly impressed" with the technology and that he asked a military aide on his staff to set up a meeting with the national security agency to demonstrate the companys products "no doubt the agency will be just as impressed " mr gibbons wrote he also tells an etreppid executive to begin using a private email address that is "a direct link to my desk and does not go through anyone else " in later exchanges mr gibbons discusses his efforts to set up meetings with the department of homeland security and arranges meetings with several pentagon officials including a top defense intelligence official an etreppid executive responds "now if we can get into the navy it would be great " in a statement yesterday a spokesman for the governor said mr gibbons has "consistently stated that he and warren trepp have a longstanding friendship " mr gibbons the statement continued is proud of his efforts "to highlight the good work of nevada companies as part of his duties to represent his constituents however he held no special power in awarding defense contracts which go through a multilevel approval process " mr trepp didnt return phone calls or emails seeking comment his attorney steven peek said yesterday "warren has had no inquires or questions from any federal officials about his relationship with jim gibbons " mr peek said mr trepp continues to talk to the fbi "about the theft of his companys intellectual property" by his former partner the crux of continuing legal disputes between the two men mr peek also said mr trepp "unequivocally denies that he wrote any emails regarding any payments to jim gibbons and questions their authenticity " the fbi declined to comment on the investigation which appears to be in a preliminary stage the bureau has stepped up its pursuit of public corruption cases and says it now has about agents working on federal state and local cases compared with in on tuesday former senior cia official kyle "dusty" foggo was indicted on fraud conspiracy and money laundering charges for allegedly accepting jet flights and a vacation from a contractor brent wilkes who was indicted on related charges both pleaded not guilty yesterday the indictments arose from a continuing fbi investigation of former republican rep randy "duke" cunningham of california who last year began serving a prison sentence for accepting bribes the cunningham case and claims made against mr gibbons have drawn attention to alleged congressional abuse of the classified or "black" portion of the federal budget which covers cia nsa and other secret government activities and has grown to at least &# billion new limits on special interest spending known as earmarks were enacted by congress last month including rules meant to restrict earmarks in the classified budget the nevada case is being watched closely in washington john negroponte former director of national intelligence warned in a court filing of "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if details of the secret contracts are disclosed the new federal probe follows a nevada investigation of the dispute over ownership of etreppid software used in secret government programs that investigation was initially focused on dennis montgomery the former partner of mr trepp who designed the software on which etreppid was founded in the men have accused each other of trade secret theft among other claims and have been battling in court for more than a year the new emails and internal documents would appear to support some of the claims made in legal proceedings filed by mr montgomery who in court papers has alleged that mr trepp gave at least &# in cash and casino chips to mr gibbons public records show mr trepp gave &# to the governors campaign through a series of separate companies avoiding a &# limit on individual or corporate contributions in court filings mr trepp has denied mr montgomerys claims he also filed a defamation suit against the chairman of the nevada democratic party tom collins over published comments about the business dispute before last years election he cites "false testimony" by mr montgomery who he says "engaged in a campaign to spread falsehoods which led up to a story published in the wall street journal " the journal isnt a defendant in the libel suit which is pending in state court in reno the nov page one story in the journal reported that mr gibbons and his family accompanied mr trepp on a caribbean cruise and that the congressman had helped mr trepp win federal contracts mr gibbons at the time said his assistance to mr trepps company was simply intended to promote promising technology and that the cruise and jet flights didnt violate house ethics rules because of his "close personal friendship" with mr trepp mr montgomery has accused messrs trepp and gibbons of using their political clout to get local fbi agents to raid his home and investigate him in december a federal magistrate found flagrant constitutional violations in the fbi raid according to people briefed on her ruling which remains under seal the court found that the local fbi and u s attorneys office had effectively acted as armed enforcers for etreppids wealthy owner in a private business dispute with a former partner mr peek mr trepps attorney said "if the magistrate decided the search was improper im disappointed in the decision but without knowing the basis i cant comment " in his court filings mr montgomery alleges that mr gibbons himself called in local federal officials at the behest of mr trepp who is one of mr gibbonss biggest campaign contributors in an interview last year with the wall street journal mr gibbonss wife dawn acknowledged that mr trepps wife had called her about the dispute in response mr peek said "any citizen has a right to report a crime like a theft of intellectual property and computer equipment and the government should rightfully act on the report of a crime regardless of who reports it "
