u s to take more iraqi refugees washington the bush administration said it would allow about iraqi refugees into the u s following bipartisan complaints in congress that the administration wasnt doing enough to help them but while the white house tried to tamp down criticism of one aspect of its iraq policy new political troubles emerged over plans to add troops to the effort as republican fissures appeared in the house yesterday during floor debate on the conflict according to the united nations more than two million iraqis many of whom worked with u s efforts there have fled the country most have found their way to camps in jordan and syria both countries have taken steps to curb the influx initially the bush administration did little to welcome iraqi refugees in part to avoid acknowledging that instability in the country had become a long term phenomenon fewer than iraqis have been admitted to the u s as refugees since officials said at a recent senate hearing u s lawmakers and even some military leaders say more should be done to help iraqi refugees especially those who have assisted the u s war effort of particular concern are the iraqi interpreters whom soldiers and marines often depend on for information about have served more than have been killed and many others injured they often wind up with refugees who have headed to jordan among other countries seeing themselves as combat veterans most would like to emigrate to the u s but often must return to iraq where they and their families face heightened risk because of their american affiliation the u s plan also envisions giving special treatment to iraqis still in the country whose cooperation with the u s puts them at risk of reprisal the u s plans to contribute about &# million for a world wide resettlement and relief program the refugee announcement came as the house continued a nonbinding debate on iraq in which democrats stepped aside for two hours while the minority aired its differences with the white house the remarkable situation developed after north carolina rep walter jones was given an hours debate time to control as the lead republican co sponsor of a nonbinding resolution of disapproval challenging the troop surge mr jones a member of the house armed services committee then yielded to a succession of like minded republicans whose speeches against the troop increase were interspersed with remarks by republicans supporting the administrations policy the result was a two hour snapshot of a growing party split that poses the most serious threat to the white house as it tries to sustain long term support for the war those opposing the president include reps phil english r pa and fred upton r mich with coveted seats on leadership committees such as ways and means and energy and commerce mr jones later predicted republicans may yet support the resolution of disapproval when it comes to a house vote most likely tomorrow the landscape has changed significantly from june when only three house republicans broke with the party leadership on a vote supportive of the administrations war policy "if you oppose the surge the troops will be demoralized were told " said rep howard coble r n c "i think not i believe they would more readily be demoralized if we were willy nilly rubber stamping every issue confronting us " at a news conference earlier in the day mr bush played down the significance of the house debate saying "they have every right to express their opinion and it is a nonbinding resolution " but he warned congress against trying to cut funds in future votes saying "we have a responsibility all of us here in washington to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the resources and flexibility they need to prevail "
