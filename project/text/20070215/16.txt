china may get more daring with its &# trillion stash beijing the government of china a country where more than million people subsist on less than a dollar a day is now dealing with an unusual problem what to do with all its money chinas central bank sits on a hoard of &# trillion in foreign currencies and securities making it one of the biggest investors in the world now officials have agreed that the traditional approach to managing this massive rainy day fund keeping it safely invested in bonds issued by u s and european governments is out of date following the lead of countries like singapore south korea and norway china is starting to look at new ways of managing its investments together these moves by central banks have ramifications for financial markets world wide the likely result fewer steady purchases of investments like u s treasury bonds and more buying of investments that are riskier but have better long term returns like corporate bonds stocks or even real estate and commodities scholars suggest china could spare perhaps &# billion or &# billion from its reserves for more aggressive investments even a slight shift of this type could have a significant impact in u s markets china has long been one of the biggest buyers of treasury notes making it in effect a major lender to the u s government chinas buying has helped keep interest rates low in the u s the greater the demand for a countrys bonds the lower the interest rates the country needs to offer china hasnt publicly discussed its strategy yet in late january premier wen jiabao said only that china will "strengthen the management of foreign exchange reserves and actively explore and expand the channels and methods of using the reserves " that is a break from the historical pattern of central banks being more concerned about preventing losses than achieving gains they have long been steady buyers of the safest and most widely traded investments cash and government bonds a big chunk of their holdings is in u s dollars according to the international monetary fund the official reserves of developing nations are composed of roughly u s dollars and euros most of the remainder is in british pounds and japanese yen so any move by china to broaden its investments would mean buying less u s debt that has led some to worry that less demand for dollar denominated investments will put downward pressure on the u s currency however that doesnt have to be the case argues stephen jen global currency strategist for morgan stanley that is because central banks looking for higher returns could still put money into u s corporate and agency bonds as well as stocks since central banks are so large they need to invest in markets big enough to absorb their money so the biggest beneficiaries should be the deep mature markets of developed nations the u s europe and japan china would be joining a growing number of governments that manage their investments with a commercial flair aiming more for longer term gains and less for short term stability last month the chairman of russias central bank with holdings of more than &# billion said it is looking at spreading its investments more widely the head of south koreas central bank said this month that he is considering putting more of that countrys &# billion in reserves into different types of investments including stocks officials in china "will quietly and slowly gather the expertise " says john nugee a former bank of england official who works with central banks for state street global advisors the range of possible investments could include national priorities as well as financial assets in december vice premier zeng peiyan said china should "take advantage of the rather large foreign exchange reserves to add to the nations reserves" of natural resources which are in great demand as china feverishly builds new roads factories and skyscrapers china has already proved adept at finding creative ways to use its reserves over the past few years the government has used them to shore up the finances of domestic banks insurers and brokerages to the tune of about &# billion the debate on what to do with the reserves in china is still going on although some principles have been established "the central government has already set the basic tone they are planning to separate the functions of reserve management " says yi xianrong a scholar at the chinese academy of social sciences a government think tank he and other scholars say one or more new organizations will be given a mandate to pursue a different investment approach on a portion of the countrys foreign reserves still china is likely to continue to manage a large portion of its reserves the traditional conservative way one reason developing countries hold lots of reserves is to protect the local economy if financial crisis strikes essentially it is money in the mattress to say prop up banks or support the local currency by buying it if foreign confidence flags chinas need for that kind of protection hasnt gone away still its reserves have been increasing by nearly &# billion a month for the last couple of years largely because chinas successful exporters are bringing in huge amounts of dollars which the central bank then buys to keep the yuans exchange rate with the dollar steady if current trends continue the reserves could top &# trillion by the end of the decade that rapid growth has given china the confidence to rethink how it manages its holdings because now there is generally agreed to be more than enough to back up the yuan in case of financial disaster zhou yang contributed to this article
