happy hour on rails may sound its last call bar car riders bemoan cutbacks in service drinks with crew of for the past years charles lawrence has left his manhattan office job in time for the new haven line p m or p m train from grand central terminal there the year old commercial real estate broker from fairfield conn settles into the bar car buys a beer and chats with other regulars their latest topic of conversation isnt just sports or business but whether the trains operator will eliminate the bar car itself "its this sense of community that ties people together " he says "when theres no bar people will just disappear take a seat and go home " the bar car has long played a central role in the life of the suburban rail commuter a place where writer john cheever drank and characters gathered in s movies such as "rally round the flag boys " but the final whistle may be sounding on the era of the rolling happy hour citing financial losses or the need to provide more seats for commuters rail agencies from new jersey to new york to the northwestern suburbs of chicago have already dropped or cut bar car service now local transportation officials are introducing plans to redesign the remaining cars on some lines with more seats and smaller bars or proposing to do away with them altogether mr lawrence and his fellow riders are particularly worried about their cars with total annual ridership up more than since on trains from new york to new haven metro north railroad and the connecticut department of transportation are working on redesigning the lines bar cars in part so they can better be used for seating even if a bartender isnt on duty more worrisome to riders on the new haven line when connecticuts department of transportation ordered passenger train cars in july there were no bar cars among them other rolling bars are also threatened metra which provides commuter service between chicago and surrounding suburbs has bar cars on three of its lines but plans to phase out the service over the next year or two as aging cars are eliminated and in december a member of new yorks metropolitan transportation authority board proposed that the long island rail road and metro north stop selling alcohol on rail cars and platforms because he is worried passengers may drive home from stations drunk neither the board member mitchell pally nor the railroads say they are aware of specific incidents related to driving an mta task force will recommend later this year whether the long island rail road and metro north lines should sell and allow alcohol the task forces first meeting is scheduled for later this month riders cite many reasons for frequenting the moving bars wanting to stand and stretch their legs after a day at a desk making business contacts or adding daily socializing without cutting into family time regulars on the new haven line call standard passenger cars "prayer cars" "so quiet " one rider explains "you can hear a pin drop " brendan kelly a year old who works in television ad sales in new york didnt know anyone when he moved to fairfield in so he started riding the bar car as his father had done when he was growing up in long island now whenever work allows he heads for the car to meet a crew of about men most of them finance or media workers mr kellys group has developed its own identity they stand in the back end vestibule of the p m bar car and dont mix much with those at the front end mr kelly compares the scene to the one from the sitcom "cheers" "everybody knows your name " he says and figures his experiences could be fodder for a tv show mr kelly and his wife socialize regularly with fellow bar car riders he says whom he calls the "train guys " when he was out of work at the end of he says he landed a job with a fellow rider who is also in ad sales others in mr kellys group have surrendered their own flower bouquets to fellow riders who have forgotten special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays "its a happy hour and its killing three to four birds with one stone " says mr kelly "we call it the bar that takes you home " from at least the s through the s power brokers gathered in bar cars and more comfortable private club cars on their journeys home to wealthy suburbs in their heyday these cars ran from urban centers like new york and philadelphia typically serving martinis scotch and bourbon to fraternities of businessmen enjoying cigars and poker games starting in the s when public transit agencies took over the once private rail lines many bar cars and cushier club or parlor cars were abandoned to provide a more egalitarian feel to trains in the s groups like mothers against drunk driving formed and lobbied for stricter consumption rules in nj transit discontinued the last four "refreshment cars" in new jersey shortly after metro north created more seating by converting the bar cars serving its hudson and harlem lines into regular passenger cars it was recommended that connecticut make the same switch to the new haven line until rider complaints reached such a level the plan was abandoned in the late s the two bar cars on trains serving chicagos northwest suburbs were discontinued because they were unprofitable in long island rail road closed its last bar car though attendants with bar carts still ride on some trains amtrak has about a dozen fewer cafe cars where attendants serve food and beverages than it did a decade ago because the cars cost too much to operate most of the cuts have been on routes that are shorter than two and a half hours including cutbacks in on direct routes between new york and albany the bar cars on the new haven line are holdovers from the s they havent been mechanically overhauled as have most of the lines passenger cars of a similar age and they are subject to frequent repairs some commuters would be happy to see them go "its disgusting like its never been cleaned its just gross " says catherine lally years old of greenwich conn who works in new york and took the p m train home recently in an adjacent car unlike many other bar car operations in recent decades the metro north bar operation which includes bar cars and carts in stations is profitable says tom celli manager of commissary for metro north the line combines its bar car and cart operations into one operating unit and for he says the operation made a profit of &# the line isnt planning to get rid of bar cars says connecticut dot rail administrator gene colonese he says new versions could be ordered as early as bar car service is available on about of metro norths daily scheduled runs on the new haven line down from about a decade ago the drop is primarily because of mechanical failure in the aging equipment says commissary manager mr celli on non bar car days riders buy drinks in the station and gather in prearranged meeting spots whenever there is no bar car on the to new haven mr kelly and his group meet in the back vestibule of the second car from the front of the train other groups meet in the center of the train or in the third car from the rear where the bar car was until or so years ago
