daimler weighs chrysler options partner might be sought or unit sold as job cuts plant closing are set daimlerchrysler ags acknowledgment yesterday that it may have to find a partner or spin off its ailing chrysler arm underscores the depth of the crisis facing detroits auto makers but also could present an opportunity for a rival seeking a greater presence in north america the german american auto titan which reported a drop in fourth quarter net income as a result of a million euros &# million operating loss at its chrysler arm outlined a sweeping restructuring plan that includes cutting jobs in the u s and canada closing one auto assembly plant additional production cuts and the elimination of some slow selling models from its product line under the restructuring plan chrysler aims to return to profitability by and have a return on sales by yet chief executive dieter zetsche conceded that might not be enough to sustain chrysler for the long haul while implementing the restructuring plan he and his top aides will look for partnerships to help chrysler expand into fast growing international markets he said without ruling out a sale "all options are open " mr zetsche said daimlerchrysler shares were up or &# at &# as of p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange people familiar with the matter said a small group of daimlerchrysler executives have started exploring how the company could separate itself from chrysler though any decision on that option probably wont come for some time in order to give the current restructuring plan a chance to work given the depths of chryslers problems a cut rate price might be the only way to attract the private equity players who are the units most likely buyers bankers on wall street said such buyers would have to commit billions of dollars in both purchase and working capital while running a wrenching restructuring and negotiating with a jittery union the breadth of todays capital markets means that funding a deal would be relatively easy the hardest part said a number of bankers was attracting the management to handle the work "there are very few people on the face of this earth who could do it " said one person who concentrates on the auto industry the main opportunity they said rests with a buyer who can best rework the companys "legacy costs" the term that encompasses wages health and retirement benefits for its union workers that would favor the likes of ripplewood holdings the new york private equity fund that has been involved in a number of difficult buyout situations ripplewoods principal timothy collins declined to comment the list of potential partners for chrysler includes renault sa and nissan motor corp the two auto makers run by carlos ghosn mr ghosn held unfruitful alliance talks last summer with general motors corp and said then that he was interested in a north american partner a spokesman for nissan said that "we remain convinced that extending the alliance could generate a lot of value" but added that currently there are no discussions under way with a potential partner daimlerchrysler has hired j p morgan chase &amp co as its adviser according to people familiar with the situation daimlerchryslers decision to open the door for partners or even a buyer underscores the hurdles facing detroits auto makers as they struggle to restructure their high cost north american operations increasingly it appears their troubles may be too great for them to overcome without joining forces with other auto makers or massively overhauling their longstanding business practices in north america starting with their labor pacts with the united auto workers in the u s ford motor co chief executive alan mulally has said he is interested in assessing whether ford could rely on other companies for some manufacturing or other tasks and visited toyota motor corp last year gm executives have made it clear that they see their companys future growth as coming largely from outside the u s in outlining chryslers turnaround plan chrysler chief tom lasorda said the auto maker must move away from relying on "internal" resources and embrace partnerships "for growth and to manage costs " the situation at chrysler also raises questions about the future direction of the united auto workers which will enter contract negotiations with the big three later this year all three auto makers want the union to accept some combination of changes in health care pensions and work rules to lower costs and help them compete against rivals that dont have unionized work forces mr zetsches blunt view of chryslers woes "could be a signal to the uaw that youre arguing with a man with empty pockets " said jurgen meyer a fund manager in frankfurt with swedens seb asset management which owns roughly million daimlerchrysler shares the uaw said in a statement that chrysler cant cut its way to profitability noting that the actions by the auto maker will be the subject of continuing discussions daimlerchrysler reported fourth quarter net income of million euros down from million euros a year earlier revenue fell slightly to billion euros earnings per share fell to european cents from cents chryslers operating loss was the result of slumping revenue and higher incentive spending as consumers shifted to cars from the trucks sport utility vehicles and minivans that account for about three quarters of chryslers sales amid higher gasoline prices chrysler will close an suv plant in newark del eliminate one shift at a minivan plant in st louis and a shift at a truck plant in warren mich near detroit all told chrysler will cut production capacity by vehicles under the restructuring plan chrysler will cut about hourly positions and white collar jobs or about of its work force chrysler expects to take restructuring charges of as much as billion euros in mr lasorda said he said chrysler will eliminate perhaps three to six of the models in its product line mr zetsche ruled out platform sharing between the mass market chrysler unit and mercedes which builds luxury vehicles he said certain similarities between architectures will increase as a result of parts sharing john d stoll and terry kosdrosky contributed to this article
