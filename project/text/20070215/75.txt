politics &amp economics house leaders to push tariffs on china exports trade law could be adjusted to apply to beijing subsidies japan currency may be next washington leading house democrats after pulling the bush administration behind the idea of incorporating labor rights into trade deals are upping the ante further in the trade debate by pushing the white house to take a tougher line toward china a hearing scheduled today by the house ways and means committee is expected to lay the groundwork for action on legislation that would bring china under u s laws that use tariffs to punish countries that unfairly subsidize their exports the move goes beyond the strategy stressed by the bush administration in dealing with such subsidies the administration has been trying to work through the world trade organization in geneva lodging a wto complaint last week alleging beijings support for chinese companies is harmful to u s makers of everything from computer products to steel the emerging legislation would open a second front to pressure beijing and underscores the determination of congressional democrats who won a legislative majority in novembers election partly on an antiglobalization agenda to bring a more activist tone to u s trade policy "what the administration needs to accept is there is now a new majority and there is now a need for new policies " said michigan democrat sander levin chairman of the house ways and means trade subcommittee the session will focus on subsidy complaints as well as chinas alleged failure to enforce intellectual property rights in an interview mr levin said china effectively operates a "rigged market " he suggested the hearing and coming legislation reflect concerns among rank and file lawmakers that the administration has been too passive in dealing with beijing "this is part of making trade a two way street of essentially abandoning what has been a hands off soft approach " he said the house measure on subsidies is expected to be formally introduced soon perhaps this week and would be ready for action before the full house this spring the legislation is backed by ways and means chairman charles rangel d n y and several other committee members and is expected to enjoy wide bipartisan support rep phil english r pa said he intends to support the measure saying it will address "a lot of the concerns of chinas critics" in congress the view in the senate remains unclear but anti china sentiment is simmering among members there too the house subsidy measure is expected to be the first in a series of trade bills moving through the chamber this year next up mr levin said will be legislation addressing concerns china and other nations including japan manipulate their currencies to create trade advantages details of that bill remain to be worked out one option under consideration by house lawmakers would be to classify currency manipulation as an unfair subsidy the administration has sought to address trade issues with beijing both by pursuing enforcement actions at the wto and by trying to resolve other issues such as complaints that u s financial services firms arent given full access to the chinese market through a "strategic dialogue" led by treasury secretary henry paulson under pressure from democrats the administration already signaled it is willing to consider adding new labor rights standards to trade deals the administration has resisted democratic demands for such provisions in the past democrats have said labor standards should be added to pending trade deals with peru panama and colombia in testimony yesterday before the ways and means committee u s trade representative susan schwab said the administration is trying to find common ground with congress on the issue and vowed to "try to bridge the differences on labor rights " the concerns voiced by mr levin reflect the broader demand on capitol hill to step up action against china especially after a report this week showing the u s trade deficit with china reached a record &# billion in in the senate a bipartisan group of senators including lindsey graham r s c and byron dorgan d n d have called for the u s to revoke normal trade relations with china over its trading practices in the house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and other top democrats called on the white house to present congress with a "comprehensive plan" in days to deal with the problem of surging trade deficits and to take action to stop alleged currency manipulation by china and japan critics say it is unclear whether china as a nonmarket economy is subject to u s sanctions for unfair subsidies under u s law american companies can seek relief in the form of countervailing duties from imports that have been subsidized by governments abroad such cases can be brought against industrialized nations and developing countries but critics say they cannot be brought readily against countries like china though china has moved toward freer markets it still is designated as a command economy a trade court ruling more than years ago cast doubt on whether nonmarket economies are subject to subsidy complaints under u s law the house legislation would make clear they are last year a group of u s paper products firms brought a subsidy complaint against china under u s law the first such filing in years administration officials said the administration has long argued that it retains authority to pursue subsidy cases against nonmarket economies but the long drought between filings reflects doubt about how much standing the administration really has
