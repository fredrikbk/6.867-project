how moet &amp chandon made rose champagne fashionable for the third year in a row moet &amp chandon was happy to foot the bill last week while the glitterati at new york fashion week downed large amounts of its rose imperial champagne at the "moet rose lounge" in bryant park moet approved fashion vips like betsey johnson and vivienne tam served bottles of moet rose at backstage parties after their runway shows on moets tab being fashion weeks official champagne sponsor cost moet the worlds largest champagne producer hundreds of thousands of dollars not counting the free bubbly and the labor costs says franklin d isacson the drinks brand manager in the u s but the buzz created around moets nonvintage rose was worth the investment he says the evidence "paris hiltons publicist called me to make sure she could get a vip pass " across the atlantic in the champagne region of northeastern france there is also a lot of buzz about rose until recently most champagne houses made only limited amounts of expensive vintage rose in years when the weather produced high quality grapes and then it was generally sold as a luxury product for wine enthusiasts for decades roses share of the french champagne export market hovered around to but since rose champagnes share has climbed to more than with exports soaring in the first nine months of from a year earlier according to comite interprofessionnel du vin de champagne france which represents grape growers and production houses in the region most producers believe the growth is a structural shift not just a trend "i am convinced along with a certain number of houses that we are creating a new category " says daniel lorson a civc spokesman a combination of factors has contributed to rose champagnes recent success including quality improvements rising champagne sales in all categories the search by increasingly educated wine consumers for something new and a general trend toward all things pink but industry players point to one factor in particular a decade of well orchestrated publicity campaigns and production increases by the regions giant moet &amp chandon which is owned by luxury goods behemoth lvmh group "they were not the first to do a nonvintage rose but arguably the most influential " because of their sheer size and timing mr lorson says moet executives say the idea of developing a nonvintage rose was attractive because demand for their vintage rose was growing especially among women in japan also consumer feedback showed that people perceived rose as young and extroverted and the company hoped to widen its consumer base "champagne is elitist its pretty much about status so some consumers are afraid to get into it " explains frederic cumenal president of moet &amp chandon champagnes executives thought that rose was "something interesting that can boost the brand to be seen as young " mr cumenal says but moets decision to invest heavily in nonvintage rose was risky champagnes growth is limited by a french law aimed at maintaining quality that fixed frances champagne region at about acres most of which is already planted moeets expansion meant transferring valuable grapes to rose production years before any actual sales while the bottles aged nonvintage rose blends grapes from different harvests allowing the maker to maintain a fairly consistent taste year to year and to produce a product every year but it is also more difficult and expensive to make than nonvintage white champagne because of the extra labor required by the blending process which involves adding red wine or grape skins to the champagne and rose champagne wasnt yet a proven success in terms of high volume sales on the other hand the profit margin for a bottle of nonvintage rose is higher then for nonvintage white champagne mr cumenal says this fact was "somewhere in the thinking but not a key factor" in moets turn toward rose because the margin is only slightly better but other producers say that even though margins change every year because weather plays a big part in the cost of production roses margins are very attractive and significant in a region where producers are struggling to make more money off a limited supply of grapes mr lorson estimates that a nonvintage rose is priced to higher then a bottle of nonvintage white champagne after making the decision to invest in nonvintage rose production moet knew its "visibility had to increase " says benoit gouez the companys head wine maker moet started with rose petal covered valentines day ads in glossy magazines and special packaging in the late s as sales increased marketing spread to all parts of the world year round the company tried to embrace the fashion world from the beginning at london fashion week in the company launched nonvintage rose in the u k and it is sponsoring the event for the th year in a row this week many other houses do less mainstream marketing choosing to focus purely on client relationships and some have only recently begun focusing on traditional advertising for rose yves dumont chairman of groupe laurent perrier one of the few champagne makers that became known for its nonvintage rose decades ago says the company has struggled with its strategy since "high volume producers" like moet moved in pushing the market forward rapidly and stretching laurent perriers supply a few years ago laurent perrier considered following the trend by buying several other houses to acquire grape growing land and doing a lot more marketing but it eventually decided not to says mr dumont "we just cant compete on volume and marketing size " he says so the company hopes to fill a premium rose niche over the last five years other champagne houses have poured into the nonvintage rose market with new products and focused marketing but supply is always an issue in california domaine chandon the sparkling wine brand owned by lvmh began producing its first nonvintage rose etoile rose in the mid s around the same time as the companys french counterpart moet &amp chandon demand is now so high for rose champagne that most houses are selling it only to their very best clients and have stopped using bottles for promotional events moet has stopped offering its nectar imperial rose a sweeter rose then rose imperial that does well in the u s at publicity events says mr isacson the u s brand manager some champagne houses are pulling back on marketing but moet has no plans to do so "these people are jaded " mr isacson says of new yorks fashion crowd "we really have to do something that will stand out " in fact next month the house will start selling handmade leather moet rose picnic bags complete with magnums of rose imperial only will be available for sale in the u s priced at &# apiece
