it works despite libeskinds best efforts denver the explosive anti rectangular defiantly irrational new south or hamilton building of the denver art museum has been written about a great deal since it opened in the fall because it is the first building designed by daniel libeskind to be completed in this country mr libeskind now age is an independent minded polish american architect and theorist who came to fame in when he won a competition for the jewish museum in berlin his building in berlin jagged in plan symbolic expressionist in style intentionally disorienting and emotionally disturbing took years to complete and helped mr libeskind win in what seemed at the time the plum design job of the new century master planner for whatever will eventually emerge at the sacred site of the world trade center towers in manhattan it now appears that the complex of buildings and memorial spaces at ground zero will end up quite unlike what mr libeskind had in mind and may take even longer to finish than his museum in berlin mr libeskind regards rationalism as one more constricting ideology and dismisses as nonsense the modernist dictum that "form follows function " comforting easily understood palladian symmetry and rectangularity he considers a rejection of the contemporary world his new museum building for denver supposedly inspired by the rockies although it looks like his projects elsewhere is essentially a collision of five tilted off angled hollow sculptures except for a few window slits and skylights these colliding volumes are completely covered in reflective titanium panels like frank gehrys guggenheim museum at bilbao although he thinks in angles rather than curves mr libeskind shares a number of traits with mr gehry the building contains according to its engineers not a single true vertical structural wall the logo image of the new building is an astonishing spear like wing that bursts out of the central tilted box and is cantilevered feet to the north where it points to its castle like sister building across the street designed by italian architect gio ponti in works from six of the museums permanent collections are still housed in the ponti building vibrantly redecorated inside in the s the libeskind wing contains samples of four collections modern and contemporary western american african and oceanic as well as three new galleries for temporary exhibitions currently filled with works from three denver related private collections just west of and below the cantilevered spear a glass enclosed footbridge has been built over th avenue to connect the two wings affording spectacular views east over downtown denver and west to the snow crested wall of the rockies the flat ceilinged lobby of the new building off of a welcome new plaza is a banal introduction to all the excitement even with its tipped over seating and a giant louise bourgeois spider to walk under but just left of the lobby begins the most dramatic interior space a four story granite staircase inside a manic foot high white atrium the black stairs keep narrowing and zigzagging back on themselves as they rise and are sometimes pressed against tilted walls each broad landing foyer permits dizzying views up and down to the steeply sloped triangular ceilings and ceiling beams wide punctured nonvertical walls and strange shapes and strips of skylight the galleries on all four levels are entered through heavy climate controlling glass doors off these foyers all the permanent interior surfaces are painted a calming chalky white which may reduce the risk of vertigo in addition to studio libeskind now headquartered in new york and zurich and its denver collaborator davis partnership two other groups and one individual should share credit for whatever success this building is finally judged to achieve praise must go first to the board of trustees of the denver art museum which had the foresight and the guts to award the design commission to mr libeskind in june while his berlin museum was still under construction and minoru yamasakis world trade center towers were still intact when the architect had not yet appeared on "oprah" or been the subject of an word profile in the new yorker all the trustees knew was that they wanted a new building that would "put denver on the map " they got it second i would single out the los angeles office of arup the world wide engineering firm that cut its teeth figuring out how to put up jorn utzons spectacular sydney opera house regarded by many people at the time as impossible to build three decades later the computer wizards at arup worked out precisely how to design and where to place the complex web of hidden steel beams and plates and concrete pads that permits mr libeskinds gravity defying funhouse to stand up finally i would award a special prize to dan kohl the denver museums chief exhibition designer in collaboration with the dams curators he was obliged to come up with some way to display real works of art to real people in mr libeskinds triangular or trapezoidal spaces with their steeply tilting ceilings and walls that lean inward or outward from the vertical a few choice pieces actually work well on these disorienting "cabinet of dr caligari" surfaces jennifer steinkamps minute three projector video specially commissioned for the space shows fluttering silken sheets in pale pastels tumbling endlessly down a by foot wall tilted away from the viewer at degrees but most of the time mr kohl simply had to ignore mr libeskinds walls which were never designed for the display of art in any case and erect his own vertical partitions and glass cases within them sometimes as in the display of a few prize pieces of oceanic art the vitrines are attached directly to the leaning walls which allows magical objects to cast mystical shadows the freestanding tan walls and cabinetwork mr kohl designed for the small african gallery are a work of art in themselves smaller works are placed at the low end of mr libeskinds swooping ceilings this does a disservice to paintings by modern masters picasso matisse braque miro mondrian et al hidden away at the low end of the top floor out of sight of the larger and splashier late modern and contemporary works still serra kapoor close de kooning le witt which the vast new spaces serve best mr libeskinds jewish museum in berlin was open to the public for more than two years before any exhibits were installed a situation he may have preferred two features of the new hamilton wing in denver seem to betray the architects lack of interest in any art other than his own his interpenetrating nonrectangular volumes sometimes end up yielding small triangular galleries that can be devoted to single artists and tight corners that can serve as niches for single sculptures but they also create acute angled spaces both too small for visitors and unusable for display even more incriminating are the two by fours one finds lying on floors all through the galleries and atrium foyers as defacing as yellow police tapes these have been put in place to keep visitors from bumping their heads against mr libeskinds in leaning walls and sharp corners in other places potted plants and carefully positioned statues serve the same function at many of frank lloyd wrights buildings one encounters low ceilings and sharp corners the price we pay for his sometimes arrogant art the sloping spiral of his guggenheim museum on fifth avenue presents a major challenge to exhibition designers and can compromise a viewers encounter with the art on display but none of these experiences reflects anything like the apparently brutal indifference of daniel libeskind to the work of any artist but himself the fact that the new building of the denver art museum remains an exciting place both to look at and to visit is a tribute not only to its form fixated celebrity architect but also to the good people of denver who have found ways to work wonders around him mr littlejohn writes about cultural events in the west for the journal
