physics through the lectures make it all worthwhile "some of them make me cry " dr lewin says robert croghan a canadian entrepreneur living on the caribbean island of st lucia says he has used some of the mit courses as guidance for an alternative energy project he is working on mr croghan says he read the lectures for courses on international development and entrepreneurial finance for extra guidance "they allowed me to take my street smarts and apply it with the terminology from a formal education " he says in white house tenn army first lt ronnie e matthews jr took notre dames

are supported through grants from the william and flora hewlett foundation which says it hopes to promote "open educational resources " hewlett so far has given over &# million to universities and nonprofits to post free online materials "knowledge is a public good and a public good should be freely shared " says catherine casserly program officer for education at the menlo park calif foundation "through the contributions of many we can revolutionize teaching and learning " that mission democratizing education also appeals to universities but schools arent interested only in the public good schools say that offering materials online can draw in potential applicants curious about what an actual course looks like an mit survey of users showed that about a third of freshmen who were aware of the site before attending the university said it made a significant impact on their decision to enroll universities say they dont worry about losing applicants by giving away materials online "from yales point of view there still is nothing more important than direct interaction between students and teachers " says diana e e kleiner an art history professor and director of the yale project "putting a selection of our courses online doesnt change that "
