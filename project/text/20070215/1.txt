africas last best chance the long stalled doha round of trade talks recently had in the words of wto director general pascal lamy a jolt of "new energy" after the recent meeting of key trade ministers in davos what is not clearly understood is that if a successful agreement is reached it will be especially good news for africa failure conversely would have tragic consequences for the continent it would lead the united states and the european union to negotiate more bilateral free trade agreements with key countries but not with sub saharan africa and other poor countries which offer few attractive markets for developed countries manufactured goods and services africa which has seen its share of world trade shrink in recent years would fall even further behind developing countries felt that previous multilateral trade negotiations like the kennedy round the tokyo round and the uruguay round primarily benefited the highly developed nations while they undertook costly obligations to protect developed countries intellectual property and impose sanitary and phytosanitary standards the developed countries did not significantly open their markets to the labor intensive manufactured goods and agricultural products of developing countries for the doha round launched in however there is a development agenda at its heart is agriculture a politically sensitive sector in the eu and the u s but the largest employer in low income countries accounting for about of their labor force and of their gdp the world bank estimates that these agricultural products face what former u s trade representative robert portman observed is a practically insurmountable global average tariff rate of and that of the benefits from a successful doha round would come from improved market access for developing nations agricultural products farmers represent less than of the labor force in industrial countries but they have very substantial political power in the u s eu and japan these political forces especially in the eu led to the eventual derailment of the doha round last summer but as the doha talks take on new life congress and the bush administration need to stay true to the commitments of the doha development agenda especially in agriculture two weeks ago the administration proposed ending subsidies for wealthy farmers substituting trade distorting subsidies with cash payments to farmers and trimming traditional agriculture programs by &# billion over the next decade these proposals if approved would directly benefit some of the poorest people on earth save lives and ultimately reduce american foreign aid while helping susan schwab the u s trade representative put wind in the sails of the ministers pledge in davos to restart serious talks the promise for developing countries and particularly the poorest african nations is huge in particular africa stands to gain significantly if sensitive product exclusions do not disproportionately target key african exports peter mandelson the eu trade commissioner pledged recently that europe will significantly improve its previous tariff reduction offer he needs to make good on that promise but even the current u s and eu proposals on the table far surpass those offered in previous multilateral trade rounds and offer real gains for developing countries wto members have agreed to provide duty free quota free market access to the least developed countries for at least of their products an agreement has been reached to end the direct eu and u s export subsidies by that have squeezed out the products of farmers in africa asia and latin america assistance will be given to help poor countries streamline their customs procedures to help with the red tape and corruption that historically impeded engagement in significant international trade developing nations also must make serious commitments to complete the doha round a growing percentage of trade is between developing nations with more than of the duties paid by developing countries to other developing countries this makes no sense the world bank has found a significant increase in per capita income of developing countries that lower their own trade barriers and concluded that totally eliminating global trade barriers could lift to million of the worlds poor out of poverty growing their economies by &# billion by opening their trade arteries to manufactured goods and services is also important it will help developing nations trade with each other which is growing faster than world trade overall but where levels of protection on goods are four times higher than levels of protection in rich countries intraregional trade in africa was only of gdp in in part due to self destructive trade barriers between african countries as trade ministers make an effort to reach a doha deal they should recognize that it is the poorest nations particularly those in africa that would be the biggest losers if doha collapses we hope this will be understood by everyone on a bipartisan basis as this crucial negotiation heads into its final phase for africa this may be the last best chance mr holbrooke is a former u s ambassador to the u n and vice chairman of perseus llc mr eizenstat held several senior positions in the clinton administration including u s ambassador to the eu and heads the international practice
