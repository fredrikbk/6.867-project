narrow escape how a chastened kpmg got by tax shelter crisis boss of just three days admitted firms sins fought to keep clients timothy flynn a top executive at kpmg llp was driving to a nephews graduation in may when he got a phone call from the chairman the firm faced imminent criminal indictment over tax shelters it used to sell then a different sort of shock one week later the chairman eugene okelly learned he had a brain tumor that left him just months to live mr flynn a down to earth accountant who once led kpmgs human resources department was suddenly thrust into its top job where he faced an urgent task to somehow persuade the government not to indict he knew that criminal charges against the firm would probably kill it as they did arthur andersen after the enron scandal mr flynn took a gamble kpmg had for years stoutly denied any impropriety calling its tax advice legal but days after taking the helm mr flynn met with justice department officials and acknowledged that kpmg had engaged in wrongdoing he got no promises in return and the admission could have sunk the firm instead it provided flexibility to the prosecutors who were aware that the collapse of one of only four remaining accounting giants could harm the financial markets two months later the government gave kpmg a deferred prosecution deal holding off indicting if kpmg paid a &# million penalty and met other conditions kpmg now is emerging from what some at the firm call a near death experience last month a judge satisfied with the firms reforms so far dismissed the deferred criminal charge mr flynn has put in place stronger controls and a former federal judge now oversees kpmgs ethics and compliance efforts mr flynn also banned a type of incentive pay that many believe helped fuel the sale of improper tax shelters for the most part he has managed to retain partners and clients in november he was able to report that the firms revenue had grown in the fiscal year ended sept kpmg isnt out of the woods it still faces lawsuits from tax shelter clients and though the firm hasnt been indicted some of its former executives have and their trial in september could cast the firm in a harsh light defense attorneys plan to argue that the shelters had approval from top management kpmg says "theres no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the management committee was aware that there was fraudulent conduct involved in the sale of tax shelters " a government appointed monitor of kpmg gives mr flynn a vote of confidence he has proved to be "the right person at the right time " says the monitor richard breeden a former chairman of the securities and exchange commission mr flynn grew up in a tightknit family with six children in the minneapolis suburb of bloomington an eagle scout and high school wrestler he attended the nearby college of st thomas his fathers alma mater and along with two brothers followed his father into accounting in he took a &# a year job in the local office of peat marwick &amp co a predecessor of kpmg eventually impressing superiors with his technical accounting skills and management knack frequently described by those who meet him as earnest mr flynn says former sec chairman arthur levitt is like "the parish priest who became pope " a test of his skills came in as arthur andersen was imploding after an obstruction of justice indictment accounting firms rushed to snap up its clients and partners kpmg initially fell behind in this scramble mr flynn and jack taylor then vice chairmen of kpmgs audit business refocused the effort first they made a priority of signing up andersen partners figuring clients would follow their auditors then dividing the country between them they spent the next three months on the road meeting with about andersen partners in all one dan doherty recalls the approach while executives from other accounting firms simply left messages at his home he says mr flynn took the time to talk to his wife and showed a "clear empathy for the circumstance we were in " it "wasnt just this mad rush of recruiting i never felt i was in the back of the line " he says mr doherty joined kpmg in all about andersen partners did kpmg snagged andersen clients second only to ernst &amp youngs haul according to research firm auditanalytics inc but soon kpmg had troubles of its own the once staid accounting world had changed with big firms using their audit relationships with companies to pitch more lucrative services among them were tax shelters elaborate sets of financial transactions designed to shield income from taxation for example some shelters created paper losses on foreign currencies which wealthy individuals who bought the shelters could use to offset taxable gains despite having never really put any money at risk kpmg developed a sophisticated marketing operation including a cold call center in fort wayne ind to push its tax products according to a senate report as the internal revenue service stepped up probes of such shelters early in this decade kpmgs accounting firm rivals stopped offering them and settled with the government kpmg sold shelters longer than others and insisted there was nothing wrong with its products a stance that angered the irs the justice department and some senators kpmg began to shift strategy in early under justice department investigation it forced out people who worked on the shelters and started to work toward a resolution with the government but as the process dragged on in late may the u s attorney in manhattan sent kpmg a letter saying an indictment was imminent then came the shock of mr okellys tumor he stepped down and the firm promoted mr flynn now years old he took over as chairman just three days before a meeting with justice department officials set for monday june at a m the saturday before executives huddled in the washington offices of law firm skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom among those there to plot strategy were mr flynn new deputy chairman john veihmeyer and a former federal judge whod recently joined kpmg sven holmes kpmg still hadnt made a final decision on whether to admit wrongdoing or if so what form an admission would take one adviser mr flynn recalls warned that an admission once made couldnt be rescinded others raised the risk of civil liability but mr holmes says he told mr flynn bold action was called for because "you only get one chance to make a first impression in a meeting like this " all were aware arthur andersen had faced a similar decision in andersen later had its conviction overturned in one sense a vindication of its defiance it was a pyrrhic victory as by then partners and clients had fled and andersen was out of business "i think we have to just admit wrongdoing and accept responsibility " mr flynn says he finally told the kpmg group the firm agreed that as an executive with no direct involvement in the shelter sales mr flynn was the right person to deliver the message though he was on the management committee when kpmg was selling shelters mr flynn was at human resources during much of the period and was never a tax partner on monday morning he attended the meeting with the justice officials and sharply changing kpmgs position admitted it had sold shelters that helped people evade taxes justice officials basically just listened later that week after a wall street journal report that the justice department was weighing an indictment kpmg issued a statement taking "full responsibility" for "unlawful conduct by former kpmg partners" in offering tax services not long afterward justice department lawyers let the kpmg side know they were willing to discuss a settlement now kpmg had to fight to retain clients executives took to the road for long stretches mr veihmeyers wife sent clothes to him by courier as he traveled over the summer of messrs flynn and holmes contacted more than audit clients one was general electric co kpmgs biggest audit client and one that paid it more than &# million in fees that year according to auditanalytics mr flynn met with ge directors according to a person who attended his message amounted to "theres some stuff here its really ugly it happened and heres what were going to try to do with this situation " ge stuck with kpmg a spokesman for ge says it is "pleased that kpmg and its leadership have aggressively addressed the compliance issues raised in the governments tax case " kpmg was lucky in one way midsummer is late in the year for big companies to make auditor switches because it can take months to negotiate terms of an audit engagement clients werent the only concern many kpmg partners were angry any exodus of partners would make it harder to keep audit clients then in early august a memo purporting to be from unnamed current and former kpmg board members circulated saying mr flynn lacked "backbone " it blasted management for admitting wrongdoing and abandoning partners involved "while the leadership may believe the path to pursue is the survival of the firm at all costs we dont " the memo said "the actions being taken will probably result in the demise of the firm anyway " mr flynn says the memo was "hurtful" and its claims were "lies " to calm partners he personally reached out to hundreds of them often singling out younger ones michael r gervasio a young tax partner in chicago says he was impressed as much by mr flynns persistence as by what he said mr flynn phoned eight times over two days before finally connecting with mr gervasio at home at one night "we really want you to stay " mr gervasio recalls being told he did later that month august kpmg won a new lease on life the justice department announced a deferred prosecution agreement besides the &# million penalty it required kpmg to stop selling prepackaged tax products stop doing tax returns for most individuals shed its benefits and compensation practice and submit to federal monitoring through september mr flynn called a special meeting of partners such sessions typically were staged this time messrs flynn and mr veihmeyer set up computer kiosks so people could submit questions anonymously "why should we trust you guys now " asked one question at the meeting in dallas which had drawn nearly all of the then partners others asked why the penalty shouldnt be paid just by tax partners mr flynn said they all had to "sink or swim" together and a big fine was the price they must pay to "get their firm back " the firm says that from june to sept just partners left excluding normal retirements and some forced out because of the tax shelters one thing that helped keep people aboard was a post enron boom in auditing auditors now had to do more and take more responsibility and they demanded bigger fees to do it kpmg also kept most of its clients from june through the end of the year it lost just three companies with stock market values above &# billion according to auditanalytics mr flynn set about changing how the firm was run he scrapped an incentive pay system blamed for encouraging partners to push the tax shelters in a two day january board meeting he urged directors to rethink kpmgs governance and they crafted changes the head of legal and compliance currently former judge holmes is now one of the firms top four executives the chairman and deputy chairman no longer sit on the nominating committee limiting their ability to fill the board with their allies the board now has a lead director who is a counterweight to the chairman mr breeden the monitor says kpmg has developed a good governance system "but it needs more seasoning to be sure that it works as well in practice as it should in theory " although kpmg reached a &# million settlement with investors it sold tax shelters to it still faces suits from several dozen investors who opted out of the settlement it has been quietly settling some of these kpmg remains in a wrangle over its refusal to pay legal fees for former executives who were indicted in that and other cases lawyers opposing kpmg say it is a sharp elbowed litigator as antagonistic as ever michael avenatti who represents tax shelter investors suing kpmg says "they interpret court orders in the narrowest sense and to the utmost extreme to benefit their positions " kpmg says it defends itself "as appropriate and in a professional manner " one former critic is impressed with changes at kpmg former sec chairman levitt once called kpmg a "rogue operation " mr levitt who has offered informal counsel to mr flynn says that the chairman "stepped into a troubled situation and by sheer strength of personality and character saved that firm from destruction " taking shelter key events in the
