free to choose and a good thing too radicals for capitalism by brian doherty publicaffairs pages &# scores of books have been written on the role of communists and socialists in the u s dour chronicles of welcome failure but very few writers have devoted much attention to the role of libertarians a more appealing and optimistic group of thinkers political activists and ordinary citizens who believe that respect for the individual and the spontaneous order of market forces are the key to progress and social well being the neglect is strange given how much libertarians and their limited government logic have shaped the culture and economy of the u s the ideas of john locke and david hume animated the writings of thomas jefferson and thomas paine libertarian principles kept what we think of as "big government" in check for much of the th century and well into the th despite tariffs and war the federal income tax officially arrived in permanent form as late as coolidge and his treasury secretary andrew mellon took a famously minimalist approach to governing of course we now live in a post fdr age with government programs everywhere still the libertarian impulse is part of our political culture "i believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism " ronald reagan declared today pollsters find only of people refer to themselves as libertarians but some of voters hold broadly libertarian views and can be a swing factor in the photo finish presidential race of some of libertarian minded voters supported george w bush last november many of them abandoned the gop disillusioned by its profligate ways and helped hand control of congress to democrats with "radicals for capitalism " brian doherty finally gives libertarianism its due he tracks the movements progress over the past century by focusing on five of its key leaders ludwig von mises f a hayek ayn rand murray rothbard and milton friedman the emphasis is on their ideas but mr doherty also takes into account their personal struggles not least their feuds with other thinkers and their relation to an intellectual establishment that for most of their lives thought they were either crazy or irrelevant or both libertarian ideas have enjoyed a surge of respect lately helped by the collapse of soviet central planning the success of lower tax rates and the appeals of various figures in popular culture e g drew carey john stossel and clint eastwood who want government out of both their bedroom and wallet even so libertarianism is often not the peoples choice part of the problem is the inertia of the status quo "in a world where government has its hand in almost everything " mr doherty writes "it requires a certain leap of imagination to see how things might work if it didnt " many people couldnt make that leap when for example economists proposed channeling some social security payroll taxes into private accounts mr doherty introduces us to an entertaining cast of minor characters who kept individualist ideas alive from the new deal through the great society there was rose wilder lane the editor of her mothers "little house on the prairie" frontier books and robert heinlein the science fiction writer who coined the acronym "tanstaafl" for "there aint no such thing as a free lunch" howard buffett the father of financier warren buffett was a fiery old right congressman from nebraska who compared the military draft to a form of slavery during world war ii henry hazlitt put economic analysis from his friend von mises into unsigned editorials he wrote for the new york times then a far more free market paper than today mr doherty is candid enough to note that not every individualist he sketches consistently respected the rights of individuals textile baron roger milliken for instance required his executives to attend a libertarian "college" in the rockies but also lobbied for tariffs to protect his products and other libertarians showed a certain want of personal character lsd guru timothy leary raised money for libertarian party candidates but didnt exercise the integrity or personal responsibility he himself said must accompany freedom ayn rand sold millions of copies of her novels but treated her acolytes abominably and "ended up kicking out of her life pretty much everybody " inevitably as with any constellation of like minded people there is squabbling and the petty search for heretics but there is also mr doherty shows the great work of fertile unorthodox minds harvard philosopher robert nozick abandoned the new left when he realized capitalism worked best but acknowledged feeling for a while that "only bad people would think so " hayek a supreme rationalist ended his life believing that "a successful free society will always be in a large measure a tradition bound society " he even praised religion for encouraging restraint and long term thinking "under circumstances where everyone believes that god will punish all for the sins of some " today the internet has become mr doherty notes an efficient way to transmit libertarian ideas and show their practical application with its decentralized free wheeling ethos the internet is itself libertarian without even trying to be jimmy wales the man who started the interactive online encyclopedia wikipedia believes that "facts can help set the world free " the largest retail market in the world is ebay which allows anyone to buy and sell without a government license louis rosetto the "radical capitalist" who founded wired magazine notes that even if libertarian ideas must now push against a statist status quo "contrarians end up being the drivers of change " among the most ornery contrarians he says are the libertarians "laboring in obscurity if not in derision " they have managed "to keep a pretty pure idea going adapting it to circumstances and watching it be validated by the march of history " mr doherty has rescued libertarianism from its own obscurity eloquently capturing the appeal of the "pure idea " its origins in great minds and the feistiness of its many current champions mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
