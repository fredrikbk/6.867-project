yahoo tries to protect turf from tv rivals networks continue to creep into the digital realm upfront season online when the big tv networks stage their annual presentations for advertisers every spring they go heavy on showbiz pizzazz yahoo trying to get a jump on the networks with its own event for marketers this week took a different approach instead of a parade of hollywood stars and song and dance routines as is common at the network events nearly ad executives and advertisers were treated to a stream of serious minded yahoo executives talking about the web portals many features and their value for advertisers in a roughly minute long presentation in new york the only concession to entertainment was an animated gopher called gus who helped a yahoo executive navigate the portals wireless offerings while attendees got to frolic at a party afterward the more serious tone was deliberate the biggest such presentation of its kind by yahoo it was part of an effort by the sunnyvale calif company to protect its digital turf from growing competition posed by television networks the networks have begun putting many of their primetime shows online in hopes of grabbing a share of the fast growing online video ad market yahoo which is under pressure from google in the search ad category and has been suffering a sharp slowdown in revenue growth cant afford to lose ground to the networks as well while yahoo in the past has done some low profile meetings with media buyers before the tv "upfront " this years event was a significantly bigger play dubbed "yahoo in front " tuesday nights presentation came three months before the broadcast networks schedule their annual "upfront" presentations in new york when they outline their fall schedules and start negotiations to sell the bulk of their ad time for the coming fall season last year several of the networks pitched web tie ins along with their tv schedules and this year they are expected to be even more aggressive on tuesday yahoo executives tried to persuade media buyers to give it more consideration when figuring out their ad spending "we think we should be a bigger part of your early planning " yahoo chairman and chief executive terry s semel told media buyers to make their case yahoo executives spent lots of time telling media buyers how the web portal could help them reach targeted audiences centered around defined areas of interest these include yahoos seven million newsgroups and its yahoo answers site where advertisers can target people asking questions about specific topics yahoo also discussed its wireless plans but yahoo didnt shrink from taking shots at the competition advertising only on television means reaching audiences "who may or may not be interested in the product being advertised " said wenda harris millard yahoos chief sales officer she also admonished buyers to remember that of media consumption is online but only of media dollars are spent there "clearly a disconnect " she added in an interview later ms millard said the event was designed to educate media buyers "you have people who are schooled and skilled in selling television selling digital to people who are schooled and skilled in buying television but neither one of them has the experience to understand what the real opportunities are for marketers here " the company wants to teach the "traditional buyers about what the real opportunities for digital are " she added "i see a lot of old tv shows thrown up there online and second spots thats not what it digital is about " "this was different than what the networks do yahoo gave a strategic solution presentation " said mary gerzema president of interpublic groups universal mccann u s to be sure online video ad spending is small estimated at &# million this year compared with total online ad spending of &# billion according to emarketer but online video ad spending is growing faster than other types of online ad spending and

online " said greg smith chief operating officer of the north american operation of neo ogilvy cq an interactive ad agency owned by wpp groups ogilvy &amp mather "the networks are starting to see they
