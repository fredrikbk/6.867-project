fun was in short supply at this years toy fair new york kids today are goys and everybody knows it for toy people the question is what to do about it a goy is a kid who is getting older younger the phenomenon means that children are outgrowing traditional playthings earlier and falling into the clutches of sony and microsoft never to be seen again the result is an industry in slow fade while u s toy sales climbed by less than one half of between and the small rise followed three years of low single digit declines according to npd group which tracks the industry this week as the toy industry gathered at new yorks javits center for the th american international toy fair there was plenty to attract the to set but there was less to lure older kids whose interests tend to wander toward ipods cellphones and videogames apart from its almost absurd abundance different items are on display toy fair demonstrates childhoods condensation according to eric clark author of "the real toy story " a recent book about the industry toy makers are trying to emulate electronic gadgets "the danger is toy makers will drive kids to real electronics " he says "which are getting cheaper all the time " toy makers acknowledge the problem but there is no clear way around it even teddy bears are getting techy gund the year old family owned maker of stuffed animals prides itself on its refusal to sell through mass market retailers like target and toys "r" us but this year for the first time it introduced a line of animated bears the hope among toy sellers is that technology can be used in a way that enhances play rather than as an end in itself "for years toy makers were chasing tech " says harold chizick a vice president for marketing at spin master a toronto based company "thats not what makes the toy industry great " his company scored with its line of radio controlled vehicles including the air hogs storm launcher lego is attempting to attract older kids with its "edgier" bionicles line a building set without an electronic component that allows the creation of action figures says michael mcnally a spokesman for the denmark based firm at the other end of the spectrum the company has also updated its mindstorms line a pricier building set that comes with a microcomputer that serves as the brain for lego robots "we have to be careful with technology " mr mcnally says "if it doesnt lead to more building its not right for lego " other traditional toy makers are bringing their playthings up to date jim engle president of providence r i based little kids inc has built what he says is a better version of whiffle ball mr engle is not the first to claim improvements on the plastic ball he says his will curve and knuckle more reliably or bat but he adds a wrinkle an electronic home plate that lets backyard ballplayers keep score by recording the effects of singles doubles and home runs the device also adds stadium sound effects "we take the traditional play patterns and make them better " mr engle says and his hope is more kids will drop their joysticks and play outside philip orbanes is another nouveau traditionalist the president of london based winning moves as well as the former r&amp d chief for parker brothers has invented monopoly the mega edition while localized or specialized versions of the game made on license from hasbro inc which owns parker brothers are a dime a dozen the mega edition is something new mr orbanes also the author of "monopoly " a history of the game has added eight new properties and has drafted minor adjustments to the rules the result he says is that the game can typically be played in minutes rather than three hours and there is less luck involved a good board game today mr orbanes says must not be a poor cousin to a videogame still the game must provide a "burst" of activity and be "intense and enjoyable throughout " sadly toy fair itself has lost much of its intensity and its fun while the mid february event is still a happening that draws the media spotlight much of the business of toys is done at a smaller gathering held the previous october to which the press is not invited there the wal marts and mattels of the world do most of their buying and selling toy fair itself is important for creating buzz but that was also in short supply the toy of the year according to the toy industry association which runs the fair is t m x elmo an update to tickle me elmo which caused a craze in there was no such excitement this year at least not at toy fair the problem for the fair and the industry seems to be oversaturation in the u s in particular of the worlds children consume more than of the worlds toys according to mr clark kids have more toys that hold their interest fleetingly at best but engaging toys that foster the imagination are still out there "the toys are good you just have to go search for them " says allison holmes co owner of oranges and lemons a childrens boutique in greenville del "i dont think its the industry " ms holmes says "its the parents " the kids old and young ever well supplied need to be encouraged to get out and play mr ackman is
