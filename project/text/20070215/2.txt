awaiting the dishonor roll congress has rarely been distinguished by its moral courage but even grading on a curve we can only describe this weeks house debate on a vote of no confidence in the mission in iraq as one of the most shameful moments in the institutions history on present course the members will vote on friday to approve a resolution that does nothing to remove american troops from harms way in iraq but that will do substantial damage to their morale and that of their iraqi allies while emboldening the enemy the only real question is how many republicans will also participate in this disgrace in the mistaken belief that their votes will put some distance between themselves and the war most of them voted to authorize in the motion at issue is plainly dishonest in that exquisitely congressional way of trying to have it both ways we reprint the text nearby the resolution purports to "support" the troops even as it disapproves of their mission it praises their "bravery " while opposing the additional forces that both president bush and general david petreaus the new commanding general in iraq say are vital to accomplishing that mission and it claims to want to "protect" the troops even as its practical impact will be to encourage iraqi insurgents to believe that every roadside bomb brings them closer to their goal as for how "the troops" themselves feel we refer readers to richard engels recent story on nbc news quoting specialist tyler johnson in iraq "people are dying here you know what im saying you may say oh we support the troops so youre not supporting what they do what theys sic here to sweat for what we bleed for and we die for " added another soldier "if they dont think were doing a good job everything weve done here is all in vain " in other words the troops themselves realize that the first part of the resolution is empty posturing while the second is deeply immoral all the more so because if congress feels so strongly about the troops it arguably has the power to start removing them from harms way by voting to cut off the funds they need to operate in iraq but that would make congress responsible for what followed whether those consequences are americans killed in retreat or ethnic cleansing in baghdad or the toppling of the elected maliki government by radical shiite or military forces the one result congress fears above all is being accountable we arent prone to quoting the young john kerry but this weeks vote reminds us of the comment the antiwar veteran told another cut and run congress in the early s "how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake " the difference this time is that speaker nancy pelosi and john murtha expect men and women to keep dying for something they say is a mistake but also dont have the political courage to help end instead theyll pass this "non binding resolution " to be followed soon by attempts at micromanagement that would make the war all but impossible to prosecute and once again without taking responsibility mr murtha is already broadcasting his strategy which the new politico web site described yesterday as "a slow bleed strategy designed to gradually limit the administrations options " in concert with antiwar groups the story reported mr murthas "goal is crafted to circumvent the biggest political vulnerability of the antiwar movement the accusation that it is willing to abandon troops in the field " so instead of cutting off funds mr murtha will "slow bleed" the troops with "readiness" restrictions or limits on national guard forces that will make them all but impossible to deploy these will be attached to appropriations bills that will also purport to "support the troops " "theres a d day coming in here and its going to start with the supplemental and finish with the defense budget "" congressman neil abercrombie d hawaii told the web site he must mean d day as in dunkirk all of this is something that house republicans should keep in mind as they consider whether to follow this retreat the gop leadership has been stalwart even eloquent this week in opposing the resolution but some republicans figure they can use this vote to distance themselves from mr bush and the war while not doing any real harm they should understand that the democratic willingness to follow the murtha "slow bleed" strategy will depend in part on how many republicans follow them in this vote the democrats are themselves divided on how to proceed and they want a big gop vote to give them political cover however "non binding " this is a vote that republican partisans will long remember history is likely to remember the roll as well a newly confirmed commander is about to lead american soldiers on a dangerous and difficult mission to secure baghdad risking their lives for their country and the message their elected representatives will send them off to battle with is a vote declaring their inevitable defeat resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that  congress and the american people will continue to support and protect the members of the united states armed forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in iraq and  congress disapproves of the decision of president george w bush announced on jan to deploy more than additional united states combat troops to iraq see
