politics &amp economics capital fishing out facts on the wealth gap the best off americans have been getting a larger bite of the economic apple over the past years or so the trend is clear the reason is the subject of academic debate what if anything the government should do is the subject of political debate politicians sense that many americans are uneasy about the widening gap between economic winners and losers some think they got elected to deal with that others view dealing with it as the only way to keep lowering barriers to trade still others wish the whole thing would blow over but recent public acknowledgments of the facts of inequality by president bush treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are evidence this issue isnt going away the bush administration shies away from using the tax code to resist market forces of inequality though the treasury web site does boast that mr bushs proposed change in the tax treatment of employer provided health insurance would raise taxes on the top fifth of taxpayers and cut them on the rest democrats more comfortable using the tax code to play robin hood are itching to undo some bush tax cuts for the rich facts sometimes get obscured in this debate here are a few fact one federal taxes make the distribution of income more equal even after the bush tax cuts taxes dont undo all market forces pushing income toward the top and there are good reasons they shouldnt before taxes the bottom of u s households got of the nations income in after federal taxes of all sorts they got about according to the congressional budget offices latest estimates because of the earned income tax credit a cash bonus the government offers low wage workers many americans at the bottom get money from the government rather than having to pay income taxes they still face payroll taxes on their wages before taxes the top got about of income after taxes they ended up with yes you read that right the million best off households got about as much income even after taxes as the million worst off that top by the way pays about a quarter of all federal taxes cbo estimates arent perfect but they represent the best available attempt to combine census bureau and internal revenue service data to get a comprehensive picture of who pays taxes fact two the treasury benefits more when ceos get bigger raises than when ordinary workers gain and that along with the buoyant economy is a big reason for todays surge in federal revenue its simple taking all federal taxes into account including payroll as well as income taxes and allocating corporate profits and taxes paid on them to those who hold shares the cbo says those in the bottom fifth pay an average of &# in taxes for every &# they take in those in the top pay &# in taxes for every &# they take in fact three the bush tax cuts reduced income tax rates across the spectrum some saved a lot more dollars than others namely the ones who make a lot of money but strangely the percentage of taxes paid by different groups hasnt changed very much consider this calculation by james poterba a massachusetts institute of technology economist if the bush tax cuts had never happened and president bill clintons tax rates were applied to the economy american households would have paid about more of their income in taxes mr poterba quickly adds that people would have behaved differently had taxes remained at clinton levels they would have sold fewer shares of stock for instance because capital gains tax rates would have been higher that means the estimate overstates the actual effect somewhat but mr bush did cut taxes so mr poterba looks at how that smaller tax bill was sliced what percentage was paid by the best off by the middle class etc it turns out the share of the income tax tab actually picked up by each group in is close to what it would have been had mr bushs tax never happened the cbo numbers show the same thing the top paid of all federal taxes under mr clintons tax rates and under mr bushs how can that be clearly the well off saved many bucks for one thing tax rates were cut for the bottom and middle as well as the top a fact often lost in public debate over taxes on the rich second theres so little income earned and so little tax paid at the bottom that a tax cut of &# is a big change in the taxes that group pays and conversely at the top fact four rising spending on government retirement and health benefits almost surely will force tax increases in the next decade or so the issue is who will be taxed mr bush got tax cuts through congress without getting much so far in the way of lasting money saving changes in social security medicare and medicaid thats a recipe for future tax increases politicians eventually will restrain spending on those benefits but there are no signs theyll do enough to avoid higher taxes in the years ahead
