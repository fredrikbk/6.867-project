roads not taken still play a part in vermont life you cant always see them but they do exist and they do cause trouble charlotte vt steve kantor bought his home here in its the last house on a quarter mile dirt drive with views of cow pastures and a mountain range he likes it because its off the beaten track seven years later however he was informed by the town that a foot wide public road runs through his land he says he wasnt aware of that the road doesnt appear on maps and theres hardly a trace of it today "they say the center of the road is right here " said mr kantor as he crouched down in the middle of a hedgerow alongside his land and cleared away brush mr kantor a lawyer is at the center of a controversy threatening to throw a monkey wrench into the states residential real estate market vermont has scores of old public roads that havent been used as such for decades and havent been kept up some resemble paths through the woods or private driveways while others at least to the casual observer are indistinguishable from their surroundings now with more retirees and second home buyers acquiring vermont real estate some towns are rushing to stake claims to these "sleeping roads " disputes center on differing perceptions of public and private property here known for its woodlands and rolling hills vermont has vast networks of trails some of which run through peoples land and vermonters have a long tradition of letting people pass through their property for snowmobiling hunting hiking and other forms of recreation locals worry that some of the outsiders now moving to the state are less open to that idea and are too fond of no trespassing signs some vermonters are helping to guard this trail network by combing through old records to show that some of these roads are in fact still public the vermont association of snow travelers which represents about snowmobilers has been giving powerpoint presentations to members on how to compare road atlases from the s with todays highway maps to find roads that might have gotten lost over the years that alarms some property owners and has spooked the states biggest title insurer which threatened to stop writing policies in three towns where a number of old road cases have cropped up for title insurers in vermont who by law are required to go back only years in their title searches the nightmare scenario is the one now unfolding in the town of chittenden in the western part of the state for nearly four years james and kathy peterson have been seeking approval to build an addition to their square foot white colonial house the town has blocked them saying it would encroach on the green road which was laid out by the areas settlers in as a mail route and hasnt been maintained as a road since the s the petersons deed contains a survey that mentions the possibility that an old road runs through their property the green road battle reached its apex one saturday morning in may when two members of the town select board accompanied by the town historian and others showed up with chain saws and announced that they were going to cut the road out of the woods where they believed it once went they began by taking down trees on the adjacent property and were moving toward the petersons plot when the state police intervened the case is set to go to trial later this year the couples title insurer first american title insurance co has already spent more than &# getting ready for the case the worst of the battles over sleeping roads may be yet to come a new law gives cities and towns until to get any old roads onto their town highway map or risk having to pay damages if they later want to claim them for property surveyors these clashes have been good for business cases typically are resolved by researching the history of the road to determine whether it was in fact built some were surveyed but never actually created and if it was whether it was ever "discontinued " the formal term for decommissioning a road roads that werent discontinued are legally still public roads says paul gillies a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state in vermont with wide experience in old road cases thats true even if they no longer resemble roads surveyors pore over town charters road maps and even deeds going back to the time of king george iii surveyor terry harris has worked on about old road cases in vermont including one in the town of barnard during a recent visit to the town clerks office there mr harris flipped open a volume titled "road surveys barnard " it contains more than surveys recorded in yellowed tightly packed script not only must they try to decipher the handwriting of the day property surveyors must also wrestle with old english spellings and th century legalese as well as references to people who are long dead and landmarks that no longer exist including churches barns and specific trees "you dont know what youre going to find whether its going to be to your clients benefit or not " says mr harris dave sargent a select board member in chittenden a hilly town of says he remembers walking parts of the mile green road as a kid with his father and enjoying its mountain views and remnants of cellar holes "people have long accepted that a road was there knew it was there and never really questioned it " says the year old "but then there is this mass migration of people from out of state and theyre building on what was or is old farmland and suddenly they think that because no one is driving on it its no longer a road " mr sargent says chittenden currently has no interest in rebuilding the green road for cars but the town wants to retain that option for future generations the petersons say they have a court document proving that the road was discontinued in the s the town says the document isnt valid in charlotte the town says research has turned up old roads that it is considering claiming once it decides which of those it wants to pursue it will hold separate public hearings for each "you cant see them and they were used years ago if they were used at all " says eleanor russell chairwoman of the charlotte select board "but they are still legitimate roads " for mr kantor because of the old road there is now an encumbrance on his property which means that every time he refinances his mortgage he has to get a letter from the title insurer pledging to defend the title states have different ways of dealing with their old roads maine for example presumes "abandonment" if a road hasnt been maintained with public money as a road for at least years in vermont some towns are likely to let their sleeping roads lie mainly because mapping them out is expensive but others plan to follow the path of chittenden barnard and barnards neighbor bethel which were among the first vermont towns to research their old roads they all relied heavily on a local history buff john dutton who says he also is advising other towns "my time is pretty tightly booked because of the pressure on these towns " he says
