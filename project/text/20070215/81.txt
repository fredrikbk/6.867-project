sec considers fund board compromise rule would allow choice under some scenarios lead independent director a compromise rule on mutual fund board independence has been floated within the securities and exchange commission aimed at bridging the gap between two sides in a years long debate according to a person familiar with the matter the rule would effectively allow most mutual fund boards to choose whether they should be led by an independent director if they met certain requirements which would be a step back from an original rule mandating an independent chair under the compromise which is still in the discussion stage the sec would require mutual fund boards to be overseen by an independent chairman however a fund would be exempt from that rule if it met a series of tests the most significant of which is having a supermajority of independent directors on the board and a lead independent director most mutual fund companies already have at boards that are at least independent directors and many also have lead independent directors so in those cases meeting the exemption requirement might not be a significant hurdle the sec first proposed and passed the independent chairman rule in requiring boards to be independent including an independent chairman but a federal appeals court sent it back for reconsideration twice the issue has divided the sec but chairman christopher cox is committed to some form of fund governance rule and is looking for a middle ground between commissioners with opposing opinions the potential appeal of this version of the rule is that boards could decide on their own if they wanted to seek an exemption and have the board be led by an interested chair one affiliated with the management company that could appease critics of the old rule who argue it limits the discretion of fund boards yet by ramping up the number of independent members on the board as well as the lead director it also achieves the goals of those pushing for more independent voices on fund boards the viability of this version of the rule far from clear but it would have the support of at least one commissioner roel campos a democrat and an ardent backer of the original rule the compromise rule hasnt been presented to the commission or made as a formal recommendation paul atkins a republican commissioner who voted against the first governance rule has said he isnt in favor of government mandating corporate governance many fund boards have already increased the percentage of trustees the investment company institute says of funds have boards with of its members not from the industry setting different standards depending on whether the chairman of the board is independent or affiliated with the management company is bad policy argues eric roiter general counsel for fidelity management &amp research co fidelity investments money management arm "it implies that there is something deficient about a board where the independent directors who are in the majority to begin with have chosen to have a management director serve as chairman " mr roiter says
