the next generation of genealogy sites new collaborative formats let users fill in family trees addressing privacy issues from the beginning the internet has attracted people seeking to research their family trees and sites wanting to make money off their pursuits the webs search capabilities seemed custom tailored for sorting through long forgotten records that are now being dusted off and digitized hundreds of sites sprang up in practice though web genealogy has led to a lot of frustrated consumers the process has been expensive most sites charge fairly steep subscription fees and time consuming now sites are aiming to eliminate some of those drawbacks one new entrant geni com which was launched last month by a former paypal executive offers a new model based on connecting living relatives free of charge the site is part genealogy part six degrees of separation instead of paying a fee to research family records buried in archives it asks users to build their own family trees using the knowledge of living relatives that eventually will merge into one giant family tree for the world that is the hope anyway geni com is taking some of the elements of popular so called social networking and user generated content sites such as wikipedia and myspace it went live in mid january and has registered more than users since then it has done no traditional marketing yet but blogs such as digg where users submit news stories and tech crunch which focuses on technology passed the word the site is free rather than charging fees geni plans on selling advertising and also plans to generate revenue by creating "premium" accounts and selling products such as posters or coffee table books of the family trees but geni has already courted controversy and raised privacy concerns several blog posts have expressed frustration with the level of personal information that can be published about a person even without their permission for example a geni member can create entire profiles for relatives who dont visit the site including their birth dates education phone number and photos some of the identifying pieces of information used by many financial institutions such as mothers maiden name and birth date are often listed on the site to address those concerns geni is only allowing visitors to the site to see their own family trees geni says that family members are responsible for ensuring that the profile information is correct popular sites such as myspace rely primarily on similar modes of self policing the company says it doesnt plan to sell the data to marketers it also says it will introduce more privacy features as the site grows ben guthro a year old software engineer from boston started building a family tree on geni com after he saw a post on digg his tree now has members some of whom he has never met before such as his mothers cousin who lives in california "it spreads fast " he says more established genealogy sites are also adding geni like elements for instance the generations networks founded as myfamily com inc nearly a decade ago and now operating eight sites including ancestry com has built its &# million a year businesses primarily by selling subscriptions to passionate family historians for access to archives that track family lineage such as census records draft cards and death certificates the provo utah based company is offering more free ad supported features allowing family members to build trees by attaching ancestors names photos and stories since adding these features last july ancestry com users have created more than one million family trees with million names photos and million family documents from the sites thousands of record collections geni com works like this users enter their first and last name email address and gender a box then pops onto the screen pink for women and blue for men where members can add a picture then fill personal information into a profile members then create their family tree by entering the names and email addresses of their family members those relatives receive an email from geni asking them to join the network and help build the tree by inviting more relatives and creating profiles for ancestors as family trees start to overlap geni com plans to link similar branches together to create one giant family tree where members can track their ancestry and see their distant relations living throughout the world right now geni doesnt offer access to any databases or other research sources members also are using geni to stay in touch with living family members through sharing pictures and sending messages geni hosts more than one million profiles with average users adding people to their trees ana greene a year old from arlington va is planning a wedding and intends to post pictures from the event on the site michael levine a year old research physicist from port jefferson n y says that after his nephew invited him to join geni he continues to unearth new family connections "i found relatives i didnt remember i was related to i went to visit somebodys goat farm when i was seven and all of a sudden their name pops up " says mr levine who finds that he visits the site several times a day to check if his family members have responded to his invitation during a coming business trip to chicago he plans to meet up with a cousin from his mothers side a woman in her early s who is a concentration camp survivor family tree sites are attracting a young more global audience than some similar sites more than half of genis traffic comes from outside the u s indeed a problem with the traditional sites is that they worked better for families which had come to america generations ago and less well with more recent immigrants meanwhile the generations network also is developing internationally launching sites in the u k canada australia germany china and italy but some users worry that geni is too wide open "this collaboration thing has some dangers " says mr levine "i invite people they can invite people and they have the same privileges as i do to erase names or change things all you need is someone who is careless or malicious and all your work goes down the drain " the upgraded tree some web genealogy sites are aiming to improve the process of constructing a family tree here are a few of the changes a new entrant geni com has users enter their own information build profiles and invite other family members to collaborate it is also free ancestry com which sells subscriptions to access archives such as census records is adding free services that allow users to build trees and add relatives photos and stories
