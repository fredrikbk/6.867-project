freedom and labor europe just got its best jobless report in a very long time the bad news in a decade when record numbers of people found work in the rich world europes best is an unemployment rate of significantly higher than americas or that of any other developed economy the old world offers a useful model of what not to do its largest economies germany france and italy have shunned a policy mix that has enabled english speaking and nordic countries to reduce their jobless rolls in its annual "going for growth" report released tuesday the oecd argues that deregulated labor and other markets are the best route to full employment thats hardly man bites dog news but the study draws on a decades worth of empirical data to make the case before a french politician gets upset lets be clear that no ones calling for an end to the welfare state the oecd study shows that a social safety net can coexist with strong growth and low unemployment notwithstanding other social and economic costs but the kind of safety net matters look at the welfare besotted nordics in particular denmark which has recently found tough love its "flexisecurity" system combines generous jobless benefits strong incentives to get new work fast and lenient hiring and firing rules this encourages danish employers to create jobs and pushes beneficiaries back into the work pool the result unemployment fell to in from in see nearby chart rigid job protection laws have the perverse effect of keeping people out of work germany and france are generous with benefits lax about getting the unemployed off the dole and inflexible on hiring and firing such laws discourage companies from hiring and they discriminate against the jobless by raising the bar to enter the workforce women and minorities are disproportionately hit in france the overall jobless rate is a still high today down from in but the youth jobless rate is three times higher even after its poor minority young rioted in late france did nothing to make it easier for these kids to get jobs unemployment in germany rose to in from in after berlin tightened eligibility rules for unemployment insurance on the margins without touching hiring and firing rules the rate has since gone down marginally to thats still a long way from denmark or the u s as the oecd study shows countries with low jobless rates not only have the most open labor markets but also the freest product markets these are in descending order the u s britain australia canada new zealand and denmark except for the u s all these countries abandoned statist policies and opened up their economies in the past decade or two the result more growth and jobs by the way half the one percentage point decrease in euro zone unemployment in the past decade comes from spain where market reforms got the jobless rate down to today from in the oecd report also points out the often overlooked benefits of deregulation to job creation freer competition in product and service markets reduces prices that in turn relaxes wage demands and lets companies hire more workers financial deregulation for example tends to bring down interest rates enabling companies to expand in this virtuous circle its then theoretically easier to fix bad labor laws in a growing economy new governments in italy and germany and a soon to be new president in france have a chance to catch up with other developed economies on getting their citizens into jobs the recipe isnt complicated reduce taxes to reduce wage costs tighten rules on government benefits loosen up employment protection laws come to think of it the new majority in the u s congress could stand to read the oecd report too
