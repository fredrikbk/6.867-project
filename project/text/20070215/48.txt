identity thieves steal to buy groceries easy and low risk a perfect crime for everyday life in some twisted way it makes sense when a criminal steals your identity to rip you off for thousands of dollars you might call that normal crook behavior but these days identity thieves who now range from far flung organized crime rings to local drug addicts are also using your identity for the basics such as groceries "it used to be that people used the information to buy something they couldnt otherwise buy " said fred baclagan a special agent supervisor with the california department of justice and member of the san diego based computer and technology crime high tech response team the evolution of identity theft crimes is striking criminals now see identity theft as a means to fund a wide variety of activities mr baclagan said "it used to be a white collar kind of crime but now the narcotics people are into it gangsters are into it its rampant " thieves steal data in myriad ways from grabbing personal data via complex online phishing scams to low tech thefts some steal post office boxes right off the corner mr baclagan said then "they use the personal information to buy groceries or toilet paper or dishes or fast food " he said "this is their everyday life " why "its too easy to do and theres too little penalty " he said adding that convicted identity thieves are often back on the street within months another popular path to data the workplace thieves secure a job at a place where theyre likely to see personal data hotels are a popular target mr baclagan said he has seen five or six such cases in recent years in san diego one case involved a man who was a night auditor at a well known hotel chain "he had access to stacks and stacks of receipts thieves go after the hotel stuff because you get the personal information included with the credit card" data he said thieves focus on out of town visitors because law enforcement agencies often are unable to follow up on out of town crimes he said still credit card fraud is the main identity fraud crime consumers face and they are relatively well protected in that credit card issuers usually pay for the fraud charges "year in and year out the no category of fraud is credit cards " said james van dyke founder and president of javelin strategy &amp research a consulting firm in pleasanton calif which conducts an annual survey of consumers on the subject online fraud remains a problem keystroke logging "has become a lot more prevalent " said avivah litan an analyst with gartner research in stamford conn thats when thieves download software onto an unwitting victims computer then capture what the victim types including passwords and other sensitive information but theres much you can do to better your chances of avoiding the crime monitor your personal accounts closely posting your resume online dont include your date of birth or social security number understand pc security product limits no product available today will completely prevent identity theft store personal information in a locked drawer and avoid leaving information in your car shred with a cross cut or diamond cut shredder "weve had instances where the people on drugs will take the time to tape shredded information back together " mr baclagan said using a cross cut or diamond cut shredder prevents that still some dont think shredding is the solution "i dont bother shredding although if i have a statement with my bank account number on it ill either file it or rip it right where the account number is " ms litan said how does ms litan stay safe "i check my accounts as often as possible i never give my bank account number online " she said plus she uses her credit card rather than a debit card "i never worry about my credit card because i know im getting my money back "
