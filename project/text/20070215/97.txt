the first reductions of street homelessness in years we are writing in response to the jan letter to the editor from dave oneill "why most of the homeless are intractable in face of attempts to help them " the letter is a criticism of julia vitullo martins jan editorial page essay "homeless in america " the content of his missive indicates that mr oneill needs to immerse himself in the data and results emerging from around the country he dismisses the rapid re housing approach that has been adopted by cities and counties across the country resulting in the first reductions of street homelessness in our nation in years the provision of customer preferred cost effective permanent supportive housing solutions works precisely because we have learned from the failures of deinstitutionalization we no longer need mr oneill to point out that the well intentioned policy of deinstitutionalization had the unintended consequence of pervasive street homelessness in our country we know and see that what we do need now is to solve the problem not simply analyze it endlessly thats why mayors and governors across the country have partnered with the bush administration to create nonpartisan initiatives on behalf of the most disabled that partnership has created visible and measurable results as ms vitullo martin rightly reports mr oneills contention that investment in housing innovations including housing first will not make an impact is refuted by the thousands of formerly homeless people experiencing mental illness now living in permanent supportive housing and by the research that demonstrates a retention rate in that housing of the reductions in homelessness on city streets are not the result of ineffective and costly police sweeps but of an investment in innovative solutions cost studies from around the country are clear permanent supportive housing is less expensive for many of the population and more effective when compared with the high cost of the population randomly ricocheting through expensive health and law enforcement systems while it may be hard for those removed from the streets to understand the therapeutic impact of a room of ones own formerly homeless people do when we visit them theyre clear privacy support and restored dignity move them beyond demoralization and dependency to remoralization and dignity here is what a formerly homeless disabled veteran now living in his own room after years on the street told me recently as he held up his new keychain "you could send the army the navy and the marines here and theyd never get these keys from me " after years of managing the failures of deinstitutionalization and the status quo that has maintained the misery this country is embracing the innovations that make sense to the customers common sense to the policy makers and dollars and sense to the taxpayer we have changed the verb of homelessness from managing to ending the status quo of undoable "good intentions" will not change our vocabulary or our intent philip f mangano executive director u s interagency council on homelessness washington the letter is also signed by dr dennis culhane university of pennsylvania commissioner robert hess new york city department of homeless services dr sam tsemberis founder and executive director pathways to housing new york city
