climate changes cold economics industry efforts to fight global warming might hit consumers pockets with mandatory curbs on u s global warming emissions looking increasingly likely in the next several years industries are starting to argue over who will pay for the cleanup one thing is clear whatever the cost it will get passed along to consumers a new report from the utility industrys think tank the electric power research institute says the u s utility sector could ratchet back its global warming emissions to levels by that would be a major feat given that emissions are projected to rise significantly over the next few decades but congress is unlikely to boost taxpayer funded energy research by enough to develop the necessary technologies says jeffry sterba chairman of the institute who is expected to present the study today at an energy industry conference one option he said utilities are considering proposing that the government allow them to tack an additional modest charge onto consumers electric bills to raise roughly &# billion a year to cover the cost as the democrats who now control congress start pushing for federal global warming regulations industry heavyweights are changing their stance on the issue exxon mobil corp which has long opposed emission constraints now is talking about how such rules should be structured and the edison electric institute the electric utility industrys chief trade group announced last week that it is dropping its longstanding opposition to mandatory emission limits the corporate change is a concession to political reality even if they would prefer not to have an emissions limit industries targeted by regulators are angling to shape whatever they get slapped with to minimize their portion of the bill the electric power research institutes study estimates some of the potential costs of an effort to curb u s global warming emissions and puts a lengthy timeline on the task it reflects a message likely to be heard increasingly from heavily emitting industries they are confident they will be able to develop technologies to reduce global warming emissions if politicians consumers and certain other industries are willing to foot the bill that "if" shows how the global warming debate is moving beyond political rhetoric to questions of economic reality achieving that emissions cut in the power industry the nations biggest source of global warming emissions would require aggressively rolling out a broad array of technologies some of which arent yet economically proven the study says among those technologies energy efficiency improvements for instance in buildings and appliances to slow the projected growth in electricity demand increases in the penetration of renewable and nuclear power higher efficiency coal fired power plants and capturing the carbon dioxide emitted from power plants and storing the global warming gas underground developing the necessary technologies so they could be widely deployed will require roughly &# billion more in annual low carbon energy research spending in the u s the epri says thats money beyond the approximately &# billion the institute says the federal government currently invests each year in that area the power industry could raise the roughly &# billion a year for new clean energy research by increasing the average u s electric customers rate by cent a kilowatt hour said mr sterba who stressed the utility industry hasnt yet proposed such a fee that would increase the average americans monthly electric bill about to &# from &# according to government data epri officials believe the &# billion collected would advance the technologies to a point where they are economically competitive with conventional technologies the expectation is that private investors then would be willing to finance deployment of the technologies because then they could earn an attractive profit the officials said mr sterba the chairman and chief executive of pnm resources a new mexico utility says the study suggests that the cost of addressing global warming is significant but not insurmountable "im concerned we may be being a little bit naive" about the likely costs he said "at the same time i think there are people who may be being a bit too gloom and doom " the study also marks an attempt by the utility industry to deflect regulators attention to other sectors of the economy that utilities argue are ripe for emission cuts themselves utilities will need decades to develop technologies to significantly cut their emissions mr sterba said but other industries capable of reducing their emissions more quickly and cheaply should be asked to do their share among the technologies the study proposes to bring emissions back down to levels for instance is the widespread sale of so called "plug in" hybrid vehicles plug in hybrids would get even better fuel economy than todays gasoline and electric hybrid cars because they would get more of their power from their electrical system requiring the cars to be plugged into electrical outlets to be recharged but deploying plug in hybrids widely would require big shifts by auto makers in addition taking steps to preserve more trees and inducing farmers to change the way they till their land would be lower cost and quicker ways to begin reducing emissions than relying solely on the utility sector for the bulk of the cuts mr sterba said trees and soil absorb carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas other studies are coming to similar conclusions a new report by consultant mckinsey &amp co argues that the least expensive options to curb global warming emissions are some of the most basic improving the energy efficiency of buildings air conditioners and lights for instance and planting more trees such moves will be cheaper than some higher technology methods such as capturing the co that is emitted from power plants and then burying that co underground mckinsey says the cheaper options do present a political hurdle the mckinsey report notes they involve "billions of small emitters often consumers rather than a limited number of big companies already subject to heavy regulation "
