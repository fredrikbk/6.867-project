hussains lawyer mr lenihan says his client wasnt trying to flee the country but was going to costa rica and nicaragua for business and charity purposes he argues that prosecutors have singled out his client in part because of his middle eastern sounding name when others at the company were also responsible "this thing was not set up as a scheme to defraud people " he says "this is what happens to good people with a good idea and lousy timing who get into trouble " mr hussains trial is scheduled for april investors and others have filed &# million of claims in bankruptcy court mr cayo says he has defaulted on the three condos he bought because broken pipes have made them unrentable mr cortes continues to make payments on his unit the waldengreen complex which fell into disrepair last fall

that he "never saw people strong armed to invest the sad part is people lined up to invest their money it was the whole furor of the real estate market "
