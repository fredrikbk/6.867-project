the expat life chair skates and sled dogs in a manchurian wonderland online edition how do you celebrate a mild winter in beijing for us the answer was heading north to harbin about a one and a half hour flight away in northern manchuria the capital of heilongjiang province harbin is famous for its russian influence and extreme temperatures a lot of people particularly chinese thought we were nuts to drag our kids up there one of rebeccas colleagues asked if we were trying to make "kidsicles " on the hourlong drive from the airport to our hotel on a frigid friday night with gusts of wind blowing snow across our path i felt as much on the other side of the world as i ever have in china the van moved slowly over an icy empty highway as we drove through what appeared to be miles of barren white fields illuminated by a full moon we were joined by our friends the carberrys and the bleak landscape had all of us wondering just where we were harbin however is far from an obscure or particularly daring trip many people we know visited the weekend prior to or following our jaunt we met another group of beijingers for dinner and ran into still more friends and acquaintances around town and on the planes both coming and going frigid old harbin has managed to become a trendy winter destination despite the distinct possibility of subzero temperatures the city with a population of about million is located on the songhua river which was in the news last year for a horrible chemical spill and has an interesting history its development began with the russian invasion of manchuria at the end of the th century and the subsequent building by russia of the chinese eastern railway many refugees also fled there after both world war i and the russian revolution it reputedly once had the largest russian population of any city outside the soviet union parts of the city retain a uniquely old world european flavor there are two old synagogues one of which is now a museum the other a school and an impressive russian orthodox church at least i hear its impressive we barely saw any of that stuff the draw for us and for most of those we know was the eighth annual ice and snow festival and we spent most of our time in harbin trekking around from one wintry attraction to another if i had to sum up our trip in two words they would be ice slides they were plentiful and our kids couldnt get enough whether the mode of transport was burlap sacks their own bottoms or large inner tubes we found our first slide on saturday morning the hotel recommended we start our day in a nearby park and all eight of us piled into two cabs which dropped us off in a wind whipped parking lot we walked along a bluff above the huge frozen river looking down on a fleet of rickety ferries frozen for the season at odd angles i was happy to be wearing my fathers heavy down parka purchased when he lived in alaska years ago "when eddie bauer was eddie bauer " we all took multiple runs down a fast moving ice slide smashing into a snow bank at the bottom then took sled dog rides which left us feeling bad for the poor german shepherds and st bernards pulling us along the frozen river the kids then ran over to a cleared off "rink" for a round of chair skating a unique chinese sport that is exactly what it sounds like you sit on chairs equipped with skates and propel yourself around using short sharp poles ready for a break we entered a teahouse atop the hill in some sort of municipal building in an adjoining room a bunch of old men played mahjong beneath a huge photo of smiling bare chested winter river swimmers and former premier jiang zemin clad in a thick overcoat and fur hat im fairly certain that two of the mahjong players were in the photo a corner table was filled with hats gloves russian nesting dolls and various fur products including fox stoles with the heads attached a man ran over blowing cigarette smoke in my face and put one of the foxes on my shoulders when i shook my head he removed it and placed on my head a hunting cap lined with thick red fur it felt nice and warm he smiled showing crooked teeth and proclaimed "hao kan hao kan " looks good he picked up the fox stole and shook it around pointing at the head then at the hat indicating it was fox fur he wanted yuan more than &# i laughed and said no he yelled " " then " " i threw out "" and he eagerly agreed even after i asked him to throw in a nesting doll rebecca rolled her eyes when i walked out wearing my new chapeau but eli loved the dolls we entered a nice tree lined park down the river where our kids joined others on a playground and we watched a couple playing ping pong on one of the tables you frequently see in chinese parks clearly harbin residents didnt let temperatures in the low teens keep them inside we rode a gondola over to an island and the view from hundreds of feet up was impressive indeed large horse sleds trotted across the river and clusters of men used jackhammers to drill ice fishing holes i maintained my composure despite a creeping sense of dread as the gondola swayed in the high wind on the other side we showed our return tickets and continued around only to stop at the edge of the station two ladies emerged laughing and gave us a big joint push my heart thumped in my throat at the idea of needing a push start to propel two families hundreds of feet into the chinese air no one else seemed to share my fears so i struggled to stay calm the kids all enjoyed trying on my hat but looking at them i had a sickening realization theres no way that fur originated on anything other than a dog serves me right for buying fur at all it has never touched my head again we remained active all day finding another slide filled stretch of park eating a quick and greasy noodle lunch returning to the hotel for a swim and hitting a russian restaurant for dinner with an unwieldy but fun group of beijing expats both the concept and the company were far better than the dreary food by the time we made it to the packed parking lot of the ice and snow festival we were all verging on meltdown it cost a relatively extravagant yuan to get in but as we entered it became clear we were all out of juice we took a horse drawn sleigh ride through the massive fields filled with beautifully lit ice replicas of the great wall and parthenon among many other impressive structures then left agreeing to pay five times the metered rate for the short ride to our hotel furthered the feeling that harbin connects a vacuum cleaner to your wallet when you enter the city limits we had lots of grand ideas for the following day ranging from a visit to a siberian tiger park to church and synagogue exploration but we ditched them all in favor of a return trip to the ice fest the parking lot was empty in such sharp contrast to the prior nights festive atmosphere that we thought it was closed it was open and mostly empty save for a large number of workers many enjoying the slides they had presumably created using scrap lumber and metal as sleds and insisting we do the same on a tubing hill some of them asked if they could carry anna up and slide her down while others followed us around watching the kids with great interest i was just as intrigued watching their fellows work on constructing a replica of the citys famous church its sides covered with scaffolding as a crane hefted huge blocks of ice into place the real thing couldnt have been all that much more interesting right well return to find out next year have you visited someplace that felt like the other side of the earth has travel euphoria ever prompted you to make a ridiculous purchase have you ever visited an ice festival or tried chair skating im looking forward to hearing from you share your thoughts write to alan paul at expatlife dowjones com
