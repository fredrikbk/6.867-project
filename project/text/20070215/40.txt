good ways to pack up and move your files into a new computer ok so youve got a new computer and now youre facing the hassle of how to migrate all your stuff programs files settings from the old machine to the new one how can you do it in the quickest simplest manner here are three common scenarios and how to handle them windows xp to windows vista microsoft has built a decent migration utility into the new vista version of windows its called windows easy transfer it allows you to migrate folders and files email accounts and messages settings and favorites windows easy transfer can be used to manage a migration over a network via burned cds or dvds or with external hard disks but i tested it only with the simplest approach the one microsoft recommends a special cable called an easy transfer cable the best known of these is made by belkin it costs &# and is available in electronics stores and from www belkin com easytransfercable it works only if your old computer is running the very latest version of windows xp called sp in my test i first installed the software for the belkin cable on my old windows xp machine vista can handle it out of the box i then plugged in the cable and used windows easy transfer on both machines following the instructions as i went along the process was simple and quick it transferred over files totaling gigabytes documents music pictures videos and more in about minutes the files and settings were placed in a new user identity on the vista pc windows easy transfer even lets you select which items to move and which to skip if you want but there are some downsides windows easy transfer doesnt move programs so you will have to reinstall these manually microsoft is testing a program that will move programs called windows easy transfer companion you can download it at microsoft com downloads also i got a blue screen crash shortly after the transfer completed but the computer worked after a restart i also tested another program that can use the belkin cable or a similar cable sold by its publisher pcmover by laplink software it costs &# or &# with the cable but has the advantage of moving programs as well as files and settings in my tests it worked fine transferring roughly gigabytes of programs and files in about three hours it also set up a new user identity on the vista pc for the transferred material however pcmover can only move all of your stuff it doesnt allow you to choose which items to move worse one of the transferred programs wouldnt work on the vista computer because it lacked some underlying components moving programs this way is a hit or miss proposition because of the hideously complicated manner in which windows stores programs on the hard disk and because some windows programs wont "activate " or run on a pc other than the one on which they were first installed another alternative is a retractable cable called the tornado which costs &# at www thetornado com the beauty of this product is that it requires no software installation the software is built in and just appears when you plug in the cable the downside is that the software is entirely manual you have to select then drag and drop folders and files between two windows representing the two computers in my tests it worked fine but was tedious and unless youre a techie you wouldnt be able to use it easily to transfer settings and programs because you wouldnt know where to find all of the files needed windows xp to macintosh if you bought a new apple macintosh instead of a vista pc the process of moving your files is even easier no cable is needed when you buy a mac in an apple retail store apple will transfer your pictures music movies and other documents from your windows pc to your new mac free of charge if you bought the mac elsewhere including apples online store an apple retail store will perform the data transfer for &# if you plan to run windows on your mac using the &# parallels software from parallels the company will soon release the final version of a utility called transporter this program can transfer all the contents of a real windows pc into the windows environment on a mac but it works only over a network and the files it moves wont be easily accessible by mac programs details are at www parallels com products desktop transporter i havent tested either of these procedures macintosh to macintosh for years all new macs have come with an excellent built in migration utility that in my experience is simple quick and comprehensive it works via a firewire cable available for as little as &# at electronics stores it moves all types of files settings and even programs and lets you choose which types to move i have used this process multiple times in recent years it has never failed me and typically has required two to five hours whatever computer you buy migration is now easier than ever if not perfect email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
