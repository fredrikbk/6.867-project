backlash endangers california pot dispensaries santa barbara calif for years when janet seaboyer sought relief from her frequent bouts of anxiety she went to the compassionate center of santa barbara and ordered from a marijuana menu that featured chocolate pecan truffles and cannabis strains with names like purple urkle and sweet and sour but the compassionate center shut down at the end of october and the year old ms seaboyer who says she has suffered from epilepsy since childhood is considering going back to clandestine street purchasing "i wouldnt want to but if i have no other choice thats what id have to do " she says californians legalized marijuana for medical use in when they passed proposition but a recent crackdown in this southern california enclave and elsewhere in the state by the federal drug enforcement administration has forced a number of dispensaries out of business and highlighted the awkward tension between state and federal laws california has an estimated medical marijuana dispensaries according to the marijuana policy project a nonprofit group that backs medical use of the drug their number rose sharply after a state senate bill strengthened the law initially confined to big cities like los angeles and san francisco the dispensaries cropped up in smaller communities across the state nestled between the pacific ocean and the santa ynez mountains santa barbara is known for being one of the poshest communities in the nation in the past few years it also became home to a thriving medical marijuana business the citys new cottage industry really started to flourish a year ago when the city council passed measure p an order mandating that pot arrests should be the santa barbara police departments lowest priority and that a city appointed board must review all such arrests santa barbara mayor marty blum says new dispensaries sought licenses to operate in town which brought the total figure to about for a population of just but the sudden sprouting caused some problems and they got worse a few months ago when an incident outside a dispensary drew a public outcry linda vega was teaching a flamenco class when a gang fight erupted in front of a dispensary two doors down forcing parents strolling by with their children to seek refuge in the courtyard of her dance studio appalled ms vega and more than other concerned residents gathered for a neighborhood meeting to air their complaints the incident increased the tension between people like ms vega who want the dispensaries closed and patients and their doctors who say the sites offer a safe appropriate environment in which to purchase cannabis to alleviate various ailments joseph rodino a former masonry manager bought his marijuana from the same dispensary as ms seaboyer he says he needs it to stimulate his appetite and relieve discomfort from hepatitis c a virus that afflicts the liver and causes pain and fatigue mr rodino who formerly bought the drug on the street from dealers says the dispensaries do away with "all the furtive sneaking around and that whole drug world sort of thing by making this a really simple business transaction for something that you need " but ms vega doesnt buy that argument she says the dispensary next to her studio called acme became a magnet for the same riffraff that street dealers attract the only difference she says is it had the veneer of being a legal business "it wasnt people with cancer who needed it they were hoodlums " she says acmes owner glen mowrer says the problem wasnt as bad as ms vega makes it out to be and that last summers fight had nothing to do with the dispensary itself the nearby "low income housing has something to do with gang members not acme " he says in any case the growing controversy has prompted the santa barbara city council to impose a moratorium on new dispensaries the city is currently developing draft ordinances to regulate the dispensaries that the city council will vote on in the coming months it is considering a conditional use fee permit that would restrict dispensaries to areas away from schools homes and parks "thats most of our city so its challenging " says mayor blum patrick fourmy one of the compassionate centers founders maintains that his dispensary offered a legitimate medical service the center had clients including he says people from "the district attorneys office the police department and chief executive officers from fortune companies " patients there were served only if they had a doctors "recommendation " by law prescriptions can be written only for fda approved medications since the centers storefront closed it has been operating a delivery service while it tries to reopen a brick and mortar establishment but the food and drug administration maintains that marijuana offers no health benefits and that its possession and sale remain banned by federal law last year the fda issued an advisory with other federal agencies stating that "no sound scientific studies" support medical use of the drug the dispensaries critics have found an ally in the federal government when the dea which has raided about dispensaries in the state since issued notices to santa barbara dispensary landlords threatening to seize their properties several operations closed including mr mowrers acme he says his mother owns the property and he doesnt want to risk losing it joshua braun owned another local dispensary hortipharm caregivers for years but in light of the recent actions by federal authorities he says he turned the business over to others mr braun thought measure p and the initial acceptance by santa barbaras community would insulate him from such problems but he says the federal government has found an effective tool to discourage the business "landlords here have a lot more to lose " says mr braun "theyre going to lose a building not worth &# but &# million "
