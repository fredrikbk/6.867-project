its mortgage assets by &# billion suffer its first quarterly loss since going public in and take a &# billion investment from china to help restore its capital base morgan stanley is the fourth financial behemoth to announce a massive write down as the crisis arising from the u s home mortgage business spreads through global financial markets chief executives at the other three citigroup inc merrill lynch &amp co and ubs ag have lost their jobs after reporting losses that ranged from &# billion to &# billion like ubs and citigroup morgan stanley is getting a cash infusion from a foreign government it announced that a chinese investment fund will pay &# billion for an eventual stake governments and financial regulators are working feverishly to maintain confidence with both the u s federal reserve and european central bank pumping vast sums into money markets to ensure financial institutions have both the cash and the faith in each others solvency to continue doing business for mr mack who turned last month and has a five year employment agreement that runs through the losses unveiled yesterday are a profound setback to a business approach he has championed mr mack took over as chief executive in after a battle led by alumni of the firm to oust his predecessor philip purcell mr mack pushed morgan stanley to wager more of its money on big trades and investments and once admonished the firms bankers at an internal meeting "youve lost your swagger " morgan stanley has taken some big risks with its own money it made bearish bets against assets backed by subprime mortgages and the bets were profitable at first but partly to hedge its positions the firm bought mortgage backed assets that it thought were safer when those assets also plunged in value the profits turned into huge losses the size of the losses is prompting criticism against mr mack a veteran wall street executive who rose through the bond division ranks at morgan stanley to become the firms president morgan stanleys board backed mr mack at a meeting last week a person familiar with the session said mr mack already had been under scrutiny because of a few key decisions related to the mortgage finance business including standing by a co president zoe cruz whom he had known for many years he ousted her three weeks ago for her role in the mortgage losses in addition under mr macks watch morgan stanley in february paid &# billion for a credit card company goldfish only to see its value written down by &# million a few weeks ago he acquired a subprime mortgage company saxon capital inc for &# million last december even as warnings about the subprime storm were being sounded "hes a chronic destroyer of value " said kevin murphy a former morgan stanley airline analyst who is now retired and recently sold his stock "hes a nice person but you put this guy in the corner office and theres an x factor where he hurts himself " others said mr macks achievements outweigh the bad quarter "we still think hes the right guy here " said eric veiel an analyst at t rowe price group inc which owns million morgan stanley shares "i think he has the confidence of the troops and a lot of his decisions have been good " among the good decisions mr veiel said was recruiting james gorman the former head of the brokerage force at merrill lynch who has improved the results at the former dean witter brokerage mack supporters at the firm say he has delivered record or near record results in most businesses this is mr macks second term at morgan stanley he quit after clashing with mr purcell and served as a top executive at credit suisse group for three years before returning in triumph upon mr purcells dethroning a charismatic former college football player with a lilting north carolina accent mr mack has cultivated an image of smooth skill and political finesse he is frequently mentioned for a top washington job if the presidential candidate he is backing hillary clinton is elected before mr mack arrived the firm had been more risk averse chastened by losses in emerging markets in and telecom bonds in mr mack decided to ramp up proprietary trading in which the firm bets its own money in part to keep up with wall street peers who were emphasizing their trading businesses in mid in a pep talk to bankers mr mack expressed frustration that rival goldman sachs which has made big proprietary bets was setting the standard for morgan stanley instead of the other way round when mr mack took over he rejected a demand from purcell opponents that he dump ms cruz a purcell loyalist as a result some morgan stanley alumni including star banker joseph perella and vikram pandit refused to return to the firm mr pandit later ended up at citigroup and became its ceo this month mr mack said later that he didnt want to put the firm through more trauma by ousting ms cruz ms cruz promoted new trading and risk management lieutenants in recent years current and former executives say ms cruz set a tone in which she didnt welcome dissent once higher ups made decisions about trades these people say communication broke down among some of the key decision makers involved in vetting the mortgage trades a spokeswoman for ms cruz didnt have immediate comment in the quarter ended nov morgan stanleys largest business institutional securities posted a pretax loss of &# billion down from a &# billion profit in the fourth quarter of mainly due to the mortgage write downs the net loss for the quarter was &# billion or &# a share compared with year earlier net income of &# billion or &# a share the losses overshadowed several bright spots as advisory revenues rose to &# million and stock sales and trading revenues rose to &# billion those results plus the chinese investment helped morgan stanley stock rise &# or to &# at p m trading on the new york stock exchange in a call with investors mr mack said the losses were "embarrassing" to him personally as well as the firm he said he would forgo any bonus for the year after enjoying a &# million pay package last year but morgan said it would attempt to keep up bonus levels in many parts of the firm by paying out of revenues above the going rate at many wall street firms of mr mack said on the call that the losses resulted from "an error of judgment that occurred on one desk in our fixed income area and a failure to manage that risk appropriately " the ceo told employees at a meeting yesterday the worst part of the write down was believing and stating that the magnitude was one number and then discovering it was two times that much morgan stanley had said last month its write down for september and october was &# billion less than half the eventual &# billion figure for the full quarter despite the miscues mr mack may end up keeping his job because of a paucity of executive talent on wall street with the experience and knowledge to run a large organization in addition mr mack has many fans within morgan stanley unlike merrills recently ousted ceo stan oneal who had irked and pushed out many well liked executives analysts predict merrills total mortgage related hit will top morgan stanleys and could hit &# billion or more once it reports fourth quarter results next month a merrill spokesman declined to comment although morgan stanley has trimmed its sails slightly by reducing its total assets by to &# trillion mr mack said the firm would continue to take risks "weve been sprinting " he said on the call with analysts "well be jogging for a while but we will still be in the market taking risk "
