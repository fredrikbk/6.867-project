politics &amp economics change in seoul may enliven economy president elect lee to welcome competition foreign investors tougher line with pyongyang seoul south korea south koreas newly elected president likely will make the country more inviting to foreign investors and competition while taking a firmer line with north korea lee myung bak a businessman who later became mayor of seoul will be inaugurated as president in february after which he plans to invigorate south koreas economy through public spending and cuts in taxes he also wants to build a cross country waterway and to pursue more free trade deals like a u s pact reached earlier this year to deal with north korea he says he will keep communication open with pyongyang but link future aid to the norths nuclear weapons disarmament that tougher stance is closer to the u s approach than the all carrots policy of south koreas current president roh moo hyun at a news conference thursday mr lee said his administration is likely to be more critical of the north mr rohs government rarely discussed the norths human rights violations and other problems "i think unconditionally avoiding criticism of north korea would not be appropriate " mr lee said "if we try to point out north koreas shortcomings with affection i think that would go a long way toward improving north korean society " mr lee also said he would quickly organize a team to seek foreign investment which has declined in recent years "we will explain to foreign investors that south korea is a good country to invest " he said with all the ballots counted mr lee the nominee from the conservative grand national party had won of the votes in yesterdays election his nearest opponent chung dong young garnered mr chung was the nominee from the united new democratic party the centrist party that along with its predecessors has ruled the country for a decade the election marked a shift in priorities for south koreans away from politics and toward the economy in previous elections voters wanted to break old ties among the military business and government and to shake off other vestiges of the authoritarian rule of the s and s this time the economy was the major focus south koreas output grew an average of annually during the five years under mr roh that was slower than other major asian economies other than japan and slower than south koreas previous growth voters thought the economy had been allowed to slip the country now suffers from problems seen in industrialized countries such as higher labor costs and high real estate prices and is burdened by rising oil and commodity prices it imports nearly all of its energy and of its food mr lee appealed to voters because of his experience as a chief executive officer in the hyundai conglomerate and as mayor of seoul the nations capital "i dont care about the past " lim yoo soon years old and a housewife in seoul said after voting for mr lee "id vote for anyone who made the economy better lee seems to have the power to drive things " though dogged by questions about his business ethics mr lee led presidential surveys by big margins throughout the year in interviews and speeches before the election he said he would invite more foreign investment and competition into south korea in part to spur innovation and growth mr lee said he would negotiate more free trade agreements building on mr rohs deal with the u s which was the biggest economic accomplishment of his presidency such deals come with controversy while they clearly benefit south korean exporters and consumers they also force the country to lower barriers protecting domestic industries because of this mr roh excluded crucial segments of south koreas agriculture industry including rice from the u s pact mr lees presidency also could be strongly influenced by north korea if that country builds on the small steps it shut down and began to dismantle its nuclear plant it took this year to end its nuclear weapons program south korea the u s and three other countries are dangling huge economic incentives in front of north korean dictator kim jong il to try to persuade him to stop building nuclear weapons to keep receiving the energy and financial incentives north korea must disclose dec the full extent of its weapons program and nuclear arsenal separately mr roh recently promised the south would pay for new tourism projects and build shipyards and highways in the north with no strings attached mr lee says he will review such programs and link their completion to progress in denuclearization "he will try to maintain the economic assistance to north korea but it will be in a more pragmatic way " says ha young sun a professor of international relations at seoul national university the presidency of mr lee could start under a cloud the undp led national assembly earlier this week passed legislation appointing a special prosecutor to investigate mr lees involvement in a failed investment business whose principal has been indicted for fraud mr lee was cleared of wrongdoing in two previous investigations of the investment company the most recent by national prosecutors earlier this month even if the new probe timed to end just before his inauguration in late february resulted in an indictment mr lee wouldnt face trial because a sitting korean president cant face trial for anything less than a capital crime on the day before the election mr lee dismissed the new investigation as a last ditch political maneuver "even if they investigate me times or times the results will not change " he said "there is only one truth " still the issue cost mr lee some votes jung jung jin a year old tax accountant in suburban seoul said he decided not to vote for mr lee after a video was broadcast sunday of the candidate talking about the investment firm in a speech "politics could fall into chaos because he still needs to be investigated " says mr jung who voted for lee hoi chang an independent who had been the gnps candidate in the previous two elections mr lees margin of victory was the widest since south korea became a democracy years ago far exceeding the previous record margin of percentage points in the election south korea elects presidents to a single five year term and winners need only a plurality of votes while mr lees victory was largely because of voter perceptions that south koreas economy is in trouble both of his predecessors took office in periods of greater economic difficulty than now kim dae jung was elected in just a month after south koreas economy nearly collapsed from a rapidly devaluing currency and the weight of overinvestment by conglomerates and financial institutions mr roh took power in as south korea experienced a sharp slowdown in growth because of mounting household credit woes and soaring oil prices before the u s invasion of iraq
