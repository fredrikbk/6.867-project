politics &amp economics eu vehicle emissions plan could stir industry fight european regulators unveiled proposed financial penalties to give teeth to an effort to slash auto emissions by setting up a fight next year between regulators and europes auto makers the european commission the european unions executive arm yesterday detailed long awaited proposed legislation that attempts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide a global warming gas from new cars while spreading the costs broadly among manufacturers the move came the same day the u s passed tighter fuel efficiency standards for new cars and light trucks which could affect a brewing national debate about emissions as expected the legislation would base limits on vehicle weight with targets becoming more lenient along a curve as vehicles get heavier that is a concession to german car makers whose fleets are skewed toward powerful cars with relatively high emissions levels the commissions proposal would impose hefty financial penalties phased in over several years beginning in that industry officials said they would oppose in the case of volkswagen ag the penalties could total as much as billion euros &# billion roughly half the companys net income based on one estimate by european automobile manufacturers association an industry lobbying group in brussels that criticized the proposal as excessive volkswagen is a member of the group the commissions proposal is expected to raise new car prices in europe by roughly euros on average eu officials said however they said their research indicated that price increases would be largely offset by lower fuel bills the commissions proposal must be approved by the european parliament a process that is expected to take months by regulators want to reduce the average level of carbon dioxide emitted by europes new car fleet to grams per kilometer compared with about grams now the commission said it will hold car makers accountable for reducing the industry fleet average to grams with a further reduction of grams coming from "other technological improvements" and increased use of biofuels passenger cars are responsible for about of carbon dioxide emissions in the eu although europes auto industry has reduced its average carbon dioxide emissions as part of a voluntary agreement with eu officials in the late s the pace of its cuts has slowed in recent years that is because of a trend toward heavier better equipped and more powerful vehicles the eus effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles has divided much of europe french and italian politicians had lobbied the commission to adopt limits that put most of the burden of carbon dioxide reduction on heavier higher emitting cars germany had demanded a formula that gives greater leeway to heavier vehicles hoping to protect manufacturers such as bmw ag and daimler ags mercedes benz that have traditionally specialized in powerful sedans and sports cars in the end the commission disappointed car makers in both regions adopting a complex formula that takes weight into account though not to the extent german car makers had wanted arndt ellinghorst an auto industry analyst with credit suisse said the commissions proposal is a "relative win" for germanys premium car makers because their customers who tend to be affluent can more easily afford price increases than customers of mass market car makers such as italys fiat spa and frances renault sa the commissions proposal contains some concessions intended to help manufacturers avoid being hit with financial penalties it would let companies form "pools" with one another so a company with lower emissions could help compensate for a company with higher emissions companies that make fewer than vehicles annually and dont wish to join a pool would be allowed to apply to the commission for permission to set an individual target david gauthier villars in paris contributed to this article
