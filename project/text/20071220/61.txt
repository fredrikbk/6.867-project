deep junk rating of "ccc " a heavy blow for the financial guarantor which depends on a sound credit standing for access to capital and to get business s&amp p said it had "significant doubt" that the company can come up with the capital needed to resolve its problems the company said last night that it is working to stabilize its finances aca insures the interest and principal payments on bonds committing to pay investors if a bond issuer defaults initially this business was tied to the stable municipal bond market but in the past few years aca wrote insurance on more than &# billion of securities backed by mortgages and corporate debt a big chunk of these were known as collateralized debt obligations or cdos that pooled risky subprime bonds whose value has deteriorated substantially in recent months many buyers of this insurance were large wall street firms and banks including merrill lynch &amp co canadian imperial bank of commerce and others that are now potentially exposed to additional losses cibc yesterday warned it may have to take up to a &# billion charge on its cdo holdings insured by aca prompting fitch ratings to place the canadian banks own "aa " credit rating on

environment in a statement last night aca said it has entered into a forbearance agreement with its counterparties that will help it avoid defaulting on its guarantees until jan it said it was surprised at the magnitude of s&amp ps downgrade and plans to work with its counterparties to find "a more permanent solution to stabilize its liquidity and capital position " "the future looks tenuous for aca its hard to see how they will make it through this without outside help " said david havens an analyst at ubs securities investors and analysts had been bracing for the aca downgrade for weeks still it is unclear exactly how the sharp downgrade will affect the financial institutions that bought credit guarantees from the insurer these guarantees have acted as hedges for some of these banks helping them to keep some of the risk of their mortgage holdings off their balance sheets if the guarantees become void the banks may have to make further write downs on their own cdo

missed their opportunity its over for aca " said sean egan managing director of egan jones an independent credit rating firm "its going to be nearly impossible to stop the slide of this company " and nothing short of a multibillion dollar cash infusion can save it he added s&amp p yesterday also adjusted its views on several other bond insurers which are better capitalized than aca but are also
