kiwi goes beyond shine in effort to step up sales for a century kiwi shoe polish remained pretty much the same just over one ounce of colored wax in a palm size tin embossed with the image of a kiwi bird but about two years ago sara lee corp whose predecessor company consolidated foods corp acquired the brand in interviewed people in eight countries about their shoe care needs what it learned was "a shocker " says kiwi president paco casa people dont care nearly as much about the shine on their shoes as they do about how fresh and comfortable they are on the inside on a list of more than attributes people desired in their shoes shine ranked merely th since then kiwi has unveiled a slew of new products including "freshins" thin lightly fragranced shoe inserts for women and "smiling feet" a line of cushions for heels and the balls of feet antislip pads and strips that can be placed behind the straps of high heel sling back shoes it has also emerged as a test case for chief executive brenda barness effort to revive the long stagnant conglomerate best known for its cheesecake "it became clear innovation was a key value of ours " ms barnes says but innovation itself wasnt enough she says products had to be informed by the needs and desires of consumers something that had been lacking for many years at the sluggish company when ms barnes became ceo in february she immediately called on employees around the world to help develop a vision for the company executives held focus groups with employees around the world and then synthesized the findings products that emerged included soft &amp smooth whole grain white bread driven by kids telling sara lee marketers that they dont like brown bread and parents saying they want their kids to eat something more nutritious than white bread and volution an air freshener that rotates through three scents every minutes while sales at kiwi and the company overall are up profits have been squeezed by increased spending on research and development and marketing but the way kiwi responded to the new focus on innovation shows how ms barness efforts to push people to think outside the box or inside the shoe are beginning to pay off kiwi was launched in by william ramsay a scottish born businessman who had a shoe polish and disinfectant company in australia when he developed a new brand of shoe polish he named it kiwi after the wingless bird that is the national symbol of new zealand his wifes native country sara lee executives learned that shoes and the way people wear them have changed over the years since kiwi was founded todays footwear is made less from leather and more from canvas and synthetic materials even the military one of kiwis best customers since world war i had been moving away from leather partly because so much fighting now takes place in the middle east where desert sand makes canvas more sensible most consumers today are more likely to toss out worn shoes than work to keep them in good condition women a huge market kiwi had never targeted are most concerned about having comfortable fresh smelling shoes for sara lee it was clear that kiwi needed to become a foot care brand without losing its edge as the worlds shoe care expert the task of making it happen dubbed project "galileo" fell first to kiwi researchers in an r&amp d center in the netherlands they knew all about shoe polish but they had to consult foot doctors and physiologists to understand foot anatomy and how bacteria trigger odor buildup in shoes and instead of just showing focus groups drawings of new shoe polishes as they had in the past they had to develop prototypes that customers could actually put on their feet "you can tell them an insole is thin but how thin is it and will it fit in their shoe if their shoe is already tight " says greetje folkerts kiwis manager of new product development along with the fragrant shoe inserts and other in shoe products for women the work also produced new fresheners for sneakers and mens shoes insoles for athletic shoes single use polishes and more products to protect shoes from weather "i remember when kiwi shared with me their new products " ms barnes recalls "i said i can relate to that id rather throw my shoes out than polish them and if you can bring me something to make them more comfortable ill buy that " but not everyone was immediately sold on the idea when it came to designing the packaging for the new products the marketing people disagreed about whether to add any images beyond the iconic bird after much debate the six global kiwi marketing directors finally decided that on some of the new polishes theyd show images of shoes and when the sara lee sales representatives who call on big retailers like wal mart and tesco were told theyd have to sell the new products "they looked at their sales directors like they were mad " mr casa says "they said kiwi is a round tin mainly for men and now youre coming to us with colorful products called smiling feet its not serious " there was another consideration entrenched competition schering ploughs foot care segment which is made up largely of the venerable dr scholls brand produced more than &# million in revenue in sara lee wouldnt break out what percentage of kiwis sales were made up of the new foot care products but the brands overall sales including polishes last year were &# million with all that in mind the sales force decided that rather than talk about the new product themselves they would tell retailers how they were going to remake the shoe care aisle they developed a new merchandising system in which they group their womens products athletic products and traditional shoe shine products by color moves intended to make the shoe care aisle easier to shop the new products were first rolled out in spain and have since been spreading across europe and the u s theyll enter new markets around the world next year kiwis sales in fiscal rose to &# million contributing about of sara lees &# billion in annual revenue "i am absolutely sure the sales trends on kiwi would not be what they are if they hadnt introduced these new products " ms barnes says "they drove growth on something that hadnt been growing for some time "
