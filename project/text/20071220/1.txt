a cultural conversation with marjane satrapi words and pictures of an iranian exile "i believe that an entire nation should not be judged by the wrongdoings of a few extremists i also dont want those iranians who lost their lives in prisons defending freedom who died in the war against iraq who suffered under various repressive regimes or who were forced to leave their families and flee their homelands to be forgotten one can forgive but one should never forget " marjane satrapi in the introduction to "persepolis" this may seem like an unusual introduction to a comic book but marjane satrapis graphic memoir in part a coming of age story set against irans islamic revolution and the iran iraq war of the s defies easy classification in one major new york bookstore i found "persepolis" in the middle eastern history section "persepolis " the animated movie makes its u s debut next week the first person account spans to from ms satrapis childhood in iran to her exile in europe the book pulls no punches in its descriptions of iranian political repression and religious fundamentalism irans ministry of culture deemed the film islamophobic and anti iranian but ms satrapi rejects these labels "i dont have any problem with religion " she says "i have more of a problem with any ideology when you take it and you use it to repress people " furthermore "everyone who comes out of this movie has more sympathy for iranians " she says "because it shows the iranian people are human beings like everyone else " perhaps most important "persepolis" tells a national story from the perspective of the individual "individualism for me that is to understand that each person is important " ms satrapi says "and for me that is the basis of democracy " the film is certainly timely even if ms satrapi did not intend it to be "we started making the movie years before and iran was not the center of attention " she says at a time when much national debate is focused on the nuclear threat from tehran the film encourages american audiences to understand iran on a more personal level "education and culture is a weapon of mass construction " ms satrapi says "this is a fact " there is reason to believe that the french language film written and directed by ms satrapi and vincent paronnaud will be well received in the u s the two volume graphic novel on which it is based "persepolis " and "persepolis " landed to widespread critical acclaim "in america it was incredible actually " ms satrapi says "but that has to do with american culture you know people have this something that they always give you a chance to express yourself this is a very good thing about the american culture that i like a lot they always let you say it " ms satrapi is clearly not shy about expressing herself she sits across from me in a posh room at new yorks regency hotel smoking cigarette after cigarette and rapidly shooting off opinions on a diverse array of topics ms satrapi who currently resides in paris tells me that she loves new york "i like bagels and cream cheese and lots of stuff so you know i feel at home " the real life ms satrapi very much resembles the defiant heroine of her memoir born in in rasht iran ms satrapi was raised in tehran by two loving independent minded parents life changed dramatically after the overthrow of the shahs regime and the islamic revolution of ms satrapi had attended a french nonreligious school until when bilingual schools were shut down and veils became obligatory the young ms satrapi does not take well to religious education she hits a school principal who tries to forbid her from wearing jewelry and later confronts a religion teacher who claims that there are no more political prisoners since the islamic republic was founded the girl retorts to the applause of her classmates "but weve gone from prisoners under the shah to under your regime how dare you lie to us like that " after these incidents ms satrapis parents send her to austria where she proceeds to get thrown out of a catholic school for insulting some nuns "persepolis" follows ms satrapi from iran to austria back to iran and finally to france with a tone that is simultaneously painful and lighthearted after a bad breakup with a european boyfriend ms satrapi concludes "i had known a revolution that had made me lose part of my family i had survived a war that had distanced me from my country and my parents and its a banal story of love that almost carried me away " in "persepolis " ms satrapi finds humor even in her battles with religious fundamentalism and she seems to hope that international audiences will laugh along with her laughing helps people communicate to understand one another better "you laugh with somebody you cry with yourself " she says "as soon as you laugh with somebody you are not scared of this somebody anymore " she is quick to poke fun at herself "this kind of project has turned me into a hippie you know im talking about peace and love the whole day " she says with more than a hint of irony "i say to myself if someone as egocentric narcissistic because those are the two things you have to be to be an artist if i start talking like that that means that the whole world is really bad it means that we are in big trouble " ms satrapi has not been back to iran since "persepolis" first came out in french eight years ago the problem with iran she explains is that you dont know what can happen to you "you dont know what is waiting for you " she says "you dont know " ms satrapi has also written childrens books and several other graphic novels such as "embroideries" and "chicken with plums " i ask her why she is so drawn to graphic novels "i think by images i know how to draw and i know how to write why choose one or the other " she adds "the first language of the human being before writing is drawing the image is the reality the drawing is how the human sees this reality its something extremely immediate " for ms satrapi graphic novels are not a "genre " rather they are just a way to tell a story "if you consider it as a medium then you can do anything with it " she says "if you think that it is a genre then you have to make superhero stories or you have to make fairytales " "persepolis" the book is entirely in black and white while the movie has an occasional splash of color "i come from the underground comics which for economic reasons first we draw in black and white because it costs less to publish it this is the first thing " ms satrapi explains "so its a habit but then also its an aesthetic choice black and white is always very modern " ms satrapi at first thought that turning a comic book into a movie was a very bad idea she later decided that it was an artistic challenge the film closely resembles the book although the movie contains much less information the book starts from childhood while the movie begins in france "the moment that we made the movie was a very nostalgic time of my life so the whole structure of the movie is based on a flashback everything leads to this exile " ms satrapi says "the book was much more linear but the movie in a way it becomes more personal " ms satrapi explains how an animated film might have a more universal quality than a movie in a geographical place with real human beings such a movie "becomes again a story of those middle easterners those crazy people we cannot understand as soon as it is drawings it can be anyone it can be anywhere " "persepolis" shines a harsh light on the treatment of women in iran and once again ms satrapi appears defiant in one memorable scene in the film ms satrapi egged on by her female friends dramatically tears off her veil but she is reluctant to call herself a feminist "for me its a question of human beings if people are stupid and they are bad no matter if they are men or women i dont like them thats why i never participate in the festival of women etc because i always say if that was a festival of men how would i think about it why would i be excluded " ms satrapi describes her cause as "human " "that is the only thing that i believe in education and the human being and that is all the rest for me is just fuss " ms parker is an assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal
