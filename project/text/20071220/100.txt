the endless campaign the iowa caucuses are days away with the new hampshire primary five days later and what follows from there wont be pretty the way americans are selecting our presidential candidates in is frankly a mess the first problem is the overall length of the campaign there are few more demanding physical activities than running for president other than military training or athletics at a very high level and this will be the longest presidential contest on record the first candidate this season announced dec virtually all the democrats declared by late january and almost every republican by mid march so next fall well elect a president whos spent two years rocketing around the country in an aluminum tube and sleeping in strange hotel rooms on a brutal exhausting campaign trail this gives america the longest leadership selection contest in the democratic world it wasnt always like this bill clinton announced for president on oct at this point in the presidential contest hed been a candidate for weeks george w bush made his first campaign speech on june at this point in the race hed been a candidate for just over five months in voting will also begin earlier than ever in the iowa caucuses were held jan this time theyll be jan for the first time some new years partygoers will still be nursing hangovers when they caucus yet despite the seemingly endless campaign the nomination contest will be settled quicker than ever in there were seven contests in five weeks beginning with iowa this time here will be contests in states in roughly the same amount of time two days after iowas contest on thursday jan wyoming republicans will caucus on saturday jan new hampshire holds its primary on the next tuesday jan on jan michigan votes followed by nevadas caucuses and the south carolina republican primary on jan hawaii republicans start a two week voting period jan and south carolina democrats vote on jan florida goes to the polls jan and maine republicans caucus on feb then in a rush there will be contests on tuesday feb what candidate can effectively campaign in more than a handful of the states voting in the first month in the presidential race of the delegates were selected by march by march and of the democratic delegates by april and of the republican delegates by may this time around the and thresholds will be crossed on feb and by march over of the delegates will be selected cutting the length of the primary season by more than half by jamming the contests together raises the likelihood of a bandwagon developing for the candidate who wins the first few contests this would allow a candidate to sweep to victory in the subsequent contests that rapidly follow because all that voters will see is his or her face on the evening news and in the papers remember few americans have seen these candidates up close except voters in iowa new hampshire and south carolina in an abbreviated primary season the weight these early state voters carry is even more exaggerated both parties could end up with a candidate chosen in haste and repented of at great cost if primaries and caucuses were spread out with weeks not days and hours between them then voters in more states could learn more about the candidates candidates would have more time to come back from an early loss to a contender who was briefly the flavor of the moment in one state candidates would also benefit from having more time to think about the big important things they want to do for the country the process side of politics is now undermining the intellectual side it was revealing that at a health care forum last march sen barack obama admitted he didnt have a health care plan but promised to have one by this january in addition the current process increases pressure on candidates to narrowly focus on the concerns of their partys activists in the early states this crowds out other important things that tell the voters who they are its hard for candidates to resist for example then texas gov george w bush spoke early in the primary season about rallying the armies of compassion to confront hopelessness of spirit and condition this wasnt a "base theme " rather it was an appeal to all americans his primary opponents criticized his focus on compassion but mr bush rejected any retreat from the theme an action that served him well in the general election now because of the calendar many candidates feel forced to devote much of their rhetoric and time to appealing to a faction in their party is it really good or fair for so much of america to outsource its candidate selection to activists in a handful of the states at the front of this clipped process a longer primary process would give more americans a chance to make a considered decision about who should be president the process could still honor the role of iowa new hampshire and south carolina but give other states the opportunity to more fully participate in the selection of our nominees there will be a vast stretch of time between when each nomination is likely to be secured early february and the conventions where they are ratified aug for the democrats and sept for the republicans lets not kid ourselves next year the general election starts in earnest on feb a general election campaign that lasts nine months will bore even more than it has in the past the american people it will certainly work to the disadvantage of the better known candidate who could appear as yesterdays news and uninteresting when compared to a fresh face some of the candidates already seem like overly familiar figures and not a single vote has yet been cast the media will be partly to blame by next spring at the latest journalists will have tired of the candidates and their messages and demand they say or do something new different and controversial or they will be made to suffer the result of all this is that were putting pressure on candidates to act in ways that have nothing to do with how well they will govern the purpose of a campaign ought to be the opposite its too late to do anything about but americans deserve better next time one answer might be to create a series of days on which states across the country could hold their primaries or caucuses these contest days would be spread out over the winter and spring each day would have a mix of states representing different regions of the country rep sander levin d mich and sen bill nelson d fla have introduced legislation along these lines there are also proposals from the state secretaries of state and groups of leaders in both parties perhaps a reform structure could be arrived at by the two major parties and their rules without requiring congressional action longer earlier and shorter at least when it comes to selecting our presidential candidates is not in the countrys best interests the presidential primary mayhem and next years seemingly endless general election campaign will be compelling evidence for reform mr rove is a former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to president george w bush see related letters "letters to the editor what
