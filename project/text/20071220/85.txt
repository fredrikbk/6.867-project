settling on the score alberto iglesias and the kite runner at first blush alberto iglesias may seem an unusual choice to score "the kite runner " marc forsters film that opened friday born in spain where he still resides mr iglesias hadnt written a score that utilized the modes of the music of afghanistan where much of the film takes place but the film required a tender evocative and thrilling score to bolster and support the story of a friendship seemingly destroyed forever by a childhood betrayal in a country brutalized by the soviets and religious zealots mr iglesias is a master of such emotionally complex music his work for the films of pedro almodovar including the richly romantic score for "talk to her" and the bernard herrmann inspired music for "bad education " show his range and his oscar nominated score for "the constant gardener " set in kenya and the u k demonstrated he cant be categorized by his ethnicity mr iglesiass subtle vivid compositions for "the kite runner" give the film the often conflicting textures it needs to help tell a story that is both starkly real and something of an incredible fantasy his score nominated for a golden globe award illuminates several otherwise static scenes that depict a deepening then fractured friendship between two pre teen boys the year old mr iglesias who during our telephone conversation seemed as sensitive and convivial as his music can be was recruited by mr forster who contacted him in madrid while he was shooting the films afghanistan scenes in china "yes it was a very long distance call " mr iglesias told me prior to meeting the director in san francisco mr iglesias read a spanish translation of the khaled hosseini novel on which the film is based "i liked it very much " he said "it gave me the soul of the project and opened the first musical ideas " he also studied the regions music and arrived in san francisco with what became the music for the films opening credit sequence which foreshadows themes much like an operas overture "but it was in a very different version not so rhythmic " he said promising an adventure as well as tenderness the film version anchors viewers in a setting that will transport them between afghanistan and the u s mr iglesias knew hed have to employ a variety of traditional middle eastern instruments such as the bansuri and ney which are wooden flutes the dulcimer like santur the rubab an afghanistan lute and various hand drums among others but as the project began he realized he hadnt met any musicians who played them "the rubab and the tabla i needed to know them for the psychology of the film " he said so that he could record at cata studios near his home he found musicians in spain who had experience with middle eastern and central asian modes mr iglesias would compose and theyd augment his music "you write three notes and they play six in between " that augmentation he added gave the music the authentic colors it needed mr forster enriched the score by adding existing recordings by notable afghanistan pop singers ehsan aman and the late ahmad zahir and sami yusuf who was born in iran much as mr iglesiass score for "talk to her" seemed to draw from the same emotional well as a caetano veloso performance in that film his writing for "the kite runner" melds seamlessly with "omaid e man " a number by mr aman thats used in a wedding scene the universality of the main characters struggles is communicated when regional stringed instruments give way to western acoustic and electric guitars its a concept gustavo santaolalla used to great effect in his oscar winning score for "babel " but mr iglesiass score for "the kite runner" has a gorgeous and thoroughly characteristic orchestral component that distinguishes it for example in a gruesome scene in which a couple is stoned to death the music may appear to be merely a lengthy electric guitar solo over percussion but its supported by chilling strings that intensify the viewers reaction a brief lovely piece entitled "sin" opens with flute and strings soon the music quiets a nylon stringed guitar enters and a violin resumes the theme in "fuel tanker " delicate guitar and santur weave like kites in the air then vanish into dark orchestral tones the score which is available on the deutsche grammophon label is melancholic at its core the film mr iglesias said is "about distance and loss and guilt and these things put me in a melancholy mood " he mentions how one of the characters who relocated to the u s recalls the flowers of kabul he saw as a child "this is something very nostalgic and deep in the end piece i tried to be more happy but even when seeing the flying kites i was filled with sadness " when speaking about the art of film composition in general mr iglesias inadvertently summarized the beauty of his work for "the kite runner" "in a film the music must have a conversation with the story " he said "in our perception we allow the music to represent our emotions theres a moment of transmission when the music communicates the emotion of the film it captures the soul of the film " mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
