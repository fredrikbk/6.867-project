cure state regulation of health insurance congratulations to merrill matthews "a health insurance solution " op ed dec for pointing out the tragedy of state governments forbidding citizens from exercising the basic right to buy health insurance from other states these regional regulatory monopolies drive up health costs by making their residents pay for expensive mandates that benefit determined interest groups at societys expense they also drive up health costs and taxes in less regulated states because over regulated states continuously lobby the federal government for more money to bandage their self inflicted wounds that is why new york gov eliot spitzer and new jersey gov john corzine are suing president bush for his clearly responsible policy of ensuring that states enroll poor kids in state childrens health insurance plans schip before enrolling middle class ones the federal governments out of control spending on medicaid and schip bails out states that drive private health insurance premiums sky high through over regulation because of this residents of states where health insurance is still affordable should be just as outraged as those in over regulated jurisdictions and support rep shadeggs bill to create a national market in health insurance john r graham director health care studies pacific research institute san francisco there is another side concerning states mandating what an insurance plan must cover as a resident of new jersey i could not buy the private catastrophic health insurance policy issued in another state that fit my needs because the policy i preferred was considered inadequate by the new jersey legislature i had to wait three additional years to retire with coverage under my employers retiree policy that was suitable to the legislature thereby cheating me out of three years of early retirement doug hartlove somerville n j i have been watching with some interest the development of a market for health savings accounts which were supposed to be targeted toward employers like myself earlier this year i visited a former medical school classmate in california a self employed psychiatrist i was pleasantly surprised to learn that he was able to set up a health savings account &# deductible for himself and his family for no more than &# per year in expenses and premiums when i returned to new jersey i called my insurance representative but was told that very few hsas are sold at all in my state because all the mandatory coverages imposed by the legislature had made them all but unaffordable many of these mandates were undoubtedly passed at the behest of special interest groups in my own profession i would urge congress to co opt this issue by passing legislation allowing a nationwide health insurance marketplace for both individuals and businesses i for one would love the opportunity to buy my classmates policy at his price sam litvin m d long branch n j i read with disgust mr matthewss misguided suggestion on health insurance the only true way to improve health care is to adopt a single payer universal health care plan the u s spends much more than other countries we could have the cadillac of national health plans right now we have the edsel mr matthews blames state mandates as the cause of our collective pain especially chiropractic care and mental health benefits which together probably account for less than of all health care costs both are preventive in nature low tech and low cost they often lead to fewer hospitalizations and less drug use the true drivers of health care costs are the back door mandated benefits that get in with no public hearing such as new drugs new high tech testing and many hospital costs the drug vioxx is a prime example of a back door mandated benefit mr matthewss proposal is disingenuous and would not result in lower health care costs it would just eliminate benefits that save many states and people money peter g hill d c m p a boston
