fiscally fit the christmas gift countdown terri tells how she tackles the gifts on her last minute shopping list online edition if youre like me youre nowhere near finished with your christmas gift buying as a dyed in the wool procrastinator this time of year typically finds me scrambling to finish checking off all the names on my gift list the funny thing is i actually enjoy the bum rush of last minute gift buying to me its part of the fun of the season gerry likes it too though he admits the reason is he typically ends up buying a few great gifts for himself in the process this close to christmas online shopping is now largely out of the question unless we want to pay exorbitant fees for expedited delivery so gerry our son gerald and i will hit the mall this weekend to try and find everything else we need geralds needs have already been long checked off his gifts were bought wrapped and hidden soon after his letter to santa was written to be sure the enjoyment we get out of last minute christmas shopping is the exception to the rule weve witnessed our fair share of surly shoppers eager to get in and out of the shopping melee to help prevent such scenes i thought id share some advice on how i wrap up my gift buying list as quickly and painlessly as possible preparation is key for procrastinators so like santa i make a list and check it twice i prioritize the list by time gifts that need to get there on time by mail come first gifts we need to have in hand on christmas eve come next then gifts we need on christmas day and finally the few presents that will be given after the holiday shopping online is the most convenient option for last minute shoppers but also the most expensive its too late for standard shipping for most retailers so prepare to pay extra for two day and overnight shipping charges still driving all over town to buy gifts isnt exactly a cheap alternative with the average national gas price hovering near &# a gallon to keep shipping charges to a minimum i try to hit just one or two major retailers because i shop at amazon com a lot i pay &# a year for amazon prime which offers "free" two day shipping for most items that said amazon prime doesnt cover shipping charges for purchases made through third parties as my colleague jason fry noted in this column those retailers generally have their own shipping charges so check the fees before you buy i didnt wait until the last minute to buy the "hot gifts" of the season so im not one of those parents tearing their hair out trying to find a wii in time for christmas this time of year store clerks are inundated with phone calls from frantic parents asking when the next shipment will come in instead of wasting my time and theirs calling this year i signed up with itrackr com which lets you track when hot gifts are available at local retailers the site will also send email and cellphone alerts when the gifts you need are in stock it worked for me i snagged a wii for gerald at target gift cards are the go to gift for most teens on my list electronics store cards for the boys movie theater cards for the girls if you dont have the time or inclination to rush out to the mall check your local grocery store most big chains now offer gift cards from major restaurants and retailers ill also be picking up a gift card from the grocery store itself for the family that geralds third grade class has adopted for the holidays the grocery store also offers another easy gift buying option magazines sports crafts and cooking magazine subscriptions are a great gift in a pinch wrap the magazine up with a note card and a bow and youre done so i get my food shopping done and check some names off my list at the same time coming up with a unique gift for a few of the kids on my list is difficult because their birthdays are close to christmas so ill be hitting the bookstore which helpfully groups childrens books by the age of the child as part of the gift gerald and i will invite the kids to come with us on our next visit to the library to get their first library cards indeed some readers responding to last weeks column suggested another present that wont require a trip to the mall the gift of time offer to spend a day with a loved one doing something he or she will enjoy a trip to the movies museum or amusement park a day together at the spa or whatever they want to do the memory of the time spent together will likely last longer that of any material gift youd buy when christmas is just hours away and i still have people to buy for i head to the web again in the past ive purchased print out gift certificates from web sites such as amazon giftcertificates com and ticketmaster com that i then included in my familys holiday cards last year in a panic after i realized id forgotten a gift for my godchild in texas i purchased an electronic gift card that arrived via email i also called to tell him to check for the gift in case the email might be accidentally deleted or caught in a spam filter definitely not the warmest gift he received that year but at least he knew gerry and i were thinking of him for the person in your life who has everything the gift of charity may be the most welcome and expeditious gift of all web sites such as charitygiftcertificates org and networkforgood org let you make donations in a persons name and even come with their own gift cards and finally if youd rather avoid the long lines at the toy store consider the gift of education instead as i noted last week you could contribute to a childs college savings account the kid will appreciate the gift in the future and his or her parents will be grateful for it now in the end with a little organization and creativity you can finish checking off your gift list in a hurry without losing your holiday cheer see you at the mall do you wait until the last minute to buy gifts during the holiday season is it procrastination or are you hoping for deep discounts what shopping tricks do you use to make it as painless as possible write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about last minute christmas shopping or join me and your fellow readers in
