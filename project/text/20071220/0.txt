hospitalists are seen as help specialists shorten stays in hospital modest cost cuts doctors who specialize in the general care of hospital patients a relatively new category of doctors called "hospitalists" reduce the average hospital stay by but only modestly lower treatment costs according to a new study the study published in the new england journal of medicine might damp enthusiasm for hospitalists who have been a fast growing category of physicians hospitalists work full time at hospitals performing generalist duties traditionally handled by family doctors or internists making rounds the new category has been one of the fastest growing medical specialties of the past decade exploding from just a few hundred doctors in to practicing today according to the philadelphia based society of hospital medicine the organization for hospitalists in the first wide scale study focusing on hospitalists and whether their use saves hospitals time and money researchers from tufts university school of medicine followed patients admitted to hospitals between september and june in what researchers say is a "small but significant" finding the study concluded hospitalists lopped or a half day off the average four day hospital stay peter lindenauer an author of the study said that finding suggests they are an "attractive solution" for hospitals struggling to accommodate more overnight patients now he said people "wait in emergency departments for hours for a bed " however despite the reduction in hospital stays the use of a hospitalist offered only modest savings compared with care by a general internist and no significant savings over care provided by a family doctor one theory is that hospitalists simply do the same amount of work but in less time or they may order more tests than regular doctors since the hospitalists arent intimately familiar with patients histories dr lindenauer said while the study didnt look at quality of care he said "one of the disadvantages of the model is that it introduces a handoff between doctors the primary care doctor is caring for you in your office then they refer you to the hospitalist for hospital care then at the conclusion the hospital refers you back to primary care " the theoretical advantages he says are that a patient is looked after by a doctor who spends his entire day in the hospital and is able to make decisions in "real time " unlike a doctor who stops in for rounds but as the field grows there needs to be an emphasis on improving efficiency such as better communication between primary care doctors and hospitalists experts said
