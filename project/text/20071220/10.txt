as google expands rivals unite microsoft viacom alliance aims to gain in market derail doubleclick deal like many moves in the media business these days microsofts wide ranging partnership with viacom announced yesterday was mostly about advertising and mostly about trying to compete with google the agreement contains various content sharing arrangements but it centers on viacom using microsofts online advertising system for placing ads on the media giants web sites the companies share an interest in fighting google as it expands beyond its core business of internet search into other forms of online advertising including ads in videos the deal is a tactical win for microsoft as it tries to slow that expansion viacom is suing google for &# billion claiming that googles youtube web site hosts videos including such programs as "the daily show with jon stewart" that violate viacoms copyrights microsoft meanwhile competes with google for advertising from media companies on whose web sites it can sell ads in exchange for a portion of the revenue adding a large media player like viacom helps justify microsofts recent &# billion acquisition of aquantive an online advertising specialist that developed a service called atlas to compete with doubleclick which also provides online ad services and which google plans to buy for &# billion yesterdays deal calls for viacom home to mtv comedy central and paramount pictures to provide microsoft with audio and video content from its cable and motion picture businesses in gaming viacom will become a preferred publishing partner across microsofts online service for casual games the arrangement includes a mix of advertising guarantees licensing fees and revenue sharing between the companies they didnt disclose details other than to say that the value of the deal over five years is &# million in "financial considerations and business services" between microsoft and viacom microsoft over the past six months has waged behind the scenes and public campaigns to derail googles planned acquisition of doubleclick microsoft has argued to advertisers and regulators that doubleclick gives google an unfair advantage in online advertising the federal trade commission is examining the merger and is expected to rule on the deal as early as this week the outcome of a separate regulatory review is also pending in europe the viacom deal is a further attack on doubleclick to date viacom has used doubleclick to process the bulk of its online advertising under terms of its deal with microsoft viacom will move that business to microsofts atlas service atlas will place ads on viacoms sites and provide information on clients that can be used to target advertising more effectively the deal also allows microsoft to exclusively sell viacoms "remnant" display ad space which are spots for ads that have gone unsold microsoft executives are racing to grab as many advertisers for the system as they can before google can close its deal for doubleclick say people familiar with the matter until regulators rule on the doubleclick deal microsoft may have an edge in services that bundle ad sales with the technology infrastructure for placing ads on sites until the deal closes google and doubleclick are unable to bundle their offerings in that way microsoft and viacom executives said that the timing of their announcement within a day or two of the ftcs expected ruling on doubleclick was coincidental "this has nothing to do with that " said kevin johnson president of microsofts platforms &amp services division whatever the outcome of the ruling google executives feel microsofts efforts have delayed the companys integration of doubleclick say people familiar with the situation google said the deal undercuts microsofts arguments that googles purchase of doubleclick would hamper competition in online advertising "while some have apparently argued otherwise todays announcement would seem to suggest that those arguments are flawed " google said in a statement viacom chief executive philippe dauman said the deal would "enhance revenues immediately" for viacom in the first quarter of viacom will get guaranteed revenues for remnant advertising as well as guaranteed minimums for advertising across its cable networks according to people familiar with the situation viacom signed a separate deal with yahoo in april for sponsored search and contextual ads which wont be affected by this new deal the microsoft deal will just cover graphical and video ads the guarantees could act as a form of insurance as viacom moves away from doubleclicks system that transition is technically difficult because doubleclick and atlas use different methods for displaying and accounting for ads and if not done well the shift could temporarily disrupt viacoms revenue stream microsofts mr johnson declined to specify how long it would take to move viacoms business from doubleclick to atlas saying only that it will take "months not years " emily steel contributed to this article
