alternative medicine nursing homes struggle to kick drug habit new therapies sought for dementia sufferers music and massages brooklyn n y it is lunchtime at cobble hill health center and elizabeth johnson is busy helping patients in the alzheimers unit tying plastic aprons around their waists passing out salt and pepper shakers paper cups straws and little containers of milk "you have to sit and eat " mrs johnson tells one resident "there is a spoon if you need a spoon " she says to another in her print dress and coral lipstick mrs johnson years old can almost pass for a staffer on some days or even the manager she used to be at a local city hospital in fact she is a patient here stricken with an advanced form of dementia that sometimes renders her confused fretful even combative not long ago cobble hills staff would respond to mrs johnsons unruly episodes by putting her on a powerful antipsychotic drug use of a new generation of antipsychotic drugs to control the behavior of dementia patients has surged in recent years despite the food and drug administrations "black box" warning labels that these drugs can increase the risk of death for elderly dementia sufferers about of nursing home residents are on antipsychotic drugs according to the centers for medicare &amp medicaid services most of them on newer ones called atypical antipsychotics mrs johnson however is now part of an experiment at the cobble hill nursing home to wean patients off antipsychotics in her case the staff has figured out that when she becomes distraught the best way to calm her down is to have her do what she loved to do when she was well work simple tasks such as setting the table they say give mrs johnson a renewed sense of purpose and calm the challenge of caring for rising numbers of seniors who suffer from dementia and the behavior problems that can stem from it has provoked a wrenching debate among nursing home operators regulators and families there are few effective medicines to manage the outbursts of alzheimers patients behavior that can overwhelm family members trying to care for a loved one at home and strain the resources of those trying to maintain order in nursing facilities federal law strongly discourages nursing homes from physically tying down unruly patients but federal health care programs such as medicaid do pay for drugs that may help calm aggressive behavior and agitation associated with alzheimers medicaid in spent &# billion on atypical antipsychotic medicines more than it spent on any other class of drugs including antibiotics aids drugs or medicines to treat high blood pressure atypical antipsychotics are approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but in what is known as "off label" use doctors often prescribe the drugs to elderly people with dementia the widespread use of antipsychotics among the elderly has begun to draw criticism from regulators researchers lawmakers and some in the nursing home industry sen charles grassley the ranking republican on the senate finance committee this month asked several drug manufacturers for records on how they may have marketed these drugs for use in geriatric patients he also has asked the inspector general of the department of health and human services to investigate use of the drugs in nursing homes the &# billion nursing home industry has evolved toward large often understaffed institutions a law signed by president reagan in sought to limit physical and chemical restraints in nursing homes but in the late s with the introduction of new medicines called atypical antipsychotics use of psychotropic drugs among the elderly began to creep up according to cms nearly of nursing home patients who dont have a psychosis diagnosis are on antipsychotic drugs a study published in the archives of internal medicine found antipsychotics were prescribed not only for psychosis but for depression confusion memory loss and feelings of isolation says the studys author becky briesacher last year cms instituted new guidelines to limit the use of antipsychotics even so under federal rules its still easier for nursing homes to get reimbursed for giving patients extra pills than it is for hiring extra staff an elderly person with alzheimers often isnt able to refuse antipsychotic drugs says cynthia rudder of the long term care community coalition a new york patient advocacy group "you are basically quieting them against their will and it is absolutely horrendous " she says family members can object to the use of such drugs but they risk having the facility threaten to discharge their relative on grounds that they pose a danger to themselves or others at cms officials stress the need to shift to smaller less rigid facilities as a way to reduce antipsychotic usage dennis smith director of the center for medicaid and state operations says nursing homes should seek "a different model" of care so that when dealing with patients in distress the solution isnt only "unlocking the drug cabinet " his agency is pursuing a twofold approach offering alternatives to nursing homes such as the option to live in the community and trying to improve nursing homes by letting them know "they will be open to scrutiny " some nursing home industry officials agree change is needed "we cannot treat people by simply throwing psychotropic drugs at them for our convenience " says larry minnix president of the american association of homes and services for the aging while there are "really good places where physicians and nurses monitor this carefully that is the exception not the rule " he says yet replacing drugs with approaches that require a more human touch is easier said than done staffing remains an issue according to cms nursing home patients on average receive a half hour of care per day from a registered nurse plus minutes from a licensed practical nurse and two hours and minutes from an aide there are some alzheimers patients for whom nonpharmacological approaches simply dont work says william thies a vice president at the alzheimers association in chicago and in these cases antipsychotics may be warranted but the drugs need to be used very carefully at the lowest dose and after ruling out a medical problem says dr thies who has a doctorate in pharmacology still some nursing homes are trying alternatives at providence rest nursing home in the bronx distraught alzheimers patients are given massages and aromatherapy providence a facility with patients run by an order of nuns has brought its overall reliance on antipsychotics down to over the last few years and down to zero among patients who are not psychotic at bishop wicke care center a bed facility in shelton conn the emphasis is on giving patients consistent caregivers avoiding staff turnover that can make life trying for residents the home has also undertaken a project to get to know what patients were like when they were young as a key to dealing with their angst at cobble hill in brooklyn the effort to wean mrs johnson off antipsychotics is part of a broader effort by the facilitys chief executive officer olga lipschitz to make the facility more "homelike " mrs lipschitz who at is the age of some of her patients took over cobble hill in the s following a scandal over conditions in new york nursing homes "i have been at this for years " she says "reform is constantly needed " some patients are responding well to alternative approaches others still need drugs after she retired mrs johnson lived on her own in brooklyn but she began to wander from her house "strangers were bringing her home " recalls her daughter shirlyn breeden one day a bruised mrs johnson showed up at her church unable to explain what had happened she was taken from one medical facility to another and given antipsychotics her daughter says mrs johnson was on antipsychotics when transferred to cobble hill in may and the staff kept her on the medication she was "combative with other residents at times " say her case notes "my mother thought this was her apartment and these strangers were living there she would tell them to get their feet off the bed " ms breeden recalls "i would tell her youre being mean to them but she would say they know that you are not supposed to put your feet on the bed " ms breeden worried about her mom "her eyes were weak she was incoherent she couldnt complete a full sentence " she says "that wasnt my mother she was never like that " her mother was the kind of woman she says who never left the house without putting on lipstick the medication didnt halt her outbursts her daughter recalls a terrifying day when mrs johnson moved her bed to block the door of her room convinced strangers wanted to come in in louis mudannayake cobble hills medical director decided the facility had too many patients on antipsychotic drugs "they were chemically shlogged " he says "a patient who had had some quality of life earlier who was able to interact and smile at her relatives and put a fork to her tuna fish was no longer able to do that " he began a chart by chart review of every patient on any type of antipsychotic he formed a team including a psychiatrist pharmacy consultant a nurse social worker recreational therapist and nurses aide that met roughly once a month they determined which patients could be taken off the drugs and which ones could have doses reduced initially there was skepticism from the staff some nurses warned patients would run amok if taken off the drugs doctors balked persuaded the drugs worked ravi amin a psychiatrist who works at cobble hill and other facilities says he has given orders at some of the other nursing homes to have a patient taken off antipsychotics only to find them countermanded by the unit nurse and the facilitys on site internist "doctors would be called to restart the medicine so that by the time i made the second visit some patients were back on it " he says mrs johnson had been on an antipsychotic called seroquel for about a year and a half in may the team concluded she was a candidate for "environmental redirection " this meant that if she became upset the staff wasnt to automatically reach for seroquel but try other ways to calm her within a month she was taken off the antipsychotic entirely "we began to give her little tasks pre packaged spoons to give out aprons to put on other residents " says liza long a nurse who is the units community director "she still thinks shes at work " to her daughter a telling change in mrs johnsons life since stopping the antipsychotics is cosmetic these days she says mrs johnson rarely leaves her room without her lipstick on a spokesman for astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp maker of seroquel says "decisions about medical treatment are made by physicians" and the company doesnt recommend the drug "for uses other than its approved indications in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder " he says the boxed warning "contained in all labels for this class of drugs states there is increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia related psychosis " he adds that the labels also state the drugs arent approved for treatment of patients with dementia related psychosis some caretakers say that antipsychotics can be effective in helping an elderly loved one at home serena ferguson a physician took care of her mother at home for years in the throes of dementia her mother would pace and wander and try to leave the apartment she recalls it was hard to get her to fall asleep and dr ferguson had to place herself by the door to make sure her mom wouldnt slip out dr ferguson says atypical antipsychotics were the only way to keep her mother safe at home "they would calm her down " she says "those medications will make you drowsy and she would go to sleep and that is good because i would go to sleep " she says last year her mother was admitted to cobble hill where she remained on the antipsychotic drug seroquel but when the nursing home told her they wanted to wean her mom off the drug dr ferguson agreed her mother has been off antipsychotics for about months instead she has been getting stimulation her daughter says including music and dancing when her year old mother mae was young she loved to go dancing at the savoy ballroom in harlem mrs ferguson worked as a presser at a dry cleaners to support herself and her only child on a recent friday mrs ferguson sat motionless at the dining room table she wasnt smiling she had not eaten much then a staffer put on a cd of nat king cole singing "almost like being in love " mrs fergusons eyes widened and she started to smile with help from an aide she rose and began swaying to the music snapping her fingers "dance with me " she said to dr mudannayake the medical director "id like to dance with all of you " she said to the staff not all cases work out some patients relapse some receive reduced doses of antipsychotics but show signs of distress others are taken off drugs and still suffer from symptoms of their brain disorder in the rate of antipsychotic use among cobble hill patients who didnt have a psychotic disorder was nearly earlier this year it had fallen to about but lately the rate has crept up again showing the constant struggle sometimes little seems to work after cobble hill patient mary goldman a former college professor suffered yet another stroke this year she was no longer able to speak clearly she began to scream uncontrollably tugging at nurses in an effort to calm her the staff administered milligrams of seroquel twice a day but mrs goldman screamed even more loudly sometimes for as long as an hour and a half the medical director says when her case was reviewed earlier this year the team recommended trying to taper her off the antipsychotic now mrs goldman is off the drug she still screams and cries out her husband says though not for as long when his wife becomes distraught he tries to soothe her by speaking gently holding her arm and stroking her hand "sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt " he says "it does not diminish agitation completely but it does diminish it " lately cobble hill has tried bringing books and magazines to mrs goldmans bedside "she is not really reading " says dr mudannayake "but they seem to comfort her and she yells and screams less " often she will merely fling them to the ground her husband bends down and picks them up
