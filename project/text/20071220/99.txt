the end of earmarks for those of us fated to watch annual state of the union addresses the most entertaining moments are when the members all rise to cheer and applaud a presidential statement they know is popular but they also know will never happen such a moment occurred in january when president bush declared "over of earmarks never make it to the floor of the house and senate they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk you didnt vote them into law i didnt sign them into law the time has come to end this practice " the members whooped it up with wide ironic grins and even mr bush had to smile at the spectacle well heres an idea how about if mr bush now demonstrates that he meant what he said by making the members live up to their applause the president has the opportunity to do this as part of the &# billion omnibus spending bill that congress passed this week that bill contains special interest earmarks but most of them arent even in the language of the law itself instead they are part of an accompanying page "committee report" compiled by the house and senate appropriations committees and staff we doubt most members have even seen the report mr bush has said hell sign the actual spending bill but that doesnt mean he and his executive branch must spend that money on the earmarks in the committee report a december legal analysis by attorney todd tatelman for the congressional research service concludes that "because the language of committee reports do not meet the procedural requirements of article i of the constitution specifically bicameralism and presentment they are not laws and therefore are not legally binding on executive agencies " in plainer english this means committee reports have not been formally passed by both houses and "presented" to the president for signing this means mr bush has the legal authority not to fund these projects which lack the force of law mr bushs own budget office has asserted this authority before earlier this year then budget director rob portman instructed federal agencies that they could disregard committee report language on earmarks "unless a project or activity is specifically identified in statutory text agencies should not obligate funds on the basis of earmarks contained in congressional reports or documents " mr portman wrote thats why there were fewer earmarks last year federal agencies would still be obligated to spend the money appropriated by congress but they could choose to spend those dollars on higher priorities that would benefit all taxpayers rather than on favors for special interests or political donors for example the &# for a bike trail in minneapolis could be used to rebuild the collapsed bridge in that city and to strengthen others we hear the white house is exploring this option and that some in the senate are urging him to take it this wont make the president popular with appropriators in either party but it isnt as if he needs to store political capital for a reform agenda in his last year in office taxpayers would be grateful that someone is finally trying to discipline an earmark process that wastes money and has a record of inviting corruption mr bush has both the law and public opinion on his side
