mukasey limits justice white house links washington attorney general michael mukasey issued guidelines aimed at limiting contacts between the white house and the justice department seeking to overcome allegations of political interference that dogged his predecessor alberto gonzales in a memo to u s attorneys and other senior justice department officials mr mukasey said communications between the department and officials in the presidents and vice presidents offices "must be limited " when it pertains to pending criminal or civil enforcement matters the guidelines address an issue that hung over the justice department during the scandal that hobbled mr gonzaless last months in office it was a year ago that the justice department fired seven u s attorneys in one day sparking allegations that white house political operatives were meddling in justice department decisions some of the prosecutors who were fired were handling politically sensitive cases or had received calls from lawmakers or political officials about investigations internal documents and emails released by the department showed that senior aides who helped select those to be fired were partly focused on pleasing political aides to president bush these links tainted the departments reputation critics have contended senate judiciary committee members raised the issue during mr mukaseys confirmation hearing and he promised to review the departments guidelines for dealing with such contacts on pending cases mr mukasey said "the department will advise the white house about such criminal or civil enforcement matters only where it is important for the performance of the presidents duties and where appropriate from a law enforcement perspective " he added that such limitations ensure "that there is public confidence that the laws of the united states are administered and enforced in an impartial manner " the memo leaves open plenty of room for white house officials to coordinate with the justice department on matters that could still cause criticism democrats in congress have objected to the level of collaboration between white house officials and the departments office of the legal counsel on now controversial legal opinions related to terror detainees and other national security matters it isnt clear that given the legal responsibilities of the department the guidelines could be made any more restrictive however mr mukaseys orders require that he or other senior officials be made aware of contacts
