the happiness myth one morning when i was i elbowed my father as he got ready for work "dad " i said "are you happy " for a long moment he stared at me then he replied "son a man doesnt have time to think about that a man just does what needs doing " he gave me one of his youll understand someday smiles and left ive been thinking about that exchange a lot now that another kind of exchange the gift giving kind is upon us if recent traditions hold a fair percentage of those gifts will be "inspirational" materials that extol the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment certain to end up under the trees of at least some americans who dont already own it is that unparalleled tribute to wishful thinking "the secret " by rhonda byrne the years blockbuster best seller cum cultural phenomenon sold six million books and dvds on the strength of the belief that you can imagine your way to total fulfillment some of the seasons hottest inspiration books though not "how to" in format sell a similar message notable is elizabeth gilberts "eat pray love " the story of one womans literal journey to happiness in which she decided to forsake the comfort of her known life for regions uncharted "eat pray love" reached the top of the best seller lists after being blessed by oprah self help guru tony robbins too has lately been spamming his online community with holiday offers various robbins products and even tickets to his entry level seminars on personal reinvention will likely end up as stocking stuffers if the quest for joy doesnt take center stage at christmas it will surely pop up the following week typically new years resolutions that dont involve weight loss have something to do with embracing change choosing happiness following your dreams etc we are consumed by the pursuit of happiness thats too bad because its that very pursuit as currently framed that may prevent you from finding happiness or at least a passable facsimile now im not contending that dads stoic machismo is what life ought to be about for either gender but a lot of us seemed a lot happier or at least less restless before the happiness movement began bullying us myrna blyth a longtime editor in chief of ladies home journal made this point explicitly in her book "spin sisters " ms blyth undertook an informal study of the themes in womens magazines as they evolved over recent decades and concluded that what women have mostly gotten from their magazines is the message that theyre never quite happy enough never good enough never fulfilled enough never far enough along on the path to "having it all " of course its not just womens magazines that do this with highly visible gurus of personal development fanning the flames an entire generation has come of age believing that perpetual happiness is a birthright over the past four decades the concepts of empowerment and entitlement first cousins in the family of american psychobabble have conspired to produce what new york observer writer alexandra wolfe labels "the most coddled generation in american history " we once laughed at the excesses of the "me generation " the malignant narcissism epitomized in the tv show "seinfeld " if we dont laugh quite as much these days thats because its not caricature anymore its life as we live it contrary to what you hear from oprah not "everything you want in life" is attainable unless maybe you are oprah consider the staple line from school administrators during self esteem boosting student assemblies "in this great country you can even be president if you want " while technically its true that anybody can be president it is not true that everybody can be president yet thats the implication in my own case growing up in brooklyn i wanted desperately to patrol center field for the dodgers alas i had millions of young competitors some of whom had actual major league skills if that is your dream the only dream that will make you happy what do you do when the dodgers fail to call we know what some of us do perhaps when our plans dont work out the years between and the period of the most intense "coddling " saw a tripling in suicides among people aged to for every "successful" suicide to young people attempt it increasingly those who dont kill themselves find alternative ways of escaping reality today almost one fifth of people under age confess to binge drinking millions of others descend on doctors seeking prescriptions for prozac xanax and the like although its reckless to draw straight line links of causation is it not possible that these grim facts represent in part what happens when people raised on pie in the sky brainwashing run up against the hard truths of an unforgiving world and cant cope heres something else dad told me "life isnt built around fun its built around peace of mind " maybe dad sensed the paradox of happiness those most desperate for it run a high risk of being the last to find it thats because they make foolish decisions they live disorderly lives always chasing the high of the moment perhaps happiness is best viewed as an ongoing marathon rather than a succession of disconnected sprints its a long term commitment that sometimes calls for sacrifice and self denial compromise and conciliation above all happiness may mean knowing when to quit to settle for "just ok " that is a very unpopular message in these empowered times my father didnt have it all but i believe he was at peace with himself and the life he led shouldnt that be enough for any of us mr salerno is author of "sham how the self help movement made america helpless " crown he is now writing a book on vanitys role in american life see related letter "letters to the editor the pursuit of happiness is not a myth for him" wsj jan see related letter
