ahead of iowa republican race is wide open washington two weeks before the iowa caucus the race for president while tightening among democrats is wide open on the republican side highlighting the unusual fluidity of the first campaign for the white house in over a half century that doesnt include an incumbent president or vice president a new wall street journal nbc news poll shows that rudy giuliani has lost his national lead in the republican field after a flurry of negative publicity about his personal and business activities setting the stage for what could be the partys most competitive nomination fight in decades after holding a double digit advantage over his nearest rivals just six weeks ago the former new york city mayor now is tied nationally with former massachusetts gov mitt romney at among republicans just slightly ahead of former arkansas gov mike huckabee at and arizona sen john mccain at other polls show mr giulianis lead shrinking in florida one of the states he has built his strategy around with the polls margin of error of plus or minus percentage points that puts mr huckabee who had only single digit support in the previous poll in early november within striking distance of the leaders mr romneys national support also has nearly doubled at the same time mr romney has fallen behind mr huckabee in the leadoff jan nominating contest in iowa the results signal a dramatic shift in the nature of the republican race in a party with a history of rewarding established front runners theres no longer a front runner of any kind "there is no hierarchy " said democratic pollster peter hart who conducts the journal nbc survey with republican counterpart bill mcinturff "there is no establishment candidate the republican voters are searching " the democratic race has remained a more stable contest among the top contenders in the national rankings with former first lady sen hillary clinton of new york maintaining a percentage point national lead over sen barack obama of illinois but she faces an increasingly stiff challenge in iowa and other early primary states from mr obama and vice presidential nominee john edwards mr obamas momentum in iowa has spilled over into new hampshire where he has narrowed mrs clintons lead while arguing that he is more in tune with the national mood for change the journal nbc poll may fuel arguments by the obama campaign that their candidate is more broadly acceptable than mrs clinton a polarizing figure whose negative rating exceeds her positive mark the poll shows mr obama leading mr giuliani by a larger margin than mrs clinton does a change from early november when the data suggested they would both fare about the same against him against mr huckabee mr obama leads by to while mrs clinton has a narrow to edge amid the races changing dynamics candidates in both parties are scrambling to readjust their messages and their tactics with his standing slipping nationally and in key states mr giuliani this week accelerated his unconventional retreat from early voting states to focus on later contests where he thinks his northeastern roots and his record as a moderate on social issues might play better he was in missouri yesterday one of several states holding feb primaries "a baseball game youve got to play nine innings and whoever gets the most runs at the end of the nine innings wins " he said in defense of his strategy as he climbs in the polls mr huckabee is starting to attract the kind of intense scrutiny his better known rivals have gotten for some time and which could erode some of his newfound support mr romney released a tv ad this week attacking mr huckabees heavy volume of prisoner pardons as governor and stepped up criticism of his lack of foreign policy experience "here at huckabee for president headquarters we like to call it operation kitchen sink " campaign manager chip saltsman wrote in a fund raising missive to supporters this week suggesting that mr huckabees opponents were going after him in every way they could think of mr huckabee a former baptist minister has responded with positive rhetoric and an iowa ad hailing the spirit of "the birth of christ " another factor injecting uncertainty in the race the mood of the electorate is rapidly shifting according to the poll with voters paying less attention to iraq and more to economic concerns in recent months "i kind of switched between romney giuliani and thompson " said year old adam cates who works in real estate in conway s c and attended a romney rally yesterday now growing fears about the economy have him backing mr romney a former private equity executive among democrats mrs clinton has attempted to win iowa voters who complain she is cold and impersonal with events featuring her mother daughter and childhood friends mr obama sensing new openings has spent two days this week in new hampshire which votes jan to chip away at the firewall mrs clinton has tried to erect there should she lose in iowa the ferment is far more pronounced in the republican field and is all the more striking because of the partys penchant for orderly succession "there hasnt been anything like it for more than years " notes political historian james reichley likening the current turmoil to the intraparty battles that led to the nominations of wendell willkie and thomas dewey in the s the disarray stems partly from president bushs low approval rating which stood at in the latest survey it also reflects an aging of the conservative coalition that ronald reagan marshaled in with economic national security and social issue voters all vying for supremacy "defining itself as ronald reagans party no longer works " says mr reichley a onetime white house aide to republican president gerald ford "theres got to be some new definition of what it means to be a republican " indeed the serial erosion of support for messrs mccain romney and giuliani has alarmed some longtime republicans about the prospect of disarray persisting until next summers republican national convention in minneapolis while that might produce the sort of attention grabbing suspense that some political reformers have pined for modern electoral strategists place far more value on rapidly uniting party constituencies for the general election battle ahead in such a fluid contest the pollster mr hart cautioned "within a month its going to be totally different " a fifth candidate former sen fred thompson of tennessee also draws double digit support at after shooting up to second place in the republican field earlier this year meanwhile the campaign agenda is shifting as well perceptions of military progress in iraq have reduced the proportion of voters who cite iraq as a top priority for washington to from last month with many americans now expecting a recession health care and the economy now rank nearly as high as iraq which could prove unwelcome for messrs mccain and giuliani both identified with national security issues "i was kind of for mccain but i dont know it just seems like romneys got a better act " said ralph stork a year old retired marina operator at the romney event in south carolina yesterday elizabeth holmes in myrtle beach s c laura meckler in des moines iowa christopher cooper in concord n h and amy chozick in independence iowa
