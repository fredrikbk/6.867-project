capital dont count on a stimulus plan with the federal reserve struggling to find the right medicine for a sickly economy that may be resistant to traditional remedies talk of using fiscal stimulus spending increases or tax cuts is growing louder for years the conventional wisdom among economists and the politicians who listen to them has been that recession fighting is best left to the fed it can cut interest rates quickly when the economy weakens fiscal stimulus the argument goes is a great idea in theory the reality is that congress and the president inevitably move so slowly that the stimulus arrives too late or they use recession jitters as an excuse to pursue pet projects that dont actually stimulate much yes a sluggish economy got a well timed boost from the bush tax cuts in but the past quarter century suggests that relying on the fed to fight recession usually works still when deficit fearing harvard university economists martin feldstein who advised ronald reagan and lawrence summers who advised bill clinton begin prescribing fiscal stimulus and when former fed chairman alan greenspan incorrectly by the way is viewed as a fellow traveler its time to listen carefully that the economy needs help isnt at issue the issue is whether to mix fiscal stimulus with monetary policy whether the government should do something more than offer a little help to some struggling homeowners what are the arguments for doing so the fed isnt doing enough because it doesnt realize how ill the economy truly is this case is built on the premise that the white house and congress are better than the fed at diagnosing the short term swings in the economy and it ignores the fact that the fed could offset a fiscal stimulus it deemed imprudent by keeping interest rates higher than they would otherwise be a lousy argument the feds rate cuts arent working because market interest rates arent behaving as usual amid the widespread reluctance of lenders to lend true and the fed and european central bank worry about that this bolsters the case for fiscal stimulus but makes a better argument that the fed and ecb need to be more aggressive the fed cant cut rates because it fears a dollar crash at the fed the gradual decline in the dollar is viewed as a tonic for the economy itll help boost exports though it does exacerbate the central banks inflation anxiety but cutting rates too much too fast could trigger a market rattling confidence shaking plunge in the dollar to the extent that specter stands in the way of the fed doing what it will take to avoid recession then tax cuts or spending increases are indicated stronger argument the usual channels through which fed monetary policy works are clogged lower interest rates usually help the economy in part by stimulating housing construction but housing is such a mess now that trimming the feds target interest rate on overnight bank loans wouldnt have the usual oomph and banks may be so preoccupied with cleaning house and sweeping up the debris from an imprudent lending binge that the usual fed approach may not spur them to make new loans choking the economy strong argument unless conditions improve significantly in the next several weeks the fed can make decisions swiftly but as nobel laureate milton friedman taught monetary policy works with long and variable lags giving americans money to spend for example through a tax cut that shows up in their paychecks next spring could have a much quicker impact on consumer spending if and this is a huge if congress and the president move swiftly they could complement the feds efforts that really is the big rub mr summers calls for timely targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus do it soon aim it at people who will spend the money dont worsen the long term government deficit history isnt encouraging about the likelihood of quick action president bush and democrats in congress agree on almost nothing these days "fiscal stimulus probably wouldnt be put into place until after the stretch of subpar growth passed " says vincent reinhart a former fed economist now at the american enterprise institute adds laurence meyer a former fed governor "theres no such thing as a temporary tax cut anymore we found that out " he says in a reference to the bush tax cuts turn from what the fiscal physicians are prescribing to what is actually likely to happen that is what mr greenspan is doing he would prefer politicians do nothing letting housing prices and securities pegged to mortgages fall until investors see them as bargains and start buying stabilizing the economy but with so many homeowners in pain and so much anxiety about the economy he knows politicians want to do something he says he would rather they offer "emergency aid similar to what government does in natural disasters " than tear up contracts between borrowers and lenders or prop up housing prices and prolong the crisis the fed has done a lot and treasury secretary henry paulson has done a bit backing a plan to prod lenders and certain homeowners to modify mortgage deals to avoid mass foreclosures democrats in congress have lots of proposals for helping the homeowners and communities hurt most acutely few would survive the likely presidential veto some republicans argue for extending the presidents tax cuts now even though that isnt likely to have much short term impact a few deficit hawks will fantasize about a grand compromise that packages fiscal stimulus now with deficit reducing measures that take effect later a good idea that hasnt much chance in todays political environment so the best political forecast is that nothing will come of this talk of fiscal stimulus but should the economy continue to deteriorate early next year or if a big financial institution totters or if the fed looks impotent or paralyzed talk will give way to action and if the economy looks bad enough could produce legislation that president bush might accept
