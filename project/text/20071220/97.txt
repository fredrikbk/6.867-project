style where everyones a fashion critic met show seeks bloggers notes to accompany scholarly text one sample it is very poofy in a new exhibit at the metropolitan museum of arts costume institute designer olivier theyskens describes a gray organza evening gown he designed "my aim was to bring a sort of twisting movement all over the dress that would spiral upward and at the level of the waist like wings it would take off like a bird " the costume institutes head curator harold koda writes that he sees in the dress an erosion of the boundaries between coutures "lavish artisanal skills" and ready to wears "sensitivity to the mood of the contemporary woman " and on the exhibits blog a critic calling herself elizabeth volunteers this interpretation "it is very poofy it quite reminds me of clouds and churning ocean water i love it " fashion criticism has long been the exclusive realm of an insular band of journalists who traveled the big runway shows in paris milan and new york and seemed to speak their own esoteric language but the mets new exhibit "blog mode addressing fashion " is inviting anyone with an internet connection to critique the clothes on display with its new blog blog metmuseum org blogmode which went up this week the august museum is also acknowledging that traditional fashion criticism is over "theres a whole new field out there " says andrew bolton the costume institutes curator he decided last summer to turn a retrospective of important garments acquired by the museum since into a three way conversation of sorts between curator designer and outside observers "we wanted to further the practice of fashion interpretation and appreciation " he says the exhibit features garments arranged mostly chronologically from a circa british waistcoat to mr theyskenss ballgown from a nina ricci collection it contains work from prominent designers like vivienne westwood comme des garcons creative director rei kawakubo and donna karan among the notable pieces are a dress by hollywood couturier gilbert adrian in a patterned crepe designed by salvador dali and a couture evening dress by jean paul gaultier with interlacing corset ribbons all along the back which revealed model sophie dahls bare buttocks on the runway "it is the ultimate backless dress " mr gaultier wrote in the museum notes the exhibit also features some accessories that will be sure to inspire online chatter like the "incubus" necklace by the artist simon costin which incorporates five vials of human semen in the middle of the exhibit a "blog bar" invites viewers to post their own thoughts on the clothes curators decided to invite anyone to post comments on the blog after noticing over the past year and a half that fashion blogging is gaining momentum and respect as influential blogs garner large audiences and advertisers shift ad spending to the internet designers and retailers are also beginning to view the medium as a new opportunity to reach people some bloggers are even getting invited to major runway shows blogger scott schuman who posts photos of street fashion on thesartorialist com is now a well respected style arbiter with a column in gq magazine and a book deal in the works some of the advertisers on his site include well known brands like belvedere vodka kenneth cole and guess many bloggers are "cultivated amateurs " mr koda said this week while admiring the th century red wool waistcoat "i do not think bloggers will change the direction of fashion but they can inform our interpretation of objects " the exhibit also illustrates how the internet is making high brow cultural institutions more accessible to a mainstream audience "curators arent these godlike creatures " mr bolton says the costume institutes democratic approach to criticism surprises some industry experts "what is astonishing to me is that the fashion industry is allowing these people to become important " says david wolfe creative director at the doneger group a new york retail consultancy but some designers find it refreshing "fashion is supposed to be this exclusive world that nobody has access to " says hussein chalayan who uses elements of technology in his designs such as a remote control powered dress in the show but the internet is changing that perception "at the end of the day when you have a critic write about your work it is just one person who is supposed to be an expert " he says "why is this taken more seriously than a blogger " for designers bloggers also represent a useful tool for market research and brand promotion shoe designer manolo blahnik who sponsored the mets exhibition says he thinks bloggers have been partly responsible for getting a younger generation of consumers excited about his shoes one popular blogger who calls himself manolo the shoe blogger has built a community of people who treat footwear criticism as if it were a team sport "i love it " mr blahnik says the "blog mode" exhibition opened to the public on tuesday and the blog went live on monday showing mr theyskenss gray evening gown a different garment will be posted each day to inspire conversation after the show closes in april yale university press will publish a book with photos of the featured items commentary and excerpts from the blog the show features designers comments where available alongside mr kodas notes to emphasize fashions various interpretations for instance mr koda saw mr blahniks heelless "bhutan" pump from spring summer as a subtle homage to footwear designer roger vivier as well as a nod to the "lotus" shoe used in chinese foot binding but mr blahnik saw things differently he intended to pay tribute to "the brutality of etruscan fortitude with a bit of scottish highlands and then a touch of celia cruz the cuban singer who i admired so much as a child " "you see i was in china and he was over in the scottish highlands " says mr koda
