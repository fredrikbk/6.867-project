wonder land im sorry so sorry "after the debate today i went to mitt romney and apologized to him " mike huckabee "im sorry so sorry please accept my apology " brenda lee whose apology would you take as more sincere pastor huckabees or brenda lees an apology stood for something back when brenda lee admitted "that dont right the wrong thats been done " but now we live in an era of apology hyperinflation with wrongs and apologies a dime a dozen as happens in most inflations the value of "im sorry" has fallen here swept at random from newspapers sodden with official sorrow are headlines about politicians apologizing for this and that "clinton apologizes to obama for drug comment " "mccain campaign apologizes to romney " "romney apologizes for tar baby comment " "giuliani apologizes to iowa poor farmers " "obama apologizes for punjab gate " "obama regrets saying soldiers lives wasted " "brownback apologizing to romney " "bush apologizes to l a times reporter " as well the etiquette of conveying political apologies has become as refined as the rules of dueling in th century france in an interview with nbc national journal barack obama explained the code duello of hillary clintons apology to him "we were both getting on our planes on our way to the debate she asked my staff if i would come around the plane to speak to her we met on the tarmac she apologized for billy shaheens remarks i said i appreciated the apology " he is then asked if he thought this was "an honest sincere apology " sen obama replies "im not going to characterize it beyond what i just said " which wellsprings feed this apology compulsion among modern politicians as good a place as any to begin is knowing that they fly on "our planes" to the same venue "the debate" and are able to have meetings "on the tarmac " can you do that instead of picking on the rich f scott fitzgerald should have said it is the political class that is different from the rest of us "kerry apologizes for misinterpreted words " this surge in public penance is recent as an aficionado of political remorse i noted some years back that politicians caught in flagrante articulo tended to express "regret" when their tongues slipped because they are politicians who by nature flap at the mouth slips are common and "regret " a word of no exact meaning has been the perfect antidote indeed like salami regret could be sliced thick or thin politicians tend to qualify their regret on a sliding scale as in "for anyone who a may have been b was c is offended by what i said" blah blah blah " extend my regrets " perhaps the most famous case study of this usage in still fresh political memory is hillary clintons expression of regret during the campaign of to tammy wynette "i happen to be a country western fan if she feels like ive hurt her feelings im sorry about that " this of course didnt fly it made the stand by your man mess worse but as a class politicians dont like to apologize for anything none of the hundreds ive met has ever acknowledged a clear mistake "let me explain that" still theres nothing worse than an embarrassment that hangs in the air decomposing into an odious public stink especially now "allen apologizes for macaca comment " with the arrival of the web the merest off script remark can race like wildfire from media shrub top to media shrub top threatening to burn down ones campaign by morning what to do after all these are all big boys they know mud is the coin of the realm one will never get to the promised land without spending it by the bucket ever adaptable politicians have learned to let the air out of the medias bottomless shock over mudslinging by instantly unabashedly some might say too eagerly pronouncing the a word "let me state for the record in the most unequivocal terms " or my favorite "let there be no mistake " wait a minute wasnt it your mistake no matter they apologize you will notice however that these penitent pols get to have their cake and apologize for it too the no commandment of campaign politics remains you shall reap as you sow doubt about your opponent thus just as an apocryphal southern politician earlier in the past century accused his opponent of having "heterosexual proclivities " it serves the same purpose for the clinton campaign to let drop sen obamas youthful experiments with puff the magic dragon or gov romneys "mormonism" for which one fully and without hesitation apologizes the blow has been struck and if victorious the "fired" campaign aide will of course be rehired "ned lamont apologizes for campaign managers comments " as always with these people all the rest of us pay a price for what they do the price here is that it demeans and ultimately diminishes the idea of an apology notwithstanding edith piafs "i regret nothing" better as sung in the original "je ne regrette rien" apology has its uses it is better than dueling it is better than letting personal wounds fester it is often as the saying goes the right thing to do now it seems the personal apology is to become yet one more casualty of our era of wretched media excess it is being done to death for most people delivering a deserved apology isnt easy as one comes to it in a state of shame but how hard can it be for the mike huckabees and hillary clintons to "apologize" to a political opponent this presumably is about to become one more well worn tool in the skill set of life as we choose to live it now it looks like were going to need something new something beyond regret beyond apology and remorse get over it see related letter "letters to the editor having to apologize makes me very sorry" wsj dec
