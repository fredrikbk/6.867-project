dear mr buckley cancel my subscription cancel your own goddamn subscription by william f buckley jr basic books pages &# i dont think im giving away any trade secrets when i say that in many magazines the letters page is not quite what it appears to be the ruse is less noticeable in daily newspapers particularly this one where the editors rely on feedback from their readers and labor to put together a letters page that lets off steam even as it provides genuine interest its a different story though in the high end glossies the ones that are fat with ads and self regard in their slick rubbery pages its more often the editor himself or herself who benefits from the illusion provided by a letters page he does after all get several pages of copy that he doesnt have to pay a writer for his platonic ideal of the perfect contributor the writer who hands in his article and is then run over by a bus before he can complain about the editing comes to life in the letter writing reader who is advised in the fine print that while the publication "welcomes letters to the editor" it nevertheless "reserves the right to edit the letters for length and style " meaning send us whatever you want well print whatever we want at the same time the editor gets to appear egalitarian and concerned flattering his readers by making a show of seeming to care what they think when all he really cares about is whether they drop the &# for the lexus advertised on page one reason the old new yorker magazine the one with a j liebling and e b white was so unusual was that it refused to print letters to the editor at all thus making the editors disdain utterly transparent the magazine didnt run corrections either the message was unmistakable and you could almost hear it through the lockjaw of that foppish monocle wearing eustace tilley on the cover "it seems scarcely possible dear reader that any letter you write could be of any interest to us whatsoever we write you read " so just be still and go back to that eight part series on glaciers another nervy equally admirable approach was conceived by william f buckley jr in addition to his duties as columnist tv talk show host lecturer novelist and manhattan boulevardier mr buckley was founder and for years the editor of the magazine national review in this role as in others he was an innovator instead of merely parking all the letters to the editor in a few pages at the front in the editorial equivalent of a mud room he set aside a special department in the middle of the magazine to showcase the ones that caught his eye and then more often than not he would gut the letter writer right there on the printed page at nr the letters page became an abattoir mr buckley called his department "notes and asides " and he has now gathered between hard covers a "best of" collection culled from the years through when the department was discontinued in "cancel your own goddam subscription " we find the whole range of letters to the editor complaints and condescending jibes lame jokes and wry observations galloping know it all ism and always a favorite of letter writers nitpicking the tone varies with the subject of course but certain notes recur "you ridiculous ass " begins one early letter another opens "you are the mouthpiece of that evil rabble that depends on fraud perjury " and another "you are a hateful un christian demagogue " "you are the second worst dressed s o b on television " mr buckleys responses are equally pithy though slightly higher toned and always more allusive to one disgruntled reader who identifies himself in his righteous indignation as the second coming of jesus mr buckley warns "and i am the second coming of pontius pilate " he sometimes composes his insults in latin a bit of one upmanship that even eustace tilley would envy arthur schlesinger jr writes to complain about some perceived slight "i might have hoped that you would have had the elementary fairness or guts to provide equal time but alas wrong again " "dear arthur " mr buckley replies "i should have thought you would be used to being wrong " not all the exchanges are purely contentious the literary scholar hugh kenner writes in to critique a single sentence a long zig zaggy construction that mr buckley wrote to open an essay in esquire magazine abashed mr buckley protests that the sentence was "springy and tight " "springy and tight my foot " says kenner "those arent springs theyre bits of scotch tape " what follows is several pages of literary dissection with kenner attacking vigorously and mr buckley defending his published sentence with slackening strength if it sounds fussy it isnt its a miniature tutorial in rhetoric and style from one of the centurys most rigorous critics directed at one of its most accomplished journalists you cant imagine finding it in any other letters column over time "notes and asides" became a grab bag of odds and ends a way for mr buckley to clear his desk there are speeches random squibs and tributes to the living and the dead a lot of this material is included here along with the letters and given mr buckleys unrelieved involvement in the public affairs of his time the book stands as a kind of informal intellectual history of the final third of the th century these items of buckleyana are good to have in more permanent form but i bet its the letters to the editor that readers will savor most even those magazine readers who have once or twice been duped by distant editors into writing a letter to the editor themselves mr ferguson a senior
