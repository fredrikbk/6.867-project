the meticulous and the magical martin puryear museum of modern art through jan the exhibit travels to the modern art museum of fort worth texas the national gallery of art in washington and the san francisco museum of modern art new york back in the s the museum of modern art followed an exhibition of late paintings by paul cezanne with a retrospective of sol lewitts career the contrast between the two the pioneering modernists intensely wrought views of montagne sainte victoire versus the cool impersonal sculptures and drawings of a pioneer of s minimal art was extreme and deliberate this year moma is at it again during the summer it showed richard serras sculptures enormous canted sheets of industrially produced steel that took visitors on a roller coaster ride of emotions ranging from fear to exhilaration beginning last month the museum followed that by showing sculpture of a very different stripe martin puryears meticulously hand made and magically allusive wood constructions organized by john elderfield the museums chief curator of painting and sculpture "martin puryear" brings together nearly sculptures running the gamut of the artists career from the mid s to this year aside from their sheer beauty the one common denominator of this work is its mood of poetic whimsy mr puryears works combine insouciance mystery and wonder in a way that recalls alexander calders earliest assemblages mobiles and other works of the s take the three enormous sculptures occupying momas cavernous atrium gallery "desire" features a large wheel attached to a long axle whose other end anchors to a tower "ladder for booker t washington" is a long wiggly ladder that gradually narrows creating a perspectival illusion that suggests its disappearing into the sky "ad astra" consists of a boulder like form loaded into a barrow whose handle is well feet long wandering among them you feel like a lilliputian visitor to a storage area for farm implements designed by lewis carroll yet far from being disquieting the experience is one of pure delight then theres "sanctuary" an open box atop two long vertical tree branches with a single wheel at the bottom it might have been titled "the timid unicyclist " since it leans against a wall in one of the galleries a personage unwilling to roll the dice with gravity or "in sheeps clothing" an enclosed rectangular volume with an opening on top that has you curious about what might be inside except that the openings too small for you to really learn anything yet there can be a darker side to mr puryears sensibility as well in the catalog mr elderfield quotes mr puryears explanation that "desire" expresses unfulfilled longing the wheel doomed to perpetually circle but never meet the tower and theres "self" a tautly enclosed volume the artist has stained a deep black that sits there hunched and brooding born in mr puryear is like richard serra of the generation that came of age artistically in the heyday of minimalism yet while he shares something of that outlook in his preference for simplified forms his sensibility is too rich and his inventiveness too restless for him to have been contained by its straitjacket of impersonality strictly geometric form and industrial manufacture in fact mr puryear is a hard artist to categorize because his work confounds and overturns many of the things wed come to take for granted about th century sculpture where wood was most often a carvers medium mr puryear uses it additively sometimes his work will remind you of brancusi but the romanian modernist was after a kind of formal and spiritual purity in his work whereas mr puryear is interested in a wide range of metaphor and allusion and while his sculpture frequently engages with the space around it like calder and other earlier sculptors just as often he does something they never did seals the space in so youre aware of it as an element but cant see it time after time mr puryear has reshuffled the aesthetic deck and dealt the cards to suit himself he is a complete original nowhere is this go it alone attitude more in evidence than in mr puryears dedication to handcrafting his sculptures while in college in the early s he made acoustic guitars essayist michael auping perceptively sees a connection between this experience and mr puryears mature sculpture writing that "the description of a guitar a body a hollow space a neck could refer to any number of his sculptures from the past three decades " he adds "throughout his career the artist has turned again and again to the idea of an enclosed hidden space with a carefully assembled outer shell " in the late s while in the peace corps in sierra leone mr puryear learned wood carving from local craftsmen later he spent time observing a custom furniture maker in stockholm out of those three experiences grew an approach to craft that combines the modernist practice of assemblage with joinery and boat building but mr puryears craft technique the way he chooses to assemble his pieces is more than a means for realizing an idea in three dimensions its integral to his works impact as art the frantic crisscrossing of the lengths of wood that make up "thicket" for example has an expressionistic flavor suggesting a sculptural equivalent of one of jackson pollocks drip paintings beauty lightness of spirit a premium on craft skills mr puryears art combines all these things at any time that would be a significant achievement but in todays art world crassly commercial cynical and tendentious its more its a public service mr gibson is
