plan to unclog new york airports is a mixed bag big airlines are victors as peak flights capped will that do the job big airlines travelers may benefit flights at peak hours capped washington the bush administrations plan for reducing airport delays represents a victory for major airlines and a mixed bag for consumers and it presents one big question will it work after a summer of record delays and months of heated debate among administration officials and aviation groups transportation secretary mary peters announced steps regulators will take in the congested new york area the region accounts for roughly one third of the nations commercial flights but as many as of its delays dot intends to cap the number of flights at kennedy and newark liberty airports appoint a northeast aviation official to tackle cross jurisdictional issues and auction off runway slots to the highest bidders ms peters said the new measures will "cut delays protect consumer choice support new yorks economy and allow for new flights as we bring new capacity online " for consumers the plan holds out some hope that delays in new york wont be quite as bad next year as they were this summer but they may have to pay more to fly during peak hours because there will be fewer flights at those times steps being taken by airlines and dot to ensure there will be more off peak flights at kennedy and newark next year so consumers may find better deals if they are willing to travel at odd hours with demand in new york increasingly outstripping the air traffic infrastructures capacity to handle it airlines had accepted the idea that flight caps would come to kennedy and newark as they already have to la guardia airport ms peters said or flights an hour will be allowed at kennedy during peak periods a slightly higher figure than dot initially forecast but well below the number airlines sought still major airlines endorsed the dot plan because it doesnt contain two elements it lobbied vigorously against a congestion pricing scheme where runway fees would soar during peak periods and auctions of existing runway slots james may president of the air transport association said the plan was "not only acceptable but positive " and delta airlines chief executive richard anderson called it a "step in the right direction " but as with some of the big questions bedeviling the aviation world such as how to pay for a major overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system the dot plan exposed some fault lines with new access to new york area airports all but blocked off for the foreseeable future low fare airlines are worried that it will be even harder to take on entrenched incumbents such as delta air lines inc jetblue airways corp and continental airlines inc "what were saying is sorry youre not going to have the same options that people around the country are going to have " said ed faberman executive director of the air carriers association of america a trade group for discount airlines like airtran spirit and frontier the international air transport association a trade group representing many foreign carriers and some u s airlines seethed over dots plan to auction off slots that become available at kennedy and newark because of capacity enhancements "a takeoff slot at jfk requires terminal space a parking gate and a landing slot somewhere else " said giovanni bisignani iatas director general "this is a complex situation and an ebay approach slot auctions will not solve the problem " the national air traffic controllers association said little will change until the federal aviation administration resolves a long running labor dispute and experienced controllers stop retiring in droves beyond this it remains unclear whether the core of dots plan will do much to relieve delays caps have been in place for a while at congested airports such as la guardia chicagos ohare and washingtons reagan national but delays at these locations have risen in recent years and they remain among the worst performing airports this suggests that other issues such as airspace limitations and inefficiencies on the ground will continue to create flight delays and caps may need to be much lower than dot is forecasting to make much of a difference the biggest help nearly everyone in the aviation world agrees would be to enhance the infrastructures capacity dot said it would move forward with the port authority of new york and new jersey on improvements but the move to a satellite based navigation system advocated as the ultimate solution remains a decade or more away meantime ms peters said dot will push forward with an airspace redesign in an effort to improve the flow of planes approaching and leaving new yorks congested hubs
