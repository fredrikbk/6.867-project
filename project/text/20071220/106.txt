the morning brief latest polls depict an ailing giuliani online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the polls started to matter last year when presidential candidates were raising money networking and shoring up name recognition and they began to count more this year as rounds of debates and campaign events defined the white house aspirants for political cognoscenti and set the tone for election season narratives but now with the iowa caucus set to kick off a front loaded primary season two weeks from today the numbers actually offer a fair idea of where the races are going the latest tallies are most worrisome for republican rudy giuliani who as luck would have it checked into a st louis hospital last night to be treated for flu symptoms on the advice of doctors there and his own physician back in new york the former nyc mayor decided to stay the night the associated press reports and the fact that hes stuck in missouri as rivals criss cross iowa and new hampshire is part of what sets him off from the republican pack as the new york times notes rather than fight for votes in the first two state contests mr giuliani has been in florida california and other big later round states in a strategy thats partly based on his strong national standing in the polls and that may have backfired the latest wall street journal nbc news poll indicates mr giuliani has lost his national lead and garners the same support among republicans as former massachusetts gov mitt romney with former arkansas gov mike huckabee just a few points behind at those numbers are all the more germane because mr huckabee now leads the republican field in iowa according to the latest washington post abc news poll which suggests mr huckabees support in iowa has quadrupled since the summer as the post reports the survey found of likely republican caucus goers backing mr huckabee and just supporting mr romney mr huckabees numbers are also rising in florida where mr giuliani has banked his candidacy as the journal notes two recent polls there show that among likely republican voters mr giuliani leads mr huckabee by four percentage points with mr romney trailing both a third gave mr huckabee the lead in florida the factors behind mr giulianis fading star include his un republican like support for abortion rights and tolerance of homosexuality though they seemed to hurt him less earlier this year before mr huckabees evangelical experience helped propel his candidacy into the limelight but more harmful perhaps is the way revelations about mr giulianis past periodically add a tinge of scandal to his image "there were stories about how as mayor he provided taxpayer funded security for his wife who was then his mistress " as the los angeles times notes and just yesterday the post reported on the latest batch of evidence to surface about mr giulianis ties to former aid and new york police commissioner bernard kerik and how he brought mr giuliani in contact with the likes of a convicted felon who has turned government witness against mr kerik mr giuliani certainly isnt the only candidate whose numbers are in flux or getting campaign speed bumps thrown up by his past yesterday mr romneys campaign was forced to explain how the candidate boasted of watching his father the late michigan gov george romney march with martin luther king jr during a s civil rights march when the elder romney wasnt there "he was speaking figuratively not literally " campaign spokesman eric fehrnstrom tells the detroit free press and since he rose to the head of the pack mr huckabee has had to explain or even apologize for his characterization of mr romneys mormonism and a host of actions he took as governor the democratic race according to the wsj nbc poll "has remained a more stable contest among the top contenders" at least nationally sen hillary clinton has a percentage point national lead over sen barack obama but that counts for little in the close race that is iowa or in new hampshire where mr obama is building momentum and has narrowed mrs clintons lead morgan stanleys woes and its help from china morgan stanley yesterday was forced to write down its mortgage assets by &# billion and post the firms first quarterly loss since it went public years ago that makes morgan stanley "the fourth financial behemoth to announce a massive write down as the crisis arising from the u s home mortgage business
