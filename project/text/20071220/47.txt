home &amp family cranky consumer how to get a posh present for peanuts we find gifts at gucci vuitton scoring at tiffany sure that jimmy choo crocodile bag priced at &# might be the perfect designer statement of a holiday gift or better yet that cartier emerald ring for &# million plus but what if you have a somewhat smaller spending limit say bucks not to worry many of those designer names still have something to sell you whether its a key chain a set of note cards or a small make that very small bottle of perfume whats more theyll often wrap your thrift minded find with the same fanfare think bows gift bags and lots and lots of tissue paper as if it were worth well a million bucks its all part of a growing trend of emphasizing whats been dubbed "affordable luxury " particularly as high end retailers position themselves in suburban malls right next to more wallet friendly merchants this holiday season alone crystal specialist swarovski has introduced two bangle bracelets and a pair of earrings in that &# or under range "it expands our reach and it allows people of different means access to swarovski " said a company spokesman handbag maker coach has added a line of cosmetic products with a lotion that sells for &# of course the concept isnt entirely new just witness the scene in "breakfast at tiffanys" when audrey hepburns social aspiring character holly golightly finds herself in tiffanys flagship new york store and nearly walks out with a present of a silver telephone dialer priced for &# since were now in the height of the gift buying season we thought wed play a contemporary version of holly golightly and see what upscale retailers could sell us in that &# or less bottom rung category and whether theyd treat us with the same courtesy as a more affluent customer right down to how they packaged the item so we went shopping without identifying ourselves as journalists at two malls in south florida the gardens in palm beach gardens and town center at boca raton with no shortage of pricey boutiques we quickly learned that yes there are gift buying options aplenty but you might have to work a little to discover them take our experience at a louis vuitton store when we explained our financial dilemma to a sales clerk she seemed concerned but semi clueless saying our best option might be a key chain priced at &# we pushed a little harder and then she remembered some agenda refills for under &# not exactly our idea of the perfect gift since the recipient would still need the agenda but when that clerk went to the back of the store to find those refills she came upon some items better suited to our purposes first a series of beautifully designed travel notebooks albeit at &# apiece and finally a travel guide to new york priced within our budget at &# the book was wrapped in tissue paper and placed inside a sturdy box which was in turn placed inside an elegant brown vuitton bag at a gucci store where the sales staff was hidden in the back and took their time to acknowledge our presence we just didnt feel the love a fairly humorless clerk said that our choices would be limited she mentioned a key chain on sale for &# and some cosmetic items we opted for a &# bottle of perfume and walked out feeling a tad neglected gucci was also the only retailer to make no additional effort with the packaging the bottle went into a bag with some tissue paper but that was it no bow or placing inside a box to add to the festive holiday feel gucci wouldnt comment on our experience other retailers had a much firmer grasp on the luxury on the cheap concept at a coach store a chatty clerk said she knew exactly what we wanted not a coach bag but something to go inside a coach bag "yes " we responded that led her to suggest a &# mini picture frame key fob more an accessory than an actual key chain but the cleverly conceived item did have room for two photos and the clerk threw a couple of colorful coach catalogs into the gift bag to add some literal heft to our offering at swarovski we werent told about the aforementioned bangles or earrings but a kindly clerk took pity on our situation especially as he saw that a &# teeny tiny ladybug crystal display piece just wasnt going to cut it for us that led to the most bang for your buck suggestion from all the retailers we shopped a gift membership in the swarovski crystal society for &# not only did the program come with a stunning display piece in the shape of a shell much larger than that ladybug it also included a subscription to a quarterly swarovski magazine invitations to special events and even admission to a swarovski museum in austria and what about our version of breakfast at tiffanys in a touch tone world we didnt expect to find that silver telephone dialer but the beyond polite sales staff was eager to help us find something and the stores solid selection of lower price items from jewelry to cosmetics made it relatively easy the clerk suggested a great novelty item a deck of tiffany playing cards for &# he carefully tied a white ribbon around it and placed it inside tiffanys signature bag even on a poor mans budget we felt like big spenders store tiffany item playing cards two decks price &# sales staffs attitude beyond courteous not only did they recommend a number of items albeit many in the &# range they also didnt rush us through the process packaging the classic tiffany light blue bag was expected but the clerks offer to tie a white ribbon around the deck was much appreciated it made the presentation all the classier if money is no object how about a tiffany exclusive elsa peretti necklace a clerk suggested a nice diamond one for &# store gucci item eau de parfum spray oz price &# sales staffs attitude uninterested the clerks were hidden in the back of the store and the one who finally helped us didnt have her heart in it she noted just a few items a key chain on sale for &# and let it go at that packaging the gucci bag with straps colored in holiday green and red makes a smart statement but it would have been better if the clerk took the presentation to another level by placing the perfume in a box or wrapping a bow around it if money is no object the clerk pointed to an ostrich bag for &# plus but seemed to sense we werent likely to buy it store coach item mini picture frame key fob price &# sales staffs attitude chatty and in tune with our needs as evidenced by our clerks observation that we werent looking for a coach bag but an item to go inside a coach bag she suggested a few choices from cellphone lanyards to key fobs packaging the bag with the coach insignia wasnt anything to write home about but the clerk gave our gift some literal heft by including a couple of coach catalogs if money is no object it wasnt on view in the store but the clerk did mention we could buy an alligator bag from coachs stylish bleecker collection for &# store louis vuitton item new york city guide price &# sales staffs attitude cordial but somewhat clueless at first the clerk didnt think she had anything for under &# but when we suggested some possibilities stationery books she started to spring into action packaging sophisticated the book was wrapped in tissue paper then placed inside a box and then the box went inside an urbane looking brown bag and the clerk made sure to include three vuitton catalogs as well if money is no object we were told we could special order a vuitton watch for &# and shown a picture of it in the catalog store swarovski item swarovski crystal society membership price &# sales staffs attitude respectful the clerk was more than patient when he saw the smaller under &# pieces didnt quite appeal to us he came up with the idea of purchasing the membership packaging another retailer that didnt skimp the crystal display piece that came with membership was placed inside a box then the box went inside a bag but the subscription to the magazine is processed separately so make sure you have the recipients address handy if money is no object if that &# crystal ladybug isnt big enough for you you can always go with the &# swan
