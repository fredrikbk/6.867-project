wanted swfs money sans politics washington as financial capitals around the globe increasingly soak up cash from sovereign wealth funds political capitals are fretting prodded by the u s and europe multilateral institutions are writing guidelines for sovereign wealth funds that would keep the money flowing from oil nations and export rich asian governments but the codes arent likely to directly address the biggest political issue surrounding the funds whether they will be used for strategic purposes rather than commercial ones the growing financial importance of the swfs as some have taken to calling the essentially government owned investment vehicles was demonstrated yesterday when china investment corp with about &# billion in assets agreed to invest about &# billion in morgan stanley which has been reeling from the global credit crunch that followed investments from the governments of singapore and saudi arabia in ubs ag of switzerland abu dhabi in citigroup inc and china in blackstone groups initial public offering in all of the cases the foreign firms took minority stakes and said they wouldnt be active in management joseph quinlan a senior market strategist at bank of america said "swf" should stand for "salvaging withering franchises " he estimates that the funds have invested roughly &# billion in western financial companies since the second quarter of the year nevertheless there is still widespread suspicion in washington and european capitals that the funds especially those owned by russia china and oil states in the middle east could use their burgeoning wealth to steer investments for political purposes many of the funds release little information about their investment aims or holdings further deepening the anxiety there are about three dozen sovereign wealth funds with about &# trillion in assets in the next decade britains standard chartered estimates the funds assets might reach as much as &# trillion depending on the global economys growth that is a lot of capital that could translate into a lot of political capital if so wielded in october after a meeting of the group of seven nations the u s britain japan canada germany france and italy and leaders of eight sovereign wealth funds the two sides agreed to put together voluntary codes of "best practices " the international monetary fund is working on a code for sovereign wealth funds the organization for economic cooperation and development is writing a code for the recipients of investment the two institutions are expected to produce a preliminary set of guidelines in april "the benefits of swf investments to the recipient countries depend on the extent to which the behavior is economically driven rather than politically driven " treasury deputy secretary robert kimmitt writes in a coming issue of the magazine foreign affairs but a senior imf official said in an interview that "political issues and national security issues arent in the purview" of the imf and that those issues wont be part of the codes instead the imf is focusing on guidelines that would help sovereign wealth funds operate more professionally like a private investment fund there would be rules on setting up investment strategies and making sure investment decisions fit those strategies other guidelines would look at the structure of sovereign wealth funds including oversight boards and committees to manage purchases the imf would also make suggestions on what kind of financial information to disclose how often and to what authority the proposals fall well short of plans to directly constrain swfs tuesday swiss national bank vice chairman philipp hildebrand said the guidelines "need to spell out upper limits to investment stakes in foreign private companies " a proposal by arvind subramanian of the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank would turn to the world trade organization to negotiate enforceable rules for sovereign wealth funds the imf officials say such proposals are well beyond the imfs reach and are bound to be rejected by sovereign wealth funds many of which already feel they are being unfairly singled out in a meeting at the imf last month sovereign wealth fund managers said they were participating because they feared a political backlash in the u s and europe if they didnt in the past the imf has been able to pressure reluctant nations to take actions such as publishing a wide range of financial data on the imfs web site because those nations needed imf loans but nations with sovereign wealth funds have such rich financial reserves that they no longer need the imf "this will truly be voluntary as opposed to voluntary " said edwin truman a former federal reserve official now at the peterson institute if sovereign wealth fund recipients are concerned about a funds political influence the nations can enact laws regulating investment said the imf officials the u s for instance screens foreign investments if they pose national security problems germany and canada are considering toughening their laws on foreign acquisitions the organization for economic cooperation and development codes will cover countries that receive investment and will try to ensure they treat swf investments uniformly and dont discriminate against any particular swf reviews of swf investment should also be predictable and open to outside scrutiny said adrian blundell wignall deputy director of the oecds enterprise and financial affairs directorate both the oecd and the imf are focusing on issues of "transparency " advising the funds and the recipient nations to be more open about the choices they make but that may not be enough to assuage popular concerns "is this all about cleaning the windows and seeing more clearly " mr blundell wignall said "but if we clean the windows is there something left that still bothers us " the fundamental issue is whether the sovereign wealth funds have some independence from the state mr blundell wignall said he pointed to national pension funds which invest vast amounts of money abroad they dont face political backlash because their motivations are seen as purely commercial sovereign wealth funds should adopt a structure similar to that at many of the pension funds mr blundell wignall said the fund manager then would have a fiduciary responsibility to the countrys citizens to obtain the highest possible financial return and the investments should be handled by external financial managers he said
