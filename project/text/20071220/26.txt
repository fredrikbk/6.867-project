congress passes annual fix to alternative minimum tax washington year end legislation to protect millions of middle class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax cleared congress but not before democrats had to give up their hope of covering the cost with offsetting tax increases or loophole closings the reprieve could have election year consequences and came as democrats also bowed to new war funding for president bush on a vote the house accepted senate language adding &# billion in emergency defense funds for u s operations in iraq and afghanistan and the underlying &# billion spending bill was then sent to mr bush for his signature congress has approved annual fixes to the amt since even as costs have grown to near &# billion with an estimated million taxpayers now affected democrats had hoped to break with past practice and find an amt patch that didnt add to the deficit but senate republicans proved too strong and as resistance collapsed the house voted to again approve a fix with no offsetting rise in taxes created in the amt is a parallel tax system that discounts many of the deductions and credits allowed under the income tax code with the goal of targeting the very rich who might use these breaks to avoid any tax liability but it has become the bane of middle and upper middle income married couples in high tax states who find themselves vulnerable as their incomes rise with inflation the annual fixes follow a pattern of raising the amt exemption to reduce the impact of the tax for example up to &# of income for a married couple would be exempted in up from &# in and far above the initial &# level the goal is to protect about million taxpayers from the amt and ease some of the burden on the remaining million who would still pay the higher levy treasury secretary henry paulson welcomed the action but warned the late date had consequences making it likely some tax refunds will be delayed democrats split better than in favor of the bill and speaker nancy pelosi d calif said her partys commitment to middle class tax relief ultimately "trumped" the antideficit "pay as you go" rules also championed by democrats the back to back losses on iraq and taxes were a one two punch that dramatized the limits of her power faced with mr bushs veto and republican filibusters in the senate seventy eight democrats supported the war funding and ms pelosi suggested that next year her party will focus less on war spending per se and more on criticizing the administrations policy and the performance of the iraqi government she said she was surprised by how long republicans have supported the president on the war but she said that even with the increased focus on the economy iraq remains a paramount issue for democrats "it eclipses everything we do here " she said republicans also admit some changes in tactics are needed minority leader john boehner r ohio said his party must do more to define what it stands for not just what it opposes in the democratic agenda as congresss approval ratings have slipped in public polls he and other leaders suggested that republicans are also being hurt and could have a mutual interest with democrats in seeing more progress made on issues next year
