investors from the rest of the world have bought &# billion of chinese companies according to thomson financial the investment in morgan stanley will give state run china investment corp a sovereign wealth fund essentially the governments money pile as much as of the wall street giant it is the latest in a string of bailouts of financial giants by foreign investors as the firms struggle with souring mortgage related investments indeed yesterday morgan stanley reported a &# billion write down for its fiscal fourth quarter on its u s subprime and other mortgage investments citigroup inc and ubs ag received sizable help from middle eastern and singaporean investors in recent weeks wall street firm bear stearns cos agreed in october to swap &# billion investments with chinas citic securities co the question now is are these investors the smart or the dumb money historically foreigners are the suckers who allow the locals to sell out at the markets peak already the abu dhabi investment authority which invested &# billion in citigroup told executives at the bank that it wasnt pleased by citigroups move to bring &# billion in assets onto its balance sheet people familiar with the matter said the investor also expressed concern that citigroup might have to raise more capital potentially diluting its investment a person aware of the matter said citigroups relationship with abu dhabi remains good and that abu dhabi officials didnt disagree with the banks actions and there has been a political backlash in china against the government funds &# billion investment in blackstone group lps initial public offering a high water mark for the private equity boom since then blackstone shares have lost more than a fifth of their value erasing &# million in the paper value of chinas investment consequently cics senior managers emphasized they were looking to take a slower more passive approach only last week cic started the selection process for money managers to funnel some of the &# billion they have allocated from the &# billion fund for overseas investment into global equity markets but then the fund seized the opportunity to make the morgan stanley investment an aggressive move at a time when wall street banks look more like distressed assets "this deal is a big surprise " said stephen green a senior economist at standard chartered in shanghai "the u s subprime crisis created an opportunity and they jumped at it " for cic the deal with morgan stanley its second largest overseas investment could provide access to expertise the giant fund is keen to acquire following widespread domestic criticism over the blackstone loss cic characterizes itself as a "passive investor" and will have no representation on morgans board that is likely meant to address concerns over political sensitivities surrounding chinas investment in a blue chip wall street firm two years ago strong political opposition in congress derailed a bid by chinese oil company cnooc ltd for unocal corp of california since then chinese firms have shied away from efforts to buy majority stakes in big u s companies still the sheer size of chinas investment in morgan stanley will likely give it clout days before charles prince decided to step down as citigroup ceo amid massive credit market losses he had lost the support of a longtime backer saudi prince alwaleed bin talal described similarly as a passive investor in citigroup china made its biggest overseas foray to date in october when its biggest bank industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd announced the purchase of a &# billion stake in africas largest lender south africas standard bank group ltd china has the money to spend because of its ballooning trade surplus with the rest of the world as well

country that has remained elusive to wall street in the s morgan stanley formed the first onshore investment banking joint venture china international capital corp with a chinese state bank that venture later suffered from disagreements between the two partners and morgan stanley became a passive investor still holding a stake reaching out to chinese money is a natural move for morgan chairman and chief executive john mack perhaps the top u s financial executive left with deep ties to china since returning to morgan stanley from credit suisse in the summer of mr mack has pushed his china team to build a broader platform in china he recently signed a deal to re enter the chinese domestic markets while morgan stanley has also bought a small chinese bank and a stake in a fund management venture all of those deals beef up the banks china presence at a time when morgan stanley like most of its rivals still does most of its china business out of hong kong by linking chinese companies to global capital markets still striking deals in china has become increasingly difficult as beijing fears some chinese assets have gone to foreign investors too cheaply in the past skyrocketing stock prices have contributed to this feeling and prompted regulators to scuttle deals by western firms though china continues to attract the worlds highest levels of foreign direct investment &# billion in the first months of this year an increase of on the year the size of the biggest outbound investment deals have this year far exceeded inbound investments the top five
