japanese banks balk at aiding siv fund tokyo japans top three banks are likely to turn down a request from u s banks to put money in a global subprime mortgage bailout fund reasoning that their limited subprime exposure means participation isnt warranted according to people familiar with the matter a refusal by the large japanese banks to participate could help lift investor sentiment their share prices have tumbled recently on the view that investing in the fund would be a waste of money the fund aims to relieve pressure on structured investment vehicles or sivs hurt in recent months by the global credit crunch declining to participate in the fund which is backed by bank of america corp citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co also would signal that enthusiasm for the project continues to wane as originally envisioned the big banks would establish the fund to buy assets from strapped sivs with initial capital of as much as &# billion a figure since pared back to around half that amount mitsubishi ufj financial group inc mizuho financial group inc and sumitomo mitsui financial group inc were supposed to give their answer on whether they would participate by yesterday but sumitomo mitsui japans third largest bank by assets already told japans financial services agency this week that it wasnt going to accept the request a person close to the matter said if the government presses the bank to take part there still is a possibility it would this person said but the chances of that are slim because the government has said it will let the banks make their own decision participating in the fund "is something that the banks should decide on their own based on their management judgment and all we will ask for them is to deal with risk management properly " banking minister yoshimi watanabe said last week mizuho is unlikely to join because the returns offered are so low another person familiar with the matter said the banks are likely to act in unison meaning that if sumitomo mitsui and mizuho decide to stay out mitsubishi ufj likely will too these people said bank of america citigroup and j p morgan have been working for months to set up the fund but their proposal has been scaled back partly because banks have begun tackling their own siv problems and also because some sivs arent interested in taking part the people familiar with the matter said japanese banks are reluctant to put money in the fund because their subprime exposure isnt as serious as those of u s and european banks a spokeswoman for mizuho declined to comment on the matter while a sumitomo mitsui spokesman said "nothing has been decided yet " a mitsubishi ufj spokesman said the group is "carefully" mulling whether to join the fund adding that it didnt consider yesterday a definite deadline
