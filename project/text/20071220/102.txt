the expat life a merry wary christmas is flourishing in beijing online edition our housing compound looks like it might take off any minute the trees throughout the common grounds are festooned with lights and a dormant for winter fountain has been transformed into a towering electronic christmas tree it took an army of workers a week or more to set up all this firepower and the results are impressive the other day i drove home and saw a large group of chinese gawking at it and taking photos of each other in the three years weve been in china there has been a continuous increase in the amount of christmas celebrating here friends who cant or dont go home for the holidays tell me this has eased the strain of being in china for the holiday meanwhile we are double outsiders as westerners who dont celebrate christmas peering at it from so far away has led me to feel both more and less connected to the holiday which has always so dominated this season my friends wyatt and jacqui cameron moved to shanghai years ago and struggled to find a few items to add some christmas cheer to their apartment two years later she says there was a noticeable change when trees appeared at the flower markets theres been a little more of everything every year since "every year it increases and that makes it easier for me " says mrs cameron "i think i actually celebrate the holiday more here than i would at home i feel an obligation to participate in it more for my three kids because im not home i feel i have to establish tradition for my kids like i had and i feel that its all on me to do without an extended family nearby " christmas came to beijing a little slower than it did to shanghai just a few years ago western expats had to search high and low for christmas trees and decorations or make sure they had a good supply from home now there are sellers of real trees all around the expat heavy area where we live and they are also abundant at local flower markets indicating that at least some of the growth is due to more chinese marking the holiday there is even a single seller of small sad looking artificial trees at the downscale local market near our house you can still traverse vast sections of beijing without noticing that it is the christmas season but many higher end locales have decorations most of them garish and overblown the pacific century mall features a huge christmas display on its front sidewalk including three skinny chinese guys in santa claus suits complementing two more roly poly mannequin santas wire reindeer and even a manger scene baby jesus rubs elbows with santa claus and prancer ive heard tell of a stuffed santa claus cradling baby jesus and even of a crucified santa on a cross though i havent seen these myself and think they are probably urban legends while people in the u s often fret about putting the christ back in christmas he was never really in it here my old chinese teacher yechen who lived in london for five years and enjoyed the christmas season there told me last year he found it full of a spirituality thats sorely lacking here "starbucks mcdonalds and christmas are all the same to most people here they just like foreign things " he said "people dont understand what the holiday means its just fashionable big fun " at the mall a large white faux church complete with imitation stained glass windows showing jesus and mary serves as a backdrop a chinese family posed in front of the "church" for pictures and laughed when i asked if it had any religious significance to them "its just pretty " the mother said as michael boltons take on christmas carols wafted from speakers behind us "we come here and take pictures every year " despite the carols and the merry christmas signs theres no gift buying frenzy even on a sunday afternoon a few weeks before the holiday that is reserved for chinese new year which is like christmas thanksgiving and new years all rolled into one chinese friends who enjoy marking christmas tell me that exchanging small gifts is purely optional a sweet little lark my family and i meanwhile belong to that small subset of the expat world that doesnt celebrate christmas status that has given us a heightened sense of closeness to each other and to our small circle of jewish friends and sunday school mates lighting a menorah here feels a little extra special it would have been easy to opt out of religious life while living in china since being jewish has always been only a part of who i am but once we opted in it seemed to mean more maybe because it took some extra effort and it clearly sets us apart here my kids take great joy in explaining chanukah to their classmates they own the holiday in a way they wouldnt back in the states and i dont want to tip this appropriately warm balance by digging in my feet on santa claus or christmas trees since coming to china ive loosened up about whether my kids engage in christmas festivities i have enjoyed watching them participate in huge santa infused events at their british school the last couple of years and even threw a santa hat on myself last week when the big man visited the second grade classes being so far away i feel some warmth for these christmas totems which seem to represent america more than they do than anything religious but i do have my limits and they were tested by jacobs "holiday" play this year a musical reenactment of the birth of jesus called rejoice i squirmed in my seat as my son and his friend sam wore skullcaps on stage as the token jews it was meant as a show of diversity but it felt all wrong as did the entire production which nowadays would be considered wildly inappropriate in a non religious american school other american families of different faiths were also upset but our british and aussie friends couldnt understand why it was another reminder that in my expat life the cultural miscommunication is not always between me and china write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published read comments by readers on my previous column about the tradeoffs inherent in expat life and how missing a recent family gathering left me longing for home i have lived in london and tokyo while single and mexico and canada with my family and now enjoy living in san antonio chosen so our two children can spend their high school years in the usa and near my wifes family living abroad is indeed full of trade offs and im glad we could share the experience with our kids in their formative years so that now and going forward we can fully appreciate and enjoy the blessings of living in our great nation paul hinz i can totally understand your mixed feelings about being an expat and missing various things or people here in the usa while living in tokyo i once flew home for a weekend to attend a friends wedding but my familys two years there represent some of the most memorable high impact experiences for all of us no one has a crystal ball so i tell my kids to enjoy all the moments as best as possible shortly after we decided to return to the u s my father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and we were home to be with him through the end bottom line enjoy the expat life as you will have many unique experiences and stories to recount with your family for years to come i hope our articles inspire others to sample expat life jordan rosner im sorry to hear about your father and am glad you got to spend time with him i never doubt our decision to come here and really do value every day of our time in china i think the fact that i so rarely have regrets or second thoughts actually made the intense feelings i had stand out all the more much to my surprise many readers have written to say that my columns have influenced their decisions to become expats for which i am honored and humbled the positives all need to be thought of first all of us expatriates need to start with a positive we are here because we want to be and not because weve been exiled sometimes when family events difficulties in voting and different standards of behavior stare in the face the best thing to do is to keep compiling the list of adventures challenges with great outcomes and excitement that comes with living in one country and having been brought up in another as your article implies the most difficult of times is when one of those family ceremonial events from birth to death comes up we have lived in israel for years and been very good about making the trips for these events usually it is not the event but the ability to interface with a large number of family members and friends at the same time that is so important sometimes we know we cant all go back and sometimes we know we made the right choice to travel miles of traveling for two days at a funeral or wedding also planes fly in both directions sometimes we believe that because we have moved the obligation is on us to return not so family members need to recognize that if they really miss their loved ones the flight time and expenses are the same in either direction stephen j kohn wait planes fly both ways happy chanukah wow your article brought back a lot of memories i was a career expat and lived outside the states for years i was all over the place the caribbean mexico greece belgium iran and finally four and a half years in tokyo i married a greek and my first child was born in athens i always felt the way you do about thanksgiving every year we still years later with everyone home share thanksgiving with some of the same people we knew overseas and its always terrific to see them every year and to catch up back in the good old days before satellites and cell phones the big sporting events in the u s were broadcast on tape delay in i told my son aged to try and not learn the score of the super bowl played the day before because wed watch it together that night ill never forget his face he looked up and said "whats the super bowl " it was time to go home and we did about a year later still i wouldnt trade a day of it george w howard iii your article reminds me of my old house in my hometown where my grandma brought me up i am happy to see other people think the same way in fact i am a little surprised that american people sound to be more traditional than chinese in terms of missing the good old days most chinese today like to move around and do not like to look back or keep themselves to the family joanna li i am probably a little old fashioned in terms of my attachment to my hometown and old family house im not sure its typical of americans these days though it seems to be so of pittsburghers i welcome thoughts on this from any other americans
