another bush tax cut nancy pelosi and her fellow house democrats surrendered to reality yesterday grudgingly handing president bush and taxpayers another victory they finally passed a one year "patch" that will prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting some million middle class americans when they file their tax returns next year congress passed the amt in to hit a handful of millionaires who were said to be exploiting too many loopholes also passed by congress but because it isnt indexed for inflation and because democrats raised amt rates in to and from a single rate of the amt has turned into a blob that sucks in ever more taxpayers earning between &# and &# a year now back in the majority democrats have found themselves hoist on their own campaign pledge for "pay as you go budgeting " which meant offsetting any amt tax "cut" with &# billion in other tax increases or spending cuts mr bush and republicans sensibly argued that because it was never intended to hit so many people the amt shouldnt be used as an excuse to raise taxes on other americans and with an election year coming senate democrats didnt want to raise taxes on their rich hedge fund donors so house democrats had little choice but to abandon "paygo" as well and pass amt relief without any offsetting tax increases this is good news for the economy which is struggling enough without a new tax on private equity or other risk takers even better for the longer term this democratic decision to abandon paygo may foretell less damaging economic policy in the main goal of paygo is to make cutting taxes all but impossible and in particular to prevent any extension of the lower bush tax rates that expire after this years amt fight has exposed paygo for the political fraud it is and sets a precedent for abandoning it in in order to avoid walloping the economy with an even bigger and more damaging tax increase democrats will of course have to come up with another one year "patch" in before the election and already theyre promising that this time they really will stick to paygo right our own advice is that democrats could avoid these annual acts of political masochism if theyd merely repeal their own amt tax rate increases which would stop the tax from snaring so many voters in their own "blue" states meantime who would have guessed that a democratic congress would continue mr bushs streak of cutting taxes in some form in every year of his presidency congratulations madam speaker
