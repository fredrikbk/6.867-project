hired to seek buyers for his fashion house "i find many of them a bit dry " says the year old cigar smoking italian designer "sometimes incompetence is useful " he adds now speaking of himself "it helps you keep an open mind " mr cavalli single handedly transformed a hand painted knits business into one of the worlds most famous fashion brands over the past four decades but now the designers

fourth child " cristiana cavalli his daughter from a previous marriage is chief executive both women rarely disagree with mr cavalli "im used to always deciding everything myself " the designer says "its a blessing but also a terrible defect " although mr cavalli is now one of fashions most extroverted figures his childhood was defined by alienation his father was killed during world war ii when roberto was two years old leaving his mother alone to raise him and his sister mr cavalli says the death of his father combined with the devastation of postwar italy traumatized him so much that he developed a stutter "i began to speak well at a very advanced age years old " he recalls "it was psychological the trauma of war my family and growing up on my own i was more or less a street kid " after attending art school in florence mr cavalli says he began to paint and draw on knitwear which he sold to make a living in the s a textile manufacturer commissioned mr cavalli to make thousands of sweaters and in the designer launched his own collection of womens clothing as he carted leather and denim apparel emblazoned with wild animal prints into the subdued salons of paris mr cavalli earned a reputation as a provocateur his business was overshadowed by fellow italian designer gianni versace who made his name courting hollywood starlets as clotheshorses for his provocative looks it wasnt until mr versace was murdered in that mr cavallis business took off mr cavallis business didnt have the factories to deal with the sudden surge in demand so he forged deals with manufacturers that plastered his name on bags bikinis and vodka and sold them around the world it was the beginning of a life of luxury mr cavalli renovated a th century hilltop villa overlooking florence where he began throwing parties for celebrities including model cindy crawford and pop singers lenny kravitz and shakira as mr cavalli basked in the limelight the lines between his business assets and personal fortune became a little fuzzy and the designer was put on trial in for tax evasion mr cavalli deducted &# million as company expenses between and including utility bills for his villa and the installation of a video projector in his bedroom according to court documents during the trial fashion photographers and celebrities testified that the designers lavish lifestyle promoted his brand through photo shoots interviews and sleepover parties mr cavalli was convicted in march but plans to appeal the sentence according to a spokeswoman more trouble was brewing however the house of cavalli had grown into an unwieldy mishmash of employees and more than a dozen licenses "i needed someone who could give me good advice on matters where i wasnt capable " recalls mr cavalli in october the designer hired mr jorio fili to whip the business into shape but big decisions were kept in the family mr jorio filis attempt to end licensing agreements for beachwear in order to bring production in house led to clashes with cristiana cavalli who was then in charge of licensing soon after mr jorio fili joined the designer asked him to prepare a business plan for sab capital a saudi arabian investment fund that wanted a majority stake in the fashion house the funds owner sheik salah al balawi and mr cavalli frequently went on yachting trips together but left business details to others "those were very vulgar matters that had to be done by lieutenants " says filippo lardera managing partner at sigma corporate finance srl who negotiated on behalf of mr cavalli in early sab offered to buy a stake in the fashion house that valued it at million euros &# million at times operating profit sab was willing to pay a significantly higher valuation than an italian bank forked over months later for a small stake in prada spa the milan fashion house the designer turned it down later that year italian private equity fund investitori associati made mr cavalli an offer valuing his fashion house at million euros &# million that too fell short of the designers expectations "he was talking billions " mr lardera recalls mr cavalli says hed like to team up with another investor "since im no longer young " but there are no more offers on the table so mr cavalli is sticking to joint ventures earlier this year he created animal print frocks metallic jackets and black lace underwear for swedish retailer hennes &amp mauritz ab the limited collection sold out in a day yet under the terms of the deal the house of cavalli didnt get a penny mr cavalli says "the commercial side" of his fashion house objected that a deal with the low priced retailer would cheapen his brand but he overruled them because h&amp m which bankrolled a major ad campaign in his name was a good platform to promote his wares with young clients once the deal was signed mr cavalli invited h&amp m designers to his florence villa where he grilled steaks and served wine from his vineyard the villa was eventually chosen as the backdrop for a tv ad campaign for the h&amp m collection that features mr cavalli arriving fashionably late to his own soiree "mr cavalli mr cavalli you missed the party " the crowd cries his response "how can i miss the party i am the party "
