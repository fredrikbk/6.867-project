winnings to build an oil company juggling three wives and children he headed a legendary family whose soap opera quality rivaled the one on tvs "dallas " now dallas based hunt oil co the family run company he founded is playing another high stakes hand betting it can make money on projects in iraq and other spots that big oil companies wont touch the companys biggest wager is on peru royal dutch shell spent nearly years and &# million to develop a natural gas project in the amazon before pulling out empty handed in hunt took shells place in this volatile country two years later amid protests from international environmental groups and local indian activists hunt soon plans to pump gas from amazon wells and pipe it over foot andean peaks where alpacas graze the company is building a massive plant overlooking the pacific ocean to export liquefied natural gas yesterday an lng consortium led by hunt won approval of a &# million loan from the inter american development bank for the project part of &# billion in financing it is seeking from export and multilateral agencies today it faces its toughest financing hurdle when the u s export import bank decides on another &# million loan in the ex im turned down financing for a companion natural gas project in peru in which hunt has a minority stake over environmental concerns "the things that have worked out well for us are often the things that on day one people said you must have lost your mind " says ray hunt the companys year old chief executive officer hunts scrappiness pedigree and political savvy have made the company an outsized presence in an oil world dominated by giants the companys &# billion or so in annual revenue is just a few days work for shell or exxon mobil because hunt doesnt have the cash or technological prowess to compete with the major oil firms for the largest projects it must troll for profits in regions marked by dicey politics its willingness to explore overseas makes it distinct among u s independent oil and gas producers most expose themselves to less risk and lower reward by limiting their exploration to smaller fields in the u s that dont attract the majors attention "ray hunt is known as an original " says thomas wallin president of energy intelligence group a new york publishing house mr hunt compares his employees to a commando outfit his privately held company can move quickly because it isnt second guessed by shareholders or wall street analysts hunt discovered oil in northern yemen in the s for instance when oil majors shunned the region because it was then claimed by saudi arabia but such projects are also a gamble two years ago the yemeni government seized hunts main oil operations afterward hunts global oil production plummeted by in according to moodys investors service moodys downgraded the companys credit rating a notch the yemeni setback makes hunts bet on peru even more important the company doesnt expect much growth in its oil and natural gas fields in texas the gulf of mexico and canada industry analysts say in peru though it owns of a &# billion consortium set to start exports of liquefied natural gas in and it is also searching for oil elsewhere in the country if hunt succeeds in peru it figures it can expand elsewhere in latin america hunts gambling streak dates to the s with h l hunt a storied entrepreneur and bigamist who believed he possessed a "genius gene" that he was determined to pass on to his progeny mr hunt partly financed his first stakes in oil leases in east texas with poker winnings and later made his own oil finds in the texas plains newspapers regularly dubbed him "the worlds richest man " before he died in he named ray hunt then just as his executor passing over rays better known half brothers nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt who went on to try to corner the world silver market when the effort fell apart in and his paper gains vanished bunker famously remarked "a billion dollars isnt what it used to be " ray hunts modesty and establishment politics contrasted with the familys eccentricity time magazine dubbed him "the nice hunt" in but he shared the family affinity for risk and began the companys international expansion in hunt bought a stake in a north sea oilfield overlooked by the majors for &# according to a hunt biography "texas rich " the stake produced millions of dollars in oil the companys stature rose along with the political fortunes of the bush clan in ray hunt ran a support group for george h w bushs unsuccessful senate run called "young men for bush " and he remained an important campaign contributor to him and his son on their routes to the white house a hunt vice president jeanne phillips rescheduled her wedding to host a fund raiser for bush senior while the companys bush connections opened doors in washington they sometimes backfired in the middle east after the invasion of iraq this fall hunt was one of the first oil companies to sign an exploration deal in the kurdish region of iraq the companys political connections chafed on two ends president george w bush rebuked hunt saying the project could deepen iraqi political divides kurdistans oil minister ashti hawrani says he almost nixed hunts exploration bid because he feared the contract would be seen as a political plum "we said do we really want to give a contract to that company " mr hawrani says "people can read it the wrong way " the kurds signed the deal anyway in yemen the bush connection became one rationale to justify the expropriation of hunts properties although hunt figures the yemenis were motivated by rising oil prices hunt is seeking more than &# billion from yemen in international arbitration it is also still smarting over an earlier yemeni decision to choose total sa over hunt to build an lng project even though it was hunt that discovered a big natural gas field hunt is relegated to a stake in yemen lng "mr hunt told me three times about the difficulties he had with yemenis " says jaime quijandria a former peru mining minister "he wanted to be a project operator he didnt want to just be an investor " hunt got its chance in peru in shell discovered between trillion and trillion cubic feet of natural gas near the amazon village of camisea enough to vault peru into big leagues of gas producers from the start international environmental groups opposed shell fearing it would despoil one of the most biodiverse parts of the amazon early slip ups didnt help when loggers near a shell work site brought gifts to machiguenga tribesmen they inadvertently spread influenza and killed many of the natives shell says the loggers didnt work for the company peruvian politics were also forbidding "shining path" guerrillas controlled parts of the andes where pipelines would run while a nationalist government made what shell considered onerous financial demands shell quit peru in shell gave peru another look in the s after an investor friendly government took over and the guerrilla movement was shattered trying to limit environmental damage it treated the amazon as an offshore facility ferrying rigs by helicopter rather than building roads but shell couldnt reach a deal with the government on pricing and exporting it pulled out for good nearly a decade ago in argentinas pluspetrol sa proposed to drill for natural gas near camisea and along with another argentine company build two gas pipelines hunt quickly signed up for minority stakes in the camisea drilling and pipeline projects hunt started a more ambitious project too lining up partners and financing to build a pipeline across the andes to a plant on desert cliffs of the pacific coast that would chill camisea gas to minus degrees fahrenheit this liquefied natural gas would then be shipped in tankers to north american and asian markets hunt benefited from a changing political environment shells exit had stunned the countrys political and business elite who now sought to show they could attract foreign investment mr hunt flew regularly to lima to lobby for changes in the energy law a prominent hunt adviser pedro pablo kuczynski who had just stepped down as finance minister helped smooth the way in he invited mr hunt to dine in his garden with peru president alejandro toledo the prime minister and mr quijandria the mining minister afterward the government began to push through perus congress a series of what it billed as small technical fixes to laws and regulations it took two years before locals broadly understood that the changes had effectively recast the countrys energy policy to promote exports peruvian newspapers dubbed the changes "the hunt laws " a study by a former harvard economist funded by the u s group environmental defense and released last week argued that peru would be better off keeping the gas for domestic use deepening the debate here carlos herrera descalzi a former peruvian mining minister accuses the government and hunt of using "very clever and very dirty" tactics to make the legislative changes peruvian government officials say the lawmakers had sufficient notice and hunt says the revisions were necessary to attract investment "ill bet you the biggest steak dinner in dallas " says mr hunt that the creation of an lng market will boost perus gas exploration and benefit local industry hunts efforts in peru have been hobbled by missteps in the camisea project started by pluspetrol amazon communities complained they hadnt been fairly compensated for their land one of the two pipelines sprang five leaks in the first months after operations started in and the pipeline consortium has spent more than &# million patching it hunt argues that it was minority partner in the camisea project and wasnt responsible for the botched operations many activists in peru still oppose hunt dissatisfied communities advised by international nongovernmental organizations can be a potent political force they successfully pressed the government to cancel a big gold mine in and have shut down oil exports for weeks at a time during a november session at a lima hotel michael valqui world wildlifes peru representative told hunt executives that they suffered from "original sin" for the companys stake in the camisea project he urged hunt to lobby the government for additional environmental and economic analyses no way shot back hunter hunt senior vice president and ray hunts year old son and heir apparent who said the company didnt want to get involved in peruvian environmental policy "we understand what we are not " he said "we are not the government " hunt is however planning to spend about &# million over four years to help develop isolated andean communities along the pipelines path to impress international lending agencies and build local support in minas corral a collection of stone huts with thatched roofs only recently wired for electricity edgar zamalloa a former peruvian finance ministry official hired by hunt conferred with village leaders in november theyre unhappy about a camisea pipeline that runs near the village they told him because the grass hasnt grown back fully over the buried pipeline after three years "one hundred percent of the community lives off alpaca " said year old fredy lorenzo gomez whose lined face makes him look a decade older when the group heard that mr zamalloa had come to talk of a new pipeline requests poured out can the grasslands be improved for alpaca grazing what about more water for animals first aid kits for the community "were very poor as you can see " said another villager zenon alccasi dressed in the brimmed brown hat typical of the region "we believe the first pipeline didnt benefit us we dont know about the second " mr zamalloa listened closely but made no promises from previous visits he knew that the source of the sole communal water pipe is contaminated hunt plans to install a chlorination unit and improve the water system while its not what the community is asking for mr zamalloa figures the changes will help the local children and be welcomed hunt has more plans for peru which has opened wide swaths of the amazon for oil and gas exploration the company plans to explore for oil in a part of the peruvian rain forest abandoned earlier this year by another oil major conocophillips conoco pulled out under pressure from achuar indians who protested at the companys houston headquarters wearing traditional robes and headgear and lobbied shareholders with the help of amazon watch a u s environmental group "we arent interested in operating counter to the interests of the local population " says a conocophillips spokesman such tactics wont work with hunt ms phillips the hunt vice president told amazon watch in a fall teleconference hunt has no public shareholders
