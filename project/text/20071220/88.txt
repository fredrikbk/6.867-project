politics &amp economics epa sides with auto industry california is blocked from tightening caps on tailpipe emissions the bush administration blocked californias plan to put tighter limits on automobile tailpipe emissions handing a victory to the auto industry on the same day the president signed an energy bill that mandates the biggest boost in federal fuel efficiency standards in more than years late yesterday environmental protection agency administrator stephen johnson blocked california from going further than the federal government does in curbing auto emissions that contribute to global warming setting up a clash with gov arnold schwarzenegger the moves indicate the bush administration is satisfied with the energy bills miles per gallon standard for new cars by and may curtail efforts at epa and three other federal agencies to address co emissions from passenger vehicles still the actions are unlikely to stanch a movement by states that want to set their own tougher rules aimed at cutting fossil fuel burning by vehicles mr schwarzenegger said he would appeal the epa decision blocking californias proposed co limits and continue to press for the waiver to put californias standards into practice "the energy bill does not reflect a vision beyond to address climate change while californias vehicle greenhouse gas standards are part of a carefully designed comprehensive program to fight climate change through " he wrote in a news release mr johnson didnt say how the energy bill would affect the work under way at epa and the other agencies designed to curb carbon dioxide emissions in response to a recent supreme court ruling that declared co a pollutant auto industry executives and environmentalists are lobbying over the outcome which could amount to a mileage standard tougher than the one congress approved the energy bill signed yesterday which includes several measures to increase the nations energy efficiency raises auto makers fleetwide average mileage standard for cars and light trucks to miles per gallon by replacing current levels that amount to mpg it places a greater burden on auto makers particularly general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc which depend on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles for much of their profits still the details of the legislation leave potential wiggle room for trucks and suvs california is driving the next phase of the national energy and climate change debate although the states proposal doesnt specifically address fuel efficiency auto makers say it could force them to reach a mileage target of nearly mpg the top selling u s car the toyota camry gets mpg in combined city and highway driving according to the epa figures reported to consumers more than a dozen states representing roughly half the u s auto market are looking to adopt the california rule auto makers say that could require them to sell different vehicles in those markets "if that epa waiver was granted and we saw a proliferation of rules and regulations we would have a national food fight on co and regulation " said dave mccurdy a top auto lobbyist "what the industry asks for is some consistency and predictability " the effort could result in greater nationwide fuel efficiency environmentalists say auto makers "can choose to make one line of cars that meets the california standard nationwide " said david doniger a policy director at the natural resources defense council an environmental group involved in the litigation between california and the auto industry auto makers say that each state could enforce the california rule differently forcing them to tailor their vehicle fleets to each state california can set stricter emissions standards than the federal government does under the federal clean air act a nod to the states history of dirty air but it must get an epa waiver to do so the epa had repeatedly given california permission to set stricter clean air standards in the past but allowing the state to take on co from vehicle tailpipes would have crossed a new threshold in denying the waiver last night mr johnson said california didnt prove it had a specific compelling need to go beyond federal law "california is not exclusive in facing this challenge " mr johnson said he said a national standard is "a better approach than if individual states were to act alone " sen barbara boxer a california democrat who chairs the senate environment committee said she will push for congress to overturn the epas decision "to hide behind the energy bill flies in the face of the supreme court decision on greenhouse gas emissions " ms boxer said "this is going to become an issue in the presidential race " in pushing for new federal rules the bush administrations focus has been more on curbing oil imports than stemming global warming with the passage of the energy bill many environmental groups suspected the administration would embrace the fuel economy increases mandated by the new energy bill as its de facto approach to tackling co emissions deny californias waiver and stop short of additional regulation if the bush administration relies on the congressionally mandated fuel economy increases as the main way to reduce co emissions from vehicles it may end up providing much of the regulatory clarity sought by the auto industry however the supreme courts ruling this year that the epa must study and potentially regulate co emissions all but ensures the battle will drag on beyond regardless of the administrations next steps the wrangling over californias emissions standards reflects a broader predicament facing auto makers in the past year the courts have applied the most pressure on auto companies to cut co emissions and increase fuel efficiency u s district judge anthony w ishii in california last week rejected auto makers arguments that the states plan to regulate tailpipe emissions illegally usurps powers reserved for federal regulators current law gives state regulators the authority to "reformulate" national mileage rules to "harmonize" with stricter policies enacted in california judge ishii ruled judge ishiis decision capped a series of court setbacks for auto makers in addition to the supreme court ruling that the epa can regulate co emissions from cars and trucks a federal judge in vermont rejected the industrys attempt to block the state from implementing californias tailpipe emissions rules corrections &amp amplifications a federal judge in california ruled that federal regulators have authority under current law to set mileage rules that are consistent with stringent policies enacted in california an article yesterday incorrectly said the judge ruled current law gives that authority to state regulators wsj dec
