a bustle grows on hedge row the ipo allure och ziff plans debut as red flags wave sign of a market top hedge funds like their private equity siblings are finding it difficult to resist the allure of selling shares to the public the latest sign of that is a move by och ziff capital management group llc to register to raise as much as &# billion in an initial public offering of stock the ipo is expected to be the largest in the u s for a firm focused on hedge fund investing though och ziff also is involved in private equity and real estate going public could prove less beneficial to hedge funds than for leveraged buyout firms raising questions about whether hedge funds are raising capital to improve their businesses or simply trying to cash out while investors are enthusiastic almost every large hedge fund firm is considering a public offering say bankers and people in the industry the burst of ipos from huge hedge funds "may be a market top these people are enjoying significant cash flows that are unsustainable and they know that " says michael napoli who runs absolute return group a los angeles based hedge fund advisory firm "why not realize some value when the flows from investors continue " och ziff was founded in by the now year old daniel och an ex goldman sachs star with money from the ziff brothers who made their fortune in publishing and media the firm manages almost &# billion in late it managed less than &# billion the proceeds from the ipo will be used by och ziff to buy ownership interests in the firm held by various parties including partners the partners have pledged to pay taxes on the funds and then put the money they receive back into och ziffs hedge funds for at least five years but och ziff is going to borrow &# million before the offering and distribute that money to its investors likely leading to a windfall for top executives like private equity giant blackstone group lp och ziff will be a publicly traded partnership its income would flow to partners and be taxed at but congress is considering raising that tax closer to the corporate tax rate while also examining the tax on profits that funds pay the ipo filing comes despite an underwhelming performance of shares of blackstone which went public just over a week ago in contrast fortress investment group llc has seen its shares rise to &# since going public at &# a share in february though it is well off the &# a share reached on the day of its debut fortress which manages &# billion has almost &# billion in private equity &# billion in publicly traded real estate companies and &# billion is in hedge funds leveraged buyout firms like blackstone regularly raise money for new funds they use this cash to make acquisitions as such there are clear advantages to raising so called permanent capital in the public markets that can help lbo firms avoid the long and sometimes challenging effort of regularly courting investors to raise cash but raising big money has never been much of a concern for top performing hedge funds and until recently being very large wasnt considered a positive attribute some of the best performing hedge funds regularly give money back to their investors when they sense a paucity of opportunities permanent capital from an ipo can put pressure on hedge funds to put it to work even when they dont see attractive opportunities at the same time hedge funds care more about secrecy since a smart strategy often is quickly aped by competitors when it is divulged that makes some wary of the transparency that comes with the public markets as public companies hedge funds divulge information about their fees and compensation "these people arent terribly interested in being more public than they have to be but apparently they are getting more comfortable with it " absolute returns mr napoli says just over a week ago london based hedge fund firm glg partners lp agreed to an unconventional deal to go public in the u s market by selling itself in a reverse takeover deal third point llc a new york hedge fund last month unveiled plans for an ipo on the london stock exchange behind the change a growing view that being large and controlling more assets may be necessary to thrive today big firms usually have lower trading fees and financing costs better risk management and can provide investors with a variety of trading strategies the largest hedge funds have done better than smaller ones lately och ziff for example has generated returns of since it was launched compared with for the standard &amp poors so far this year och ziff has scored gains of after fees beating the market last years gains of also topped the market och ziff uses little borrowed money in its strategies at a wall street journal conference last week eric mindich who runs eton park capital management said that although his firm isnt considering a public filing listed shares can help a hedge fund recruit top talent and as more hedge funds make long term investments they are more wary of their lenders cutting off financing before the investments come to fruition adding to the attraction of raising capital from an ipo or a bond offering some hedge fund managers have spent the last decade building their firms and are ready to cash out or at least reduce their exposure to their firms hedge funds are beginning to look more like private equity firms so it makes sense that they also will want public shares with which to compete at the same time the firms are taking steps to try to keep a lid on the power that shareholders will have the stock that will be sold will be class a shares which will have limited say in the och ziffs operations as compared with the class b shares which will be held by existing owners and executives for the first quarter ended march och ziff reported net income of &# million up from &# million in the comparable period revenue jumped to &# million from &# million
