dow jones pact would protect three top editors the agreement on editorial independence that dow jones &amp co and prospective acquirer news corp hammered out last week after laborious negotiations was designed to preserve a measure of journalistic autonomy for the wall street journal and other dow jones publications by shielding top editors from corporate meddling but the documents power relies less on specific language than on how those editors and the new owner exercise influence the agreement isnt as detailed as say a rule book for a sports event much of the wording is vague leaving operations to mutual agreement between the two parties and the ability to enforce the agreement legally is less crucial than the ability of reporters and editors to win attention for their grievances the document is partly designed to appease worried dow jones employees and the bancroft family members who control the companys voting shares but it may also put news corp chairman rupert murdoch who isnt expected to shirk from implementing his strong notions of how a news gathering enterprise should operate on notice that hes being closely watched at other publications he has acquired mr murdoch has gained a reputation for meddling in editorial coverage "it gives you a good starting point " says john huey editor in chief of time warner inc s time inc "but that document isnt what all this hinges on it hinges on the good will intelligence and backbone of the people involved " the agreement which is still getting finishing touches proposes a five member special committee to protect three people from interference from news corp the journals managing editor and editorial page editor and the managing editor of dow jones newswires the members of the special committee wouldnt be connected with either dow jones or news corp and would be chosen by mutual agreement between the two the committee would have approval rights over the appointment and removal of the three editors these editors would also have "control over spending and allocation of resources within budgets set by news corp management" after discussions with the editors but news corp s decisions about the size of budgets would be final replacement members of the special committee would be decided by the committee and approved by news corp the agreement doesnt explicitly mention wsj com an increasingly important part of the journal franchise the members of the special committee would be chosen and listed in any merger agreement and would be in place from day one the special committee would meet at least once each quarter on a regularly scheduled basis and more often when necessary "that suggests a rather hands off approach when you are dealing with a daily newspaper and a minute by minute news service " said david schulz a partner at levine sullivan koch &amp schulz llp a media law firm based in new york as laid out in the agreement the managing editor of the journal "would be consulted prior to the use of the wsj or dow jones brand names" by news corp or another party but news corp s decisions on branding matters would be final news corp also agreed to allow the bancroft family to nominate a member to news corp s board a position that would expire after years to strengthen its standing with the courts the special committee would be made "third party beneficiaries of the agreements " and would have the standing to challenge news corp in court and seek injunctive relief the agreement is binding for any other buyer of dow jones for the bancroft family one of the most important aspects of the structure is how "enforceable" it is according to several people close to the family the family ceded discussions on editorial independence to dow joness board and once agreement is reached on a price it will vote on whether it supports a sale many in the family distrust mr murdoch and his track record at other publications for example at the times of london where he hired then fired the top editor shortly after taking over in so it was crucial for many family members that the committee which will be funded by news corp be able to take legal action and seek "injunctive relief" in case of a disagreement between the editors and news corp management but observers agree that while the notion of enforcement is important what appears to be more crucial is the power of the press after adjudicating any disagreement between editors and news corp the committee can publish its findings on the journal editorial page "at the end of the day if there is bad faith on either side im not sure how effective anything could be " says mr schulz but "they can go public with their findings and that seems to be their most important power " he says mr schulz has done some legal work for dow jones in the past the three editors who are explicitly named in the editorial agreement wouldnt respond to a request for comment yesterday but they issued a statement acknowledging the documents limitations after thanking the two sides for drawing up the document they said "we also recognize the best assurances of independence are reporters and editors committed to following news where the facts lead and to expressing opinions based on consistent principles and from owners committed to preserving their freedom to do so " the editors are journal managing editor marcus w brauchli editorial page editor paul gigot and newswires editor neal lipshutz one key issue about editorial independence is that news corp is a giant media and entertainment company most newspapers dont need to write much about the business interests of their smallish parents but mr murdoch has his hand in everything from global politics to making movies and tv shows other publications have had to deal with these issues for years time inc merged with warner communications in and later time warner merged with aol at the time of the time warner tie up jason mcmanus then the editor in chief of time inc also served on the companys board the overlapping role created a conflict for mr mcmanus who limited the coverage of the merger in time inc publications even as the event was widely covered by other publications mr mcmanus was widely criticized for his role "we thought it fairer at the outset to let others take the lead analyzing in depth its ramifications and significance " he said in an editors note in time magazine at the time mr mcmanus couldnt be reached for comment in after mr mcmanus stepped down mr hueys predecessor norman pearlstine drafted a one page document entitled "the role of time inc s editor in chief " the document says that the editor in chief will protect the editorial independence of time inc s properties which include everything from time to fortune to sports illustrated to people magazine it stipulates that the editor in chief has the final say over editorial decisions at any of time inc s magazines and that the magazines are expected to provide unbiased coverage of time warners other properties according to a person familiar with the document today instead of serving on the board of time warner time inc s editor in chief reports to the chief executive of that division and has little official interaction with time warner executives mr huey says he keeps mr pearlstines document in his desk drawer but hasnt had to use it "i have limited faith in these kinds of documents " he says "you can no more guarantee the future course of a publication with a structure for the owner than you can rule from the grave by drawing up a will " mr huey says he has never had an issue with time inc ceo ann moore or time warner ceo richard parsons over editorial independence messrs huey and pearlstine are former journal editors as part of the agreement news corp has promised to adopt a set of journalistic principles that are virtually identical to those in dow joness code of conduct the principles say that in all of news corp s publications "analyses represent the publications best independent judgment rather than their preferences or those of their owner sources advertisers or information providers " the principles also adopt the journals editorial page mantra free people and free markets at all of news corp s publications "the result of this deal might not be to corrupt the wall street journal " quips daniel okrent a former top editor at time inc who became the first ombudsman of the new york times "it could be that it reforms all the news corp publications " mr murdoch has said that he draws a distinction between his more sober minded publications and his gleefully partisan and irreverent tabloid papers such as the new york post and news of the world in the u k regardless operating as part of a larger media conglomerate inevitably has its complications "it is hard to find a publication or broadcasting company that covers itself or its corporate owners aggressively and effectively " says mr okrent who wrote sometimes critically about the aol time warner merger for time magazine "it is not that they are evil or craven its just damned hard to do "
