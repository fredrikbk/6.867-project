chairman works to recast shell ollila looks to apply spirit of innovation he promoted at nokia the hague one company makes mobile phones the other pumps crude but for a year now they have had one thing in common high tech pioneer jorma ollila in his former job as chief executive of nokia corp mr ollila turned a sluggish finnish conglomerate into an icon of innovation now he is hoping to work some of his magic on royal dutch shell plc the anglo dutch oil giant he joined as chairman last year mr ollilas appointment captures shells efforts to recast itself as a high tech company he says he sees his role as working with ceo jeroen van der veer to put technology "at the top of shells agenda " "within the next years this will be a technology business " he says in an interview at shell headquarters here mr ollila a finn joins the worlds second largest nonstate controlled oil company by market capitalization behind exxon mobil corp at a defining moment for the oil industry western supermajors are riding high oil prices to record profits but soaring costs are quickly catching up and profit growth is stagnating exploration opportunities have dwindled as competition grows from state owned oil companies with deep pockets and better access to some of the worlds most promising reserves meanwhile companies such as shell are increasingly falling victim to resource nationalism the drive by hydrocarbon rich nations to regain control of their natural resource wealth late last year shell was forced to cede control of a vast energy project in the russian far eastern region of sakhalin to a kremlin controlled gas company as the external pressures mount western majors see their future in the high tech prowess they say sets them apart from state owned rivals their proven expertise in managing big development projects and deploying advanced technology in shells case that includes exploiting "unconventional" plays such as squeezing petroleum out of gooey oil sands or turning natural gas into diesel fuel "its technology which we can bring its mastering the complexity of large projects " says mr ollila the finn has spent the last year touring the shell empire visiting projects from the companys insurgency wracked nigerian fields to sakhalin now he is meeting shareholders to hear their concerns and lay out the companys strategy he isnt running shell of course that is the job of mr van der veer a lifelong oil man but he sees his role as keeping a hawkish eye on shells corporate culture that means making sure environmental and safety issues get the attention they deserve a key concern of the industry following an explosion at bp plcs texas city refinery in that killed people another priority is ensuring that shell hires enough engineers and scientists to drive its technology agenda some say he is already making his mark "theres a much greater focus on all things green " such as renewables and combating climate change says neil mcmahon an analyst at sanford bernstein but some analysts wonder whether he will be able to give much guidance on the issues that concern investors most those in the words of citigroup analyst james neale are "reserves costs and production growth " "will he be able to shed new light on any of these concerns " mr neale asks a dapper year old who is also on the board of ford motor co mr ollila was a surprise choice last summer for the job of shell chairman a post that had traditionally been occupied by either an englishman or a dutchman shell had reason to break with the past it had just emerged from a messy accounting scandal after admitting it had inflated its energy reserves the tally of oil and gas holdings that a company expects to pump that triggered the ouster of two top executives and a series of probes and fines shell was pressed by shareholders to jettison its antiquated dual board structure and adopt american style ceo and nonexecutive chairman roles when the dust settled the new slimmer board recruited mr ollila as nokias ceo he had gained a reputation as one of the most creative thinkers in european business he took the helm in when nokia was a sprawling mess making everything from rubber boots to toilet paper on his watch it overtook motorola inc to become the worlds largest maker of mobile handsets with of the global market mr ollila who remains chairman of nokia kept it ahead by pouring &# billion a year into research and development nokia pioneered high end phones with multimedia bells and whistles while churning out low cost models for emerging markets it was a different story in the oil industry as crude oil prices fell in the s the majors cut back on r&amp d and slashed staff underinvestment left them starved of talent when oil prices recovered "there was a historic legacy of an industry thats somewhat slow moving and which is facing a change now " says mr ollila he moved in june of last year into shells inner sanctum here a slightly stuffy year old edifice with marble floors wood paneling and art deco stained glass windows telling the companys story from its roots in the dutch east indies mr van der veer sits in a somewhat larger office in a modern extension on the other side of the building mr ollila says that since joining the company he has tried to inject "a certain amount of informality" into board meetings with "a lot of discussion dialogue debate " before his tenure he jokes shells directors spent the "same minutes" on each item of the agenda but he isnt pushing too hard he says he wont appoint an outsider as ceo when mr van der veer steps down in two years he admits it has been a steep learning curve a company such as nokia invests just &# million in a factory making million handsets a year while the oil majors can sometimes spend &# billion developing a field the pace is different too at nokia engineers in charge of designing new products would "jump up from their chairs when the meeting is closed and they run and they go for it " he says at shell planning can be much more plodding with a vast array of long term issues such as regulatory concerns to deal with but nokia and shell have a lot more in common than on first blush he says for shell "the impact of technology is going to be fundamentally important in how companies are able to explore and exploit resources " he says "its not easy oil any longer "
