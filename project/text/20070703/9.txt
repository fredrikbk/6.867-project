ahead of the tape if yen corrects watch out carry traders the japanese yen recently hit a four year low against the dollar and a record low against the euro that might make sense if japans economy were sputtering but it isnt anymore the tankan survey of business confidence in japan released yesterday came in at near a three year high japans economy expanded at a annual rate in the first quarter compared with growth in the u s meanwhile there are even signs that long dormant consumer spending is picking up short term currency movements dont always make sense in this case one factor behind the conundrum is a familiar one the carry trade the bank of japan last raised its target interest rate by in february to the still bargain basement level of it now seems reluctant to tighten further at least until after parliamentary elections late this month that makes it very easy for investors to borrow cheap money in yen and then sell their yen to buy other assets like higher yielding european bonds or u s treasury notes there are good reasons why japans central bankers have been slow to move inflation there is nonexistent and wage growth is soft so they dont need to be aggressive about stamping out price increases meanwhile exports driven by the weak currency are still the countrys primary growth engine after more than a decade of dormant economic growth japans central bankers are reluctant to squash their recovery until the central bank gives a clear signal that it plans to increase rates the yen could remain on its heels but when that signal does come the carry trade could quickly unravel sweet deals by honda toyota may leave big three in dust a weak yen means japanese auto makers are as well armed as ever to steal market share from the big three honda motor and toyota motor have tried not to play the incentive game the past few years content to watch general motors ford motor and daimlerchryslers chrysler eat away at their own profit margins by showering u s consumers with financing deals and cash giveaways but the japanese are using incentives more aggressively now at a time when the big three have little ammunition left for a price war u s auto makers held the line or decreased incentives in june compared with a year earlier while the top two japanese players increased deals by as much as &# per vehicle sold according to edmunds com toyota is offering cheap financing on big trucks a segment dominated by the big three honda has nearly doubled incentives in june to &# a vehicle compared with june edmunds says the japanese enjoy a huge labor cost advantage over the big three which gives them room to push incentives meantime the yens weakness means honda and toyota can ship parts and vehicles from japan cheaply to the u s further holding down their costs as they cut prices incentives mean june auto sales which are reported by the auto makers today probably showed vigor analysts believe domestic sales of cars and light trucks hit an annual rate between million and million in june up as much as from a year ago it also means the big three continued to lose market share john d stoll comments to scott patterson wsj com or john stoll dowjones com
