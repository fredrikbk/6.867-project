trans fat ban good for hearts bad for wallets new yorks new law banning artificial trans fats in many dishes served in restaurants and other food service outlets is a triumph for health officials nationwide who have lobbied against the artery clogging fat for years but its bad news for the french fries served at brooks restaurant in queens says owner william gounaris "the french fries look like theyve been standing on a steam table for an hour when they have not " says mr gounaris who ditched his partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening for a trans fat free soybean shortening five months ago in preparation for the ban which took effect sunday fried chicken doesnt get as crispy in the new oil mr gounaris complains and the fries are pale and limp patrons used to slather their baked potatoes and corn on the cob with margarine from a four ounce tub at dougies bar b que &amp grill in brooklyn one of a six unit kosher restaurant chain in new york and new jersey by law the restaurant where huge portions are the norm can now only provide petite foil wrapped portions of margarine customers "think were making fun of them " says co owner barbara landau who says shes paying more for kosher certified nondairy trans fat free oils and fats new yorks pioneering law is being watched closely by the food industry and other cities considering similar measures says joseph pawlak vice president of technomic a chicago food service consulting firm ever since the food and drug administration announced in that packaged food makers would be required to list trans fat content on packages eliminating trans fat has become a priority for food companies ranging from kraft foods inc to mcdonalds corp new yorks announcement seven months ago that a ban would take effect caused some food service companies to accelerate plans to change their recipes one possible outcome is higher consumer prices mr pawlak says since restaurants may have trouble finding an adequate supply of replacement oils nationwide menu prices are expected to increase by this year compared with an average of about for the past years he says partly as a result of corn prices rising because the grain is in high demand for ethanol production new york city restaurants are likely to see even higher increases due to the trans fat ban say mr pawlak this is just the first easier phase of the new law food service operators are now required to use oils for frying and fats for spreading that contain less than a half gram of trans fat per serving next year they will be required to remove trans fats from baked goods and frozen foods extra time is in consideration of the difficulty of devising new recipes says new york city department of health and mental hygiene spokesman andrew tucker while the health department the agency responsible for regulating trans fat use will issue notices of violations during routine inspections the citys restaurants have a three month grace period before facing fines mr tucker says even as restaurateurs and analysts fret about the effects of the law and others point out the irony that health officials once encouraged them to use trans fats as an alternative to saturated fats patrons at brooks on a recent monday lunch hour appeared unfazed by the change despite mr gounariss complaints bob furey a retired sales coordinator who has been a regular at the restaurant for years the blue cheese and bacon "bobby burger" is named in his honor said he hadnt noticed a change in the taste texture or color of the fries cheryl mcgovern a year old marketing specialist who works across the street has eaten at the restaurant about once a month for the past four years she said she has noticed no difference in the onion rings "they were good " she said "they were just as lethal as ever " some new york restaurateurs say costs are a bigger problem at toms restaurant the diner near columbia university made famous as a hangout on the tv show "seinfeld" and by a s suzanne vega song the fries veal cutlets and chicken fingers taste the same says manager michael zoulis but the nonhydrogenated oil the restaurant switched to a month ago costs more than the now banned oil it used before while the restaurant cant charge much more than the current &# for a plate of fries it will probably raise menu prices on other items in the fall when a new crop of students arrives mr zoulis says logistics are an issue for other food servers volunteers at soup kitchens and food pantries are now supposed to examine labels on food products and separate which can be served where says joel berg executive director of the new york city coalition against hunger thats because the ban covers food served in soup kitchens but not packaged foods handed out by food pantries most facilities are "run by unpaid volunteers they have enough trouble keeping track of inventories " says mr berg who adds that he nevertheless favors the law fast food companies big users of trans fats have been preparing themselves for years to transition away from them yum brands inc s taco bell and kentucky fried chicken chains announced that all their restaurants were free of trans fat in april aramark corp which operates cafeterias for universities hospitals and companies converted all its operations to a combination of corn and sunflower oil with no trans fat in april and thus had to make no changes in new york but some chains havent yet decided on a replacement and are using one kind of oil in new york and another elsewhere mcdonalds is still working on converting about half its u s locations to a new canola oil blend burger king holdings inc is currently testing a trans fat free menu in five major markets for taste supply and operational issues spokesman keva silversmith says the restaurants were able to meet new yorks july deadline afc enterprises inc s popeyes chicken &amp biscuits which has units in new yorks five boroughs met the mandate for the ban months ago but is only using the trans fat free oil in its new york stores and continues to test other oil options thats because the chains signature taste is hard to preserve with the new trans fat free oil says spokesman alicia thompson in spite of scattered glitches and griping few restaurateurs have expressed concerns about the law to the citys chapter of the new york state restaurant association says executive vice president chuck hunt some restaurants including la caridad in manhattan which serves caribbean dishes like roast chicken and fried plantains have always used nonhydrogenated oil and thus didnt have to change anything the restaurant says others including katzs delicatessen a famous lower east side deli say they have had neither cost nor flavor problems with the switch the citys roughly kosher restaurants have had a particularly hard time due to the prohibition on meat and dairy products being made or consumed together "margarine is a major staple in the kosher industry " says yoel schonfeld a rabbinic coordinator for the orthodox union a large kosher supervising agency based in new york currently restaurants can overcome the problem by serving small packets of margarine that limit portion size but next year when trans fats need to be eliminated from baked goods kosher restaurants will have bigger problems mr schonfeld says chinese restaurants seem to be comfortable with the new law says steven wong chairman of the chinese restaurant alliance a trade group because they traditionally use oils without trans fat such as nonhydrogenated peanut and vegetable oils "for so many decades we were educated to believe that trans fats were good for human health " says mr wong "i think its about time that the government ban it for health reasons and everyone should follow "
