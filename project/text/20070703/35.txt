google v microsoft even by the hyperkinetic pace of the tech industry googles transformation from lovable upstart to colossal political opportunist has proceeded with remarkable alacrity first it was intellectual property interference then "net neutrality " now its antitrust policy the context is microsofts vista operating system the new version of windows and the "consent decree" handicapping the company for its alleged antitrust violations which is due to expire in november naturally microsofts competitors want to get in on the remaining action googles complaint turns on a feature known as desktop search allowing users to scan the contents of their hard drives google said microsofts vista search unfairly disadvantages similar "middleware" from other companies by slowing them down and making them harder to run late last month microsoft was a good sport and agreed to a compromise to alleviate googles concerns which will allow vista users to use a non microsoft program as the default and also link to it through other menus microsofts antitrust regulators both from the justice department and several state attorneys general agreed that the provisions were adequate google however was not gratified in an unusual twist the company filed an amicus brief with the federal court monitoring microsofts compliance making an end run around the regulators and urging that the consent decree be extended last tuesday judge colleen kollar kotelly batted that away sending the decision back to the regulators this was viewed as a defeat for google but it may not be the end of the matter the internet powerhouse has been cheered on by some ambitious state attorneys general especially connecticuts richard blumenthal who believe that the justice department has not acted aggressively enough against microsoft web based applications like desktop search are increasingly central to googles business prospects and thats fine but it shouldnt be permitted let alone encouraged to game the antitrust system a very big business is asking the government to intervene and protect it from competition from another very big business in the original clinton administration case against microsoft the company was deemed a monopoly because it made of operating systems called windows and doubly guilty because it tried to improve that platform for consumers antitrust policy is even more inappropriate now given the fluidity of the tech market it is easy for a business with a superior service to peel away the customers of everyone else thats what accounts for the success of googles basic internet search in the first place another example is apples itunes software which has blown away microsofts media player whatever its structural advantages while google can be faulted for its any weapon at hand tactics the problem is the arsenal that federal antitrust policy offers to rivals and the microsoft google confrontation is in some respects a pas de deux microsoft has been encouraging scrutiny of googles &# billion acquisition of doubleclick an online advertising broker because google is already the leader in online advertising its a good gauge of antitrusts overall incoherence that its become largely a venue for business predation
