fiscally fit the price of sun protection from sunscreen to laundry treatments terri totals up the cost of keeping safe online edition my son gerald inherited a lot of things from my husband gerrys irish family his dads wicked sense of humor his grandmother kathys blue eyes and his familys alabaster skin its the skin that worries me particularly this time of the year gerrys mom kathy once had a life threatening facial melanoma after his brother brian had a malignant facial lesion diagnosed back in i started buying additional sunscreen products to keep my guys protected ive finally drilled into gerald the importance of using sunscreen the constant refrain hounds him all summer long "time to put on more lotion " and getting my eight year old son to do so has gotten exponentially easier with the introduction of spray on lotion bottles gerald used to protest loudly when i insisted he stop whatever he was doing so i could apply more sunscreen and then aggravate me by wriggling as i struggled to apply lotion by hand neither one of us enjoyed the process with the new spray on bottles sunscreen application is a snap now that ive shown him how to do it properly gerald insists on spraying the lotion himself it took a couple of times before he mastered the ability to hold the bottle correctly and move it up and down his body in even strokes the first time he ended up with big white dots of concentrated sunscreen on his arms and legs and a light spritz of sunscreen everywhere else i still have to apply the sunscreen to his back face and neck to avoid getting it in his eyes and gerald still groans when i remind him that its time for another sunscreen application but the process has become a lot less frustrating and depending on the brand sunscreen has gotten a lot more expensive this year high end sunscreen products boasting a sun protection factor spf of hit the market i began to wonder whether this spf escalation really provides more protection or is simply taking more money out of my wallet dr elizabeth k hale assistant professor of dermatology at new york university says the cost of sunscreen isnt based on the level of spf "there are companies marketing products for more than &# but thats not because it has a higher spf its because its a luxury brand " she says so what level of spf is optimal "i usually tell my patients the higher the better because studies have shown people dont apply lotion properly " dr hale says for example when used improperly spf lotion actually has an spf of or less lotion bottles often say "use liberally " but thats not specific enough she says the rule of thumb for proper application is two quarter sized dollops for your face and a shot glass full or a golf ball sized dollop for the entire body "for the spray on ones you want to see a visible sheen on the skin " she says its also important to shop for sunscreen that blocks uvb and uva she says right now theres no spf number to quantify uva protection but you can usually find products that will block uva by looking at the bottles ingredients lotions containing avobenzone octocrylene and oxybenzone provide good uva protection while the higher spf lotions might not be much more expensive than lower spf lotions ive found another reason the spray on bottles are costlier than the traditional squeeze bottles we used to buy you use more sunscreen by spraying so the new bottles dont last as long one six ounce bottle of waterproof "sweatproof " spf spray on sunblock bottle costs about &# at my grocery chain this time of year i typically buy five bottles at a time one for a travel bag i keep packed for day trips one for geralds summer camp one for the boat one for the house and a final one to replace bottles that get misplaced or run out so how long does &# worth of sunscreen last not as long as id expected the spray on bottle in our travel bag is empty already and the one we use on the boat is close to used up part of the reason is geralds struggle to figure out how to apply sunscreen evenly then theres the inevitable "whoops i forgot the sunscreen " at geralds baseball game and again on the beach our travel bag lotion was borrowed by my friends and moms of kids on the team whod forgotten to bring their own sunscreen as a mom ive been there plenty of times the old style eight ounce squeeze bottles of spf cost about &# each and typically last at least a month having to replace a spray on bottle every two weeks would effectively double our monthly costs while gerald is big fan of the spray on bottles the convenience costs too much ive decided to use the remaining spray on bottles for gerald to keep aggravation to a minimum and buy lotion bottles for gerry and me out of the sunscreens consumer reports tested it favored neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch spf and no ad sunblock lotion maximum spf at about &# for a oz bottle no ad is considered a consumer reports "best buy" our clothes also protect us from the sun when gerald was an infant we started adding a product called sun guard to our laundry as recommended by his pediatrician after an unfortunate sunburn new dads fair warning if you place a sleeping infant in the shade while attending to other things remember that the earth moves around the sun tossed into your washing machine sun guard coats the fabrics with chemicals that absorb ultraviolet light sun guard costs &# for six boxes enough for six loads of laundry or about a weeks worth of clothes cleaning in the cullen household a single treatment of sunguard is supposed to block out more than of uv rays from passing through the fabric your average white cotton t shirt has an ultraviolet protection factor or upf of using sun guard should boost the protection is to upf you need to rewash the clothing in the solution after washings so every two months or so i add sun guard to the weeks laundry also as clothes get worn and stretched the product provides less protection because the fabric lets in more light because we spend a good part of the year on the water its also important that we wear sunglasses with the highest level of protection from harmful glare as well as the suns ultraviolet rays but dont confuse price for protection just because the sunglasses are expensive doesnt mean theyre adequately protecting your eyes "the higher priced brand name sunglasses will probably have a sturdier frame and fit better but as far as eye protection goes that really depends on the lens material " says dr stanley hatch an officer at the american academy of optometry according to the glaucoma research foundation sunglasses that provide the best uv protection have lenses that are treated with chemicals or have special lens coatings that completely absorb the suns ultraviolet rays some manufacturers labels will also say "uv absorption up to nm " which is same thing as uv absorption the glaucoma research foundation says because were on the water we also wear polarized sunglasses to reduce glare gerald hates wearing sunglasses so to protect his eyes each year i make sure to have a supply of upf protected boat hats which have wider brims than baseball hats to provide better coverage i can usually find them online for about &# each in any given year gerald will either wear out or misplace two of them so i figure i spend about &# a year with shipping to replace hats to protect his eyes how much more would you pay for a sunscreen that would block of the suns ultraviolet rays what products do you consider an absolute must buy to protect you and your
