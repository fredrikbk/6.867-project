office techs next step do it yourself corporate technology managers usually pick laptops software and other technology for employees now some tech managers are finding workers can do a better job when they choose and buy the equipment themselves at klm royal dutch airlines a unit of air france klm sa employees had expressed frustration at the companys policy of providing and supporting only one type of laptop the lenovo a formerly ibm and one smartphone the nokia last november martien van deth a senior technology officer in the amsterdam office tried a new system he gave information technology staffers an allowance of &# covering two years to buy cellphones for corporate use those who picked more expensive phones paid the extra those who chose cheaper phones kept the change as long as the phone ran microsoft corp s windows mobile version or operating system klm guaranteed access to corporate email the catch users had to deal with technical problems themselves and replace phones that broke not only did the program cost less than the &# the company paid for phones and support over the same period it was a hit with employees some of whom bought phones with fancy ringtones and video players now "no one can complain that their corporate phone doesnt have a camera " says mr van deth who plans to offer a tech allowance to klms entire person it department later this summer and wants to take the program companywide hes also about to start a tech allowance program for laptops among other companies that have tried departing from corporate its conventional practices are u k postal service royal mail holdings plc and indianapolis based pharmaceuticals firm eli lilly &amp co the u k s lloyds tsb group plc is considering a technology allowance program "the model is shifting " says adrian seccombe chief information security officer at eli lilly "eventually companies will say computers are no longer something i have to provide " while eli lilly doesnt have a tech allowance program mr seccombe says the company expects some employees to provide their own laptops and reimburses them for their internet connections similar to the way employees use their own cars for work and are reimbursed for mileage he expects this program to grow significantly over the next five years but tech allowance programs are still nascent most companies believe an it department needs tight control over computer users for security and that having a hodgepodge of gear to service is prohibitively expensive some employees dont want the responsibility for supporting their own devices and others cant handle it many companies testing the programs including klm have made a tech allowance optional and require participants to pass a computer competency test this "opt in" approach is seen as an important step in making the programs work helping pave the way for these programs is the growing practice of accessing corporate software applications through a web browser this allows employees to work with company data without special software on their computers staff technicians support the corporate applications and the companys intellectual property stays on its own computer servers going through a web browser also protects corporate systems from any viruses an employee may have on a personal computer in the u s there are now as many home pcs as there are pcs in the workplace according to forrester research inc companies experimenting with the technology allowance have realized there are benefits to sharing responsibility with employees who show they have the expertise it departments can trim their budgets by as much as with tech allowance programs estimates craig samuel a vice president at tech services firm unisys corp who has consulted for companies introducing the practice though it will likely be years before such programs are widespread research firm gartner inc forecasts that by the end of of companies world wide will require workers to provide their own laptops while a large corporate it department can negotiate special pricing retailers like wal mart stores inc and best buy co achieve unmatched economies of scale throw in the cost of setting up a new computer and support and suddenly the price that companies pay for computers is significantly higher than at retail a tech allowance program put in place two years ago by u k energy giant bp plc is seen as a model by many companies a bp spokesman declined to comment for this article at the time it cost bp &# a year to buy and support each employees laptop according to people familiar with the matter and a case study of the project published by computer sciences corp a consulting firm in el segundo calif to cut costs bp offered some employees an allowance of &# a year to buy and support their own computers employees would log onto the internet and use a web browser to access bps corporate software applications david burden chief information officer at royal mail believes putting employees in charge of their own pcs can increase security "if youre behind a corporate network you get complacent " says mr burden he is finishing a person pilot of a program that gives participants &# to pick and support their computer versus the &# it would cost the company but many remain skeptical "you have compliance issues and security issues but my biggest fear is that it distances the user from the information technology department " says brian clark manager of data management for drees co a fort mitchell ky home builder he doubts a technology allowance would work as employees would call the company help desk for technical support anyway or hide technical support in expense reports some companies say programs putting employees in charge of tech decisions have allowed their savvier home pc users to discover applications that make them more productive mr burden says a royal mail engineer who needed sophisticated modeling software could run it right away rather than going through a six month application process at airfoil public relations in detroit which gives employees a monthly allowance for tech needs year old account executive scott vallee decided to save his &# to buy a cingular phone that lets him take high resolution photos and videos as well as send email now "i can start working the minute i roll out of bed " he says
