investing in funds a quarterly analysis mixing it up a portfolio for the wary this lineup of funds takes an offbeat approach for the low risk crowd the conventional portfolio for a low risk investor comprises something like half to of the assets in bonds and the rest in stocks then theres the low risk portfolio of legend financial advisors it recommends a sliver in debt investments and not a single fund focused on safe u s treasurys instead its model portfolio holds a few mutual funds that partly bet that the stock market will fall and funds that bet on agriculture and other commodities too the guiding principle of the pittsburgh pa firm which has been creating portfolios for wealthy investors for more than a decade is to keep losses at a minimum using certain hedging strategies and investing in such sectors as fixed income real estate and commodities says its founder louis p stanasolovich in this column we ask prominent financial advisers who use mutual funds and exchange traded funds to share their model asset allocations for certain kinds of investors here we discuss a portfolio for a low risk investor potentially retired or close to retirement who can avoid making withdrawals for at least five years mr stanasolovich has been in the financial planning business since and founded legend in he has served on the board of the international association of financial planning a forerunner of the financial planning association one of the biggest organizations of financial planners mr stanasolovichs legend firm currently manages about &# million using diverse assets and funds that hedge their bets provides diversification and thus lowers volatility of the portfolio over the long term mr stanasolovich says he expects the portfolio to get an average annual return of to over five years he says that this performance has a slim chance of varying by more than about five percentage points in any year from the prior years result either up or down he adds that when the market is hot "were not going to have the upside " nearly two thirds of legends clients hold this portfolio he says though it is tailored to each clients needs the portfolio is reviewed daily but major changes happen only once or twice a year an asset class may be removed if the legend team thinks it has become too expensive or funds in the same asset class may be substituted if one has grown to the point of becoming unwieldy heres how the model portfolio currently shapes up conventional stock holdings mr stanasolovich believes that the u s stock market is very expensive right now and the model portfolio currently doesnt hold any traditional u s stock fund like those that invest in "value" stocks shares deemed cheap on the basis of price to earnings or other financial measures or "growth" stocks those of companies with rapidly expanding earnings he also believes that international stocks dont offer much diversification from u s stocks because many international companies depend on the u s and global economies he invests about in a fund that shops world wide for holdings first eagle global as of march first eagle global had a relatively large cash position of of assets of the stock holdings were from the u s alternative stock strategies the biggest chunk of the portfolio is in alternative strategies the portfolio incorporates several mutual funds that use investing strategies common to hedge funds which are lightly regulated investment pools for institutional investors and the wealthy many of these funds "short" stocks a strategy of selling borrowed shares in a bet that their price will fall making them cheaper to replace later producing a profit caldwell &amp orkin market opportunity and diamond hill focus long short are among the funds in the legend portfolio that use a "long short" approach in which the managers buy stocks they believe will rise in price while simultaneously shorting others these funds are supposed to do well when the market falls and mr stanasolovich thinks of them as "insurance" for a bear market he monitors their performance closely "we want to see how some of these hedge strategies react in downturns " he says he has been happy with the outcome so far for instance he notes that the caldwell fund did well in the bear market of also in the portfolio are arbitrage fund and merger fund two mutual funds that seek to profit off pending mergers and acquisitions typically this means buying shares of a company on news that it is to be acquired for a premium then profiting when the deal goes through they also may short the shares of the company making the acquisition since an acquiring companys share price often falls he says that these funds may not do as well as other stock funds when the market is booming but that "the risk is very low in that kind of strategy " among other funds in this category are leuthold asset allocation which invests in all kinds of asset classes and uses hedging strategies or short selling and pimco all asset a fund of funds investing in pimco funds in various asset classes hussman strategic growth and alpha hedged strategies use one or more hedge fund like strategies mr stanasolovich calls these funds "defensive " as they aim to make money in both bear and bull markets debt holdings given relatively low interest rates even after year treasury yields recently topped mr stanasolovich thinks theres "little or no return" to be made in traditional bonds like treasurys "we think longer term interest rates will be going up " he says bond prices and yields move in opposite directions currently the model portfolio calls for two u s funds that invest in floating rate bank loans which readjust every few months to reflect any changes in interest rates the funds are highland floating rate and highland floating rate advantage it also holds pimco floating income which invests in short term floating rate securities across global bond markets the portfolio also holds a fund that invests in short term sovereign bonds of developing countries pimco developing local markets as a way to get high yield and benefit from strengthening of these countries currencies the only fund in the portfolio holding longer term bonds is loomis sayles bond fund which buys myriad bonds including those with low credit quality real estate legends model portfolio for a low risk investor historically has included real estate it represents about of assets last year legend decided to sell out of u s real estate because the firm viewed it as getting too expensive funds in that category had performed well in the past several years and "we know that was getting tired " he says the firm switched to two funds that provide real estate exposure internationally cohen &amp steers international realty and european investors international property funds "we think theres a tremendous growth story there " says mr stanasolovich adding that he expects this asset class to return to annually over the next three years commodities mr stanasolovich is bullish on commodities and about of the portfolio is in the category the firms low risk model portfolio has invested in commodities for the past five years but mr stanasolovich says he felt constrained by the fact that most commodities related products were focused on oil and other energy he is enthusiastic about new exchange traded products that offer exposure to agriculture and industrial metals and added powershares db agriculture and powershares db base metals "to make the commodities component more balanced " he says the other two commodity investments are mutual fund van eck global hard assets and ipath dow jones aig commodity index total return an exchange traded note
