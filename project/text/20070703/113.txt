the art out of her shadow the sculpture of louise nevelson jewish museum through sept new york the stunning louise nevelson exhibition at the jewish museum reminds us that we cycle through art fashions at our peril too much worrying about which artists are being promoted at the various art fairs too little contemplation of the art itself long included in most significant contemporary museum collections nevelson somehow faded from view despite this exhibitions very persuasive argument that she occupied an important position during several decades of american sculpture perhaps the overpowering persona she cultivated captured by some of the most renowned photographers of the day ended up obscuring her achievements as an artist louise berliawsky nevelson was born in kiev ukraine in and immigrated to the u s with her family settling in rockland maine in having studied painting at the art students league she went on to study painting with hans hofmann in munich and by the mid s was primarily creating sculpture her early three dimensional works "self portrait " and "moving static moving figures " reflect a disciplined hand experimenting with a range of materials including bronze and terra cotta quite evidently under the shadow of constantin brancusi jacques lipchitz and the generation of artists whose forms hovered perilously between pure abstraction and suggestive representation so its especially revealing that in the excellent film that accompanies the exhibition six artists speaking about how she influenced their work as well as old footage of nevelson herself she says "i believe in cubism first " indeed nevelsons many complex sculptures rarely moved far from some relationship with the varied boxes in which she displayed her formalist ideas and the odd assortment of junk with which she assembled them we ought not make too much of the artists flamboyant and theatrical personality one of the text panels tells us that "in her day she rivaled andy warhol as a fixture on the art scene" so im inclined to take her on camera statements with a grain of salt because ultimately it is the work itself that makes the best argument for nevelsons uncanny power to visually seduce us at least until the later pretentious metal works such as the overblown steel construction at park avenue and nd street where the magic became mere stylistic formula began to prevail ms nevelson died in it is the visitors good fortune that the jewish museum show thoughtfully curated by brooke kamin rapaport concentrates primarily on nevelsons elegant and yet somehow unsettling monochrome works in wood and its a reminder that we really ought to let the artist speak through her art rather than through her creation of a "legend" or her flood of pithy statements about what it all means those kohl rimmed eyes may even start to obscure what turns out to be an impressive oeuvre louise nevelson shared with many of her contemporaries the dilemma of confronting the often overpowering artists who preceded her absorbing their work and literally re creating art with a visual and physical language of her own while working with found and recycled materials was fairly commonplace for a number of artists by the s and s think of david smith richard anuskiewicz and john chamberlain who were themselves following in the footsteps of picasso and julio gonzales nevelson managed both to recycle and to transform the wood detritus with which she worked subjecting the bits and pieces of furniture and other familiar scraps to the faux anonymity of monochrome and the highly traditional rules of the formalist art tradition to which she remained tightly bound because the materials appear to come from a lifetime of foraging nevelson evidently wants the viewer to occupy that uncomfortable space between recognition "oh that looks like a bedpost" and discovering as much mystery in these commonplace forms that she herself finds in assembling them "first personage" is so elegantly formal and almost threateningly black that there is a sense of surprise at finding how sensuous the wood surfaces are in "night landscape" and "moon fountain" nevelson has reconceived the most banal forms a branch wood slats so that they look as if cast in bronze giving them a new majesty very different from some of her contemporaries who actually did make bronze castings from all sorts of junk for nevelson black was "not a negation" but rather was used to make "something aristocratic " and she repeatedly succeeded in that transformative process the white sculptures lose some of the mysterious quality that emanates from the black ones yet nevelsons sensibility for the majestic remains strong especially in "dawns wedding chapel" long scattered and lovingly reassembled in this impressive installation this powerful group of works combines the expanse and weight of architecture with an assemblage of recognizable and obscure bits and pieces of wood and even some of the lacey finesse of a bridal veil the most commanding works show how and why nevelsons monochrome experiments that ventured away from black and white such as the two gold painted sculptures in this exhibition lose the spiritual qualities that made her works feel so appropriate even for the few synagogue commissions and holocaust themed works she executed it is great to welcome back to new york "homage to the " on view at the jewish museum in the mid s then in the collection of brown university and now on loan from the osaka city museum of modern art art sure does travel great distances in this age of deaccessioning but what goes around sometimes comes around considering how often an artist is badly served by an overblown retrospective exhibition we should be grateful for this unusually judicious approach to recognizing the achievements of an artist too long out of view mr freudenheim a former art museum director served as the assistant secretary for museums at the
