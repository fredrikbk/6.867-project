we really ought to give iowa a try little heathens by mildred armstrong kalish bantam pages &# a good days work by dwight w hoover ivan r dee pages &# grant wood "the music man " donna reed has any state contributed so bounteously to american culture as iowa well maybe mississippi but if iowans cant sing the blues they sure can write about em the s simultaneously the age of the great depression and the heyday of iowa regionalism is now the setting for two memoirs of iowa farm life in "little heathens " mildred armstrong kalish descended from the states earliest settlers charmingly recollects growing up on a small farm near garrison with penny pinching grandparents and an overwhelmed single mother whose husband has been banished for reasons never known she offers up a profusion of characters and memories a beloved spinster aunt shooting tin cans with her an act of cruelty at a box social hanging may baskets hunting morel mushrooms and learning to swear in her family of "hearty handshake methodists " i liked this exchange between mildred and her abstemious grandfather "but grandpa even jesus turned the water into wine at the wedding " "well i know he did and thats the only thing i ever held against him " this is a lovely re creation of an iowa girlhood before the invasion of the electrified time wasters and soul deadening initialisms of tv pc and im the author writes of "the kinship of souls that is created when everyone gathers in the kitchen to prepare a meal together " the "smell of bacon" lifts her to proustian reverie ms kalish provides recipes aunt belles horehound candy &amp cough syrup carrot marmalade corn oysters and folk remedies wart removal uses for peroxide she tells us how to skin a rabbit boil a hogs head and fry a turtle she is unsqueamish the surest sign of a farm girl and also wry affectionate forgiving a delightful companion there are worse things she knows than not having things not having roots for instance ms kalish was raised "in an environment where everyone knew everyone else " it endowed her with "a sense of security a sense of belonging in the world " she knew who she was where she was from she could name the birds the flowers the animals this is a knowledge that the children of her old town who today are "bused to a megaschool " will not acquire in technology class in "a good days work " dwight w hoover revisits the s by describing his boyhood on a acre iowa family farm "a capitalistic enterprise overlaid on a subsistence occupation " his family alternately resists and compromises with the "get big or get out" drift of th century american agriculture what is most striking about mr hoovers account is the extent to which the "progress" that drove his family off the land was the work not of some invisible hand but rather of government policy sometimes it was as brutally straightforward as the iowa highway commission using its power of eminent domain to "construct a state highway through my fathers farm " obliterating an apple and pear orchard at other times it was subtler for example the price of draft horses zoomed in world war i as horses were all but drafted for service in europe tractors filled the gap the costs of the mechanization required more cash crops a looking outward a de emphasis on self sufficiency farmers began to buy eggs and milk and meat from stores and tear down fences to allow "full utilization of the tractors potential " with livestock gone manure gave way to chemical fertilizers welcome to the modern age the hoovers living up to their surname did not look to the new deal for relief dwights father and uncles "good republicans " refused to accept government credit a farmer cousin with the echoic quaker name of herbert hoover even went to prison for resisting the draft dwight hoover is unsentimental his book lacks the warmth of ms kalishs though his observations are often acute "pumping water was no more boring than working out in a gym and at least the exercise was outdoors in clean air " he does not cover his little schoolhouse in treacle as is the case today in rural schools the dull standardized textbooks of hoovers youth disdained agriculture as a peasant pursuit beneath notice dwights grandfather urged the boy to farm the old way with horses and thus avoid the debt and overextension that would bleed postwar family farms it might have worked but the "social isolation" of the bachelor farmer spooked him dwight a lousy cornhusker and bright boy left the farm and iowa for academe he has thought on what was and wondered what might have been he is not without regret the most poignant scene in the book is his th high school reunion at which he is unrecognized by classmates and iowa is unrecognizable to him the old homestead is for sale a floodlight company is located across the road its wares aglow blotting out the marvelously dark iowa nights the tone here is elegiac the "iowa boy " writes mr hoover "is history " might the coincident release of these books augur an iowa renaissance alas the authors have long fled their fecund native soil for florida hoover and california kalish but iowans are imaginatively literate sorts as such restorative movements as community supported agriculture and human scale organic farming flourish the values that mildred kalish associates with her upbringing "resourcefulness dedication hard work discipline creativity and goodwill" will find defenders even memoirists in tomorrows iowa mr kauffmans most recent books are "dispatches from the muckdog gazette" holt and "look homeward america" isi
