funds a quarterly analysis fund fight state street aims to reclaim its past etf glory just over two years ago executives from state street global advisors exchange traded funds group went to the top brass with a plea invest more in the business they pointed to the huge potential of the etf market and the profits the firm could reap from a big market share but it wasnt just opportunity they were looking at they also had their eye on something else the loss of the firms leadership position in etfs to their aggressive west coast competitor barclays global investors in state street global a unit of state street corp introduced the first etf based on the standard &amp poors stock index it turned out to be a hugely successful product the spdr pronounced spider continues to be by far the biggest single etf in the u s with &# billion in its coffers but the boston firm itself has been dwarfed in the hot investment area by barclays which passed state street as the largest etf manager in a decade after the spiders launch the san francisco based unit of britains barclays plc surged ahead by flooding the market with new products and pouring money into a sales effort that helped make its ishares brand practically synonymous with etfs barclays now manages &# billion in u s traded etfs while state street manages &# billion today thanks to the pitch made by the etf executives state street is counterattacking theyve added more than two dozen funds in the past two years simplified what had become a confusing series of brands and boosted their sales efforts it promises to be a tough battle industry analysts and executives say waged against not just barclays but also against third place vanguard group inc which has ramped up its own marketing efforts with new ultra low cost offerings james ross a year state street veteran who heads etf product development acknowledges that there is "a lot more work to do " but "weve got some new funds that have absolutely taken off weve got some strong salespeople and have a consistent brand were definitely headed in the right direction " state streets renewed push comes as the etf business has evolved from a niche area to a main event featuring a steady stream of new etf companies and hundreds of new and increasingly volatile funds as these upstarts seek to get noticed if state street is successful it could make life more difficult for the players who lack deep pockets to promote their offerings potentially reshaping the field with ramifications for tens of thousands of small investors exchange traded funds are similar to traditional index tracking mutual funds but they trade on exchanges like shares of stock thanks largely to costs that are lower than those of average mutual funds and to tax advantages they have exploded in popularity and roughly etfs now boast &# billion in assets while that is small compared with the roughly &# trillion invested in mutual funds etfs are growing at a much faster pace when state street unveiled the first one with the unwieldy name of standard &amp poors depositary receipts its success was far from assured in its second year in fact the spdr lost assets by however it had pulled in a hefty &# billion as big institutional investors and professional traders found it an easy way to place bets on the ups and downs of the stock market that year state street launched its diamonds tracking the dow jones industrial average as well as shares tracking nine industry sectors of the s&amp p called sector spdrs both barclays and state street offer funds based on indexes licensed from dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal then in the spring of barclays unleashed dozens of funds based on widely followed indexes such as the russell index of small stocks its sales force fanned out across the country to run seminars and promote the ishares brand state street meanwhile had turned its focus elsewhere as with barclays it has long had a big business running index based accounts for pension funds endowments and other institutional accounts but its priority at the time was to expand the firms business of running portfolios headed by stock pickers especially outside the u s resources were pouring into those efforts in state streets etf unit a third brand name had become part of the mix streettracks initially a series of etfs tracking various sorts of u s stocks from diamonds in the rough to pricey shares of rapidly expanding companies as well as internet and technology stock indexes another issue was emerging the lack of a dedicated sales force state street representatives who called on financial advisers also pitched mutual funds and managed accounts which could be more profitable to sell than etfs in late state streets etf developers had a big success with a fund tracking gold prices that today has &# billion in assets still the firms etf business was falling behind that of barclays at the end of barclays managed &# billion in etfs and state street &# billion most of it in the spdr and streettracks gold shares to change things mr ross and other executives made their series of presentations to senior executives including ronald logue state streets chairman and chief executive officer they argued that with the etf market expected to grow a year it was worth refocusing the companys effort the game plan was to broaden the lineup of funds leverage other parts of state streets operations to create innovative offerings and build a focused sales effort in early the group got the green light the first step to plug holes in the line up of funds "we needed to give our salespeople a full batch of products " says mr ross "you didnt want them out there saying if you want international exposure you need to buy somebody elses etfs " however this effort was slowed by a backlog at the securities and exchange commission the growing number of fledgling etf firms had swamped the sec with product filings in late state street came out with nine additional funds including basic ones tracking large and midsize u s stocks that had been missing from the line up then in and early this year it launched a series of international etfs riding a wave of u s enthusiasm for investing overseas among the selling points lower fees than some barclays funds cost is an important aspect of the etf business because expense ratios cut into investors investment returns the average state street etf has an expense ratio of of assets while barclays charges an average according to morningstar inc still vanguard comes in the cheapest at state street executives point to their launch of the spdr dj wilshire international real estate etf as an example of their new approach in early these executives were hearing from financial advisers that clients wanted international real estate exposure the etf group approached a state street affiliate specializing in real estate tuckerman group tuckerman concurred that international real estate was emerging as an appealing investment for big u s investors mr ross and his group decided to move forward with an etf just before christmas the sec granted approval "we thought do we launch this four days before christmas " says mr ross but financial advisers were calling to ask when the fund would launch "there was a good buzz " says anthony rochte who oversees the sales effort they proceeded with the launch it pulled in &# million by year end and today has &# million early this year state street announced it is doing away with the streettracks and diamonds brands to unify its etfs under the spdr name with a logo featuring a redesigned version of the spdrs spider illustration it launched an ad campaign and reorganized the sales effort dividing the sales force to focus on client segments it also has changed how the sales force is compensated aiming to bolster etf sales as younger rivals continue to push products out the door mr ross says state street is trying to be selective about introductions he points to data showing that between september and march state street rolled out just of etfs that were launched yet grabbed of the money that went to all those new funds all total state street now has exchange traded products in the u s and barclays has barclays acknowledges that the field is more competitive these days declining to comment directly on state street on service and distribution "we still feel like we have a competitive advantage " says michael latham head of americas ishares and in fact for the first five months of this year barclays market share edged up while state streets fell according to data compiled by morgan stanley "i look at the whole etf business as being in the third inning " mr ross says "you can lose the game in the third inning but very rarely can you win it "
