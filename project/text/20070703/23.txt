deadly double standards lance cpl justin sharratt is a u s marine who served in combat in haditha iraq and whose actions on the battlefield have made him the focus of an investigation he is charged with committing three counts of unpremeditated murder on nov recently i had the distinct honor of testifying for him at an article hearing at camp pendleton calif i will not comment on the specifics of his case but i will offer a few observations about how this country is judging its young warriors for decisions they make in the heat of battle and the effect that judgment may have on our ability to wage war lt col paul yingling recently gained a lot of media attention for writing that "a private who loses a rifle suffers more consequence than a general who loses a war " nowhere is that more true than in the administration of justice for decisions made on the battlefield the defense departments "rules of engagement" allow commanders to make decisions on how to conduct combat operations they are given wide latitude up front to decide what level of force a specific mission calls for whether to conduct a very limited engagement whether to call in an air strike or conduct other actions that may result in civilian casualties their decisions are often informed by whether they are dealing with known enemy combatants or high value targets depending on the number of potential civilian casualties and the type of weapons systems employed they can order a target to be bombed without fear of legal consequence assistance payments called solatia made when civilians are injured or killed or property is damaged are not admissions of legal liability or fault these commanders often have minutes hours and sometimes days to make decisions and theyre not under hostile fire soldiers sailors airmen and marines in the middle of a deadly firefight however often have only a split second to make similar decisions against a determined civilian dressed enemy and the immediate consequence of making the wrong decision can mean getting yourself or someone in your unit killed it therefore is unconscionable to apply higher standards and expectations to a younger less experienced marine than to a commander in an operations center far from the battlefield this isnt to say commanders should face tighter legal standards but rather a call for the same deference for a rifleman who learns only in hindsight that he may have killed civilians in civilian law enforcement settings the u s supreme court has consistently held that cops who exercise the use of deadly force in the line of duty cant be sued still less prosecuted for their actions so long as they acted reasonably under the circumstances bad results do not mean bad decisions police officers unlike soldiers are not forced to raise an affirmative defense of self defense rather the government has the initial burden of proving that the police officers actions were unreasonable we should provide at least the same level of deference to our warriors making decisions in a combat zone that we do to cops patrolling the streets of america we should also protect our warriors from the caterwauling of those such as the washington post reporters who "broke" the haditha story and from those in the military who are more concerned about maintaining an "appearance of propriety" than in killing our determined enemies neither the law nor decency allows for the willful killing of innocent civilians there need to be however allowances for unintended and unfortunate consequences when it comes to applying the correct legal standard those judging the actions of warriors in combat should recognize the tactical realities of an engagement it may be legally and morally appropriate under certain circumstances to kill "unarmed" individuals such as those actively acting as lookouts for the emplacement of improvised explosive devices ieds or participating in the network of conspirators building such devices in a recent time magazine article a jihadist named abdallah is quoted saying "they are not going to defeat me with technology if they want to get rid of ieds they have to kill me and everyone like me " our young marines are able and willing to make that happen if only our leaders will display the moral courage to allow them to do so without fear of prosecution we have become our own worst enemy sadly it is not the law that creates these restrictions but rather an overly restrictive interpretation of it by some commanders and their lawyers hopefully the military will adopt a self defense deadly force policy akin to the fbis which reads in part that individual agents will not "be judged in the clear vision of hindsight " but rather based on how a reasonable person would act under situations that are "tense uncertain and rapidly evolving " i can think of no circumstance more tense uncertain and rapidly evolving than that faced by our soldiers sailors airmen and marines in the current counterinsurgency fight in iraq lt col bolgiano is the author of "combat self defense saving americas warriors from risk averse commanders and their lawyers" little white wolf books his views do not necessarily reflect those of the department of defense see related letter "letters to the editor embedded lawyers" wsj july see related letters "letters to the editor calculus of reasonableness in using force" wsj july
