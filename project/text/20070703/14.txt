business technology talking tech businesses embrace mash ups a "mash up" sounds like something year olds do with their dinner but its a new computer programming style that started out on the internet and is now beginning to work its way into business software applications mark lynd president of firescope inc a business software company explains some of the mash up basics q what are mash ups and why are some people excited about them a mash ups are two or more web applications or data streams blended together forming an entirely new application think of it like lego bricks click them together to form whatever your mind can imagine before mash ups developers faced months of development time and constant reinvention of the wheel now they can use web applications such as google maps flickr or digg to rapidly assemble a new application the excitement centers on the fact that they are so easy to build and dont require extensive programming experience many mash ups are created by people with no previous programming experience at all q give me an example a one is chicagocrime org which mashes up google maps and a database of crime information for the city of chicago users can search by several parameters including address police beat or specific ward within the city visitors to the site can filter what type of crime the location of a crime alley bank health club and dates the results are displayed as color coded map points on a google map q all of this sounds vaguely recreational is there also a business case a mash ups were originally born for recreational purposes but many businesses have embraced the concept to derive new business opportunities you may have one organization link their customer data with google maps to identify their geographical market penetration while another aggregates statistical data from their accounting or planning solutions into a centralized dashboard whats interesting with this model is that all of these mash ups could be created at very low cost and resources that makes features that were traditionally only affordable by large corporations available to small businesses q how is this changing the way business software companies design their products a the future of mash ups doesnt require any new technology or a radical change in architecture or thinking like in many previous technology revolutions and mash ups reduce the need for middleware something that has traditionally been a difficulty for most organizations big software vendors are beginning to offer enhanced interfaces to enable businesses to create more mash ups this is already happening in customer tracking and business intelligence software but well really see businesses get excited when industry specific applications that have traditionally been mired in vendor lockdown start opening up most likely due to client pressure and the massive exposure mash ups have gained in the past year q are there mash up tools yet a two examples are liferay an open source java portal and ibms growing library of "portlets" used in creating mash ups such as their google gadgets portlet with tools like these a business gets an easy to deploy framework that provides an excellent foundation for building mash ups this makes it very easy for organizations to bring the latest web technologies and social networking applications into their enterprise it says something about the maturity of mash ups that ibm has not only embraced it and started developing components and tools but also hosted an "enterprise mash up summit" to bring together developers and users to further the evolution of mash ups
