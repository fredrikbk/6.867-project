pyongyang pussyfooting in the musical "camelot " king arthur tells guinevere that "july and august cannot be too hot" in his domain in the state departments camelot avoiding a hot summer of bad news is also a high priority this explains its euphoric reaction to north koreas first partial moves to comply three months late with its february promise to "shut down and seal for the purpose of eventual abandonment" the yongbyon nuclear facility north korea initially insisted that illicit funds frozen in macaos banco delta asia first be returned to it when no commercial bank would launder these funds state coerced the federal reserve system into doing the dirty work while the actual amount of money involved approximately &# million was relatively small the still unknown variable is whether the state department made secret commitments to pyongyang to guarantee its access to international financial markets concern about potential side deals has haunted the february agreement since it was signed and will now do so permanently not only did north korea thereby achieve at least one key objective before any performance on its part contrary to the february deal but assistant secretary of state christopher hill recently made a pilgrimage to pyongyang where he said he was "buoyed by the sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives " undoubtedly north korea was buoyed by the visit which marked yet another administration retreat this one from the position that such a trip was impossible before performance by the north this pyongyang visit symbolizes the full return of clinton era bilateral negotiations with north korea and their predominance over the six party talks the bush administration has effectively ended where north korea policy is concerned replaced for the next months by a caretaker government of bureaucrats technocrats and academics so complete was the transformation that putative shadow secretary of state richard holbrooke facilitated a number of mr hills bilateral contacts with pyongyang kim jong il will now in all likelihood further his slow roll waiting for our elections when the clinton era may return de jure as well as de facto this is not a comment on partisan disagreements but an important signpost that bushs clear determination in to follow a different course has disappeared replaced with the same flawed conceptual framework that failed so badly in the s new failures lie ahead for example north koreas late june launches of short range ballistic missiles after mr hills trip the third instance of such launches in a month undoubtedly violate security council resolutions and the white house said it was "deeply troubled" by the launches but not troubled enough to do anything about them japans prime minister shinzo abe gave voice to what a bush administration would have done if it were still in power saying "we need to seek a harsh response from the international community " but the u s nonresponse will be the prototype for future indulgences of aggressive north korean behavior and further violations of its commitments the state department will justify each additional american bended knee by cooing "we are at a particularly delicate time" in the "process " process has prevailed over substance a true sign that presidential leadership has succumbed to bureaucratic imperatives the return of international atomic energy agency inspectors to yongbyon for the first time in five years was also greeted enthusiastically few however took note of the careful statements by senior iaea official ollie heinonen that the terms of iaea monitoring were agreed to with north korea "in principle " two words that may conceal more than they disclose in fact we may well find that yongbyon is already at or near the end of its useful life if so of course north koreas commitment to "eventual abandonment" means little even assuming that "eventual abandonment" really differs from the "freeze" of yongbyon embodied in the failed agreed framework the real key to understanding north korean behavior is that it wants the flows of outside assistance to resume especially from south koreas compliant government which already resumed fertilizer shipments in march based on nothing more than the february agreement without giving up anything substantial in return sure enough on june south korea resumed shipments of rice the first tons leaving that very day with up to tons promised for this year the south also pledged that the first shipment of tons of heavy fuel oil would be sent within two weeks north korea is already confident that it can break the state departments will and in the months ahead it is going to press for further concessions pyongyang hopes and given our conduct recently has every reason to expect that assistance will arrive whether or not it complies with other central terms of the february agreement namely the full disclosure and elimination of all other nuclear activities outside of yongbyon these include plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods at yongbyon weapons fabricated with such plutonium and the full extent of north koreas uranium enrichment route to nuclear weapons kim jong ils regime will not voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons program or submit to the kind of intrusive verification program we should insist on this is where it will truly draw the line making its intransigence over banco delta asia seem timid by comparison moreover behind the scenes pyongyang will simply continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs the latter not even mentioned in the february agreement and this is where we must insist that whatever is left of the bush administration draw its own line not if but when north korea balks at real substance we should insist not only on full compliance with existing security council sanctions but the repudiation of the february deal only then can we concentrate on the true solution the peaceful reunification of the korean peninsula and the consequent end of the north this alone will make northeast asia the "more congenial spot" we all say we want mr bolton is a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute
