face the music a personal national anthem the star spangled banner is a tough test of singers skills and interpretive abilities online edition a few weeks ago my year old son dylan and i were settling in to watch an nba playoff game on tv when we discovered a new indoor sport before the game the newest american idol jordin sparks performed "the star spangled banner " in the last few years american idols have sung the national anthem at a number of high profile sporting events after all the top finishers on the show have usually proven they can sing live under pressure at least adequately something not every pop star can claim my son asked me if i liked ms sparks singing i told him i thought it was ok he told me he liked "sesame street" better in the competitive spirit of "american idol " my son and i starting wondering who was the best at singing the national anthem joined now by my wife and year old daughter emma we went to youtube and began calling up performances we watched a number of "idol" performers take on the anthem kelly clarkson clay aiken fantasia and others follow those links to follow along with us then we branched out to non "idol" performers whitney houston mariah carey jessica simpson christina aguilera billy joel justin timberlake and going further back marvin gaye ms houstons performance before s super bowl xxv between the new york giants and the buffalo bills is the all american version the high notes are hit the way mike tyson in his prime used to hit opponents several of the artists we listened to put a more personal stamp on the song ms aguilera who has sung the anthem a number of times once offered a rendition of it accompanied only by a drummer but mr gayes performance before the nba all star game is a particular standout he turns "the star spangled banner" into a prayer a call for unity and a funky make out jam all without violating the dignity of the song or removing his sunglasses indoors years later in pop singer r kelly would strike a similar note when he ran through an r&amp b version of the anthem before the start of the bernard hopkins jermain taylor boxing match that actually had people dancing in the ring i found mr gayes version particularly appealing because his confident performance managed to make the anthem sound like a tune that belonged in his songbook ive long thought that the best interpretations of well known compositions dont have to necessarily surpass all that has gone before rather some of the best re interpretations do two things startle us with a new approach and make this fresh approach seem logical natural and even inevitable "the star spangled banner" is a great song for testing singers chops and comparing their interpretive skills its not just about coming up with a new way to sing the song of course perhaps its fitting that the anthem is often performed at sporting events because singing it can be more of an athletic feat than an artistic one memorable versions of the anthem are sometimes just a matter of a singer executing to perfection like a gymnast running through her routine without a slip its a challenging song to sing and trying to hit those high notes has often turned out to be the low point of many singers careers singers are expected to go for it if they opt for a lower note instead its like a skater doing a double axel instead of a triple and those mistakes can haunt today thanks to digital media its easier than ever to call up past performances the bad performances are often what come to mind first most people remember comedian roseanne barrs screeching much maligned rendition before a san diego padres game but in his book "the flag the poet &amp the song the story of the star spangled banner " irvin molotsky points out that jose feliciano sparked a star spangled controversy in when he sang the anthem before game of the world series in detroit between the tigers and the st louis cardinals mr felicianos version is modest clearly heartfelt and doesnt stray drastically from the basic structure of the song his take however does have a slight latin jazz sway and he accompanies himself on acoustic guitar for those used to rigid brass bands performing the anthem his rendition was a breakthrough and a shock mr feliciano has said that following his performance radio stations pulled his records and it took some time for his career to recover "we were so busy we never auditioned jose " jim campbell president of the detroit tigers told the new york times "as soon as he starting singing a real personalized hip version of the anthem our switchboard lit up and telegrams began pouring in from people who were complaining " mr campbell also points on that "there were some people who liked it " performances of the anthem have been more closely scrutinized ever since even as they have grown more daring in a group of performers including reggaeton star ivy queen haitian singer rapper wyclef jean and singer actor carlos ponce released "nuestro himno " a version of the anthem translated into spanish and shot through with the rhythms of latin pop "the star spangled banner" itself has a rich and rather strange history one that dates back to th century london and an ancient poet anacreon who lived around the sixth century b c was a poet known for verses celebrating love and wine he was born in what is now turkey and later lived in athens in the th century he was seized upon as the namesake and guiding spirit of the anacreontic society a gentlemens club that met periodically in london for its members to play music drink and exchange stories john stafford smith a society member composed what would be the groups theme song with lyrics supplied by the one time president of the society ralph tomlinson the composition was known as "the anacreontic song" it is also sometimes called "to anacreon in heaven " after its opening lyrics the lyrics were playful even somewhat bawdy paying tribute to music and celebration to anacreon in heaven where he sat in full glee a few sons of harmony sent a petition that he their inspirer and patron would be when this answer arrived from the jolly old grecian voice fiddle and flute no longer be mute ill lend you my name and inspire you to boot and besides ill instruct you like me to intwine the myrtle of venus with bacchuss vine in th century america well before sampling was invented it was common to borrow the melody of a well known song to create a new song by attaching some freshly composed lyrics "the anacreontic song" became an exceedingly popular melody in the u s and was said to have inspired more than takeoffs before many of them political in tone making fun of ambassadors government officials and the like it was the melody francis scott key thought of when he composed his most famous verse it was the last year of the war of and mr key was in enemy hands during a mission to free an american hostage he himself had been detained by the british on a ship near baltimore from there mr key watched helplessly as the british bombarded fort mchenry which guarded baltimore on september an assault meant to precede a british invasion of a decidedly nonmusical sort during the night the forts flag was visible in the light of the explosions but towards the end the night when the attack subsided the colors couldnt be seen and mr key was uncertain who had prevailed and so he waited until first light "at last it came " he would say later "a bright streak of gold mingled with crimson shot athwart the eastern sky followed by another and still another as the morning sun rose in the fullness of his glory lifting the mists of the deep crowning heaven blest land with a new victory and grandeur " the american flag was raised to the tune of "yankee doodle" itself a song appropriated from the british for american ends mr key inspired began to write what would become a new song he started to scribble out "the star spangled banner" on the back of a letter he had in his pocket singers usually only perform the first verse but the rest of the song which goes on for three more verses is harsher in tone with lyrics about blood and slaves and subjects that most folks arent all that comfortable discussing while waiting in the bleachers for the first pitch to be thrown not long after mr key wrote his famous lines his brother in law who had been second in command at fort mchenry had the poem printed up under the title "the defense of fort mchenry " an account by a descendant of mr keys claims the poem spread all around baltimore in less than an hour and all this without file sharing according to this account that day in a bar next to the holiday street theater a musician ferdinand durang "adapted the words to the old tune anacreon in heaven and mounting a chair rendered it in fine style " mr key was an unlikely co author for song about liberty first off he was only a part time poet and earned his living as a lawyer in georgetown more significantly according to mr molotskys book the author of the "star spangled banner" was a slave holder even the flag he saw raised that fateful night records suggest was likely sewn in part by a slave in mr key would come out against slavery and helped to found the american colonization society the groups goal however wasnt to build a more inclusive america it was to send slaves and free blacks back to africa in president hoover signed a bill making "the star spangled banner" the official national anthem of the united states over the objections of prohibitionists who opposed it because of the melodys roots as a british drinking song and education experts at columbia university who argued young people shouldnt be exposed to its martial theme when the nation was at peace others just hated the song the new york herald tribune said the song had "words that nobody can remember to a tune that nobody can sing " beginning in the first years of the th century "the star spangled banner" became identified with sporting events it was something to be heard at baseball games and basketball games before hockey face offs and at gold medal ceremonies the first well documented performance of it at a baseball game was during the world series between the chicago cubs and the boston red sox its doubtful many in the stands remembered the performance of the song though they likely found it hard to forget the young pitcher who won the game babe ruth camera phones digital music hour news and entertainment channels and youtube may be changing the relationship between american audiences and the anthem in the past you had to be there if someone performed a unique or outrageous version of the anthem pretty much the only people who saw it were the people who heard it live sure some performances usually the flubs made the news but most were forgotten by the ninth inning if not before youtube and the like may help return the anthem to its roots now online people can check out all the variations on "the star spangled banner" the good and the bad the daring and the regrettable these renditions can be enjoyed for what they are outside of the context of whatever sports event they were once paired with the games may be forgotten but the performances live on one of the most memorable renditions of the anthem took place not at a sports contest but at a music festival in at woodstock jimi hendrix soared through an instrumental version on his electric guitar and his take soon became a sonic symbol of s counterculture mr hendrixs version with all its feedback and distortion was revolutionary and somehow traditional it has been widely interpreted as an attack on the vietnam war but its more than that mr hendrix had served with the st airborne division stationed at fort campbell ky so his feelings about the military were like his music nuanced and complex charles r cross in his book "room full of mirrors a biography of jimi hendrix" writes "if he meant the song as an anti vietnam war screed as pundits quickly suggested he never stated this " on a talk show few weeks after woodstock mr hendrix said "im an american so i played it they used to make me sing it in school so it was a flashback " perhaps better than any other version mr hendrixs "star spangled banner" takes the listener back to the chaos and confusion of the night its words were written by a british hostage watching bombs exploding in the night sky not knowing if his countrymen had succeeded in holding the fort that might save the city of baltimore and perhaps america as well mr hendrixs artfully warped performance seems to wordlessly critique the anthems values while at the same time embodying them after all it makes perfect sense for a performer to take liberties with a song whose theme is freedom write to chris farley at christopher farley wsj com
