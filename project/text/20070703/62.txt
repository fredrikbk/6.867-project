journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources science biotechs future could reside in the home the enormous potential of biotechnology wont be realized by large corporations making new crops but by companies aiming at homes and small farms says physicist freeman dyson biotechnology will enter into individuals daily lives in the st century much in the same way that electronic devices like personal computers and digital cameras brought the advances in physics and chemistry into the homes of the late th century dr dyson says in the early computer era pioneers like john von neumann wrongly assumed computers would develop into "large centralized facilities " similarly people today generally think of genetic engineering as the exclusive domain of large corporations instead dr dyson says biotechnology will make its largest advances by becoming "small and domesticated " for centuries people have been effectively genetically engineering plants and animals through selective breeding as individuals gain access to the tools of biotechnology they will expand the diversity of pets and plants for recreational purposes even creating games that allow children to tinker with genes competing to make the prickliest cactus or scariest lizard genetically modified tropical fish with new colors already are appearing in pet stores beyond household fun dr dyson the father of information technology guru esther dyson anticipates that the domesticated form of biotechnology will allow rural communities to challenge the economic power of cities by transforming themselves into biotechnology research centers he notes that dolly the first cloned sheep came from an animal breeding center in scotland rather than silicon valley with their expertise in biotechnology rural communities might even come up with technologies for heavy industry such as developing earthworms that could wring aluminum from clay or seaweed that could extract magnesium from sea water dr dyson known for making bold predictions in many scientific fields and a favorite source for science fiction writers says biotechnology still poses many dangers he leaves it to future generations to resolve how his futuristic vision can be safely adopted the new york review of books july religion two scientists debate how to reconcile science faith whats the best way for scientists to approach religion two scientists known for criticizing religiously inspired changes to science curricula in schools tackle that question in a debate in scientific american richard dawkins author of "the god delusion " believes scientists should use their knowledge to challenge religion lawrence m krauss on the other hand urges a more "seductive" approach creatively seeking ways to show how science can enrich faith even if science cant support evidence for faith prof krauss cites carl sagans belief that science can expand on a sense of religious wonder by offering believers a better idea of the vastness of the universe basic scientific principles might be useful he says in thinking about theology he relates how in a recent talk at a catholic college he suggested that just as scientists shouldnt arbitrarily exclude data when doing research those who aim for a literal interpretation of the bible shouldnt make references to some bible passages while ignoring others messrs krauss and dawkins both say that their focus should be on correcting ignorance about science but the pair disagree about whether science and faith are fundamentally at odds in prof krausss view religious faith much like romantic love is a "fundamental component of many peoples psyches " even if it is irrational from a purely scientific perspective scientists shouldnt try to "rid the world of god" but to "cut out the most irrational and harmful aspects of religious fundamentalism " prof dawkins called this view pessimistic saying irrationality has nothing to do with love and insisting that it is possible to do away with what he considers superstition scientific american july management for these business lessons bring a pen and popcorn if business executives want to learn about problem solving and teamwork they should skip the textbooks and watch more movies four italian management consultants say the consultants have come up with a list of films they say showcase good business practices among them steven spielbergs "the terminal " in which tom hanks plays an eastern european immigrant trapped in a u s airport the story is a good illustration of how to turn diversity into an advantage the consultants say pedro almodovars "volver" shows how a self made businesswoman played by penelope cruz successfully runs a restaurant and werner herzogs "fitzcarraldo" offers a lesson in obsessive overreaching the lead character dreams of opening an opera house in the peruvian jungle but not all reading materials are off limits the consultants have published a book of their cinema
