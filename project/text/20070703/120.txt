business day sign up for the e mail here president bushs decision to commute the prison sentence of former white house aide i "scooter" libby has been condemned by democrats and cheered by many conservatives but ultimately may reflect an attitude within the administration that it has little left to lose the decision to spare mr libby a month prison term came just hours after a panel of judges ruled mr libby couldnt delay serving his sentence while he appealed his conviction for perjury and obstruction of justice in the cia leak case while praising special counsel patrick fitzgerald as "a highly qualified professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged " mr bush said he had "concluded that the prison sentence given to mr libby is excessive " the move marked the first time mr bush had decided to commute a sentence without going through a process of running requests through justice department lawyers white house officials tell the washington post the president had limited deliberations to a few close aides administration officials and people close to the president tell the paper commuting the sentence rather than issuing a pardon appears to have first been proposed publicly by william otis a former special council for mr bushs father in a piece that appeared in the washington post last month the new york times notes "scooter libby should not be pardoned but his punishment months in prison two years probation and a &# fine is excessive president bush should commute the sentence by eliminating the jail term while preserving the fine " mr otis wrote democrats were outraged by the presidents decision with senate majority leader harry reid calling the move "a disgrace " while house speaker nancy pelosi deemed it a "betrayal of trust of the american people " time notes mr fitzgerald was also critical saying in a statement that "an experienced federal judge considered extensive argument from the parties and then imposed a sentence consistent with the applicable laws it is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals " for most conservatives the case was a test of mr bushs will the n y times writes william kristol the editor of the weekly standard and an outspoken supporter of mr libbys cause tells the paper "it became an issue of character and courage i think mr bush did the right thing and i think he did something important for his presidency " but some on the right think the president didnt go far enough pointing out that mr libby still must pay a fine of &# and wont be permitted to practice law if his conviction isnt overturned on appeal the post says also many republicans had hoped mr bush could wait until his term was near an end to issue a clemency decision thereby keeping it out of the spotlight during the presidential campaign the wall street journal notes the white house appeared to calculate that any steps taken to keep mr libby out of jail would upset democrats but if he did nothing he would alienate conservative supporters the post writes a senior administration official who declined to be named tells the paper that there is "comfort" at the white house that the decision wont hurt the president politically the decision comes as mr bushs approval ratings are low and his domestic agenda appears to be faltering in congress with those circumstances offering some freedom because there is likely to be criticism regardless of what he does the n y times says funds keep marching to public markets the folks at och ziff capital management are seemingly undaunted by the growing skepticism of investors and legislators toward "a burgeoning field of alternative asset management companies that are seeking to raise capital in the public markets acquire stock to use in deals and cash out their principal " the new york times writes after och ziff yesterday filed for a &# billion ipo the filing follows moves by lawmakers to raise tax rates on private equity firms and some hedge funds and as blackstone groups shares are stuck in a slump below the price of their recent offering one observer tells bloomberg that a decision by founder daniel och and his partners to reinvest the ipo proceeds in their funds for five years could help avoid criticism about cashing out but the recent spate of hedge fund ipos "may be a market top " mark napoli who runs l a based advisory firm absolute return group tells the wall street journal "these people are enjoying significant cash flows that are unsustainable and they know that " mr napoli says

proxy war against american british and iraqi forces in an effort to support its shiite allies and to raise the cost of the u s presence in iraq the new york times says ali musa daqduq known to the american military as "hamid the mute" because he pretended he couldnt hear or speak for several weeks after his capture in march helped quds force train iraqis inside iran and had made four trips to iraq in the past year to report on training of militia cells and to organize militants on the model of hezbollah gen bergner tells the times a videotape of mr daqduq describing his activities in iraq
