a cultural conversation with werner herzog understanding the heart of men is german auteur and art house idol werner herzog going hollywood consider the evidence he lives in los angeles he was a fan of anna nicole smith and her reality tv show hes taken some notable young american filmmakers under his wing and his latest movie "rescue dawn" which opens on the fourth of july no less features "batman begins" star christian bale as a navy pilot who gets shot down in the early days of the vietnam war and later escapes from a jungle prison camp the storyline based on real events makes it sound like a saber rattling summer action movie a big budget competitor to the blockbusters opening that week such as the steven spielberg produced "transformers " in fact mr herzog has created something quieter and more visceral something recognizably his own in the film the most riveting battle scenes dont involve gunplay just the heroes thrashing against the jungle a seething green curtain that strangles their escape its a primal theme the struggles and obsessions of men reflected in the awful beauty of "wild nature " as mr herzog calls it that underpins much of the work that built his reputation born in and brought up in bavaria amid the deprivations of postwar germany he has made about films most of them through his own production company in person he has a high forehead and heavy eyelids features that make him look dour until his frequent smile brightens them he speaks softly and his hypnotic accent makes grand statements "you should not make films if you do not understand the heart of men" sound perfectly natural "rescue dawn" represents the first time mr herzog has directed a largely american cast with a script written by him in english in the past however he has mined the u s for settings and characters in for instance he released a documentary for television called "gods angry man " which centered on the evangelist gene scott and his feature "stroszek" concerned hard luck german expatriates in wisconsin regardless of the symbolic opening date of "rescue dawn" the films release was postponed at least twice mr herzog does call it "an american film " and there are strains of patriotism for viewers who want to look for them but the director sees the strongest symbolism in the character of dieter dengler as portrayed by mr bale the real dengler who died of lou gehrigs disease in was "a quintessential immigrant " says mr herzog "hes also an embodiment of everything i like about americans and thats this kind of optimism and self reliance courage loyalty he had it all in a way " born in germany dengler had a childhood epiphany when he watched from his window as an allied pilot strafed his home during world war ii he resolved to be a pilot and because germany had no air force after the war he traveled to the u s to become one during his grueling five month captivity he stayed loyal to the country that "gave him wings " its a story that mr herzog has told before using denglers own words in the documentary "little dieter needs to fly " the director says he had always envisioned it as a feature film but it took him almost a decade to secure the funding location and the stars who include steve zahn and jeremy davies as denglers prisonmates in the camp in the meantime mr herzog who works rapidly and single mindedly made the dengler documentary and nearly other films mr herzogs own path to the u s was less direct he started making movies in the s using a mm camera he stole when he was a student at the university of munich his raw impressionistic style caused him to be lumped in with new german cinema directors such as wim wenders mr herzog cemented his own place in the art house canon in the s and early s with films whose relatively small budgets were disproportionate to their epic ambitions shot in the peruvian jungle "aguirre the wrath of god" featured klaus kinski as a conquistador who goes mad hunting for el dorado today mr herzog plays down kinskis influence on the directors body of work they made only five films together kinski died in at age but they are among mr herzogs best hailed the most is "fitzcarraldo " in which kinski plays a rubber baron bent on opening an opera house in the amazonian rain forest to do so he orders a legion of indians to drag a riverboat over a mountain an act of folly that mr herzog executed for the film he describes the feat and kinskis mania in "my best fiend " a documentary he made about his fraught relationship with the actor in mr herzog moved to l a before marrying lena pisetski a russian born photographer who is a u s citizen "i cannot and will not become a citizen of a country that has capital punishment " he says of his own decision not to go beyond a green card though marriage brought him here he says living in the u s has caused him to rethink his career "ive done foreign films and this is very marginal here " he says "no matter how good or how bad my films are in the public perception its not more than the black under my nails " the success of his documentary "grizzly man" two years ago helped change that perception the film concerned a self styled protector of wild bears in alaska whose obsession proved fatal in timothy treadwell mr herzog found something "momentous " a metaphor that perfectly captured the directors long standing view of mans relationship with the natural world where treadwell saw disney characters come to life mr herzog saw arbitrary hunger and savagery he says as much in the film narrating in a flat tone that strikes an ominous balance with treadwells manic video footage from the field made in one month the film was a hit at the sundance film festival and widely praised by critics it took in more than &# million at the box office a substantial sum for an indie documentary and later aired on television making it one of the directors most commercially successful films "im here in your country for new horizons new coalitions new forms of distribution wider audiences " he says "grizzly man was one of the steps " it remains to be seen whether "rescue dawn" will have a comparable impact like his other films it was largely produced outside the studio system in this case with funding from private investors including a nightclub owner and an nba player and though mgm snapped up the movie at the toronto international film festival last fall it will get a limited release at first opening in new york los angeles and toronto before expanding to more cities on july with mr bale and his co stars "rescue dawn" comes with more star power than any recent herzog project inevitably however mr herzogs films are closely associated with his own exploits in making them in addition to his skirmishes with kinski the director once hypnotized his cast to make them appear possessed in the film "heart of glass" and did time in a cameroon prison when he was mistaken for a wanted criminal the stories have continued apace during mr herzogs u s residency such as the time he got grazed by a bullet while giving a tv interview near his home and last year he came to the aid of joaquin phoenix when the actor flipped his car over on a canyon road a very l a moment of celebrity confluence attention has already focused on the hardships the "rescue dawn" cast went through on the set in thailand the actors started the day shoot in a skeletal state for example so they could gain weight as shooting progressed during the filming mr herzog volunteered to eat maggots in solidarity with mr bale and flummoxed the cast by diverging from the script he had written himself is the director ever burdened by his own reputation and the legends that shadow him "i take them places as if they were paid stooges doppelgangers who ultimately i have the feeling protect me let them take the brunt " he says its part of mr herzogs ambivalence toward facts he prefers a more elastic version of reality one meant to illuminate what he calls "ecstatic truth " he applies the philosophy to everything from documentaries to the unwelcome intrusion of special effects on cinema but it applies to the directors persona as well he seems to enjoy upending peoples stereotypes of an important foreign director when a tangent in the conversation leads to the subject of television mr herzog seizes on "the anna nicole show" and the model turned reality tv stars recent death hes also drawn to another fallen american icon the boxer mike tyson "he has a very tender soul inside him and of course hes wrestling with demons " mr herzog says "ive met him hes such a fascinating man " mr herzog isnt just depicting such characters on film he also portrays them himself as an actor lately hes been working in front of the camera for young american filmmakers such as harmony korine and zak penn in "the grand " a coming mockumentary from mr penn about a high stakes poker competition mr herzog stars as a growling player known only as "the german " "the kind of roles that you can cast me in have their limitations " he says "whenever it comes to someone vile debased hostile and dysfunctional im good at that " mr jurgensen is an entertainment reporter for the journal
