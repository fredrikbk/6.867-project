doctors dilemma a risk in cholesterol drugs is detected but is it real data crunching hints at tie to lou gehrigs fda isnt concerned as he examined data on a computer one day last fall drug safety reviewer ralph edwards saw something that concerned him of people in his database who developed lou gehrigs disease or something similar while taking prescription medicines had been on statins the huge selling cholesterol drugs dr edwards director of the world health organizations drug monitoring center has amassed about four million reports of medical problems experienced by people taking prescription drugs his job is to sift through these so called adverse events looking for "signals" of potential side effects the number of lou gehrigs cases associated with statins struck dr edwards as high he would have expected a number in the single digits judging from how often other drugs in the database were linked to the disease still the analysis didnt prove anything dr edwards hesitated to publicize his finding wary of creating a drug scare and mindful that statins have been shown to reduce heart attacks significantly its an increasingly common dilemma nowadays sophisticated software allows health authorities to troll through huge databases looking for possible drug dangers the data mining can detect rare side effects that didnt show up in clinical trials but it can also raise false alarms and force regulators to divert time and money from more pressing dangers "people reach different judgments on when to shout and when not to shout " says robert temple medical director at the food and drug administration division that evaluates drugs "its the hardest single thing the value and danger to screaming early " the issue is likely to grow as regulators expand access to their databases the fda and other national drug regulators used to keep a tight lid on the adverse event reports they collected but now the who can freely disseminate them also since the fda has posted its quarterly data files on the internet and anyone can download them free of charge some companies have started offering software to crunch the data for side effect patterns adverse event reports are a major way to identify side effects after a drug is on the market but the data can be flawed or misleading the reports can be turned in by anyone patients doctors even plaintiffs lawyers media coverage or internet postings claiming dangers in a particular drug may lead doctors and consumers to report more problems with that drug meanwhile many problems never get reported determining causation is another issue if people taking a drug are older or more overweight than usual an adverse events database may show more links to heart attacks that wouldnt necessarily point to any problem with the drug it would just reflect the less healthy state of the people taking it clinical trials in which patients randomly receive either a drug or a placebo are usually the best way to identify side effects because any significant difference between the two groups is likely to be a result of the drug however trials are often too small or too short to identify unusual side effects and they dont necessarily reflect how patients take a drug in the real world the who a united nations body set up its collaborating center for drug monitoring in after the thalidomide scandal in which pregnant women who took the medicine for morning sickness gave birth to children with stunted limbs and other malformities now based in the swedish university town of uppsala the center pools adverse events from countries including the u s dr edwards a year old briton with a background in internal medicine and clinical pharmacology took the centers helm in his first experience with puzzling side effects came during a stint at the university of zimbabwe almost years ago there he noticed some patients with a rare skin condition and tracked down some antibiotics they were taking as the cause in the mid s dr edwardss team developed a software program to mine data with the help of artificial intelligence ph d s from a local university the software made it easier to analyze adverse events for one drug in the context of all event reports and fish out signals of problems at first dr edwards needed permission to publish from the national drug regulators on whose data he relied then at a conference in hong kong in national drug agencies including the fda loosened their grip allowing the who to publish without permission dr edwards also received the right to share his data with anyone who requested it he says he gets about new adverse event reports and pinpoints about serious signals a year usually he notifies national health authorities and goes no further only rarely does he publish his concern one such case involved babies getting withdrawal symptoms when their mothers took certain antidepressants that report appeared in in the lancet last fall dr edwards decided to see what his database could tell him about statins and lou gehrigs disease known medically as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als the progressive neurodegenerative disease is almost always fatal he had heard from an american doctor about an als like case that was seemingly related to statins dr edwards himself had a friend who developed another serious nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy after taking a statin with a few clicks dr edwards came upon the cases of als in people taking statins and his software told him the number was much higher than expected reviewing scientific literature dr edwards came up with a theory about the cases all statins carry a warning on their label about a rare disorder that causes muscle pain or weakness a long known side effect of the drugs more recently studies have linked statins to peripheral neuropathy dr edwards speculated these diseases and als might be connected since they involve some kind of neuromuscular degeneration and he thought all might be triggered by statins in unusual instances yet dr edwards also learned that pharmaceutical companies and other researchers are studying statins as potential treatments for brain or nervous system diseases such as alzheimers multiple sclerosis and even als some believe the anti inflammatory effects of statins may be useful in these diseases as dr edwards reflected on whether to publish his findings one point weighed heavily als is rare it strikes about five in people and affects some people world wide by contrast heart attacks are a leading cause of death and statins have helped millions of people reduce their heart risk dr edwards didnt want to raise unwarranted fears about drugs whose value is well documented "we were on the horns of a dilemma and it wasnt easy to resolve " dr edwards says behind the scenes at the fda officials were facing a similar dilemma ana szarfman an agency official who pioneered statistical analyses of adverse events had noticed the als statin signal in march about six months before it caught dr edwardss attention she was using the fdas database which overlaps with the whos but isnt identical the fda says that through the end of last year about one third of the als adverse event reports in its database of involved people on statins dr szarfman was known at the fda for her sleuthing into unexpected side effects such as the odd link between a parkinsons disease medicine mirapex and isolated cases of compulsive gambling she also helped confirm in that baycol a bayer ag statin later withdrawn from the market was linked to an especially high number of muscle disease cases dr szarfman took the als signal seriously and considered publishing an article about it but she held off while the fda took a closer look the agency didnt want to jump to any conclusions about a life saving class of drugs officials say unlike the who the fda has the ability to press drug companies for more information thats what it did in this case asking pfizer and other statin makers for all their clinical trial data taken together the long term statin trials involved patients the number of als cases came to spread equally between statin takers and those on placebo "the result of the analysis was very reassuring " says dr temple who takes a statin himself "i personally was relieved because i like my statins " dr temple says a close look at the fdas adverse event data suggested some reports might be unreliable slightly more than half of the adverse event reports in the fdas database about statins and als were submitted by consumers which is unusual because doctors usually account for the lions share also some of the als cases were reported soon after the patients had started taking statins raising doubts about whether the drug could have been the cause officials noted that the incidence of als in the general population hasnt risen since statins became popular the fda plans to publish an academic paper about its statistical findings soon says an agency official but based on the analysis of clinical trials it decided it didnt need to issue any caution about statins dr edwards came to a different conclusion he talked the issue over with his staff and p murali doraiswamy an expert in neurodegenerative diseases at duke university who has done research on statins and the brain dr doraiswamy agreed that the als signal was worrisome and should be investigated after months of hesitation dr edwards came across a study by greek researchers that helped make up his mind typically als leads to death within three to five years usually because the lungs fail when the neurons that send instructions to the respiratory system stop working but in some rare cases als like symptoms could be halted or even reversed the study said dr edwards decided his finding might help some patients prevent their disease from deteriorating he wrote a paper and submitted it to two prestigious journals both journals the british medical journal and the lancet rejected it he says fiona godlee the bmjs editor says she cant comment on specific papers but she calls adverse events hard to interpret "you only have a record of the people who developed problems without knowing how many people took the drug and didnt develop problems " she says the lancet declined to comment dr edwards pitched his paper to drug safety a little known journal based in new zealand which rushed it into print last month the paper acknowledges that some internet sites have been discussing an als statin link for at least a year raising the possibility of skewed reporting of adverse events but it notes that the number of events was also high earlier in the decade before the majority of the internet postings the paper calls on patients using statins to talk to their doctor about stopping if they experience severe neuromuscular symptoms pfizer which brings in nearly &# billion a year from lipitor says it too noticed the als signal last year in adverse event reports but concluded there was nothing to it after examining all its data the company says dr edwards has the right to publish what he found but signals derived from adverse events can unnecessarily alarm the public and create needless headaches for drug companies manfred hauben a pfizer medical director has long specialized in analyzing adverse events and several years ago started using sophisticated software adopted by pfizer a math junkie who jokes that he suffers from an impulse control disorder and stays awake at night studying statistics dr hauben says his enthusiasm for data mining has cooled he says with so many drugs and diseases mere coincidence will create some worrisome looking links "especially when youre looking for rare events most positive results are going to be false positives " he says also data mining presents "a lot of opportunities to retrofit an analysis to pre existing expectations " he says "two different vendors software can give two different results " dr edwards says his paper is merely intended to prompt more research into the matter not cause millions of heart patients on statins to panic and stop the drugs but he hopes it will be useful to some patients "suppose you started to get symptoms and your doctor said now you have two years to live " he says "wouldnt you want to know that theres some possibility that the disease is linked to the drug so you could stop taking the drug " dr edwards isnt persuaded by the clinical trial data collected by the fda the signal wouldnt necessarily show up there he says because als is so rare sheila odonovan a year old retired journalist who lives in delray beach fla wishes the signal had been publicized sooner ms odonovan was on lipitor when she started losing control of her right thumb in soon she was limping and slurring her words after going off the drug in april of last year she suddenly felt "brighter " her muscle cramps stopped and she was able to swallow more easily she wrote in an email but the improvement was short lived her neurologist diagnosed her with als last september and shes gone downhill since her voice is now almost gone and she needs a wheelchair to get around more evidence could be available in a year or two beatrice golomb an associate professor of medicine at the university of california san diego is analyzing case reports of people who developed als like symptoms after taking statins and researchers at stanford university are looking at patient records in northern california kept by kaiser permanente a big health maintenance organization to see whether people who developed als were more likely than control subjects to have used statins write to avery johnson at avery johnson wsj com
