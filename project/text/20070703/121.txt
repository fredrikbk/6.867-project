the summer of drugs this summer marks the th anniversary of the so called summer of love honest and intelligent people will remember it for what it really was the summer of drugs forty years ago hordes of stoned dirty stinky hippies converged on san francisco to "turn on tune in and drop out " which was the calling card of lsd proponent timothy leary turned off by the work ethic and productive american dream values of their parents hippies instead opted for a cowardly irresponsible lifestyle of random sex life destroying drugs and mostly soulless rock music that flourished in san francisco the summer of drugs climaxed with the monterey pop festival which included some truly virtuoso musical talents such as jimi hendrix and janis joplin both of whom would be dead a couple of years later due to drug abuse other musical geniuses such as jim morrison and mama cass would also be dead due to drugs within a few short years the bodies of chemical infested braindead liberal deniers continue to stack up like cordwood as a diehard musician i terribly miss these very talented people who squandered gods gifts in favor of poison and the joke of hipness i often wonder what musical peaks they could have climbed had they not gagged to death on their own vomit their choice of dope over quality of life musical talent and meaningful relationships with loved ones can only be categorized as despicably selfish i literally had to step over stoned drooling fans band mates concert promoters and staff to pursue my musical american dream throughout the s and s i flushed more dope and cocaine down backstage toilets than i care to remember in utter frustration i was even forced to punch my way through violent dopers on occasion so much for peace and love the dea should make me an honorary officer i was forced to fire band members and business associates due to mindless dangerous illegal drug use clean and sober for years i am still rocking my brains out and approaching my th concert clean and sober is the real party young people make mistakes ive made my share but none that involved placing my life or the lives of others at risk because of dope i saw first hand too many destroyed lives and wrecked families to ever want to drool and vomit on myself and call that a good time i put my heart and soul into creating the best music i possibly could and i went hunting instead my dream continues with ferocity thank you the s a generation that wanted to hold hands give peace a chance smoke dope and change the world changed it all right for the worse america is still suffering the horrible consequences of hippies who thought utopia could be found in joints and intentional disconnect a quick study of social statistics before and after the s is quite telling the rising rates of divorce high school drop outs drug use abortion sexual diseases and crime not to mention the exponential expansion of government and taxes is dramatic the "if it feels good do it" lifestyle born of the s has proved to be destructive and deadly so now years later there are actually people who want to celebrate the anniversary of the summer of drugs hippies are once again descending on ultra liberal san francisco a city that once wanted to give shopping carts to the homeless to celebrate and try to remember their dopey days of youth when so many of their musical heroes and friends long ago assumed room temperature by "partying" themselves to death nice while i salute and commend the political and cultural activism of the s that fueled the civil rights movement other than that the decade is barren of any positive cultural or social impact honest people will remember for what is truly was there is a saying that if you can remember the s you were not there i was there and remember the decade in vivid ugly detail i remember its toxic underbelly excess because i was caught in the vortex of the music revolution that was sweeping the country and because my radar was fine tuned thanks to a clean and sober lifestyle death due to drugs and the social carnage heaped upon america by hippies is nothing to celebrate that is a fools game but it is quite apparent some burned out hippies never learn mr nugent is a rock star releasing his th album "love grenade " this summer see related letters "letters to the editor oh wow man why lay a heavy trip on all the s dudes " wsj july
