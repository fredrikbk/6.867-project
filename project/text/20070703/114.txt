the daily fix serena williams perseveres in a gutty dramatic match online edition a timely rain delay a shrinking opponent and serena williamss formidable resolve and flair for the dramatic combined to yield an indelible wimbledon moment yesterday ms williams was up a set and level in the second set in her fourth round match against daniela hantuchova when she was felled by a muscle spasm in her leg after eight minutes of assessment and treatment ms williams was required to return to the court she managed to force a tiebreak while hobbling around but fell behind "the entire williams family a clan of considerable religious faith looked to the sky " filip bondy writes in the new york daily news "they were searching for rain which is never far away here and has been remarkably dramatic about its stage entrances dark darting english clouds were now the only things standing between serena and default in the stands venus looked up up come on rain she whispered her father pointed toward those clouds trying to give serena some hope " the rain did arrive as it has done consistently during this soggy grand slam given two hours of rest and medical attention ms williams returned without full mobility but with fearsome competitiveness and blew away ms hantuchova in the third and deciding set "williams movement did improve and it soon turned into a baffling mismatch " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "it wouldnt necessarily have required a killer like maria sharapova or justine henin to finish off serena steadiness would have done the trick someone merely determined to get everything in working the corners but not taking unreasonable chances hantuchova merely faded away a tiny dandelion floating in the breeze and serena revealed the strength and character of a champion " but some observers of the match saw a glimpse of the thespian in ms williamss performance "williams you can bet will receive an avalanche of credit for winning the match on one leg which she deserves " damien cox writes in the toronto star "but boy did she milk that injury for all it was worth making what truly was a gritty performance by the toughest competitor in the womens game a little lacking in class " serena williams has won five wimbledon titles two in singles three in doubles or two fewer than darlene hard ms hard now was once ranked no in the world and won seven doubles titles at wimbledon while reaching two singles finals in the los angeles times bill dwyre catches up with the mostly forgotten champ now an employee of usc "for darlene hard wimbledon time is pretty much like any other time now " mr dwyre writes "she gets in her car drives miles from her home in woodland hills and goes to work in the student publications department she answers phones and plans for next years usc yearbook el rodeo the bulk of which she designs " a fix tour of free agency and its implications new york rangers general manager glen sather signed free agents scott gomez and chris drury on sunday new york post columnist larry brooks says the signings dont suggest a return of the rangers profligate ways "those who believe that the stunning double play the rangers pulled on sunday sather to gomez to drury as pretty as any turned by tinker evers and chance signal a return to the bad old days in which the blueshirts threw bad money after bad in order to entice players to pull on the blueshirt well they couldnt be more wrong " mr brooks writes "for despite the outlay of cash the rangers did not bribe these players to come to new york the way they once bribed mercenaries such as theo fleury val kamensky and stephane quintal to pull on the blue&# hirt drury and gomez will wear the sweater er rbk uniform system because as badly as the rangers wanted them the feeling was mutual " but buffalo news columnist bucky gleason says the hometown sabres could have re signed mr drury despite his boyhood love of the rangers if the club had simply sent along a contract it had promised "drury agreed to a four year deal worth &# million last september " mr gleason writes "he waited and waited and waited for the sabres to send the contract to his agent so he could sign the bottom line days passed without hearing from the sabres then it was weeks still nothing finally he started having second thoughts " the nbas free agent signing period begins next week but si coms marty burns says there isnt much fuel on the hot stove league the nets retained vince carter and chauncey billups is expected to return to the pistons rashard lewiss reported move from seattle to orlando is about as much excitement as fans can expect one reason for the caution "so many teams have been burned in recent years " mr burns writes "other than shaquille oneal in and nash very few big money free agents have paid obvious dividends for their clubs " among the ways free agency has reshaped baseball it has paved the way for oddly friendly reunion scenes between players and their former clubs turned opponents "throughout the free agency era baseballs fraternization rules have become more limber than an olympic gymnast " gwen knapp writes in the san francisco chronicle "an expatriate pulls into his old hometown and feels a certain obligation to say hello to his former mates he might stop into the clubhouse or with a nod to decorum wait until both teams intersect during batting practice then sidle up to the enemy camp at the batting cage for some handshakes and a few of those minimalist manly hugs all arms and back slapping no real body contact on monday afternoon when frank thomas came back to oakland he and the as didnt bend the rule they folded spindled shredded and mutilated it " mr thomas in town with his new teammates the toronto blue jays was greeted so warmly by his former teammates because of his major impact in his single season in the bay area ms knapp says it compares with deion sanderss single season with the san francisco ers when he helped the club win the super bowl alfonso soriano was about as good with the washington nationals last season and also left good friends behind friends he visited when his chicago cubs played the nats last night "when soriano left town the nats cut payroll for years to come dollars they may someday spend for free agents " thomas boswell writes in the washington post "but without fonzie the thrill is gone except when he comes back a trail of cheerfulness behind him three hours before the game soriano was in the nats locker room seeking out old friends to tease or embrace " free agency tears players away from teammates and fans who have grown fond of them so in a way do drafts few pro stars get to stay close to the college where they excelled a fledging pro football league aims to change that the all american football league will require all its players to have a college degree and aims "to harness already existing support for football in college towns and fill much of each roster with players who played at the host school or are otherwise familiar to the fan base i e they grew up in the region or played in the same conference " sam borden writes in the florida times union "if the league had been around seven years ago maybe danny wuerffel could have played in front of gators crowds instead of going to the world league if chris leak isnt able to crack the chicago bears roster this fall maybe hell showcase his skills in a more familiar setting " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
