plan a regional system and his offer to build a new radar installation in southern russia as part of such a joint effort wrapping up an overnight visit to the bush family compound in kennebunkport maine as our washington post colleagues report mr putin went far beyond the idea he first floated during a summit in germany last month when he suggested using an aging soviet era radar in azerbaijan as an alternative to a new u s facility in the czech republic u s officials have said the old russian run facility is too antiquated to allow them to target incoming missiles mr putin says that if the azerbaijan facility is inadequate russia will build an entirely new one on its soil he also proposes bringing in nato to make the system a european antimissile shield and advocates setting up joint missile launch early warning centers in moscow and brussels "there would be no need to place any new facilities in europe " he said with mr bush at his side adding that such a move "would raise to an entirely new level cooperation between russia and the united states " while mr bush says he is "in strong agreement" with mr putins concept he made clear he isnt willing to give up plans to install new systems in poland and the czech republic "i think its very sincere i think its innovative i think its strategic " he says of mr putins proposal "but as i told vladimir i think czech republic and
