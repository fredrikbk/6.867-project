health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q regarding higher carbon dioxide levels and poison ivy all plant life thrives on co has anyone conducted tests on beneficial plants like crops c s a many readers wrote to me with the same question if poison ivy thrives under higher ambient carbon dioxide levels wouldnt all plants thrive early studies suggest that all plant life doesnt respond the same way to higher co levels to understand the research it helps to have a short lesson in photosynthesis which is the process by which green plants make carbohydrates using water carbon dioxide and sunlight and simultaneously release oxygen trees produce a far greater volume of oxygen than weeds and vines studies at duke looked at the growth of young trees and poison ivy under high co conditions as it turned out the higher co had far less impact on the trees than the poison ivy according to researchers the trees use additional carbon compounds to make woody support tissue like trunks and branches that dont photosynthesize however vines like poison ivy dont have to make woody tissue they just use all the co to photosynthesize more leaf growth which is why they grew at a much faster rate higher ambient co levels also should in theory improve growth of beneficial plants like food crops the problem is that weeds that compete with crops do even better under high co conditions every crop plant has eight to weeds competing with it so in the end while the higher co should help crops the weeds end up getting a bigger boost says lewis ziska a plant physiologist for the u s department of agriculture in beltsville md one solution is to spray weeds with herbicides but other studies show that herbicides dont work as well in a higher co environment email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
