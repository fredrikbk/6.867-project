bush and libby president bushs commutation late yesterday afternoon of the prison sentence of i lewis "scooter" libby will at least spare his former aide from two and a half years in prison but by failing to issue a full pardon mr bush is evading responsibility for the role his administration played in letting the plame affair build into fiasco and ultimately this personal tragedy mr libby will have to pay a fine of &# and serve two years probation this reflects the leniency that was previously recommended by the federal probation office but was rejected by judge reggie walton in his vindictive sentence these columns have had cause to defend the bush presidency from what weve seen as often meritless or exaggerated partisan attacks notably over national security and the iraq war this however will stand as a dark moment in this administrations history joe wilsons original false accusation about pre war intelligence metastasized into the issue of who "outed" his wife valerie plame as an intelligence officer as the event unfolded it fell to mr libby to defend the administration against mr wilsons original charge with little public assistance or support from the likes of condoleezza rice colin powell or stephen hadley in no small part because of these profiles in non courage it was mr libby who found himself caught up in prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds hunt for the plame leaker which he and his masters at justice knew from day one to be state department official richard armitage as mr fitzgeralds obsessive exercise ground forward mr libby got caught in a perjury net that we continue to believe trapped an innocent man who lost track of what he said when he said it and to whom mr bushs commutation statement yesterday is another profile in non courage he describes the case for and against the libby sentence with an antiseptic neutrality that would lead one to conclude that somehow the whole event was merely the result of mr libby gone bad as a solo operator here is how mr bush addressed it in his statement yesterday which may now stand as historys take away from the libby trial "my decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for mr libby the reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged his wife and young children have also suffered immensely the consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer public servant and private citizen will be long lasting " mr libby deserved better from the president whose policies he tried to defend when others were running for cover the consequences for the reputation of his administration will also be long lasting see related letter "letters to the editor libby has a chance to clear his name" wsj july
