highly challenged " says peter nesvold an auto analyst with bear stearns &amp co several weeks ago mr nesvold upgraded his rating on gm to the equivalent of a "buy " based on the stocks short term potential in light of recent signs the uaw may accept significant cost cuts a key signal came earlier this year when another major union the united steelworkers agreed to let goodyear tire &amp rubber
