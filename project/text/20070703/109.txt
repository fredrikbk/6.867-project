second thoughts some in silicon valley begin to sour on india a few bring jobs back as pay of top engineers in bangalore skyrockets silicon valley has helped power indias outsourcing boom by shifting technology jobs to that country three months ago munjal shah reversed a bit of that shift mr shah who leads a california start up called riya inc had opened an office in indias technology capital of bangalore in hiring about skilled software developers the lure was the wage level just a quarter of what experienced silicon valley computer engineers make then indian salaries soared last year mr shah paid his engineers in india about half of silicon valley levels by early this year it was "taking into account the time difference with india " he says "we werent saving any money by being there anymore " in april mr shah shut down the bangalore office and offered half of its engineers a chance to move to san mateo calif with work visas across silicon valley some technology companies particularly start up and midsize ones are beginning to turn away from india for low cost labor to do sophisticated tech work kana software inc of menlo park calif eliminated software development jobs in india in late and expanded its u s hiring instead teneros inc shut down a member india office and brought of the people to its headquarters in mountain view calif some tech start ups are choosing other low wage foreign locales such as romania and poland overall indias tech and outsourced services industries continue to boom the industries revenues rose by almost a third to &# billion in the fiscal year ended in march says the countrys national association of software and service companies or nasscom u s tech companies continue to shift basic work like software coding to india where big outsourcing companies such as infosys technologies ltd and wipro ltd hire tens of thousands of new indian employees each year silicon valley giants cisco systems inc google inc and adobe systems inc are expanding their staffs in india they often have other reasons besides pay to be there such as to be closer to customers but even some of the large tech companies are reconsidering india apple inc shelved plans to build a technical support center in india last year a spokesman declined to say why intel corp is stepping up hiring in vietnam which has cheaper labor than india and says it isnt significantly adding to its bangalore staff of about "the wage inflation rate for engineers in india is four times what it is here" in america says intels chief executive paul otellini its a new twist on the globalization debate around the centurys turn when u s companies first began flooding to india for its cheap labor pundits warned that the subcontinent could increasingly rob the u s of high end white collar jobs debate was especially sharp in silicon valley then in a slump because india annually turns out nearly engineering graduates several years on the forces of globalization are starting to even things out between the u s and india in sophisticated technology work as more u s tech companies poured in they soaked up the pool of high end engineers qualified to work at global companies belying the notion of an unlimited supply of top indian engineering talent in a study mckinsey &amp co estimated that just a quarter of indias computer engineers had the language proficiency cultural fit and practical skills to work at multinational companies the result is increasing competition for the most skilled indian computer engineers and a narrowing u s india gap in their compensation indias software and service association puts wage inflation in its industry at to a year some tech executives say its closer to in the u s wage inflation in the software sector is under according to moodys economy com rafiq dossani a scholar at stanford universitys asia pacific research center who recently studied the indian market found that while most indian technology workers wages remain low an average &# a year for a new engineer with little experience the experienced engineers silicon valley companies covet can now cost &# to &# a year "for the top level talent theres an equalization " he says that means that for a large swath of silicon valley start ups and midsize companies that do sophisticated tech work india is no longer the premier outsourcing destination while such companies make up just a fraction of indias outsourcing work they had been an early catalyst for the growth of indias information technology business and helped the country attract other outsourcing clients their rethinking of india raises red flags for the country indias tech industry has been a powerhouse for the economy alongside almost million indians directly employed the industry supports a further six million jobs or so according to nasscom the trade group against a backdrop of rising wages and international competition its important for indias economy that its tech giants expand into higher margin business in order to sustain their growth rates and gain market share large indian outsourcing companies are trying to expand into higher margin programming and design work rather than just basic call center outsourcing and tech maintenance which now may be done more cheaply in countries such as the philippines and vietnam wipros main tech arm wipro technologies now does consulting for its clients and can take over a clients entire it system work that was previously the preserve of companies like international business machines corp tata groups tata consultancy services ltd is helping italys scuderia ferrari design traction control systems and create software to improve the performance of its formula one cars yet while indias tech sector has come a long way from basic services such as software coding and tech maintenance and support the majority of its business still derives from that type of work at wipro technologies of revenue comes from basic services at indias other large tech companies such as infosys and tcs to of revenue still comes from such tasks analysts say some indian outsourcing companies are themselves looking to other countries mostly as a response to the globalizing nature of their business but also to tap new labor pools amid a tight hiring situation at home tcs recently opened a center in mexico and is planning to move into morocco wipro has two centers in china and is thinking about adding one in the philippines for mr shah years old opening a bangalore office for riya was a natural move an indian native who came to the u s at age he had led another tech start up in that had engineering and customer service operations in bangalore "it was dirt cheap " he says "it completely worked for us " riya is a "visual search" company building technology to search through images and identify faces or other features the company has launched an online photo site and a visual search engine called like com and will change its name to that later this month mr shah opened a bangalore office in early to help find the engineers he needed it was a challenge riya which remains closely held was unknown in india while global tech giants were staffing up there and competing for talent cisco for instance is building a million square foot bangalore campus that will hold workers u s venture capitalists have flooded in as well looking to fund engineers who want to turn entrepreneur mr shah spoke to the local bangalore news media to try to get the company name out his vice president of engineering azhar khan held recruiting sessions where he asked candidates to take a technical test to weed out unsuitable applicants to hire riyas first six engineers mr khan says he had to interview to people riya approached navneet dalal who was about to graduate with a doctorate from a computer science research institute in france inria rhone alpes mr dalal says he was also talking with google and microsoft corp about jobs riya felt it had to move fast after interviewing with google in mountain view early last year mr dalal met a riya executive at a coffee shop riya quickly offered him a lucrative package for a job in india "the initial incentive was good enough for me not to think about google in terms of stock and salary " says mr dalal now who declines to disclose his pay someone with his experience and qualifications typically earns around &# in india mr dalal joined riya as a computer vision researcher in bangalore in may within a year he says he got a better stock options deal and a raise increases like that have spurred a lot of job hopping in india pervasive software inc of austin texas opened a bangalore unit in and hired people but soon its turnover was more than a year says the companys ceo john farr the company kept having to invest in training workers only to see them leave a year ago it shut its bangalore unit hidden outsourcing costs surfaced for other tech companies as well to bridge the geographic and time gaps some have found they need to hire more u s managers to handle their indian teams kana software in menlo park has one engineering manager for every to engineers but it found it needed one for every five to engineers it employed in the indian city of chennai in december kana decided to close its indian operation mr khan riyas california based vice president of engineering says he often stayed up until a m so he could talk with the team in bangalore mr shah the chief executive flew to india six times a year to make sure things were running smoothly straddling time zones slowed development work sometimes a researcher gets stuck on a problem "its not really a good thing to keep bugging people at midnight every day so that introduces some delays " says mr dalal he also felt cut off "for us sitting here in india its hard to get the business aspect of the problem " he says mr shah commissioned a yearly survey of salary trends among top computer engineers in bangalore they showed wages jumping a year to keep people "we needed to match the increases " in january riya gave its bangalore crew raises of to each but it was also having trouble filling open job slots "i realized price expectations were too high " mr khan says "i thought "wait why are we paying a junior guy &# or &# over there when i can get a guy in california for &# " in april he and mr shah decided to shutter the bangalore operation and bring key staffers to the u s after getting board approval they flew to bangalore and assembled the engineers to break the news "they were all upset " says sowmya karnad riyas human resources director in bangalore but given the soaring wages it didnt come as a surprise messrs shah and khan offered engineers a chance to move to riyas u s office eight including mr dalal accepted those who stayed behind have few job worries sandeep gain a year old lead engineer for riya declined a u s transfer partly to stay close to his family but also because he likes his opportunities in india he says he has received two offers from a large u s conglomerate and from a nasdaq listed company both involve pay increases shutting down in india isnt cheap teneros which closed a person operation in new delhi in late says it spent &# million to do so it had to get out of contracts and it brought of its indian workers over to the u s on work visas incurring immigration fees teneros left partly because of wage inflation and a lack of information technology infrastructure that was slowing its work says its ceo steve lewis mr shah says riyas shutdown costs such as immigration charges and a broken lease will be in six figures he has cleared eight desks in san mateo for the eight indian engineers coming over and is waiting for their paperwork to clear hoping theyll be in silicon valley by the end of the year "i thought i understood india " mr shah says "but now i know its so much more effort to have a remote office as a start up " don clark and vibhuti agarwal contributed to this article
