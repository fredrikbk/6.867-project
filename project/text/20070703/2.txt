a not so crash course an auto touring track offers the fast and the timorous a safer way to race hot cars mitchell friedman drives a german made audi s designed to go miles per hour or more for long stretches but the year old new jersey businessman has never come close to pushing the needle that far although hes fascinated with fast cars mr friedman confesses to being "a bit scared besides ive got two young children and my wife wont let me drive fast " he and other u s drivers fearful that their cars capabilities exceed their own have another option on the horizon touring a deceptively sedate name for a pastime that strives to preserve the pulse pounding speed of competitive racing but eliminate its spectacular smash ups originated in europe the concept is being introduced in the u s with one of the first touring tracks under construction in monticello n y at an expected cost of &# million its scheduled to open next year tourers typically drive fast on wide specially paved private racetracks with plenty of room for error an instructor usually sits in the passenger seat telling drivers how fast or slow to go as they negotiate straightaways the quick succession of left right turns in chicanes and the abrupt change of direction in hairpins cars on the course stay out of sight of each other often up to a half mile apart passing isnt allowed speeds can reach up to mph instructor permitting "touring is a safe way to get to know your car without it ending up in a garage or you in hospital " says mark hales a british racer and auto journalist whos been hired to teach at the monticello track michael kaplan a former mergers and acquisitions attorney who is leading the investor group behind the drive &amp race club says he wasnt interested in building a track where amateurs can race each other theres already about three dozen of those the track is not for someone "looking to be next to some crazy kid whos trying to beat him " he says but for "someone who wants to be with guys with fast cars who are just as scared as he is " nestled in the catskill mountains foothills about miles northwest of new york city the facility is being built at a time when well heeled baby boomers have been buying expensive high performance automobiles capable of race car speeds their appetite is stoked by advances in aerodynamics fuel injection systems and carbon fiber bodies that have made possible lightweight cars that can exceed mph "if you drive through any number of upscale neighborhoods with a keen eye youll see all these shiny new cars just sitting in garages " mr kaplan says in the new york area where bankers and brokers have been enriched by a bullish stock market the demand is so great that the wait for a lamborghini can be about a year and about two years for a ferrari several local dealers say the initiation fee at the monticello track will be up to &# with annual dues of up to &# depending on how often members will use the track mr kaplan says membership will be limited to and he has signed up about with a goal of reaching by the time of the facilitys opening next spring james glickenhaus a new york money manager and former movie producer is an early joiner one of his ferraris is a &# million sports coupe custom made by famed coach builder pininfarina spa that can reach mph which he has driven on touring tracks in spain germany and italy "when i drive it i do it very carefully and cant afford to be around other people " mr glickenhaus says after sifting through motor vehicle records mr kaplan says he found that the northeast especially new york new jersey connecticut pennsylvania and massachusetts had the highest concentration of fast car owners in the nation experts say that car owners in other metro areas los angeles chicago san francisco and phoenix have expressed interest in touring tracks several are on the drawing board including ones in pennsylvania and new hampshire "if these tracks can be built with an element of safety to them " says elliot johnston a california based racing instructor "i can see these types of clubs really taking off " building a high speed course for amateurs especially for drivers protective of their expensive sports cars isnt an easy task to construct the monticello course mr kaplan has turned to former racers and engineers at rutgers university and the massachusetts institute of technology factors to be considered the gravitational forces on the driver that can equal those on a fighter jet pilot and the difficulty of stopping at high speeds "when youre going at mph and you put the brakes on it feels like you have no brakes at all " says brian redman a year old former british racing champion and a monticello consultant at about miles the monticello track will be one of the longest in the sport straightaways are twice the width of a u s highway lane around corners they will be triple the normal width special "high friction" surfaces will be installed on the bends and other tricky spots to keep the stray porsche from skittering off the track the outer fringes will be laid with two types of surfaces coarse asphalt for greater tire grip and a rubber composite for bringing the car to a faster stop the course meanders through acres of rolling hills at its straightest point it stretches for about a mile great for high speeds the rest of the course is broken up by hairpin turns corkscrews and bends the club has hired an mit researcher to set up cameras on the track in cars and at the clubhouse to film members as they wind their way around the course analyses of the footage can help drivers improve their performance mits agelab views the club as a rare opportunity to study the reflexes of aging baby boomers behind the wheel
