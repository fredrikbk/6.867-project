the healthy americans act sounds good perhaps too good sens ron wyden and bob bennett are correct in asserting that the healthy americans act "could defy the odds and go where every president and every congress has tried to go since a rational system that guarantees good quality and affordable health care to all americans" "fixing health care " editorial page june but the assumption that this first became a major political issue in the mid s is amiss as do most people the senators likely mark because president harry s trumans special address to congress on nov of that year marked the first time a sitting president publicly endorsed a national health care program but the question of whether or to what extent it is the responsibility of government to subsidize health care for its citizens has been around for a much longer amount of time while thomas paine had earlier written about it the subject first substantively appeared on political agendas in when president franklin pierce vetoed a national mental health bill on the basis that it would be unconstitutional to regard health as anything but a private matter in which government should not become involved at the time most americans agreed this trend largely continued for the next several decades and only began to turn as the u s became more industrialized and urbanized it was not really until the early th century that conservatives and liberals developed the staunch appeals for limited government oversight of health care and for some form of government funded health insurance respectively that we experience today the major bills to provide "better" health care seem to evade one big question does this fortify the most fundamental part of health care delivery the doctor patient relationship lee h igel ph d assistant professor new york university school of continuing and professional studies new york the healthy americans act sounds too good to be true i have just one question absent "government mandates " exactly how will this legislation provide my wife and me both cancer patients with affordable insurance that does not contain "pre existing conditions" restrictions if the good senators believe this will happen i have some securities backed by sub prime mortgages i would like to sell them kenneth susinka elmhurst ill the senators provide a pollyanna approach to health care reform they are correct in identifying cost and access as the two most fundamental issues facing individual purchasers of health care as regards cost their proposal will slow the increase in costs per year that is from on average to this they claim is the great benefit of competition the dirty little secret in the industry is that there is no incentive for providers or payers to lower costs cost shifting will be reduced but not eliminated so long as seniors have medicare and its significant provider discounts and legislatively eliminating pre existing condition limitations on all health plans is as simple an approach you can have to the problem of access i suggest our representatives tackle universal dental care first work out the kinks and then go after medical care parker lyons solana beach calif sens wyden and bennetts plan "a universal market driven health care system that all americans can afford" demonstrates a colossal disconnect from reality any universal health care plan equal to the quality that members of congress get is unaffordable and thus unattainable for those of us in the real world universal health care will only become an extension of the existing socialized government programs of medicare medicaid champus tricare and chip that are highly regulated and price controlled but definitely not market driven anthony r palmer m d durango colo the plan by sens wyden and bennett is a rational step forward but there are weaknesses that must be addressed i have been to many meetings of doctors but never one where there was agreement about what constitutes a "basic" health plan a definition will be required the original definition may have to be a directive with the understanding it can be modified but the rules for changing the definition should be provided at the same time as the fix im not sure why medicare or military patients should be excluded from the planning medicare and military medical health care should be made to conform to the same "basic" health plan so that those patients also "receive the same level of care available to members of congress " breaking the link between employment and health care is a marvelous step that was suggested years ago by milton friedman why should companies get a deduction for buying health insurance health insurance should be a deduction for the person just like paying taxes on a home i dont see any mention of catastrophic illness costs shouldnt there be an umbrella rider for such an event shouldnt it also be a tax deduction a premature infant or debilitating accident would seem to be outside a "basic" plan and financially devastating to a family along with everything else as you see the definition of "basic" is not basic or simple from my perspective the happiness in life liberty and pursuit of happiness is closely aligned with good health and a key factor in american life william v delaney jr m d fayetteville n y
