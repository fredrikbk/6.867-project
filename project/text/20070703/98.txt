politics &amp economics terror attacks resemble plot u k officials study possible link to rhyme figures as arrests grow the widening investigation into the united kingdom car bomb plot is providing a clearer picture of a multiethnic terrorist cell whose members may overlap with a group that law enforcement had previously identified and that had plans to target buildings in the u s and u k according to people familiar with the situation police moved quickly arresting two men from residences at the royal alexandra hospital in paisley scotland where one of the men who attempted to drive a jeep into a terminal at glasgows airport saturday is being treated for burns they said they arrested another late yesterday bringing the total arrests to eight since the attempted car bomb attacks in central london on friday and at glasgows airport saturday the area of scotland and men in the medical profession are key focuses of the investigation law enforcement officials are examining a possible link to a british terrorist investigation known as "operation rhyme " that probe led to the arrest and conviction of dhiren barot an al qaeda leader who plotted to blow up buildings in new york and london using limousines packed with explosive materials seven other people were also convicted as a result of the probe there is now the possibility that nearly a dozen other people who were peripherally involved with the group in operation rhyme but werent charged because they didnt appear to be threats at the time are somehow linked with the suspects in the recent u k attacks law enforcement officials said "theres no question that there are some similarities between the plot that was disclosed a few years ago and what weve seen in the last couple of days " u s homeland security secretary michael chertoff said in a television interview "now whether that shows common planning or whether it merely shows that somebody saw what barot had planned to do and then adopted it on their own remains to be seen " suspects in the recent u k attacks are from a range of ethnic backgrounds those arrested include two doctors who have been licensed to practice in the u k since and the doctors are mohammed asha and bilal abdulla according to a person familiar with the probe dr asha holds a medical degree from jordan and first registered as a doctor to practice in the u k in dr
