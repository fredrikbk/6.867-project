hottest franklin templeton fund is founding funds allocation fund a fund of funds that invests in the income mutual shares and templeton growth funds it has hauled in &# billion this year in this occasional column we take a look at some of the most popular mutual funds the &# billion income fund which carries a maximum front end load fee isnt nearly as staid as the name might suggest for the months through june the year old fund is at the top of morningstar inc s "conservative allocation" category of stock and bond funds up it has been in the top for the past decade up a year on average the fund also sports a relatively high yield at about a selling point for investors who want income distributions "with a large set of baby boomers set to retire in the coming years we expect the funds popularity to increase as brokers and financial planners tout these statistics to retirees " says morningstar which rates the fund at its highest level of five stars mostly because of its outstanding performance but it notes that while stats matter "investors shouldnt overlook the funds offbeat profile " while allocation funds generally hold blue chip stocks and high quality bonds franklin income casts a wider net "investors need to know whats driving these returns and what the risks are " morningstar analyst andrew gogerty says about a fifth of the fund is in the historically high yielding utilities sector he says so if that group were to fall out of favor the fund might be hit hard also about of the funds bond holdings are high yield or junk compared with about a fifth at peer funds from time to time some of the debt comes from emerging markets ed perks the funds co manager says he isnt making a bet on the junk bond market or specific stock market sectors but instead uses research to find individual securities that seem cheap and have a good chance of outperforming the market while providing a healthy yield "we look for investment opportunities that are going to help us meet the investment objective over time " says mr perks years old and a year veteran of franklin resources inc "the asset allocation is going to take care of itself " asked if the fund is too risky for some he responds "we cant be everything to everyone " adding that "were very transparent about where were finding opportunities " jeff fishman president of financial advisory firm jsf financial llc and a representative with broker dealer cantella &amp co has been investing his clients money in the fund for nearly a decade he says that investors should be prepared to put up with some volatility but he says the funds stable management has helped deliver strong long term results "when you look at years like when the market fell the fund didnt really fall much " he says in for instance it declined a modest beating of its peers according to morningstar once convinced of an opportunity mr perks is willing to take a large position the fund is relatively concentrated with about different common stocks convertible securities and about bond issuers currently the breakdown is about stocks including preferred stocks and debt largely in line with the average balanced fund the remainder is in cash the fund can hold up to in foreign securities which isnt unusual for the category one example of the funds willingness to act on its convictions was in when investors were reeling from the meltdown of technology stocks and generally steering clear of risky investments in june the fund had about of its portfolio in high quality mortgage backed securities but mr perks who had taken over as co manager working with franklin resources chairman charles johnson became convinced that junk bonds yielding about percentage points or so more than benchmark treasurys were a better deal so he reduced the mortgage bonds to about of the portfolio by september and bought junk bonds and some other corporate bonds and stocks the junk bond market started rallying in the fund finished in the top of the category with a total return of percentage points ahead of the peer average according to morningstar while junk bonds as a group have continued to perform well the difference between their yields and treasurys is down to about percentage points mr perks doesnt think the broad junk bond market is cheap but his team is still finding some opportunities including in bonds issued as companies pay for acquisitions or make leveraged buyouts mr perks will seek more than one way to play a favored company and finding the ideal combination can be tricky in mr perks was holding general motors corp stock and bonds when gms bonds were downgraded to junk status and some industry analysts questioned if the car maker would survive while mr perks didnt anticipate a bankruptcy court filing he wasnt sure gm would continue to pay healthy dividends so he sold gm shares at an average price of &# and bought various gm and gmac llc bonds by the end of gms stock had fallen to about &# and in early gm announced it would cut its dividend in half the stock is now about &# mr perks says the fund would have made more money had he bought gm stock at the bottom as the shares appreciated more than the bonds but he felt the bonds were "more appropriate for our risk profile and strategy " franklin income returned in dropping to the th percentile among peers hurt by both declining junk bonds and utility holdings but it was at the top of the pack in its return aided by the gmac bonds for now mr perks is buying short and medium term corporate bonds as well as some high quality bonds tied to mortgages with recent increases in long term interest rates the "broader fixed income market is compelling again " he says
