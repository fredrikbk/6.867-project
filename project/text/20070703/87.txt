order without law now pervades gaza under hamas rule as families crowd beaches some say calm wont last prisoners clamor for judges gaza city gaza strip since it seized control of gaza two weeks ago the militant group hamas has been confronted by many problems that it is powerless to resolve from paying government workers to assuring that theres enough food and medicine for the million largely impoverished palestinians living here so the islamist group is concentrating on what it figures it can deliver personal security and calm its something thats been sorely lacking in gaza partly because of the months of factional warfare between hamas and its rival the u s backed security forces loyal to palestinian president mahmoud abbas and his fatah movement that ended when hamas fighters conquered gaza june now across gaza order is clearly returning a welcome development for locals who witnessed wave upon wave of violence masked gunmen who recently terrorized school buses loaded with children have all but vanished tobacco smoke from water pipes again mixes with the sweet smell of sea air as families crowd the beaches even after midnight pedestrians cars and donkey carts choke streets that were the scene of chaos and bloodshed for more than a year before mr abbas lost gaza but it is an order delivered by the force of arms and law is still missing thats something even some hamas officials are growing concerned about gazans are grateful for this peace but many remain uneasy over what could come next "i have a feeling its going to be even worse than before and its not just me everyone has this feeling " says ramadan malaha a tanned year old in a white nike t shirt who rents water pipes and sells food to beachgoers from his sunset cafe still mr malaha acknowledges hes breathing easier for now "you dont see guns on the beach anymore " gazas new quiet along with many of its lingering questions is being delivered by hamass so called executive force a man civil army clad in blue urban camouflage and wielding kalashnikov style assault rifles hamas men now rule gazas streets from the backs of bright blue palestinian authority pickups hamas first deployed the executive force in gaza as a parallel security service after winning democratic elections in january last year even though his fatah movement founded by yasser arafat lost the balloting mr abbas had refused to cooperate with the islamists anarchy resulted as most of mr abbass security forces refused to report for duty under hamas some of those who did work clashed violently with the new executive force the bush administration and europeans both of which backed the elections but then boycotted hamas when it won supported mr abbass efforts to shun hamas hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the u s and europe senior u s officials including secretary of state condoleezza rice repeatedly called for "one authority and one gun" under mr abbass control but that strategy collapsed in june tensions between the two sides mounted until hamas seized control in its bloody sweep across the square mile territory "theres only one force securing the people here now " says abu hammam the hamas nom de guerre of a leading executive force commander a global boycott of hamas remains meaning that the islamists have little to offer the people of gaza beyond their security crackdown so theyre moving forward with haste "our theory " says mr hammam a bearish man with a bushy beard and blue eyes "is that when criminals get away with their crimes they repeat them so were sending the message you wont get away with it " on gazas streets his edict translates into near constant displays of overwhelming force disputes between powerful gaza families used to end with ambulances loaded with casualties now theyre ending with both sides handing over their guns to hamas many executive force commanders are fond of repeating one story only days after hamas took over they say two powerful families in khan yunis which is in the southern part of the coastal strip began squaring off but when two dozen executive force men arrived on the scene the clans were afraid to unleash the barrage of gunfire that usually accompanies their street fights says mr hammam he says they resorted to attacking each other "with just sticks and stones " where gun violence has been rampant that is held up as progress yet troubles run deep with one powerful clan the dogmush which allegedly kidnapped alan johnston the bbc journalist in march several hamas commanders said they were holding back an assault only to spare mr johnstons life but hamas and the clan engaged in gun battles and tit for tat kidnappings this past weekend according to press reports in gaza city executive force teams are dispatched from a narrow room with four cellphones two landlines and two radios an oscillating fan at the foot of a twin bed pushed into the corner circulates overheated air the dispatchers work in threes for hour shifts two men stay awake to answer phones and radio out for help while a third sleeps the most pressing calls are to take out drug dealers who are top public enemies for the islamist executive force but even tiny infractions meet with a strong response all public gunfire is now forbidden even the once common celebratory shots peeled off at beachside weddings land grooms behind bars also gone hamas commanders say is special treatment for the well connected a hallmark of fatah rule "i put two of my own cousins in jail " says abu subhi the executive forces year old deputy commander for operations in gaza city there is also a new openness because hamas is eager to show the world it will rule with transparency journalists and others are free to wander the streets and corridors of buildings within the walled off sariya a sprawling security compound that takes up an entire block in gaza city the sariyas streets are lined with russian made flat bed trucks for ferrying troops and even armored personnel carriers all seized from fatah a brightly painted blue peugeot station wagon still displays a bumper sticker that reads "spanish support for the palestinian civil police " says mr hammam the executive force commander "we dont have any shortages of anything now " but nowhere are the mixed results of the hamas crackdown clearer than inside gaza citys central prison which is at the edge of the sariya past the prisons gallows and up the stairs in a dank cell lined with iron bunks inmate adel rashwan says hamas is bringing order even behind bars when a guard recently tried to beat some inmates the new executive force commander of the prison intervened dragging the sentinel away by force then firing him on the spot says a grateful mr rashwan but the wiry year old inmate with the shaved head says he and three other men were beaten when they were arrested by the newly empowered executive force at his home in the southern gaza strip just after hamas took over "they brutalized us " mr rashwan says of the very security service he now lauds for protecting inmates from prison beatings he lifts his pants exposing bruised thighs mr rashwan says he isnt sure exactly what hes charged with if anything there are no judges or lawyers on duty in gaza like the fatah loyal police theyre staying home now that hamas has complete control "i want to see a judge " mr rashwan says echoing some of the other men being held in the prison as of late last week several of whom desperately pleaded their cases to visitors often unchaperoned by hamas even some executive force leaders are starting to worry about what it means to have order without law mr subhi the deputy commander for operations in gaza city says he fears guns seized without warrants might eventually have to be returned or that prisoners arrested without proper procedures could get set free drug dealers will still feel the services wrath he says "because theyre drug dealers " but until the legality of its actions becomes clearer mr subhi says the executive force might have to put much of its energy into finding and re arresting more than convicted criminals allegedly set free by fatah as hamas forces closed in on the sariya "theyve already been convicted " mr subhi says "so we dont have to worry "
