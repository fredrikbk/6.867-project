gasoline tax reflecting our national concerns your july editorial "drive a toyota act" makes the excellent point that a gasoline tax is preferable to legislated gas mileage requirements however i do not understand why you first argue that mileage requirements favor toyota over detroit to make that point in fact a gas tax will probably hurt detroit as much as increased mileage requirements note how the current high price of gas is already increasing toyota and honda sales lets not introduce gratuitous "us vs them" arguments into what should be a simple message we need to raise the price of gasoline by introducing a tax that reflects the congestion environmental and national security costs of oil and then americans can freely make their choices such a tax is both efficient and fair and detroit and toyota will have to compete to provide the cars consumers want hendrik van den berg department of economics university of nebraska lincoln neb
