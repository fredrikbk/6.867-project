love &amp money readers turn the home front and cars readers offer their input this week on the home upkeep tasks we too often put off paying kids for chores around the house and the fact that so many teens these days are driving such nice cars a few weeks ago i wrote about how my wife amy nearly caught our kitchen on fire and how the episode reminded me of the various house related issues that ive let slide for too long like buying fire extinguishers and updating our homeowners insurance to reflect higher construction costs since we bought it david ashby in waynesville mo says he recently lost his house to a fire and worse found out he was "underinsured in spite of a policy that i thought guaranteed full replacement cost " as it turned out mr ashby says the original policy was changed by the insurer when the house turned "i signed the changes without reading them " he says hed also "made improvements to the house without notifying my agent " in the end he says hell recoup about of what he needs to rebuild the house instead of the full replacement cost the biggest irony mr ashby sold insurance for years and "i didnt do what i insisted on for my clients " namely keeping coverage on a policy up to date in walnut creek calif robert schick says "many couples try to push the envelope on home repair and maintenance to avoid having to run the gantlet of selecting a reliable contractor who is also free to take the job " because most home repair issues arent emergencies dr schick says homeowners often put off projects by categorizing them as "oh i can do that when i have time" or "there is no way i can take that on but i do not have the energy now to interview and check out possible contractors " he adds "except for the few individuals who have established relationships with trusted contractors many of us wish we could just call the dealer as we can with our cars " by way of example dr schick say his rotting back deck "is replaced by me in my dreams but i know there will never be an uninterrupted two weeks to complete such a task with my likely embarrassing inefficiency or without personal injury year after year i put it off because i dread going through the process of deciding who might be the right person to do that job i am not yet needing to nail plywood patches over specific areas but that day is approaching " when writing several weeks ago about my first car a hideous gold four door buick lesabre circa i noted that teens today all seem to be driving far nicer cars in part because moms and dads are ponying up additional cash i wondered in that column whether this is just another sign that were spoiling our kids or if theres something else at work randi glick boven in deerfield beach fla says when her son hits next month "a used car is not even an option " because of safety concerns hell be getting a new car "when i was turning " she says "a used car was a great value all the guys knew how to make most repairs and if not loved taking cars apart to figure it out however now because of the safety measures in the cars and because of computers if the car is not under warranty the repairs could cost a fortune you cant fix your own car you need a computer "i really dont want my son driving a used car with a questionable air bag or worse no air bag or brakes that are not up to par so a small new car with no extras in the &# range is really the only option he wont be the coolest kid in school but he will not be stuck by the side of the road waiting for a tow truck and then without a car for weeks while he works to save up the money to make repairs " repairs are exactly what chips barry in denver imposed on his now grown kids he bought them their first cars but with a twist "the car did not work " mr barry says "the engine had to be rebuilt by the kid and me both resisted at first but then got into it and as a result both boys knew how the engine and car worked and could do routine maintenance in both cases it was a fun father son project that produced an inexpensive drivable vehicle that they could take some pride in " i wrote a few weeks ago that amy and i had become too lazy about paying our son for chores we originally assigned him certain chores a few years ago but paid him for others that we felt were above and beyond his age unfortunately we ended up doing his chores to finish them quickly and allow for more family time and he ultimately reached a point where he expected to be paid for everything we asked of him we put an end to that this summer imposing daily household duties cynthia eckholm in la mesa calif says she and her husband "have been wrestling with the chores vs helping family problem for years somehow our two boys ages and convinced us that their job of going to school was all they needed to do and that since i am a stay at home mom well wasnt taking care of the house my job " now she says frustration has "reached an all time high " ms eckholm says she and her husband have told their sons that "being a family means helping each other out and that if you see a need like the trash runneth over you could just take it out " ms eckholm says she thinks "its sort of working " but likes my wifes idea of leaving a list of expected chores every day deborah a reader in redmond wash says that when she worked as a corporate executive she paid "a nanny housekeeper gardener and cook to take care of my familys needs when i quit working to spend more time with my kids i jumped at the opportunity to do everything for them myself " but she created a sour dynamic her teenage daughter pushed aside chores like hanging up her clothes or loading the dishwasher but found time to play sports and enjoy a busy social schedule her younger son continually asked how much hed be paid for simple expected chores and pouted and groaned when he was required to do them for free deborah says that three years on "i have begun to feel like an underpaid maid to my children your column has inspired me to take a more deliberate approach to chores making expectations clear and not feeling apologetic about asking our kids to be consistently responsible for a few simple chores "
