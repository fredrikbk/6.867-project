they get better by shifting money to junk bond mutual funds investors may attempt to generate high income by buying these low rated corporate bonds which carry hefty yields indeed junk bonds euphemistically called high yield bonds arent yet at bargain levels and while the market is finally beginning to compensate investors for the risks they are taking with these funds the pain could grow if the economy weakens junk bond mutual funds have been among the most popular in recent years and for good reason the bonds which generally do well when few companies default on their interest payments have been in a long running bull market theyve returned a total of more than than for investors in the past year topping gains of for higher rated intermediate term bonds yields on junk bonds which move in the opposite direction of their price have fallen from about to about in the past five years until two months ago these bonds paid an interest rate of just over two percentage points above super safe treasury bonds minimal reward for embracing the risks of these low rated bonds thats changing lately however as ongoing troubles in the market for debt backed by mortgages of borrowers with loweer credit ratings big losses at some hedge funds specializing in bonds and the cloudy investment outlook has investors worrying about all kinds of risky investments another issue a torrent of new low rated bonds and loans being sold potentially overwhelming demand over the next few months more than &# billion of below investment grade loans and bonds will be sold to back big leveraged buyouts announced in recent months such as kohlberg kravis robertss &# billion acquisition of first data already a number of planned junk bond offerings have been withdrawn due to limited investor interest as a result high yield bonds now trade at yields that are more than three percentage points above those of treasurys meaning that investors finally are receiving more compensation to venture into junk bonds the average junk bond fund has lost about in the past month the worst month in about two years that explains why investors have pulled out more than &# billion from the funds

reward for the risks of these bonds analysts say rather than creating a rash of opportunity in wall street terms investors are "repricing risk " or putting a new lower price on risky assets though the price is not yet at bargain basement levels to wit junk bond yields were as much as percentage points above treasurys five years ago another worry the quality of bonds in the high yield market has dropped in recent years as lower quality companies have been able to find eager investors "it is absolutely true that investors are not being paid much extra yield to invest in high yield bonds today
