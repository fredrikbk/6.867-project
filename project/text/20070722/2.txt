in translation whats a b fee a load in disguise the securities and exchange commission announced this year that mutual funds"b " fees need a makeover or could possibly be eliminated altogether and caused an uproar within the fund industry that leaves many investors wondering what are these oddly named fees anyway and why is the issue so divisive the b fee gets its name from a rule that allows mutual fund companies to use a small part of a persons investment every year to pay for marketing and distribution expenses fund companies were struggling for survival at the time and the commission thought investors would be better off if mutual funds could attract more customers the fees originally paid for things like advertising prospectuses and sales literature sec chairman christopher cox said in a speech to fund directors but they quickly became a "sales load in drag " as fund companies used them to pay brokers and other intermediaries for selling the funds and servicing accounts indeed many b and c mutual fund share classes that dont have an upfront sales "load " or commission have much higher b fees say compared with or for an a class share that charges a one time sales fee say when an investor buys into the fund mr cox worries that the fees arent helping investors the way the commission envisioned especially since mutual fund companies have flourished and the industry now has over &# trillion in assets he led an sec roundtable discussion last month to discuss rule b and got an earful from panelists who said the commission knew that the fees would go to brokers and that eliminating them would ultimately raise costs for small investors or make it so no one wants to service their accounts the b fee works as a subsidy for smaller accounts allowing advisers to give everyday investors the guidance they want and need says joe russo a panelist and independent adviser in cedar rapids iowa he says eliminating or drastically altering the rule would be "disastrous" for investors in part because it would lower the incentive to take care of them the commission is in the early stages of deliberation and analysts say its unlikely the sec will eliminate the fees altogether but rather issue more guidance on how they should be used meanwhile the fees as theyre structured now continue to whittle away at investors long term gains for example say you invested &# in a fund that earned a year but charged to manage assets and for b fees the investment would grow to &# at the end of years but it would have been worth an extra &# without the b fee thats because the marketing and distribution expense costs &# over the course of the decade and an additional &# in forgone earnings not all funds charge a b fee some companies like vanguard group fidelity investments and t rowe price group keep many offerings free of the expense investors can find the b fees for their funds at morningstar com punch in the funds ticker and click on "fees &amp expenses " on the left side of the funds page
