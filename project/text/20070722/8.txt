nursing homes medicaid and your assets more than a year has passed since the federal government changed the rules for qualifying for medicaid assistance for long term care and experts in the field are still sorting out the implications for those who want to pass assets on to their children the new rules made it tougher for example to give gifts to children or grandchildren to help pay for their college education individuals who make such gifts can find themselves ineligible for medicaid benefits after theyre already in a nursing home but estate planning experts say some options remain open for those who want to pass on some assets such as a home through a trust or preserve some income for a spouse in certain kinds of annuities even by government bureaucracy standards medicaid rules are confusing and complex and the stakes are high a mistake can mean legal bills and financial problems that come on top of the emotional strain of having a loved one in a nursing home complicating matters is the fact that the federal government oversees medicaid but individual states administer the program state rules can vary significantly in fact some states are only just now finalizing their guidelines based on last years changes to the federal law california for one hasnt even gotten that far attorneys say as a result its important to speak with an expert in your states rules individuals generally become eligible for medicaid assistance to pay for long term care after using up all but a certain amount of assets that level varies by state but can be as little as &# in cash and investments for many people who had hoped to pass on even a small inheritance to their children thats an unhappy prospect one way to avoid having a lifetimes savings being wiped out has been to transfer assets to children before entering a nursing home though controversial it was a perfectly legal strategy that came with some limits to prevent abuses prior to the new law if you gave money away within the past three years you would be ineligible for medicaid for a period of time based on how much money was transferred or given away for instance if you gave away say the equivalent of nine months aid you would be denied medicaid help for that period of time starting from when you made the gift for those who were healthy it was a risk many were willing to take now the "look back" period for any gifts or transfers you may have made extends back five years from when you apply for medicaid and significantly the period of time you will be denied aid begins not from when you made the gift but when you apply for assistance and are otherwise fully qualified that means you could be in a nursing home have exhausted your savings and be unable to receive medicaid for months or even years depending on the value of what you gave away or transferred that could leave your family potentially liable for unpaid bills even if they didnt receive any of the gifts this affects not only those trying to shelter assets from future nursing home costs but even those who simply want to make a gift to a child or grandchild say to help pay for college education gifts or transfers made before the new law was signed in february were grandfathered "you give your grandchild money for college and three years later youre in a nursing home you use up your remaining money over the next year its only then that the penalty starts " says jeffrey marshall an elder law attorney in williamsport pa "thats why its so devastating theres no other way you can make the payments to the nursing home " while the new medicaid rules complicate estate planning they dont make it impossible philip bouklas a new york lawyer says the change in the rule for gifts removed a disadvantage for trusts used to protect assets trusts previously had a five year look back period while gifts had the three year look back presumably because people who used trusts were wealthier or more sophisticated and were doing so to skirt the medicaid rules now that its a level playing field mr bouklas is more often using what are known as irrevocable income only trusts in situations where individuals want to pass on a house or other assets to a child by using an income only trust as opposed to just deeding the property over to a child the parent can still live in the house and even sell it plus the trust offers tax advantages over just changing the name on the deed "you might as well use a trust since theres no extra penalty period and theres more flexibility " he says one additional twist on the strategy is to take out long term care insurance to cover the look back period in case you unexpectedly end up in a nursing home the changes to the medicaid rules also tightened but left somewhat open another planning loophole it used to be that many annuities werent counted as an asset when determining medicaid eligibility its still possible to put money in an annuity and have the funds protected but there are now greater restrictions heres how it would work if a couple has &# in assets and one spouse has to go into a nursing home the rules would likely require spending half that money before the ill spouse is eligible for medicaid however by putting &# into an annuity the healthy spouse could collect the income off the annuity and the spouse in the nursing home would be eligible for medicaid "youre converting a countable resource into one thats not countable " says mr marshall however the law put in place added guidelines that an annuity must meet to avoid being counted as a transfer of assets that would lead to ineligibility for example it has to be irrevocable and has to be an immediate annuity which means your investment is turned into an income stream with equal payments right away without any deferral whats more the state needs to be named as a beneficiary to cover the cost of the medical treatment paid on behalf of the institutionalized person if the annuity isnt set up properly your state could deny medicaid benefits "be wary " says mr bouklas
