becoming a force in detroit its also becoming a force on wall street with a stable of financial institutions that make it by far the biggest auto lender in the nation and a broader financial power around the globe as part of cerberuss acquisition of an stake in chrysler group from daimlerchrysler ag the private equity firm will be getting the auto makers lending arm chrysler financial cerberus already owns of gmac financial services the former financing arm of general motors corp a stake it acquired last year with gmac and chrysler finance under one roof cerberus will have approximately market share in auto loans nearly twice as large as its nearest competitor ford motor credit and well ahead of u s banks according to data from experian automotive that could lead to cost savings and operating synergies says mark oline an analyst at fitch ratings like ge capital the financing arm of general electric co cerberus has figured out that the financing business can be a rich vein even in struggling industries throughout the s cerberus quietly built up a middle market lending portfolio at a time when many banks were abandoning these customers since then cerberus has spread its net over a far larger pool of borrowers both at home and abroad in the process it began picking off profitable niches globally most recently while many investors are writing off the auto making business cerberus has tapped into a gold mine at both gm and chrysler car finance is "a very good business " says efraim levy an auto analyst at standard &amp poors equity research "you take low cost money and you lend it at a high rate and then once you make a transaction and generate a fee from it you can start the transaction over again and make another fee" by bundling car loans into securities sold to investors according to gmacs annual report its auto financing net income last year was &# billion or of its total automotive financing revenue private equity firms have become increasingly aggressive buyers of other financial institutions in the past few years one recent example the deal to buy student loan powerhouse sallie mae by jc flowers &amp co another private equity firm none have been more aggressive than cerberus auto lending becomes the centerpiece of an even larger empire of financial assets that is quickly coming to rival some of the bigger financial institutions in the world the firms interests range from aegis mortgage a houston mortgage company to entrecap a shelton conn leasing company to a collection of big banks in japan austria and israel success on some of these deals such as the initial public offering last year of its aozora bank gives cerberus executives confidence it can make finance lending deals work chrysler financials book value its assets minus its liabilities is about &# billion that would make it a little more than a third the size of gmac which had a book value of &# billion at the end of last year when combined that makes it a third of the size of ge capital before even accounting for cerberuss many other financial holdings ge capitals book value is &# billion chrysler financial is likely to fit into the broader ambitions of cerberus "we see numerous growth possibilities for chrysler financial such as sectors like insurance and possibly consumer or commercial finance " says mark neporent cerberuss senior managing director and chief operating officer cerberus is expected to keep gmac and chrysler financial separate for the time being it took the private equity firm nine months to carve gmac out of general motors if it was to put chrysler financial together with gmac it would have to find a way to separate the lending business from chryslers manufacturing business such separations are tricky because manufacturing and distribution and the financing of autos are generally intertwined either way gmac could become a model for chrysler financial gmac which deals in mortgage consumer and commercial lending does only about half of its business in car financing executives say chrysler financial will provide cerberus with an attractive platform to pitch other kinds of loans or even insurance products gmacs credit rating fell from investment grade to "junk" two years ago after gm was downgraded because of its mounting problems at the time when cerberus purchased a stake in the finance company last year it said it wanted to reduce gmacs ties to gms loss making auto business and bring gmacs rating back to investment grade that hasnt happened so far in part because gmacs mortgage finance unit residential capital corp recently posted large losses due to problems with its subprime home lending business and a slower housing market cerberus has also been better than many of its peers in lowering the risk of the deals it does gm recently wrote gmac a check for about &# billion to compensate for rescaps poor performance cerberus recently replaced some of rescaps top executives with individuals that have extensive mortgage banking experience rescaps new ceo jim jones previously headed another cerberus investment aegis mortgage corp and also worked at wells fargo &amp co and bank of america corp henny
