economists react economists see benign inflation data online edition the consumer price index rose in april the labor department said tuesday compared with marchs increase but the core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy prices advanced just vs in march the data largely matched wall street forecasts overall consumer inflation was up from a year ago the core cpi was up just compared with a year ago down percentage point from march and the slowest annual pace since april when it was also for the past three months the core cpi grew just on an annualized basis economists weigh in on the data and what it means for the federal reserve next rate move this was a very encouraging report however tight labor markets together with indications of some moderation in productivity growth means that cost pressures are building moreover we may still see some pass through from the latest rise in food and energy prices however core inflation has drifted closer to the feds comfort zone and another report or two such as this one could lead the fomc to remove their inflation bias morgan stanley research expect the fed to remain publicly cautious however until year on year core personal consumption expenditures inflation dips below the mark and remains there for months until then the rate hike option under the verbiage of persistently high core inflation remaining the feds "predominant concern" will remain on the table kenneth beauchemin global insight an exceedingly benign report which further widens the gulf between the feds inflation concern rhetoric and reality core cpi has now clearly decelerated to an unthreatening annualized trend possibly less bnp paribas the inflation data only reinforces a wait and see approach at the federal reserve headline inflation readings remain high while the core cpi readings are more favorable still there are two reasons for remaining cautious first some of the more volatile components lined up on the side of price declines for april apparel prices were down public transportation prices down and tobacco product prices also fell apparel prices may reflect larger discounts needed to move spring apparel when weather generally dampened demand public transportation charges falling against a backdrop of rising energy may also not be a sustainable decline the other issue is that soaring energy prices may be hurting demand for non energy goods and forcing retailers to keep a lid on price increases societe generale this was an odd report there were several key categories where prices continue to rise at excessive rates there were also places where there is basically no inflation apparel is one of the most volatile components in the index and it would not be surprising if we see a jump in costs in the near future but the restraints on vehicle computer and communications prices could be sustained the key aspect of this report is that the core inflation rate continues to moderate the fed is watching this index and the personal consumption expenditure core index to determine the direction of inflation thus the fomc members should be thinking that the future looks to be getting better this should help the markets naroff economic advisors the cpi in april was better than expected rising by less than we anticipated for both the total and the core unlike march the relatively benign core cpi result was driven by legitimate slowing in key categories rather than fluky seasonal issues in particular both rent and owners equivalent rent advanced by only in april this might be the break in shelter costs that many not us have been calling for over the last year or so stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital this moderation is giving the fomc some breathing room not so much in terms of giving the fomc the latitude to cut rates with core inflation still above the top of the fomcs "comfort zone " but more so in terms of taking any further fed funds rate hikes off of the table recall that the fomc still maintains a tightening bias should the deceleration in core inflation continue however the fomc will be free to respond o persistent below trend economic growth with cuts in the funds rate richard f moody mission residential research core consumer inflation has been retreating irregularly for the past months this corresponds to the sharply slower growth over the final quarters of last year and the first quarter of this year however the current pace of core consumer inflation is still running above the fomc comfort zone of to although the feds preferred measure of inflation the core pce deflator is rising more slowly its directional movements largely mirror those of the core cpi despite worries about the upside inflation risks because of high resource utilization sluggish economic growth is having its using delayed dampening effect on inflation this will allow the fomc to worry more about sluggish growth steven a wood insight economics apparel prices fell in april following a decline in march and airfare prices fell in april but the bls stated that this decline in airfares was due to new seasonal adjustment factors and highlighted these prices as a risk factor to inflation
