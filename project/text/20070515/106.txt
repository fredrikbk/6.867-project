the world doesnt need the world bank in regard to your may editorial "axis of soros" and bret stephenss may global view column "the whistleblowers tale" as a former debt analyst for emerging markets i have seen many dynamic companies emerge in these formerly static economies however as far as i know none of them ever got financing from the world bank or ifc the only type of companies that i saw get such financing were big bureaucratic companies with well connected owners all those companies could have gotten financing on their own and none of them could be described as being in the vanguard of dynamic growth i have worked on some projects over the years with former world bank officials they all are very well educated well spoken highly intelligent excellent at politics and networking and uniformly very pleasant people to be associated with unfortunately after a while one realizes that they are not exactly entrepreneurial like all bureaucrats they are input focused "how much money shall we lend " rather than output oriented "how many new growth companies have been created " the world bank may have a reputation as being a capitalist tool but the truth is its employees have a socialist mentality "government big bank knows better" one could argue that even if the money it lends goes to finance truly worthwhile projects that otherwise wouldnt happen there might be a raison detre for the world bank the sad truth however is that the bank finances mostly projects that could get financing on their own in the private markets those few that could not get such financing are usually of questionable value worse many projects create the potential for negative externalities especially corruption at best the correlation between bank lending and poverty alleviation is neutral at worst it could be argued that bank lending enables dysfunctional economic policies and corruption to persist thus perpetuating poverty in the long term the wolfowitz scandal purports to be about his girlfriends salary in reality it is the insular elite at the world bank fighting someone who seeks to impose real accountability maybe instead of seeking to impose accountability on the unaccountable it is time to draw the logical conclusion if the world bank does more harm than good it should be abolished at the very least its capital should be frozen so that over time it will dwindle into insignificance and right away it should have independent performance audits done by true outsiders not by easily manipulated employees the good news is that this mess is clearly exposing how dysfunctional the world bank is thereby undermining its credibility and making it more difficult to replenish its capital base the creation of the multilaterals in the s was arguably the high point of big government keynesianism silly statist economic policies based on the keynesian model have kept emerging markets in poverty for many years allowing the world bank to wither on the vine would be an appropriate end for this discredited economic philosophy the worlds poor would be the major beneficiaries k christopher taylor c f a new york
