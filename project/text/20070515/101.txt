the daily fix suns come back to beat spurs as a budding rivalry heats up online edition in the first three nba quarterfinal playoff series to complete game one team had emerged with a series lead and three changes to clinch the san antonio spurs were seconds away from making it four for four last night leading the phoenix suns by five points at home then steve nash took over he hit a jump shot made two behind the back passes that were converted into layups and received a flagrant foul from robert horry that led to some angry words exchanged but no brawl after the muck was wiped away and order restored phoenix emerged with a most unlikely victory and regained home court advantage in the best of seven series "you couldnt invent bigger stakes for a basketball game in may and both teams understood " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic "ever notice how in really big baseball games the reserves stand up against the rail and are glued to every pitch the tension was so thick in san antonio that subs from both teams stood during the action thats rare " that tension boiled over when mr horry left his feet to deliver a hip and forearm to mr nash that sent him flying into the press table along the sidelines mr horry risks suspension as do two suns players also wandered over from the bench after the flagrant foul "i dont know what robert horry was thinking " buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "he came in for the final seconds and hadnt had time to get mad about anything and i know what amare stoudemire and boris diaw were thinking nothing they left their bench out of reaction because horry took out steve nash the way a linebacker takes out a quarterback on the sideline my punishment id fine horry and nothing more and i wouldnt care exactly how many feet and inches stoudemire and diaw strayed from their bench id make them all come back because i want to see what happens next " does the nba want to see what happens next or affect it the fix doesnt buy conspiracy theories about officiating but columns like michael wilbons in the washington post today and several calls yesterday that went the suns way as true hoop points out could at least explain the tension that mr horry was feeling simply put good times for the spurs are bad for the nba mr wilbon points out that san antonio ranked st in the league in road attendance and has been a tv ratings killer "theyre polite in public dealings accept coaching and are personally accountable " mr wilbon writes "theyre smart creative and civic gods where they live theyre never ever involved in embarrassing off court drama yet it all adds up to induce one big yawn from basketball consumers " the cleveland cavaliers won a defensive battle in new jersey last night to take a series lead against the nets if the cavs close things out at home wednesday nets fans may have seen the last home game featuring jason kidd richard jefferson and vince carter in nets jerseys "they have three of the most rare most wonderful talents in all of basketball running the floor together " mike vaccaro writes in the new york post "they generate all this energy all this light all this basketball fire and yet over the course of three years all they have to show for this are two playoff series victories and far too few moments that youll want to press between the pages of your basketball scrapbook " sometimes stars dont co exist easily carlos boozer currently leading the utah jazz to within a game of their first conference finals since could be playing alongside lebron james in cleveland which would make the cavs the east favorite this spring but he left for salt lake city three years ago a move that makes sense to washington times columnist dan daly "with cleveland he never would have been more than lebrons sidekick his scottie pippen in utah though people can see him for what he is a basketball player in full " the buffalo sabres who won more games than any other nhl team this season have had minutes of on hockey against the ottawa senators in their eastern conference finals series and in those power plays ottawa has outscored buffalo buffalos power play futility has led to a series deficit something thats been overcome just twice in league history daniel alfredsson scored ottawas only goal last night and has scored in nine of the teams playoff games "not bad for a former sixth round draft pick " toronto star columnist damien cox writes of the year old ottawa captain "not bad for a player roundly vilified for his weak defensive play against these same sabres on the goal that eliminated the senators from last springs playdowns " today in valencia bmw oracles boat in the americas cup mounted a stirring comeback against italys luna rossa challenge to even their semifinal series at one race apiece two reporters recently provided looks at the atmospherics of this storied regatta the guardians matt scott climbed aboard the oracle boat and admired the sailors "practised precision " meanwhile christopher clarey notes that the valencia crowds have been large though lured perhaps more by the price free than by fandom " curiosity seeker is much closer to the truth and ambiance seeker is probably even closer and the seekers have not gone unrewarded after they have made it through the security gates " mr clarey writes "valencia knows how to organize a party " each year at this time as the european soccer leagues wind down their regular season the major league baseball season is old enough to declare some teams hopeless occasionally an american columnist looks across the pond and likes what he sees in europes relegation system the teams at the bottom of the standings each year are demoted to a lower division "the relegation system is practiced throughout the world except in north america where a chronically dysfunctional franchise like the lions gets to grow fat off the nfl teat year after year " bob molinaro writes in the virginian pilot "if the lions played by the rules of the english premier league theyd be a minor league operation next season " but the english premier league is facing allegations that one of its teams didnt play by the rules and wasnt punished adequately for its irregular acquisition of argentine forward carlos tevez the east london club west ham was punished with a fine but not a loss of points in the standings mr tevez has scored seven goals in west hams final games including the only goal in a defeat of manchester united last sunday that finished a late surge for west ham to stave off relegation sheffield united one of the clubs relegated in west hams stead is threatening to sue for explication of the controversy see this associated press article and for a dose of righteous anger about it see james lawtons column in the independent "one west ham fan emailed a bbc discussion yesterday with the heartfelt cry for godsake people should get off the bandwagon some bandwagon a desire for truth and justice if you take the wheels off this one which is obviously the fondest wish of the premiership and their beneficiaries west ham you might as well kiss goodbye to any confidence in the ability of big time football to negotiate in any satisfactory way the years ahead " whats eating roger federer the world no is still in the running for the first grand slam in mens tennis since rod laver in but two weeks before the french open beings federer has lost four of matches was uncharacteristically uncharitable in post match comments about one of his conquerors and has parted ways with his coach "the man who uses serenity as one of his most potent weapons has fretted himself into crisis " simon barnes writes in the times of london forget tennis beer pong has the potential to become more popular steven wells writes in a semi serious column for the guardian "beer pong is one of those really cool uniquely american things that americans have no idea is really cool " mr wells writes "other examples include garbage disposals in sinks competitive skipping which is simply awesome crazy legged fundamentalist christians who wiggle about to proto rocknroll while being bitten by snakes high school marching bands and the be aggressive cheerleader chant be aggressive b e aggressive if the us could ever figure out how to combine beer pong with marching bands cheerleaders and real beer like say anchor steam or sam adams it would be the one american sport that could become as popular and as widespread as soccer " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
