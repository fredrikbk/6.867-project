a cultural conversation with j p donleavy naughty paintings and once scandalous words new york last week the novelist j p donleavy departed the genteel comfort of levington park his th century estate in ireland to attend a quirky little gallery opening at the national arts club in new yorks gramercy park the show on view until may features the writers own roguish often explicit renderings he is a self taught artist of priapic dogs predatory fish and lusty human figures the brooklyn born bronx bred mr donleavy never took art classes when he attended trinity college dublin on the g i bill and he has embraced his lack of formal training the work has a childlike immediacy that conjures elementary school art class except that is for paintings of nude women with titles like "i dont know why but he likes them this size " an absence of artistic sobriety and of a college degree didnt keep mr donleavy from becoming a best selling author either his first of novels "the ginger man" chronicles the misadventures of sebastian dangerfield a degenerate american law student married and broke in ireland determined to avoid anything so banal as the classroom or steady work and occupied instead with women and liquor writing in esquire dorothy parker called it "lusty violent and wildly funny " as a disengaged student at trinity himself mr donleavy sat in on some life drawing sessions with members of the "white stag" set bohemians reacting to the stultifying morality of postwar ireland given his scandalous literary debut soon thereafter and the titles of his paintings one wonders whether it might have been the prospect of naked models that attracted him but "i am the painter who became a writer and has been rediscovered as a painter " he tells me in his suite at the new york athletic club and its true that his last opening in dublin attracted avid attention from buyers critics and curious fans of his writing his self invention as an artist took form in the s "suddenly " he recalls "i saw the high prices jack yates w b s brother was charging for his pictures i started to slap paint on a canvas " his first exhibit in dublin in reaped mixed reviews realizing he hadnt painted enough to fill the gallery he hurried to his easel on the day of the show and worked furiously hanging the works still wet on the gallery walls "the irish painter phyllis hayward who was pretty outspoken came along and she would pronounce you do have nerve so thats the kind of encouragement i got " but mr donleavy who has painted for pleasure and modest profit ever since doesnt worry too much about art critics and book reviewers "like most writers or people who live isolated lives you should try not to look into the kind of machinations of how well known you are who reads you because youd drive yourself crazy writers are best when theyre failures and struggling and rejected so thats been my history total isolation " this isnt entirely accurate as a young man mr donleavy was actively engaged with a vibrant group of writers and artists in dublin he has been married twice has had children and stepchildren and is joined for this interview by a female travel companion an agent and a lawyer friend but he seems to enjoy his image as an eccentric literary eminence holed up in a lavish pile except for local schoolkids and the odd lit cult follower few would dare to drop in unannounced at his house set on his organic cattle farm in the irish midlands signs by the gate offer vivid warnings of bloodhounds high voltage fences and aggressive bulls and of what might befall trespassers a boyish delight in the illicit so palpable in mr donleavys writing is undiminished by age but the writer now is weary from his transatlantic journey he describes the oppressiveness of the first class service on his flight to new york "im an emotional and physical wreck having made that trip over here food shoved in front of you every half hour and out of politeness because if nothing else in my life i am earnestly polite i would try to eat the damn thing off the plate and make it look as if id paid some attention and as soon as that had happened theyd take it away and then a new one came in you see " mr donleavy laments that he has no private jet at his disposal "i now have sympathy for all these people who look extravagant they have yachts and all this stuff but they need it " travel conditions being as intolerable as they are "im not in that league " he is sure that johnny depp would never put up with commercial air travel he hopes that mr depp whose breeding and physical elegance he greatly admires will play sebastian dangerfield in a film adaptation of "the ginger man" that has been in discussion for some time mr donleavys most famous book is still popular and has benefited greatly from negative press banned in ireland until the early s for sexual content that while robust seems tame by todays standards it was stigmatized even in new york a sure route to commercial success "there was an encyclical letter read from every catholic pulpit in america at the time they were warned not to read this book " that was not mr donleavys first opportunity to embarrass his parents tolerant bronx immigrants who prospered from some shrewd real estate investments in their adopted city young james patrick was expelled from fordham prep for being a "bad influence " by founding a fraternity and holding its first and last meeting at a saloon in the war mr donleavy ended up in the amphibious corps "that was practically a suicide force but at some stage in the navy you could take examinations in the fleet and i got an appointment to the u s naval academy at annapolis there i attended the strangest school ive ever attended in all my life the naval academy preparatory school " in class with the sons of congressmen and generals mr donleavy won his first literary recognition as a ghostwriter of essays for less creative classmates "there were a lot of these southerners hey j p will you raaahht me one of those things you do i was an expert at assuming their identities but a teacher who was a pretty sophisticated gentleman said i believe there is a ghostwriter at work in this school " learning from his teacher that a joycean influence was at work in his essays young j p went to the school library and read james joyce for the first time joyce was not then treated with the reverence that came later says mr donleavy "the impression you got was that he was a dissolute medical student who just drank and whored to use that european word through dublin no one looked upon him as a great innovator " still mr donleavy was drawn to ireland by his reading of joyce and by impressions picked up from fellow g i s who had had tours abroad the allure of the pub and of collegial self discovery kept him at arms length from his microbiology studies he left trinity without a degree in while soaking up the intellectual atmosphere and painting away mr donleavy was developing his literary voice among his earliest published writings were letters to the irish times defending himself against critics of his art a man in search of an audience he felt that he could reach a wider one with writing in he handed in part of his "ginger man" manuscript to scribners in new york receiving praise but no deal he moved on to london where his friend the writer brendan behan declared "this book is going to go around the world and beat the bejesus out of the bible " not quite but it has sold more than million copies and been translated into two dozen languages despite a distinctly unsavory debut beating out "the onion eaters " "wrong information being given out at princeton " and all of mr donleavys other books and plays "i was first published by the olympia press in paris who published pornography so my beginnings were dreadful in that regard but i was also published alongside vladimir nabokov he was furious because they tried to publish "lolita" as pornography " mr donleavy was paid an upfront fee for "the ginger man " then spent "years in litigation" with his publishers when the book "began to persist and become a worthy economic prospect " in the end he sent his beautiful second wife to paris to bid on the failing press when it went up for auction "youre looking happily now at the owner of the olympia press paris i own that company " mr donleavy gentleman farmer and minor print baron is not too concerned about the prices on his paintings at the national arts club most are in the &# to &# range or about the reviews the show might receive he is instead intent on reclaiming his inner child every time he paints "i feel like anyone who scratches a piece of paper children especially are natural talents as artists the thing that defeats children from becoming great artists are adults coming up to them and looking at it and saying well lets see maybe we can make that look more like a dog all it is is the suppression of the child society wipes them out fills them with fear " the writer painter farmer then poses a rhetorical question beyond the powers of most children "dare i do this are people going to laugh at me " j p donleavy doesnt really care ms finnerty writes about culture for the journal
