surging ahead in iraq there is a serious and widening disconnect between the timetables that commanders are using to guide their actions in iraq and those being demanded by politicians in washington gen david petraeus and lt gen ray odierno the senior u s commanders in iraq are quite properly planning for the troop "surge" to extend well into next year thats why the pentagon has alerted combat brigades with some soldiers to get ready to deploy in august they will be needed to replace troops rotating home back home however politicians are demanding results in the next few months or else and not just democrats house minority leader john boehner has said that if they dont see progress by the fall even house republicans will start demanding a plan b for iraq which would presumably involve pulling troops out not sending more that message was reinforced by the group of house republicans who visited the white house last week gen petraeus has promised to report back to congress by september on what kind of progress he is making but dont expect a definitive answer he is unlikely to say "the surge has worked" or "the surge has failed " he will instead probably point to a variety of indicators some of which will be positive others negative it will be left to the american people and their leaders to interpret these results as they see fit inevitably since suicide attacks will still be occurring in iraq in september many commentators and politicians will write off the surge as a failure many are already doing so even though the baghdad security plan is barely three months old and the fourth extra u s brigade has only recently arrived the fifth and final one wont be in place until june it will take many months after that to see whether security conditions are improving and even if they are perhaps especially if they are it would be the height of folly to then start withdrawing u s troops something that secretary of defense bob gates has indicated might happen an article in usa today reported on a pentagon funded study which confirms what military historians already know an average insurgency can run for a decade but most fail in the end translation if were going to be successful in iraq were going to have to make a long term commitment that doesnt mean u s combat troops stationed there for years but it does mean a substantial force tens of thousands of soldiers will be needed for many years to come if were planning to start withdrawing in september or even september we might as well run up the white flag now and let the great iraqi civil war unfold in all its horror most americans seem resigned to that fate in fact many think that the civil war has already begun and we cant or shouldnt do anything about it we hear all the time that "we have no business getting into the middle of someone elses civil war" often from the very same people who in the s were rightly urging that we get involved in the civil wars of the former yugoslavia or who today rightly urge us to get involved in the civil war in sudan the reality is that iraq has been experiencing a fairly low grade civil war until now one that has been contained by the presence of u s troops while the troop surge in baghdad hasnt yet decreased the overall level of violence suicide bombings which are notoriously difficult to stop remain undiminished the presence of more iraqi and american troops on the streets has managed to reduce sectarian murders by two thirds since january sunni fanatics are still able to set off their car bombs but shiite fanatics are not able to respond in kind by torturing to death sunnis a night in other words the surge is containing the results of the suicide bombings slowing the cycle of violence that last year was leading iraq to the brink of the abyss if u s troops were to pull out anytime in the foreseeable future the probable result would not be as so many advocates of withdrawal claim that iraqis would "get their act together" and take care of their problems themselves the far more likely consequence would be an all out civil war not only would this be a humanitarian tragedy for which the u s would bear indirect responsibility but it would also be a catastrophe for american interests in the region if we are seen as the losers in iraq al qaeda would be seen as the winner the perception of american weakness fed by a pullout would lead to increased terrorism against the u s and our allies just as occurred following our withdrawal from somalia in and from beirut in in the ensuing chaos it is quite possible that al qaeda terrorists would succeed in turning western iraq into a taliban style base for international terrorism although the momentum at the moment is running against al qaeda in anbar province the tribal forces who are now cooperating with the iraqi government would be incapable of defeating al qaeda on their own if the u s were to pull out the tribes would likely go back to cooperating with al qaeda for the sake of self preservation and a handful of american special operations forces operating from far off bases would be helpless to stop the terrorists because they would lack the kind of human intelligence now generated by u s troops on the ground that is only one of many possible effects of an iraqi civil war that we need to contemplate before making the fateful decision to give up the fight daniel byman and kenneth pollack of the brookings institution two serious democratic analysts issued a sobering study in january called "things fall apart containing the spillover from an iraqi civil war" that should be required reading for anyone calling for a pullout messrs byman and pollack studied a number of civil wars stretching back to the s in countries from congo to lebanon and found that they are never confined within the borders drawn neatly on maps civil wars export refugees terrorists militant ideologies and economic woes that destabilize neighboring states and those states in turn usually intervene to try to limit the fallout or to expand their sphere of influence "we found that spillover is common in massive civil wars that while its intensity can vary considerably at its worst it can have truly catastrophic effects and that iraq has all the earmarks of creating quite severe spillover problems " they write no surprise after all iraq with its oil wealth has far more to fight over than congo or lebanon or chechnya while a civil war is the most likely outcome in iraq it is not inevitable contrary to the common myth iraqi shiites and sunnis have not been at daggers drawn since the dawn of time until fairly recently they lived peaceably side by side intermarriage was common and major tribes still have both sunni and shiite components the slide toward civil war occurred because of an implosion of central authority and a breakdown of law and order that allowed demagogues on both sides the likes of moqtada al sadr and abu musab al zarqawi to posture as the defenders of their sectarian groups that dynamic while strong could still be reversed if the iraqi government with american support were able to offer ordinary people what they most ardently desire security with u s and iraqi forces now on the offensive there have been some encouraging signs of responsible leaders on both sides pulling back from the brink sunni tribal chiefs have organized themselves into the anbar salvation council to try to work with the u s and the government of iraq and prime minister nouri al maliki has made some important gestures toward the sunnis such as his support for an equitable oil revenue sharing law which hasnt yet passed parliament slow progress toward an acceptable modus vivendi may still be possible as long as the u s doesnt insist on artificial timetables to resolve complex and emotional issues what incentive do iraqi politicians have to make compromises if they think that american troops are heading out the door if thats the case sunnis shiites and kurds would be well advised to avoid making any concessions that would strengthen their mortal enemies thus all the talk in washington about troop withdrawals has the opposite effect from what is intended instead of spurring iraqi politicians to compromise it leads them to be more obdurate its still possible to stave off catastrophic defeat in iraq but the only way to do it is to give gen petraeus and his troops more time at least another year to try to change the dynamics on the ground the surge strategy may be a long shot but every alternative is even worse mr boot is
