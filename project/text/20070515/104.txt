every business day sign up for the e mail here the problem with taking a hard line in political fights is the loss of credibility and political capital that can come if youre forced to back down the white house could find itself in such a situation with the efforts to keep paul wolfowitz and alberto gonzales in their jobs last week administration officials and republicans close to the white house told reporters on different occasions that president bush fervently opposed the ousting of mr wolfowitz as president of the world bank amid an ethics controversy there and that despite attorney general gonzaless solidifying isolation in washington mr bush rejected all suggestions that he consider asking his longtime aide to go yesterday both of those positions seemed to get harder to defend deputy attorney general paul mcnulty informed mr gonzales he would be resigning sometime this summer writing just months after he took the position mr mcnulty a former u s attorney said "the financial realities of college age children and two decades of public service lead me to a long overdue transition in my career " still he later said he doesnt yet have another job lined up the resignation of mr mcnulty a career republican operative is the fourth at the justice department since the dismissals of nine u s attorneys last year morphed into a major scandal and is "all the more dramatic because of his high rank" in the administration the los angeles times notes mr mcnulty had admitted to misleading congress about the reasons for the firings saying he was out of the loop though he had attended meetings with mr gonzales and others when the list of prosecutors to be fired was reviewed mr mcnulty tells the washington post that the resulting political tumult which includes hostility from democrats and republicans on capitol hill and a criminal inquiry at the justice department didnt play a part in his decision to quit but friends of mr mcnulty tell the new york times he "had long chafed in his role as second in command under mr gonzales and had realized that the furor over the prosecutors had probably ended his hope to be named to a seat on a federal appeals court " while his departure seems to further isolate mr gonzales the times notes the attorney general has been able to fend off the calls for his resignation thanks to mr bushs support but since it was mr gonzales who put mr mcnulty and monica goodling another aide who resigned in charge of the prosecutor purge the latest resignation may revive pressure on him to go the wall street journal says on an international political front a panel of world bank board members presented to the full board its findings on the matter of mr wolfowitzs role in securing a promotion and large raise for his girlfriend when she left the bank for a job at the state department the report says he violated the banks code of conduct broke three staff rules and breached the terms of his contract as bank president as the financial times reports it asks the full board to consider "whether mr wolfowitz will be able to provide the leadership needed to ensure that the bank continues to operate to the fullest extent possible in achieving its mandate " it insists he should have removed himself from the decision making related to his girlfriend warns about a "crisis of leadership" and says the banks "reputation and credibility" are on the line as the journal reports and it goes on to urge the full board to open debate on "whether mr wolfowitz will be able to provide the leadership needed to ensure that the bank" can carry out its duties it seemed certain to raise pressure on him to resign the journal adds parsing irans rapidly expanding nuclear program for all the menace in vice president dick cheneys recent rhetoric on iran the international atomic energy agency which essentially opposed military action against iraq five years ago seems to be treating tehrans atomic program as a more serious threat a snap inspection of iranian nuclear facilities sunday by inspectors from the international atomic energy agency found that tehran seems to have overcome technical hurdles in efforts to expand its enrichment of uranium and that the expansion is accelerating quickly the new york times reports diplomats and nuclear experts at the u n watchdog agency in vienna tell the times that engineers at the natanz plant are already using roughly centrifuges to produce fuel suitable for reactors and that they are at the stage where they can add one cascade centrifuges a week "experts say that at this pace iran could have centrifuges operating by june enough if the uranium were enriched further to make one bombs worth of nuclear material every year " the times adds "we believe they pretty much have the knowledge about how to enrich " iaea director general mohamed elbaradei tells the times "from now on it is simply a question of perfecting that knowledge people will not like to hear it but thats a fact " the u s and european allies have been working through the u n and pressuring tehran directly to suspend enrichment in order to keep the iranians from achieving the expertise needed to make its own nuclear fuel which can feed reactors at low levels of enrichment and a weapons program at much higher levels and the bush administration has long shunned direct negotiations until iran stops enriching "were proceeding under the assumption that there is still time for diplomacy to work " undersecretary of state nicholas burns says to the times mr elbaradei has been skeptical of that approach and expressed doubts iran would fully suspend nuclear activities "from a proliferation perspective the fact of the matter is that one of the purposes of suspension keeping them from getting the knowledge has been overtaken by events " he now says "the focus now should be to stop them from going to industrial scale production to allow us to do a full court press inspection and to be sure they remain inside" the nuclear nonproliferation treaty the first bilateral u s iranian talks are actually set to take place in baghdad at the end of the month but following mr cheneys rhetorical broadside from an aircraft carrier in the persian gulf last week and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads threat laced reaction yesterday both sides are trying to show "they have not flip flopped on their policies " the washington post reports even as he lashed out mr ahmadinejad said tehran is "ready and prepared" for the talks and while secretary of state condoleezza rice said now was a good time to start talking with iran about iraq white house spokesman tony snow said that doesnt mean washington plans to restore diplomatic relations "this not only is not schizophrenic " he added "its perfectly consistent with american policy over recent months " russia may be nearing oecd membership for all the western doubts generated about the political economic character of vladimir putins russia the country may be on the verge of reaching a new post soviet milestone of acceptability membership in the group known as capitalisms club spanish finance minister pedro solbes told reporters
