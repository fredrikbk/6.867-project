either a discount off each doctors typical rate or a fixed below market rate with a cap of &# set on additional facility fees the network sells access to its doctor lists to individuals for &# a year but increasingly insurance companies looking for ways to stand out are buying the benefit to offer their members access to the discounts members present their insurance id card to qualify for the lower rates they pay the physician out of their own pocket bluecross blueshield of south carolina and humana inc s and coventry health care inc s plans in louisiana are among the insurers who are offering discounts through the network in february south carolina bluecross blueshield introduced a benefit that gives members discounts of or more on cosmetic procedures when they use a participating doctor so far more than of the health plans members have scheduled appointments with surgeons around the u s says david boucher the insurers assistant vice president for health care services the

senior vice president of provider relations for the plano texas company ryan jumonville owner of united networks which is based in baton rouge la says the year old company is finally seeing the plastic surgery network gain traction after a five year struggle in march at a national conference of blue cross blue shield insurers united networks was one of several vendors who made a pitch to more than a dozen participating plans united says it expects much of its growth in coming years to come from its cosmetic surgery network interest in such networks comes as the number of cosmetic procedures and the number of practitioners offering them has grown in recent years at the same time insurance and other medical payment options such as tax favored flexible spending accounts wont pay for purely cosmetic procedures though they will typically pay to correct a deformity arising from an illness injury or congenital defect for some people a cosmetic surgery benefit can be a deal maker susan stott age started shopping for a new individual health insurance policy after the cost of her old coverage went up coventry caught her eye because its brochure featured several "value added" programs including the cosmetic surgery discount network which gave it "a little sparkle " she says after becoming a coventry member she underwent breast augmentation surgery last year the cost was &# about of the market rate says ms stott who lives near baton rouge discount networks are a tough sell to plastic surgeons who seldom sign the sort of business contracts that are common in managed care they say discount programs tend to attract the least qualified surgeons who cant find enough patients on their own "those that are experts and leaders in these various areas dont feel like they have to participate because of the value they give in terms of their patient outcomes " says mark jewell a eugene ore plastic surgeon and past president of the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery a professional group mr jumonville says united networks targets "only board certified plastic surgeons" and has a rigorous credentialing process the company tries to persuade doctors that the lower fees they receive will be offset by reduced costs for marketing and administration "surgeons dont want to affiliate themselves with a discount program that is a term that is almost taboo so we have to sell it to them as more of a marketing fee " mr jumonville says mr jumonville says his company seeks to protect surgeons by keeping the physicians names confidential until a prospective patient is screened the company vets callers to weed out those who are price shopping or fishing for information that helps keep the surgeons fee schedules from public view and guards against the threat of fee cut demands from other patients united staff members also discuss surgery costs and help arrange financing with lenders if needed the company says about procedures have been performed so far through referrals to its network which includes roughly physicians patti kuvelis a year old senior care analyst for the state of california says she had considered having a rhinoplasty for years

an appointment she paid a &# deposit in september she met dr winslow "he had a great book of before and after pictures " she says he advised her to get a chin implant to aesthetically balance her new nose and she also had eyelid surgery the total cost of the three procedures came to about &# after additional savings for paying cash ms kuvelis says that by adding the other procedures she ultimately paid more than she originally hoped but feels she got good value for her money she says she is very happy with the results and figures she saved "a good if not more " she also applauded the follow up
