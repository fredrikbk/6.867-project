report elevates wolfowitz fight bank boards panel cites a crisis of leadership white house makes stand washington upping the ante in the bitter fight over paul wolfowitzs leadership of the world bank the board of the poverty fighting institution released a report that warns of a "crisis of leadership" and raises strong doubts about whether he should continue as the banks president the report prepared by a seven member committee of the full board found that mr wolfowitz placed himself in a "conflict of interest" when he dictated the terms of compensation for his girlfriend shaha riza a longtime bank employee the findings were presented to the full board yesterday the report insists mr wolfowitz should have withdrawn from decision making related to ms rizas promotion and pay package and warns the banks "reputation and credibility" with donors and borrowers has been "called into question" by the ensuing controversy because of the "damage done to the reputation of the bank " the report urges the full board to open debate on "whether mr wolfowitz will be able to provide the leadership needed to ensure that the bank" can carry out its mandate in a statement submitted to the board mr wolfowitz argued the report is "unbalanced and flawed " release of the page report came as mr wolfowitz prepared to appear today before the full board to offer a personal account of his actions and seemed certain to raise pressure on him to resign the job he began in june after mr wolfowitzs planned appearance the board is expected to consider his fate since the banks founding after world war ii no board has ever dismissed a president with mr wolfowitzs job in the balance the white house launched a last ditch round of diplomacy aimed at convincing european critics to separate the issues involving mr wolfowitzs conduct involved in the effort were treasury secretary henry paulson secretary of state condoleezza rice and president bushs national security adviser stephen hadley the officials argued the world banks board should first deal with the narrow question of whether mr wolfowitz violated bank ethics rules by setting terms of a pay and promotion package for ms riza after that is resolved the u s strategy put forward yesterday urges that the banks board then turn to the broader issue of mr wolfowitzs "ability to continue to lead the institution " a senior white house official said this approach aims to limit the political fallout of the investigative report and put off at least briefly the broader debate ignited by mr wolfowitzs management style which included a reliance on a small cadre of aides drawn from the bush political establishment and his priorities as president which include a controversial campaign to curb corruption in and out of the bank "we want people to look at this issue in context " the white house official said the official stressed that the u s the banks largest shareholder doesnt want to block debate on mr wolfowitzs leadership but does want the conflict of interest question to be considered as a discrete issue "we dont think from what we know of the facts that it should result for him in leaving the institution we want him to continue to lead the institution " a spokeswoman for mr paulson said the secretary who spoke with finance ministers yesterday from the group of seven major industrial powers "does not think the facts of the matter warrant dismissal " the administrations stiffened defense of mr wolfowitz who was deputy u s secretary of defense and an architect of the iraq war came as vice president dick cheney publicly insisted mr wolfowitz should keep his job "i think paul is one of the most able public servants ive ever known and ive worked with him a lot over the years " said mr cheney who met privately with mr wolfowitz a week ago and offered his full support according to an individual familiar with the meeting in its report the board committee raised concerns that the banks basic operations are being hampered now under mr wolfowitzs leadership the report also warns the current crisis threatens to have a "highly negative impact" on fund raising for the bank especially a new effort to raise billions of dollars replenish the banks soft loan window in two lengthy legal responses to the report mr wolfowitz argues that he "acted in good faith in an effort to resolve an unprecedented situation " he complains the report gives no weight to the "critical fact" that the banks ethics committee set aside mr wolfowitzs offer to recuse himself from involvement in ms rizas work status to avoid any potential conflict of interest ms riza was later detailed to work at the state department it was as part of that transfer that mr wolfowitz dictated the terms of pay which included guaranteed promotions and a big pay hike mr wolfowitz contends he was instructed by the boards ethics committee to deal with the situation and he cites a memo from the banks human resources chief that suggests there is "no precedent" for dealing with the kind of personal relationship at issue the former chief of the boards ethics committee and the world banks former general counsel have questioned mr wolfowitzs account however saying that he acted inappropriately
