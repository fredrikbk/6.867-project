when part of your job is caring for a boss who is too needy one former supervisor of alina tuttle melgar had a neediness that included requesting staffers to babysit and to provide transportation outside work her manager also made the entire staff eat lunch together and banned the consumption or mention of eggs that might sound imperious but to her supervisor compliance wasnt a reminder of authority it was a measure of friendship the manager "liked to think that we were doing these things and helping as friends " she says "we really functioned as the support group " if ms tuttle melgar got a call at home from her boss it was never to check in on a work project but say to get a ride to the airport the office egg ban forced her to try to convince a contractor to find paint that didnt use the word "eggshell " she spitefully ate eggs in her bosss absence even though she doesnt like them theres nothing wrong with a little vulnerability in managerial ranks but when the steady hand of leadership withdraws into a needy wreck the boss becomes the work appetite for attention comes in many guises friendship traveling by posse or regularly scheduled meetings pow wowing for kowtowing withholding reassurances from a needy supervisor is like failing to pay your minimum balance itll cost you more later one of the latest guises of neediness is "feedback " commonly known outside the workplace as fishing for compliments whenever jonathan copulsky got out of a meeting with one former boss the man would ask "how did i do " and if mr copulsky said "you were really good " his boss would say "what were some of the really good things i did " it was all his boss would say in the interest of improving his performance "so next time " mr copulsky recalls him saying "i can be even better " if that were true however then mr copulskys constructive criticism would have been welcome too it wasnt this would be annoying enough behavior with a co worker says rick gilkey associate professor of organizational behavior and psychiatry at emory university "but a boss creates a whole ecology around this dynamic " employees are forced to take the path of least resistance "its like nature taking the least amount of energy to accomplish a task which in this case is saying great job " says prof gilkey just because the neediness isnt always brazen hey guys wait up doesnt mean it isnt obvious john traylors former manager told his reports to call him by his first name unless someone from outside the organization were present in that case "doctor" would be used "if you were to slip up and say larry he would be incensed " says mr traylor it takes only a few managers diverting multiple salaried staffers for some all expenses paid ego trip to hurt the bottom line when the boss of one former cosmetic executive accompanied her to a trade show in italy one year typical market research was scratched "her biggest concern was getting her hair blown " she says she tried to ditch her at the salon but her boss said "youre not leaving me alone are you " then they had to go shopping for sweaters and miniskirts spending roughly seven hours shopping on a three day trip that cost about &# in airfare and lodging "we never discussed business " that adds up "its a huge drain on time energy and money " says maryanne murray who once worked with an impeccably dressed boss who would have "severe panic attacks" minutes before any presentation "what are you wearing " shed ask ms murray by phone it was ms murrays job to make sure all the extra people her boss invited to make her look part of a big team had something to say "they basically were props " she says michelle hirsch worked with an attorney who once discovered his fly was unzipped in the courtroom and made it her responsibility to ensure that didnt happen again equally important was informing him if he was too heavy handed with his cologne which meant sniffing him even if he was doused enough to burst into flames "i would always say youre fine " remembers ms hirsch "i remember thinking there is no way any of my friends are having to do this for their boss " she says email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
