global economy medical ills thwart insurers in china hong kong for years the chinese government tended to the health of its people offering basic but near universal coverage but as the country opened up to the outside world and embraced capitalism that health care safety net was all but dismantled now most chinese are left to fend for themselves paying out of pocket when they get sick savings are regularly wiped out by illness the government is struggling to find a solution and may have a partial answer in private health insurance coverage for those who can afford it the problem is that as in other developing countries a loosely regulated health care system marred by rampant overprescription and other shortcomings is slowing the development of private medical insurance in china that in turn is limiting beijings options as it strives to rebuild the system although major multinational insurers have begun to enter the chinese health insurance market they remain largely on the sidelines "this is not a profitable business " says clarence s f wong head of economic research and consulting in asia for swiss reinsurance co the worlds largest reinsurer by premiums "there is huge demand in the market but insurance companies are very conservative " the chinese life insurance arm of american international group inc which also sells health insurance is the most significant foreign player with an estimated of the market the new york financial services company offers health coverage for between yuan and yuan &# and &# for every yuan of coverage depending on the insured persons age but the companys health insurance business accounts for just or so of premiums collected by aigs life insurance arm in china according to bonnie wu a spokeswoman for aig in hong kong she declined to comment on whether aigs chinese health insurance business is profitable "at the moment our business focus in china remains on life insurance and retirement products " ms wu said although the chinese health insurance business remains small compared with life insurance a market estimated at &# billion in demand is growing quickly partly because of rising incomes in urban areas the health insurance market grew nearly sixfold between and when the chinese spent &# billion on private insurance according to a report by swiss re which the company said it conducted at the chinese governments request swiss re says that sum could rise to &# billion by even growth on that scale would fall short of the countrys need for coverage only about of urban chinese and of rural chinese are enrolled in a health insurance program according to a ministry of health survey cited in the swiss re report at the heart of the businesss unattractive economics in china is overprescription in the u s and some other developed countries insurers negotiate with hospitals through middlemen to cap costs based on specific diagnoses not actual expenses the reimbursement for treating flu for example might be fixed at &# in china the network of state run hospitals calls the shots because doctors and hospitals rely on prescription drugs to boost their income it is difficult for insurers to manage costs recently xiao ming years old brought her feverish three year old son to see the doctor at a small hospital in jiangsu province that derives most of its revenue from drug sales dr zhu bin told her the boy probably had a bad cold and sold her an antibiotic injection for yuan in most developed countries that would be an unusual treatment for the sort of infection the boy appeared to have dr zhu says he prescribes and sells drugs to nine out of every people who walk in the door he says that the child needed the drug and that the hospitals prices are reasonable at best private health insurance would be a partial fix for what ails chinas health system hundreds of millions of the countrys rural poor have little if any extra money to spend on health care beijing is considering greatly increasing public spending on health care money that could go into state run hospitals and toward a public insurance program but a robust private health insurance system could relieve some of that cost burden in its report swiss re suggested a raft of changes to promote the spread of private health insurance including opening up the business to more middlemen who could help broker cheaper prices for drugs and services between insurers and hospitals "the swiss re study proposes some worthwhile strategies for our review of chinas medical insurance system " chen wenhui assistant chairman of the china insurance regulatory commission said in a statement issued by the company after the reports release the commission didnt reply to written questions seeking more information john tucci head of general insurance consulting in north asia for global consulting firm watson wyatt worldwide says the overprescription problem is prevalent in a number of developing countries "you go into a hospital you go for just a basic test and the hospital or the doctors just want to do every test under the sun because they can claim it from the insurance " he said because of the sectors many problems mr tucci says it isnt clear if the health insurance products being offered in china are profitable although he says he suspects they arent however mr tucci sees huge potential for growth down the line "it is a market that is going to boom at some point in time " he says among multinational insurers prudential plc like aig offers certain types of health insurance products in china but life insurance remains its main business in the country "the need for health protection is increasing with living standards and we believe the potential is large " says howard green a spokesman in hong kong for the british company which sells health insurance in china through a joint venture with the state run citic group prudential wouldnt comment in detail on the economics of selling the insurance chinese companies currently dominate the countrys fledgling health insurance market ping an insurance group co controlled of the market in and says its health insurance business is profitable still the companys main business is life insurance according to yang yi xian a general manager who deals with health insurance at the company in ping an had billion yuan in total revenue of which less than billion yuan came from health coverage "the conditions in the hospital limit our product development " mr yang says "when the doctors see oh you have insurance they will prescribe many many medicines for the patients "
