nobody is untouchable karinna moskalenko is russias most distinguished human rights lawyer vladimir putin wants her disbarred ms moskalenko is the founder of the moscow based international protection center for more than a decade she has been arguing cases before the european court of human rights in strasbourg france to whose judgments russia has been legally bound ever since it incorporated the european convention on human rights in its constitution "we started with dozens of cases " she says recalling the ipcs earliest days during the yeltsin era "we are now dealing with hundreds of cases " today her clients include the imprisoned former yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov and the family of murdered journalist anna politkovskaya she also represents the victims of the "nord ost" moscow theater hostage crisis and the relatives of chechen civilians who have been tortured murdered or disappeared in russian "counterterrorism" operations with its minuscule staff of eight lawyers and trainees the ipc receives roughly requests for representation a year though most lack adequate documentation to be brought to trial still her current caseload in strasbourg totaling about represents the lions share of the courts docket and she knows how to get results her victory in the kalashnikov case involving a man who had been held in pre trial detention for five years in cramped and disease ridden conditions forced the russian government to embark on its first serious attempt at modernizing its prison system such work has earned ms moskalenko no shortage of formal tributes outside of russia in she was elected to the international commission of jurists in she won the international helsinki federations human rights recognition award within russia its a different story mr putins government assault on the ipc began by questioning the validity of its original registration next it proceeded to a tax audit a favorite putin tactic against financially strapped human rights ngos on the theory that the ipc had used funds from the national endowment for democracy and the ford and macarthur foundations for profit taking though the governments claims were easily disproven it refuses formally to close the case but for sheer chutzpah nothing approaches the governments attempts to disbar ms moskalenko on the grounds that she has incompetently represented mr khodorkovsky a remarkable bit of solicitude for a man whose sentence to a siberian prison camp has just been extended according to a motion filed april by the prosecutor generals office with the russian registration service ms moskalenko failed her client in february when she was forced to leave a lawyers conference with mr khodorkovsky a day early to attend to her sick year old son "this motion has been decided at a high level though we dont know who exactly ordered it " says ms moskalenko prosecutor general yuri chaika was until last year mr putins minister of justice the story of what happened to ms moskalenko on that visit to siberia is worth telling if only for the light it sheds on the governments efforts by turns petty and sinister to harass her and her team on feb she arrived at moscows domodedovo airport to discover that the rest of her legal team had been "detained" by police and interior ministry officials who seized their passports ransacked their luggage and inspected confidential documents related to cases before the strasbourg court including mr khodorkovskys before allowing them to board the plane on her return ms moskalenko was again detained by officials who forced her to sign papers forbidding her from disclosing the details of the governments new case against mr khodorkovsky on account of her son whose ill health the authorities were aware of she signed ms moskalenko speculates that the current disbarment action stems from the legal fuss she raised about the incidents at the airport "after i complained to the prosecutor general they reconsidered what to do about me they stopped abusing me at the airports instead they decided to finish my career " the motion will first have to wind its way through a special committee of the moscow bar but failing that the government can file for her disbarment in court "theres no precedent that i know of for this " she says "they will make an experiment of me " disbarment would effectively put an end to ms moskalenkos career in russia including her efforts the latest as recently as yesterday to defend mr kasparovs political activities in court it would also require her to seek approval from the presidency of the strasbourg court every time she sought to bring a case to trial just the sort of humiliation in which mr putins government delights yet its the broader ramifications of the governments actions that most concern ms moskalenko while she scrupulously avoids mentioning mr putin by name "i am strictly not a politician " she says more than once she is under no illusions about his methods in todays russia "it isnt necessary to put all the businessmen in jail it is necessary to jail the richest the most independent the most well connected it isnt necessary to kill all the journalists just kill the most outstanding the bravest and the others will get the message nobody is untouchable i tell kasparov look you are not untouchable " for now however it is ms moskalenko herself who is in mr putins sights a dangerous place to be given the experience of so many of her clients characteristically she isnt budging robert amsterdam a canadian lawyer on mr khodorkovskys defense team recalls that when he was arrested in september by russian security services she was the first person he called "these thugs from the secret police wouldnt give us their ids " he says "so karinna takes her cell phone and clicks their pictures the woman is completely fearless and theres nothing that scares these people more than someone who is fearless someone who puts principle above safety or social standing " mr amsterdams story is a testament to the courage and tenacity of a woman in the face of a regime whose threats must never be taken lightly one wonders whether condoleezza rice now in moscow to meet with mr putin can show if shes made of the same stuff raising ms moskalenkos case would be a start
