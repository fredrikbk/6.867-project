enterprise small dairies profit from a resurgence of home deliveries firms that held out in tough times see payoff in higher sales returning to your doorstep the milkman as american consumers rush toward healthier home grown foods the old fashioned trade of home milk delivery is making a comeback in pockets around the country and that appetite for wholesome fare coupled with rising gas prices is giving an unexpected marketing boost to some tiny dairies and local milk distributors helping them compete against larger rivals who saturate store shelves one is crescent ridge dairy inc in sharon mass a small third generation family dairy that still processes and delivers its own brand of hormone free milk in old fashioned glass bottles placing them in white steel boxes outside customers homes started in crescent ridge has stood its ground in recent decades even as consumer purchasing shifted to mainstream retail and many small delivery dairies shuttered or were sold it has since padded profits by expanding to deliver more items than milk the success of crescent ridge and others like it illustrates the potential payoff of a relatively simple if sometimes difficult to execute strategy pushing through a long uphill stretch in the business cycle "this dairy made it through the dip they stuck it out when everyone else gave up " says seth godin marketing blogger and author of a new book called "the dip " "suddenly their milk isnt a commodity its special " the milkman was still a familiar sight as recently as the s when home delivery accounted for roughly of all milk sales according to the international dairy foods association based in washington d c but in the s tough times came thanks to a confluence of events including ready access to milk in grocery and convenience stores and the spread of ultra pasteurization technology which gave milk a longer shelf life today only about of all milk sales are through home delivery according to global industry analysts inc a san jose calif based market research publisher for its part crescent ridge believing its core business was strong took advantage of the difficulties by purchasing the trucks customer lists and assets

health benefits whats more the milkmen and glass bottles are now a core marketing asset a nostalgic chit that distinguishes crescent ridge products from competitors "right now of our revenue is through home delivery " says chief executive mark parrish whose grandparents first delivered crescent ridge milk in a chevrolet milk truck "without a question it drives our business " but the lure has helped the company expand in other ways its products sell in retail outlets such as whole foods and hannaford it takes delivery orders via the web and runs its own dairy bar selling ice cream and other milk products crescent ridge isnt alone there are home delivery dairies and distribution services big and small from connecticut to california that are seeing stronger demand some have old roots

seller is the nostalgic half gallon glass bottle of milk that mr rubino gets from byrne dairy in upstate new york older customers remember the glass bottles fondly and want convenience mr rubino says while younger families are more interested in buying locally and making sure their foods dont have unnecessary additives or hormones "we were lucky and got on a particular trend at the right time " he says in addition to milk hudson milk also delivers items like cream organic eggs yogurt and poland spring water for a flat delivery fee of &# which has boosted his average order to &# at crescent ridge mr parrish says getting the average ticket order up has been key and one of his best tools is the web where customers can tweak their orders up until midnight on the day of delivery today some of customers order online and the average web order is higher than non web orders the company says its investing &# to overhaul and upgrade its web site in the next six months one of the dairys newest
