beijing olympics in china sports stars face hurdles in the race for ad riches beijing last month liu wei the captain of chinas national basketball team lost his chance to star in a chinese coke ad he had the talent mr liu averaged points a game last season with the shanghai sharks the former team of yao ming center for the national basketball associations houston rockets the deal breaker was a fight over who owns the rights to his image mr liu or the government run china basketball association coca cola co had already paid the association to use top players in its chinese ads but mr lius agent thought his client deserved a separate fee for his two day commercial shoot with two teammates "we went around and around and eventually they dropped him out " says mr lius agent terry rhoads managing director of zou marketing a sports marketing consultancy in shanghai "it isnt about the money it is about respect " a coke spokesman says the companys understanding is that mr liu had "other commitments to his team" that made him unavailable a creaking socialist system of state control over athletic careers is stunting the growth of sports marketing in china that is proving a problem for athletes like mr liu who often have no control over how their image is used ahead of the beijing games it is also a headache for advertisers counting on chinese sports heroes to help them grab market share in chinas fast growing consumer market so far beijings games have official sponsors and suppliers including coke adidas ag visa international inc and lenovo group ltd compared to at the games in athens over the next months more than &# billion will be spent on ads in china featuring olympic themes estimates mindshare wpp group plcs media buying agency in china athletes enter into government run training programs as kids with the promise that they will be taken care of for life even if that promise isnt always fulfilled in exchange they sign over much their earnings and a great deal of decision making power to chinas sports federations the olympics in athens marked a turning point when sports stars gained newfound value for chinas advertising industry now tied with the u k for the worlds third largest after the u s and japan in ad spending for advertisers getting access to athletes could prove difficult as officials want to focus on training them to win medals in november chinas top sports minister liu peng sent ripples through the marketing industry by suggesting to a beijing newspaper that in order to keep athletes focused on training for the games he would ban them from "social activities " that has been widely interpreted in china to include advertising and public relations work officials from chinas general administration of sports didnt reply to a request for clarification chinas sports officials have flexed their muscles before when diver tian liang won two olympic gold medals in athens in the marketing deals rolled in that riled chinese sports officials who accused him of engaging in too many commercial activities and then suspended him from the national team earlier this year he quit the team and he wont compete in the games murky rules make it difficult for advertisers anxious to work with chinese athletes "brands dont know where to go or how to do it " says phil de picciotto the president of the athletes and personalities practice at octagon a sports marketing division of interpublic group of companies inc "the battle lines are being drawn over who controls the decision making power of athletes " in china coaches and talent agents are usually one and the same for instance liu xiang a runner who shot to fame in his home country after his surprise gold medal in the meter hurdles in athens is managed by the chinese athletic association about half the money he makes goes to the athletic association his coach agents working between the federation and marketers and his former team only a sports federation "knows best how to keep or maintain the athletes good performance which is regarded as the key value for the sports stars " says wang dawei the vice president and treasurer of the caa "if liu xiang didnt become an olympic champion in athens if he didnt even break the world record he wouldnt have such high commercial value today " so brands have had to develop relationships with sports federations to gain access to their stars adidas has been working with chinese federations for years "we have a very deep rooted relationship with coaches and we have our own scouts within china to help us identify up and coming athletes " says marcus kam adidass senior manager of sports marketing in china for advertisers concerned about getting a return on their endorsement investment coaches and government bureaucrats can make challenging partners scheduling time with some chinese athletes can take months of planning and sponsors that pay as much as &# million to be associated with liu xiang arent even allowed access to him for ad shoots or appearances at their events just to get him once a year for a commercial shoot they need to pony up nearly &# million there are no hard rules about when and how athletes have to go through their federations or whether they can use individual agents and some truly global chinese stars have the power to make their own rules only two chinese athletes qualify as marketing superstars one is mr yao the " center for the rockets the other is the gold medal winning hurdler liu xiang mr yao has his own agents in the u s and mr liu whose career is primarily managed by the athletic association is nonetheless able to command more endorsement money than other athletes even companies that know the ropes trip up in mr yao sued coca cola because the company used his image on packaging in china without his permission coke had an endorsement deal with the cba to which mr yao still belongs allowing it to use the images of three players in ads but mr yao who had largely escaped the chinese system by joining the nba had a separate personal endorsement deal with pepsico inc in november coke apologized publicly and mr yao withdrew his lawsuit in beijing numerous brands display images of mr yao and liu xiang on billboards and in tv ads it is so hard to keep track that according to a recent survey by marketing consultancy r and csm media research more than times as many chinese consumers think mr yao works for nike inc as for adidass reebok brand which spent around &# million for his world wide endorsement yet marketers say working with the overexposed mr yao and liu xiang remains worthwhile because their achievements tap into a powerful force chinese national pride "the only people with real value are those who have international fame they represent the potential of china " says tom doctoroff the north asia ceo of wpp ad agency jwt basketball player yi jianlian who earlier this year declared his eligibility for junes nba draft is quickly earning those international credentials and has endorsement deals with nike and amway corp for basketball player liu weis agent mr rhoads who once worked for nike building a sports marketing industry is a long term project "we are trying to bring a little bit of discipline and planning to how some of chinas top athletes are marketed " he says sue feng and mei fong in beijing and adam
