flirtations "im afraid you might have gps " he protests the cellphone convinces mr bin laden that it is safe to hold only to betray the terrorist to u s troops in the final frame "this is an unfortunate end " mr bin laden wistfully concludes "all i wanted was to be a man a man who loved a phone " the quickcomic cast isnt a comprehensive catalog of the political scene but it makes up for some of its shortcomings by mixing the real with the absurd caricatures of president bush sen barack obama secretary of state condoleezza rice sen john kerry and bill and hillary clinton rub cartoon elbows with the smiling cellphone a nervous looking bull a spunky character named kid chicken and what may or may not be mr bin laden disguised as santa claus add in an elephant a donkey and mahmoud ahmadinejad and the quickcomic menagerie adds up to a comic goldmine "were trying to keep our character palate as balanced as possible " says year old eric socolofsky leader of the three man creative team behind the site which he calls a hobby the unrefined visual aesthetic is meant to have a "clip art" sensibility he says drawing inspiration from popular online comics like "get your war on" and "red meat " mr socolofsky and his partners plan to roll out drawings of sen john mccain former sen john edwards former new york mayor rudy giuliani and other presidential candidates in the coming weeks along with additional pop culture icons and original characters alex eben meyer the sites year old illustrator and designer sees the cartooning template as a way to let anyone "stage mini debates very mini mind you in a comic format " what makes quickcomic work is its streamlined interface "drawing" a four panel comic strip is as simple as navigating a pc desktop in this era of do it yourself viral media quickcomic helps open the satirical field to anyone with a witty barb and a few minutes of free time the process begins with four empty panels just beneath this canvass is an illustration selector with the characters to place a character inside a panel simply click an illustration and drag it to the desired location once in place a speech bubble pops up if left blank the bubble will vanish to edit a frame just click on the character and choose from a small toolbar of options that allows you to enlarge the drawing add a speech bubble or remove the figure entirely the hardest part is writing witty dialogue the comic creating functionality is simplified but it also narrows creative choices the drawings must be anchored against either side of the frame must face inward and cant be altered or rotated also the system wont allow more than two figures in a frame visitors are free to create their own comics but must register with an email address and password to save a completed work in the quickcomic gallery the best comics as judged by the votes of other registered users and the sites editors can be found in two special galleries an early incarnation of the site launched just in time for the midterm elections but the new and improved interface didnt appear until april the creators hashed out their hobby project over beers in brooklyn n y where they live work on the site happens slowly whenever the partners have spare time in between their paying jobs mr socolofsky develops educational games for gamelab mr meyer is a free lance illustrator who regularly publishes drawings in the new york times and the third partner ahmad saeed creates financial software for a hedge fund and produces electronic music their goal in part was to manufacture a new user generated internet trend "i wanted to try working on a viral web project " says year old mr saeed who designed the quickcomic database for mr socolofsky who thought up the concept quickcomic is a tool for expression "ive taken part in protests both physically and digitally " he says although these experiences often left him feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with quickcomic mr socolofscy envisioned something "a bit lighter a bit humorous and a bit more approachable " despite this political aim early comic creators havent focused exclusively on political topics "id say we mostly see people being ridiculous and apolitical " says mr socolofsky of the more than comics on the site so far "of the rest id say it leans to the left but we dont encourage people to express one kind of political view or another " whats missing is a massive user base an average day sees new comics added to the site and some unique visitors mr saeed reports but one in four visitors is a returning user meaning quickcomic is slowly accumulating a small core of devotees quickcomics latest upgrade allows users to embed any comic in a gallery in an outside web site "sort of like youtube " mr socolofsky suggests the creators hope this portability will increase quickcomics visibility on blogs and other social networking sites driving traffic back to their site visitors should be prepared for an anything goes environment the quickcomic gallery isnt monitored though the creators plan to add a function that will allow users to flag inappropriate content political themes quasi anonymous users and killer robots is it a recipe for offensive material "not really " mr socolofsky says "and im actually very surprised " "you sound a little let down " mr saeed adds "there are some that are mildly offensive but i havent seen any hate comics " "there is a little bit of hate " mr meyer admits write to aaron rutkoff at aaron rutkoff wsj com
