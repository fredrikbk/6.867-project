after pact to shed chrysler daimler turns focus to other challenges after nearly a decade of trying to be both german and american daimlerchrysler ag is going back to its roots starting with its new name daimler ag with its decision to reduce its stake in chrysler to just under the stuttgart germany company is giving up its ambitions of being a car maker present in every segment of the market daimlerchrysler sells million vehicles a year making it the worlds fifth biggest car maker in sales volume without chrysler daimlers sales will fall to around million less than those of frances renault sa the worlds no auto maker in terms of vehicle sales a leaner daimler will aim to emulate the success of its smaller longtime rival bmw ag a feat many industry analysts think is achievable given the strength of daimlers premium mercedes brand bmw has posted strong results since selling its mass market rover car unit in and concentrating on its premium car business including the mini and rolls royce brands "with chrysler leaving the group the risk profile of this entire company is going to be much more favorable " says michael raab an analyst with sal oppenheim in frankfurt mr raab and other analysts say daimler will be able to concentrate on its strengths in engineering premium cars and commercial trucks and will no longer be burdened by a u s vehicle business where discount battles rising gasoline prices and high health care costs have taken a toll and contributed to chryslers billion euros &# billion operating loss last year in announcing the deal yesterday daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche highlighted another potential benefit that it makes his company less vulnerable to a hostile takeover chryslers woes had dragged down the companys share price and spurred takeover speculation "were much more in control of our destiny than we have been " mr zetsche said still analysts say the strong cash flow mercedes generates could spur interest from private equity buyers unlike other german car makers such as volkswagen ag porsche ag and bmw ag daimlerchrysler has no major family shareholder acting as a buffer against hostile investors its biggest shareholder is the emirate of kuwait which has a stake by contrast at bmw the quandt family owns roughly of bmw stock at porsche members of the porsche and piech clans own of the voting shares and have recently used that clout to buy an indirect stake in volkswagen in the form of a stake held by the sports car maker volkswagen has also long enjoyed the protection of the german state of lower saxony which owns around of vw by retaining an approximately stake in the new chrysler company mr zetsche said daimler would be able to enjoy the maximum benefits of continuing cooperation with chrysler but have less of the risk an automotive council will be formed between chrysler and daimler to examine current and future joint projects daimlerchrysler said it would take the proposed name change to shareholders mr zetsches renewed focus on mercedes is likely to sharpen the competition between mercedes and rivals including bmw and toyota motor corp s lexus division since returning to germany in september from auburn hills mich where he was president of the chrysler unit mr zetsche has had to divide his time between overseeing the parent company and steering mercedes out of a huge profit slump that resulted from quality problems with its cars and persistent losses at smart a maker of tiny premium cars that belongs to the division more recently mercedes has weathered weak demand in germany its biggest market following a steep increase in the countrys value added tax this year although mercedes has returned to profitability accounting for more than of daimlerchryslers operating profit last year the durability of the divisions turnaround faces a test in august with the u s launch of the new version of its c class sedan the brands best selling model some analysts say mr zetsche could squeeze more profits out of mercedes by putting a tighter lid on spending mr zetsche has acknowledged a tendency among mercedes engineers to load up cars with frills that many customers dont even notice on some new models he noted in a speech last year mercedes offers up to different kinds of door handles "every new mercedes vehicle is used as an excuse to invent something new " says stephen cheetham of sanford c bernstein ltd in london christian breitsprecher of bhf bank in frankfurt says mr zetsche will make big strides toward reversing that tendency and boost mercedess margins in with the launch of the next e class sedan a vehicle that is expected to share more components with the c class than previous generations another business that stands to gain more management attention is daimlers commercial truck division though better known for its mercedes and chrysler units daimlerchrysler is also a major manufacturer of commercial trucks with a product range stretching from freightliner long haul trucks to thomas built school buses the division posted record profits last year though its earnings are expected to slip this year as new emissions standards take effect in the u s damping demand not all industry analysts are equally enthusiastic about daimlers prospects without chrysler mark warnsman of prudential equity group llc in new york says the company should follow toyotas model for success with its premium lexus brand lexuss design and manufacturing operations are tightly integrated with those of toyotas mass market car business allowing both sides to save money and develop products more quickly "as painful as it may be for the mercedes purists to accept mercedes is going to need chrysler " mr warnsman said in a research note earlier this year mr zetsches supporters note he has already pushed the companys german and american halves to share know how one of his first acts after taking charge of mercedes was to institute a new rule requiring managers to solve defects within a few weeks or report them directly to his office the practice intended to keep quality problems from festering is one chrysler has followed for years moreover merger critics argue the company shouldnt have had to spend &# billion the sum it paid for chrysler in to learn new skills christoph rauwald contributed to this article
