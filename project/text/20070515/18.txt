bloc party in ukraine a friend of russia stages sweeping political makeover kiev ukraine viktor yanukovich prime minister of this strategically important nation wedged between russia and the west has undergone one of the most extreme makeovers in global politics just two years ago the russian backed machine politician was a pariah in the west after he claimed victory in the presidential elections which were marred by fraud and a brutal poisoning that left his opponent disfigured only the subsequent mass street protests of the so called orange revolution forced him to accept a redo of the vote which he lost today mr yanukovich years old is locked once more in a struggle for supremacy with the pro western orange leader who beat him president viktor yushchenko but this time the thousands of protesters occupying kievs independence square for the past month flew not orange but the blue colors of mr yanukovichs party of the regions and the red and hot pink of his allies the communists and socialists they dispersed only when mr yanukovich defused the crisis by agreeing to hold new elections for the second time in as many years after his rival dissolved parliament with backing from a billionaire metals baron and political coaching from u s sen bob doles former campaign strategist mr yanukovich was re elected as prime minister last year he has positioned himself as a champion of rule of law and democratic values a visitor to washington brussels and davos as well as moscow mr yanukovichs comeback is further evidence on top of the gaza strip iraq and kyrgyzstan that the free elections encouraged by the u s dont guarantee winners who favor u s goals or even western style democracy ukraine is adding a fresh twist to the lesson as mr yanukovich adopts the language and institutions of democracy to shed the anti western and antidemocratic image that cost him the election years ago gone is mr yanukovichs bouffant hairdo a favorite of soviet apparatchiks so too are the russian advisers and televised meetings with president vladimir putin that characterized his election campaign though the russian lower house of parliament or duma has issued two statements supporting him in the current power struggle he says he wants to be the ukrainian leader who starts membership talks with the european union he even polished his ukrainian which he now speaks in public instead of his first language russian "time changes people even viktor feodorovich yanukovich " said mr yushchenko in an interview "but the test is in his decisions and actions " he added accusing mr yanukovich of trying to "usurp" power mr yanukovich declined to be interviewed for this story how far his makeover goes has implications far beyond ukraine this nation of million is split by history and language and remains divided over whether to embrace the west or russia ukraine transports of russian natural gas exports to the european union and is key to the energy security of the eus &# trillion economy moscow increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive with its neighbors sees ukraine as vital to its own security economic interests and regional influence historically eastern ukraine mr yanukovichs power base is closely linked to russia and most people in the region are native russian speakers president yushchenko is stronger in predominantly ukrainian speaking central and western ukraine which tilts toward western europe the current crisis began on april when president yushchenko dissolved ukraines parliament or rada and called for early elections he accused his old rival of engineering a creeping coup by coaxing legislators to defect from other parties to give mr yanukovich the votes he needs to change the constitution after a monthlong struggle for power in which mr yushchenko fired three judges prime minister yanukovich earlier this month agreed to new elections but the two men left it to parliament to negotiate a date and last week mr yushchenko said he would impose a date if none was settled soon threatening a further showdown opinion polls suggest the party of the regions will get the most votes as it did last year yet mr yushchenkos tough action in dissolving parliament and seizing back power is expected to bring some disillusioned orange voters back to the fold making the contest tight both viktors claim the legal high ground but the moral clarity of the orange revolution era has dissipated "im absolutely disappointed in the way things have turned out " said vitaly kutovenko a year old banker as he sipped a beer in the food court of the glitzy globus mall beneath independence square where mr yanukovichs supporters were protesting "most people are " many ukrainians were euphoric after the orange revolution and hoped it would end the corrupt autocracy that had ruled the country since it became independent of the former soviet union in then president leonid kuchma and his entourage of business "clans" had carved up the proceeds of privatization between them when mr yanukovich in november claimed victory in presidential elections later ruled fraudulent hundreds of thousands of ukrainians poured into the streets of kiev setting up camps of pup tents to protest in below freezing temperatures mr kuchma and his anointed candidate mr yanukovich agreed to fresh elections provided the constitution was changed to transfer some of the presidents powers to parliament the shock of losing the rerun elections which were held in december hit mr yanukovich hard according to advisers and friends he found himself in opposition for the first time in his political career and has said his children had to flee the country to escape harassment in the past ukrainians in opposition had suffered media blackouts arbitrary prosecution a suspiciously high rate of fatal accidents one murder by decapitation and in mr yushchenkos case dioxin poisoning that poisoning turned mr yushchenkos face into a mask of pustules and made him sick in the interview he said the effects of the poisoning reached their peak at the beginning of and required constant treatment that was a full year after he took office as president a lost period in which economic growth collapsed as the orange leaders fought among themselves mr yushchenko now revived and showing a new energy and ruthlessness said he knows who poisoned him though he wont name names he said he expects prosecutors to bring charges soon mr yanukovich for his part says a year in opposition he published a book with that title taught him the value of a free press and tolerant democracy "he really took it deep into his conscience that he needs to understand what happened in the orange revolution and what should be changed in his own mentality " said konstantin gryshchenko a former ukrainian foreign minister and now a foreign affairs adviser to mr yanukovich it isnt the first time the former engineer has reinvented himself growing up near donetsk in eastern ukraine mr yanukovich lost his mother at a young age and was brought up by his grandmother he ran wild and landed in jail twice for assault convictions in his late teens out of jail mr yanukovich was taken under the wing of former soviet astronaut georgi beregovoi he began a rapid rise in the tough world of post soviet politics becoming governor of the donetsk region in and prime minister in before the orange revolution cut him short yet he was by no means washed up politically after his electoral defeat his rock solid support in the east won him of the vote in the presidential election things brightened dramatically for him in september after the president fired his prime minister yulia tymoshenko breaking up the orange coalition as mr yanukovich prepared for parliamentary elections due the following spring one of his key backers rinat akhmetov a billionaire metals magnate from donetsk recommended he hire paul manafort who had worked on then sen doles presidential campaign mr manafort now a prominent washington lobbyist had been advising mr akhmetov as he explored taking his business scm holdings public on western financial markets with another election fast approaching mr manafort declined in an interview to talk about the specifics of the campaign advice he gave mr yanukovich but according to people involved in the party of the regions campaign in spring mr manafort advised on such basics as how to target and appeal to voters he also produced a slick campaign film and coached mr yanukovich on his presentation "this is a person who is now his own man for his own time " said mr manafort noting that in mr yanukovich served under an all powerful president mr kuchma and had limited latitude "his vision is to have a relationship with ukraines historic neighbors while integrating with the west over the longer term like nixon to china hes the only national leader who can do that " the makeover has affected more than mr yanukovichs campaign style ambassadors in kiev say that during his previous stint as prime minister he shied away from contact with foreign diplomats and the media now he invites briefings and questions speaking ukrainian even when addressed in russian he pushed through legislation to take ukraine into the world trade organization and has promised to pursue a free trade agreement with the european union in one example of his new openness he invited eight local journalists to his home this past march he talked about how he used to race cars until his favorite was a three liter ford escort and about meeting his wife when she dropped a brick on her foot making deliveries to a factory they even discussed his two spells in jail a taboo subject the media were once banned from discussing "we were wrong not to talk about that " said hanna herman mr yanukovichs communications chief "he didnt go to jail because he was a terrible criminal but because he was a young kid on the street with no parents " yet some things about the prime minister may not have changed a report released last month by the council of europe the continents human rights watchdog noted growing complaints of arbitrary police raids and harassment of journalists since mr yanukovichs coalition government took power it also noted the reinstatement of discredited old regime officials such as the head of the central election commission who oversaw and approved the fraudulent presidential vote mr yanukovich didnt address the reports criticisms but praised the resolution to which the report was attached which called for ukraines constitutional court to decide whether mr yushchenkos dissolution of parliament was legal initially mr yanukovich didnt have enough allies to form a government after last springs elections when the party of the regions became the largest in parliament but as the orange faction squabbled a key coalition member the socialist party defected orange politicians have alleged mr yanukovichs backers paid the socialists &# million to switch sides both he and the socialists say no money changed hands after taking office last august mr yanukovich began to tussle with the president over important powers that werent transferred under the deal he quickly reversed mr yushchenkos policy on the north atlantic treaty organization halting ukraines efforts to join the western military alliance in january he pushed through a law stripping the president of his right to appoint the prime minister foreign minister and defense minister as well as regional governors for mr yushchenko the last straw came in march when legislators defected to mr yanukovich from the presidents our ukraine party and ms tymoshenkos bloc many were businessmen in a political system where all parties sell parliamentary seats to businessmen who want protection and access to the sale of state assets the new blood brought mr yanukovich closer to the votes he needs in the seat parliament to override presidential vetoes or amend the constitution accepting the defectors "was a mistake " says taras chornovil a legislator who ran mr yanukovichs doomed campaign for the presidential rerun and whose father an opposition leader died in a suspicious car crash in "we should have known how yushchenko would react " he said mr yushchenko dissolved parliament alleging that the defectors were bribed and re formed the orange coalition with ms tymoshenko mr yanukovich declared the move illegal and called thousands of supporters into the streets "we cant have a president who breaks the constitution " said one of them leonid yermuraki a year old veteran of the soviet war in afghanistan "the president only represents one part of the country his people in the west " mr yermuraki was the leader of camp feodosiya a group of tents just opposite the government building in kiev he had people here on rotation from the eponymous coastal town in crimea a fiercely pro russia area of ukraine food medical care flags and matching raincoats were centrally provided he said proudly each morning his charges joined thousands to march down to independence square to listen to speeches and pop music most of the protesters have since gone home but in their echoes of the orange protests they helped mr yanukovichs makeover the party of the regions was "deeply wounded when the people threw them out" and needed to have its own version of the orange revolution said vladislav kaskiv leader of the pora youth movement which played a central role in the protests hes heartened that people like mr yanukovich now feel the need to pursue politics in public rather than in the dark as before "my mistake was thinking the orange revolution could sweep out all these business clans at once " said mr kaskiv "i was wrong its going to be an evolution "
