global economy euro zone rules play part in jeopardizing baltics gains choice of tight currency pegs superheats growth latvias central bank says its hands are tied riga latvia the tiny baltic economies of latvia estonia and lithuania have been the biggest success stories of the former soviet bloc now thanks in part to rules they have to follow to join europes common currency much of their hard won progress may be in danger a requirement that they keep the value of their currencies close to that of the euro has helped superheat the baltics already booming growth thats creating the risk of a meltdown in three countries that have spent the past decade and a half overhauling their economies according to the international monetary funds playbook "its really like a trap " says bank of latvia gov ilmars rimsevics of the requirement to keep the latvian currency the lats within close range of a target euro exchange rate he says the rule has stripped the countrys central bank of the means to rein in breakneck economic growth and rising inflation even as growth picks up in the nation euro zone economy governments in many of the countries that have joined the european union since are having second thoughts about how badly they want to belong to the currency club after years of economic upheaval many of the blocs new ex communist states are suffering reform fatigue voters and governments in countries such as poland and the czech republic are reluctant to make further sacrifices to join the euro as a result expansion of the euro zone one of the eus most important integration projects is moving a lot slower than expected legally all new eu members have to join the common currency but they first must meet certain technical requirements opening the door to years of delay so far only slovenia has joined target dates for most of the others are getting pushed back even in denmark sweden and the united kingdom the three older eu members that didnt join the euro at its launch in public opinion has hardened against the idea thats partly because until lately the euro zones economy was growing much more slowly than the economies outside it "it just doesnt seem to the public be they in britain or poland that euro zone membership is conferring any great benefits " says adam posen senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington that could change eight years after the currencys introduction prices across the euro zone are steadier and travel within it is easier the regions growth hit a six year high of last year and the imf predicts it will outpace the u s this year the rules for joining the euro set low ceilings for budget deficits and inflation countries must also hold their currencies within of a target euro rate for at least two years hoping to keep their currencies steady the baltics have chosen even more restrictive pegs further tying the hand of their own monetary policy makers latvia for instance keeps the lats within a range here on the cobblestone streets of riga latvias capital unhappiness with the currency peg is palpable inflation has outpaced wage growth squeezing ordinary citizens on a recent sunday shoppers spilled out of a shiny new six story mall in the city center kristine grindale a year old personnel manager bought two skirts she couldnt really afford "i have to work two jobs just to keep up with prices " says ms grindale she thinks latvia should stick with its own currency in a survey last year of latvians agreed the peg has also fueled a housing bubble to take advantage of low euro zone interest rates more than of latvias borrowers have opted for euro denominated loans rigas property prices shot up in making real estate here pricier than in vienna or frankfurt but the countrys central bank cant raise interest rates on euro denominated loans which limits its ability to cool the overheated market in february standard &amp poors downgraded latvias outlook to negative warning of a meltdown that could spread to estonia and lithuania which have similar imbalances soon after rumors of a potential devaluation of the lats spread through riga like wildfire foreign exchange booths across the city ran out of euros before lunchtime as latvians rushed to convert their savings since then the central bank has spent more than &lt euro&gt million &# million of its currency reserves to keep the lats within its euro peg not everyone expects latvias economy to melt down some economists forecast a protracted slowdown and a long period of deflation or generally falling prices they say latvias relatively solid public finances could protect it against a sharp slide in addition the scandinavian parent banks fueling much of the countrys credit boom are tightening lending standards which could help to moderate lending growth and consumer demand shrugging off some years of soviet central planning in the early s latvia and its baltic neighbors embraced capitalism in the extreme slashing many state subsidies abolishing most tariffs and adopting flat taxes the results double digit growth rates a tidal wave of foreign investment and entree into the world trade organization the north atlantic treaty organization and in the eu latvia pegged the lats to the euro in the european central bank which sets monetary policy for the euro zone says keeping exchange rates in step with the common currency tests whether potential members can control their economies without devaluing their currencies with the peg in place economists say that raising interest rates to cool growth and inflation is unlikely to work higher interest rates make the lats more attractive to traders and investors to prevent it from strengthening out of the peg range the central bank would have to sell more lats pumping cash into the system and further driving up inflation "latvias case is a classic example of why floating exchange rates are almost always better even for very small open economies " says barry eichengreen economics professor at the university of california at berkeley in the past similar pegged exchange rate systems led to currency crises in asia and latin america in latvias gross domestic product grew nearly and inflation neared the housing market and credit boom helped to propel the current account deficit a measure of how much a countrys spending outpaces its income to of gdp wider than the u s s of gdp one remedy would be for the government to run a big budget surplus to siphon cash out of the economy that hasnt happened a march anti inflation plan promises to tax real estate gains and curb credit growth but some economists say it is too little too late
