a canadian icon turns its glaze southward tim hortons looks to u s to expand doughnut chain first fight on dunkins turf fall river mass when tom medeiros retired from the fire department here and bought a coffee and doughnut shop he assumed his most intense battles were in his rearview mirror he was mistaken by buying a tim hortons inc franchise in the heart of dunkin donuts country mr medeiros dropped himself into one of the hottest coffee and doughnut wars on the continent "im eating sleeping and drinking this right now " says mr medeiros a brawny year old with close cropped graying hair and a chowder thick new england accent "i love it but it never really stops " in its home country of canada tim hortons claims a whopping of the coffee and baked goods market named for its late founder who was an all star defenseman for the montreal canadiens and buffalo sabres of the national hockey league the chain is so ingrained in canadas culture that the term "double double" shorthand for a hortons coffee with two creams and two sugars has its own entry in the canadian oxford dictionary but industry analysts say that in about seven years hortons will have built as many stores as canada can support so barely a year after the chain was spun off by wendys international inc hortons is ratcheting up its u s expansion currently most of its u s stores are in strongholds near the u s canada border in michigan ohio and upstate new york but by the end of hortons wants to have u s stores and perhaps more depending on if the company can make inroads in new england last year the boston area counted at least doughnut shops or one for every residents five times the national average according to npd group a port washington n y marketing information company many of those shops are dunkin donuts a unit of dunkin brands inc among u s cities only providence r i bostons smaller neighbor has more doughnut shops per capita one for every people with his square jaw and sturdy frame mr medeiros a recreational hockey player himself is reminiscent of the chains namesake he worked for years in the fire department in fall river population before retiring in around that time wendys which then owned hortons bought and renamed the areas bess eaton chain of coffee and doughnut shops it outbid dunkin by paying &# million prompting dunkin to sniff that hortons "paid a premium" for "the pleasure of competing with dunkin donuts in our heartland " hortons ceo paul house then president and chief operating officer declared it "a beachhead" in the companys efforts to build its u s business "as the number one retailer of hot and iced coffee in the united states we believe dunkin donuts is very well positioned for growth " said margie myers dunkin brands senior vice president communications in a statement "competition is always out there " hortons u s per store sales average only about two thirds as much as their canadian counterparts so far per store sales in new england are roughly half what they are at other u s stores estimates steven kron an analyst for goldman sachs earlier this month the chain posted a first quarter operating loss of &# million in its u s segment compared with an operating profit of &# in the year earlier period most of that loss was due to poor performance in new england says mr kron a recent report by credit suisse bank called the move into dunkin territory "brutal " overall though wall street is high on hortons its stock has been on a gradual rise over the past year mr medeiros wandered into a hortons one day and grabbed a brochure advertising for franchisees he had worked restaurant jobs before liked hortons food and thought he saw an opportunity after eight weeks of training in connecticut he managed three stores for a while then bought his own in february he declines to disclose the price the restaurant sits in a shopping area near a subway sandwich shop a papa ginos pizza joint and a dunkin donuts mr medeiros admits it isnt easy winning customers "people grow up with one thing they get used to it " he says referring to dunkin in style hortons is more like dunkin than starbucks as in its canadian stores hortons new england shops strive to distinguish themselves from dunkin by offering a homey place with lots of comfortable seats china mugs and cheap coffee a cup costs about cents less than at dunkin hortons advertising also tries to make the case that its doughnuts are different from the ones offered by competitors hortons has long anchored their promotions with the slogan "always fresh " referring to the fact that they make smaller batches of doughnuts throughout the day to keep a fresh supply in their pastry cases "the coffee is better than dunkins " says dick hall a retired mental health worker who lives in neighboring tiverton r i and visits mr medeiross restaurant most days "its a nice place to sit and relax " mr medeiross restaurant is open hours and he shows up each day around a m to greet the morning rush he estimates he puts in hours a week and his wife deborah and year old daughter kaitlin also work in the store while there he tries to spend as much time as possible learning customers names greeting customers no matter their age with a pat on the shoulder and an easy "hey how ah yah kid " meantime hortons is running television ads in the area and encouraging franchisees to get involved in the community mr medeiros sponsors and coaches a local youth hockey team and like other stores in canada and the u s his will pay for two local kids to attend a hortons summer camp hortons has proved itself adept at moving customers quickly through lines a problem that has plagued starbucks and unlike mcdonalds hortons has a strong association with coffee albeit with little recognition in the u s but the opportunity here is big coffee and specialty coffee drinks in the u s are one of the fastest growing and most profitable segments of the fast food industry accounting for &# billion in sales last year and growing at a year according to technomic inc a research firm in chicago carlos braga who owns three dunkin stores in fall river says the new england based giant is pushing back in the other direction by beefing up its sandwich menu and moving away from microwave preparation "when people think of coffee here they think of dunkin but hortons are the dunkin of canada so were watching them " ron joyce who became partners with mr horton in eventually took the company over and sold it to wendys in he said one day he expects there will be tim hortons across the u s "america is a big country " he said "theres a lot of room to expand " but first they have to contend with new england a market mr joyce said he wouldnt have entered last fall mr house told investors "we got our a kicked in new england" but nevertheless vowed a "good old street fight " hortons executives note that it took the chain years to establish itself in buffalo
