brazil and india dell seems poised to tap into burgeoning new markets with growth possibilities not available in more developed countries robert semple of credit suisse says dell has yet to reach its

last year mr semple says dells growing global reach makes it "well positioned for improved profitability " new directions by moving beyond its traditional direct to consumer model dell runs the risk of crimping profit margins by taking on the complexity and costs of retail distribution but the move is also an opportunity to boost sales by exposing more consumers to its products analysts say ben reitzes of ubs says he expects dell to enjoy higher sales quickly as its products begin to hit these indirect markets selling services jesse tortora at prudential equity group notes dell is shifting its focus from low end products while expanding its more profitable services business which includes extended warranties onsite support and security management mr tortora also expects dell to look for

laptop market an area where dell has historically languished due to its focus on desktop computers will require significant spending on research and development like any other computer maker selling its wares via retailers and other indirect outlets dell will also need to start building computers based on forecasts of what consumers want rather than on specific customer orders "we do not expect this to be a trivial transition " writes mr shope component costs dell has traditionally kept a very low inventory of the components needed to make its computers such as hard drives and memory chips
