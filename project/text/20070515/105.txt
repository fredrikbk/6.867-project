the pursuit of happiness seems to bring the most happiness i think you missed the point about the pursuit of happiness "getting going no satisfaction why what you have is never enough " personal journal may what makes us happy is the pursuit itself there is no viable sustainable state of actually being happy the pursuit is like a game we score points and that makes us happy having points scored against us makes us unhappy when the game is over the happiness doesnt last even when the game ends in victory instead our thoughts turn to the next game that insight became especially clear to me as i read a recent journal book review of william t vollmanns "poor people" march the surprising point gleaned from the interviews described in the book was that poor people arent nearly as unhappy as would be expected even the most impoverished among us have our pursuits a piece of tin to add to the cardboard shack might produce as much happiness to one person as a new lexus to another in either case the pursuit takes us to a better state and in both cases unhappiness begins to set in quickly if the pursuit doesnt continue to score points this leads to an important political point we should stop worrying so much about inequality in wealth and income so long as we have sufficient opportunity for social and economic mobility were all involved in the pursuit and thus more or less equally happy even though we have accumulated vastly different numbers of points richard p voss atlanta i have often felt that it was somewhat trivial to include the words "pursuit of happiness" in a document as profound as the declaration of independence however in his book "john adams" david mccullough explains that thomas jefferson had initially used the word "property" but changed it to "happiness " since at that time it was believed that property produced "happiness " so far as the "pursuit of happiness" is concerned i agree that it is a fruitless exercise happiness isnt an object to be found or achieved but a byproduct derived from proper human action instead of searching for happiness i suggest one is better advised to seek fulfillment or satisfaction john a clark ann arbor mich when all you focus on is chasing material wealth you will never be satisfied unless youre bill gates there is always someone who has more thats why its so important to invest in your spiritual well being to truly achieve satisfaction both with who you are and what you have if you visit impoverished people in third world countries youll notice they often seem happier than most americans who have far more i believe thats because they are spiritually at peace with themselves even as they continuously strive to improve their lot in life david doolittle atlanta
