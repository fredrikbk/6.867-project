auto finance bonds thriving investors pounce on gmac in wake of cerberus deal the auto sector in the corporate bond market got a lift after cerberus capital management l p said it planned to take an stake in chrysler group but many zeroed in on gmac since it is also controlled by the investment firm cerberus bought a stake of gmac from former parent general motors corp last year so called captive auto finance arms which have been deeply tied to the auto makers for decades have been a solid source of profitability for detroit even as the core fundamentals of the auto industry have withered now with the potential for slashing further costs by tying chrysler financial and gmac more closely together a marriage of two of the largest u s auto finance companies could be a key upside to the chrysler deal a chrysler spokesman referred comment to cerberus on the topic a cerberus spokesman said "no changes are planned at this time " gmac spokeswoman toni simonetti said that cerberuss intention to add chrysler to its large portfolio "underscores its continued strong interest in the auto and auto finance arena " gmac bonds were the most actively traded in the high yield bond market with its notes due trading at points or cents on the dollar up from friday the companys notes due rose point to according to online corporate bond trading platform marketaxess the auto sector overall

surprise him if cerberus used the gmac platform to service chrysler financial receivables since chrysler financial could be left light in back office resources due to other integrations "longer term it may make sense for cerberus to use its gmac platform to originate assets as well " he said "we would view the additional revenue streams and greater asset diversity were either or both to materialize as positive to the gmac credit profile at the margin " still many analysts said it was early in the game to determine exactly how the deal could play out for gmac or its former parent gm "gms interest in gmac could benefit from cost reduction opportunities related to cerberuss broader control of chrysler financial " morgan stanley analyst jonathan steinmetz said in a research note "it is not yet clear to us how the two operations will be integrated at the corporate level and which party will capture the synergy " yet adding chrysler financial volumes through gmac has the potential to "engender sizable upside at gmac and benefit gm too " robert barry an analyst at goldman sachs said "though if cerberus owns more of chrysler financial the incentive may be to grow auto finance volume away from gmac " slm buyout effect bondholders last month burned by student lender slm corp s agreement to be purchased in a leveraged buyout may not be alone if other commercial and consumer
