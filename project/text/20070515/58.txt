global economy japans gdp report may call the tune for rates stocks yen tokyo japan is expected to report thursday that its economy expanded at a much slower pace in the first quarter than in the previous three months even so economists say the japanese economy probably grew at a respectable pace demand for japanese goods and services has been solid they say from japanese consumers and foreign buyers economists estimate that japans inflation adjusted gross domestic product the total value of goods and services produced in the country probably grew in the first quarter from the previous quarter that translates into an annualized growth rate of the figure is much slower than the fourth quarters red hot pace of from the previous quarter or on an annualized basis but the economists caution that the fourth quarter jump was an anomaly as the economy rebounded from an unusually weak third quarter economists say japans potential annual growth rate right now is somewhere between and meaning that the pace should fall within that range under normal circumstances numbers higher than that are considered strong and first quarter gdp will likely qualify as such japans first quarter growth rate is expected to beat that of the u s where the economy grew at an annualized rate of analysts say a strong annualized gdp reading one near or higher could boost the value of the yen against the dollar and other major currencies but at the same time a strong figure could hurt japanese stock and bond prices here is why a strong gdp number will help the bank of japan in its efforts to raise interest rates from their current superlow levels the banks policy rate has been at since february far below the of the u s and of the euro zone while the central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at a two day meeting that ends thursday economists say gov toshihiko fukui is increasingly concerned that japans low rates may be distorting the flow of capital such distorted flows are encouraging speculative investment in japanese real estate or fueling borrowing of yen based loans to invest in higher yielding assets abroad in an arrangement known as the carry trade carry trades as well as soaring investment in foreign bonds and stocks by japans individual investors have kept the yen weak in recent years a weak yen in turn has propped up export revenue and earnings for japanese manufacturers by making their products more competitive overseas higher domestic interest rates could mean a rebound in the yens value which would weigh on export earnings and the shares of companies dependent on them expectations that interest rates will increase steadily would also mean lower bond prices which move in the opposite direction from their yields raising interest rates has been difficult for the bank of japan because japanese consumer prices have remained weak with the latest core consumer price index declining in march from a year earlier central banks normally raise interest rates to cool down economic activity or rein in inflation and they typically cut rates to stimulate activity or prevent harmful price declines so a rate increase when prices are declining is highly unusual economists say indicators other than the consumer price index particularly those that can justify interest rate increases are becoming more important in determining what happens to japanese rates "mr fukui is beginning to place more emphasis on the pace of the gdp growth than the near term cpi movement " says takuji aida chief economist for barclays capital in tokyo "if the gdp number is above it will lead to speculation that an interest rate increase will come sooner than later " mr aida thinks the most likely timing for the next rate increase is september but bullish gdp results could move it earlier economists say the first quarter gdp data are likely to be stronger than they previously predicted thanks in part to continued expansion in exports while shipments to the u s have slowed reflecting a cooling in the american economy demand for japanese goods has been robust in the rest of asia and in europe in march exports soared from a year earlier domestic demand is also likely to have made a significant contribution to the overall economy though the increase is likely to be muted compared with the unusually strong pace of the fourth quarter after expanding at an annualized rate of in the fourth quarter private consumption probably grew more than in the first quarter "domestic consumption remained solid in the first quarter " says hiromichi shirakawa chief economist for credit suisse in tokyo "there was particularly strong spending on services like entertainment and leisure thanks to the warm weather during the winter " yesterday the finance ministry reported that japans current account surplus surged to a record in march as exports remained strong and imports fell for the first time in more than three years the surplus in the current account the broadest measure of trade in goods services and investment earnings widened to trillion yen &# billion before seasonal adjustment the ministry said that marks the third straight month of increases the increase was mainly because of a slowdown in imports which fell for the first time in months a ministry official said imports were affected by a decrease in business in asia especially china because of the lunar new year holidays the official said imports fell in march from a year earlier to trillion yen as oil prices fell crude oil prices fell in dollar denominated transactions sliding in yen denominated trading exports rose to trillion yen up for the th consecutive month partly because of yen weakness against the euro in march the euro averaged yen up from yen a year earlier economists said yen weakness will continue to support growth in the current account surplus "as long as the trend of the weak yen continues the japanese current account will remain strong underpinned by companies healthy overseas business " said yasuo yamamoto a senior economist at mizuho research institute the current account surplus for the fiscal year ended in march rose to trillion yen topping trillion yen for the first time separately the japanese central bank said corporate goods prices rose in april from a year earlier marking the biggest year to year increase since december when the index gained aprils growth marks the th straight month of increases
