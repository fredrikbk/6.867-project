discovering the real robert e lee reading the man by elizabeth brown pryor viking pages &# why should we care about robert e lee especially those of us who are unimpressed by the magnolia scented mythology of the old south and who may regard the confederate commander as a gilded traitor who deserted his country in its hour of need and put his considerable military skill in the service of a discredited racial ideology elizabeth brown pryors two fold answer in "reading the man " is that lees personal struggle over secession was emblematic of the nations torment and that the decision he came to had a profound shaping effect on the course of the civil war in april lees boss gen winfield scott offered him the command of the federal forces that were being raised to suppress the rebellion of the southern states although lee opposed secession he refused and resigned his commission to join a cause that he suspected could not succeed his decision was not inevitable forty percent of virginia born officers stayed with the union including members of lees own extended family such as john fitzgerald lee who served as judge advocate of the union army "lees dilemma was not simply a historic wrestling match between right and wrong patriotism or treachery " writes ms pryor "it stands as a critical moment in our nations pageant because it forces us to consider some very basic questions what is patriotism who commands our first loyalty can loyalty be divided and still be true it is the excruciating gray area that makes these questions universal by taking a stand and never turning back lee also teaches us that they must be faced by every individual at the moment they are summoned no matter how sure or unprepared and that the grandest theories in the world fall away at the moment of heightened instinct " ms pryor has taken an icon and given us the soul of a complex man and his turbulent age surprises abound including lees childhood in the shadow of a disgraced and vagabond father his incredible solo exploits in the mexican war and his repellent racial attitudes access to a trove of previously unpublished letters has also with happy effect enabled ms pryor to bring emotional immediacy to a man who has often seemed like a marble bust lashed to a horse a diplomat by profession she is an adviser to the commission on security and cooperation in europe ms pryor exhibits a masterly grasp of military strategy lees reputation rests of course on his battlefield prowess "that he did much with little is accepted wisdom " ms pryor writes "he has so kindled imaginations that the risk defying feats of the army of northern virginia often seem to outweigh the ultimate failure of his mission " she rightly credits him with devising some of the most daring tactical plans in the history of warfare she also notes however that his victories were so costly in the lives of his men that it often left his army too weak to deal a final blow had lee embraced a defensive war less tied to fixed points as george washington did during the revolutionary war he might have conserved his resources and worn down the yankees instead lee was always striving for the knockout that never quite connected "his penchant for aggression attack and the near impossible annihilation of the union army may have cost him the war " writes ms pryor she also notes lees complete lack of interest in leading a command in the west where the war was ultimately decided these are controversial judgments but where ms pryor is provocative she is never facile her object is not to win polemical arguments but to expose lees inner machinery to the light of day few soldiers have been so loved by their men and so respected by their adversaries ms pryor too finds lee immensely likable as a man she does not evade however the embedded racism that was typically shrugged off in earlier eras when he was treated even by northern historians as the perfect christian warrior who was so saddened by war that he even refrained from referring to yankees as "the enemy " not true this last ms pryor shows like many of his social class lee disdained slavery in the abstract yet considered african americans irredeemably inferior and bought into a self serving ideology that justified slavery as the will of god "the blacks are immeasurably better off here than in africa morally socially &amp physically " he wrote in "the painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race &amp i hope will prepare &amp lead them to better things how long their subjugation may be necessary is known &amp ordered by a wise and merciful providence " he bought and sold slaves without compunction broke up families and considered free blacks a public menace after the civil war he urged that the emancipated masses be "disposed of" apparently by deporting them to africa and replaced by white european settlers ms pryor regards lee in his political core as an elitist who embraced what she vividly terms "a sort of clarified republicanism from which the nasty scum of political factions and the tyranny of an unwelcome majority had been skimmed " lee died in seeming far older than his years history treated him exceptionally well southern apologists soon turned him into a tragic hero of the "lost cause " a kind of superman who even in failure was lifted to "a height of moral grandeur never reached by any other american " in the words of one postbellum preacher ms pryor amply demonstrates that lee was indeed a tragic figure not because the "lost cause" was a noble one it wasnt his actions she says were tied to morally indefensible values that were already questioned by many americans even in his day rather she concludes "the tragedy is that he allowed his essentially noble spirit to founder in the ignobility of his eras easy assumptions " mr bordewichs most recent book is "bound for canaan the epic story of the underground railroad americas first civil rights movement "
