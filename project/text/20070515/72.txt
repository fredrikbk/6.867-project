oxy morons it is a bad time to be in pain last week the maker of oxycontin a high strength narcotic analgesic agreed to pay &# million to settle charges of "misbranding" brought by the attorney general of west virginia "scores died as a result of oxycontin abuse and an even greater number of people became addicted " said attorney general john brownlee the drug company purdue frederick admits that its sales force underplayed the abuse potential of oxycontin and yes the company should have acted more quickly to clamp down on overpromotion and to issue strong warnings in the face of overdose deaths but the real public health damage here comes from the pitched campaign conducted by zealous prosecutors and public interest advocates to demonize the drug itself this is tragic because oxycontin has been a godsend for millions of patients with searing unremitting pain from chronic back problems rheumatoid arthritis neurological disorders and other dire afflictions this latest bad rap for oxycontin threatens to inflict more pain doctors already wary of scrutiny by the drug enforcement administration will become even more skittish about giving adequate doses of oxycontin or prescribing it at all and patients will be rightly scared of losing access to the medication that made their lives livable again oxycontin was approved in for treatment of moderate to severe pain unlike its opioid cousins such as morphine or codeine which wear off in four to six hours oxycontin is slow release and lasts up to hours longer action means steadier blood levels an important feature when pain is constant and severe problems started in when drug abusers discovered that they could crush the pill thereby inactivating the slow release feature and snort or inject the powdery contents for a euphoric rush that hits the brain like heroin west virginia was one of the first states to report people dying from abuse of "oxy " dubbed hillbilly heroin then in july the new york times magazine ran a cover story "the alchemy of oxycontin " the author described how addicts not severe chronic pain patients ground an intact pill into quick acting pharmaceutical grade opiate "it takes five seconds to effect the transformation and not much longer to create an addict " the startling implication was that unwitting people were stumbling headlong into a powerful addiction two years later the orlando sentinel ran a series headlined "pain pill leaves death trail " the expose reported that overdose deaths in florida in and were linked to oxycontin the victims "put their faith in their doctors " said the sentinel "and ended up dead or broken " these portrayals were deeply flawed the typical "oxy" abuser is not a pain patient taking medication as prescribed but rather a committed substance abuser the national household survey on drug abuse found that among those who took oxycontin without a prescription had used other addictive pain relievers for nonmedical purposes and more than a quarter had used heroin when the kentucky medical examiners office recorded oxycodone related deaths in in all but two other drugs including cocaine heroin and other prescription painkillers and alcohol were found in the bodies oxycodone is the pure narcotic found in oxycontin and other pain killers in the journal of analytical toxicology reported that in less than of oxycodone related deaths oxycontin was the only drug found at autopsy the orlando sentinel recanted its story in after autopsies on two thirds of the victims uncovered other drugs e g alcohol heroin other painkillers that alone or in combination with oxycodone could have been fatal in the remaining one third no one could tell how often oxycontin itself was involved because name brand drugs were not identified in the autopsies thus the problem isnt oxycontin but its misuse by people abetting a desire to get high in fact according to the national institute on drug abuse abuse of narcotic analgesics is rare among legitimate pain patients taking adequate doses as prescribed this is not to absolve physicians well meaning doctors sometimes prescribe large numbers of pills to those who may not need such high strength medication and then refill prescriptions reflexively some are easily hoodwinked by "patients" who doctor shop to maintain a habit or to accumulate drugs for underground sale at &# per milligram the most commonly sold pill being the mg strength a vast amount of oxycontin on the black market also comes from pharmacy robberies and diversion of drug shipments bound for large distribution chains was the penalty for purdue frederick out of line i dont know but the price for those already in pain promises to be steep pharmaceutical development of improved slow acting opiate medications may be derailed by fresh paranoia more law abiding physicians wary of litigation and regulatory scrutiny may withdraw from prescribing potent painkillers it is hard enough for pain patients to get treatment this newest injection of malignant hype is the last thing they need dr satel a psychiatrist specializing in addiction is a resident scholar at the american enterprise
