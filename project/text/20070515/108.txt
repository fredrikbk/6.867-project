to create buzz tv networks try a little blogola they lavish freebies upon eager web scribes yvonne marie on stage tv critics have called "the new adventures of old christine" one of the decades funniest comedies but when cbs recently wanted to create buzz for the show critics werent the targets of the publicity campaign neither were newspaper feature writers whom a publicist for the shows star julia louis dreyfus declared werent "worth her time " the so called "mommy bloggers" were another matter warner bros the studio that produces the show for cbs identified blogs about motherhood a key theme in "old christine " and invited the writers to spend the day on the set the bloggers got free dvds watched a rehearsal and made videos with ms louis dreyfus and other cast members to post on their sites "it was totally rad " says yvonne marie the publisher of a web log called joy unexpected who says you cant buy love trying to tap into the burgeoning power of blogs as promotional tools and fed up with the jaded attitudes of professional critics and tv feature writers studios and networks are flooding bloggers with free stuff in hopes the flattered recipients will reward them with positive coverage flowing into the trough is everything from fancy gym bags and toasters to video ipods and free trips some networks in the spotlight this week as they unveil their fall schedules to advertisers have even borrowed a term from the technology industry to describe the strategy blogola until the s when news outlets started devoting more space to business coverage and reporters began peering more intently behind hollywoods curtain many mainstream writers were showered with gifts the result was usually fawning coverage networks would like nothing more than to re create that system with blogs networks see their "blog outreach" simply as smart pr strategy "the goal is to go beyond the filter of the tv critic and mainstream media to create a direct connection with potential viewers " says chris ender senior vice president of communications at cbs speaking of the "old christine" junket other network pr experts say blogs are important because they often serve as idea farms for professional reporters giving away dvds is a cheap way to curry favor but some networks are courting bloggers with hollywoods true currency access fox news channel says it recently thought about trying to flatter a new york times writer with an invitation to an industry dinner hosted by president bush instead fox says it sent invites to several new york media blogs outlets it considered to be of more strategic importance bloggers often return home with pinwheels in their eyes "you know what its funny " wrote ms marie after her "old christine" visit "and im not just saying that because i got to pee on stage of the warner bros lot where julia louis dreyfus might also pee between takes " tv networks and studios hold black belts in spin general electric co s nbc universal alone employs more than public relations people but it doesnt appear too hard to nudge many bloggers in one direction or another indeed some blog writers are even happy to let networks play editor "i hope you like it " wrote ms marie in an email to cbs to flag her "old christine" posting "if theres anything youd like me to add just tell me and i will " she signed the note "xoxo " she says she was being nice more than anything "i didnt really expect them to have any changes " she says mainstream news outlets now have strict rules governing to what extent their palms can be greased presents valued at more than &# are typically banned and that includes travel but most blogs many less than five years old dont have such rules warner bros recently flew seven bloggers to british columbia to promote its teen drama "supernatural " the bloggers got to stay free of charge at vancouvers sutton place hotel where rooms start at &# a night and spend a day hanging out on the shows canadian set the studio emphasizes that the budget was minimal "there were no luxury spa visits or lobster dinners " says sharan magnuson senior vice president of world wide publicity perks of that level say pr executives at other studios are reserved for writers from foreign publications who vote on the golden globe awards "as i slipped into my role as a seasoned television reporter and stepped onto the soundstage to watch the filming of an actual scene " wrote daniel malen on the tv addict "id have to admit that my play it cool veneer probably did a pretty poor job of hiding the excitement radiating from just about every pore of my being " warner bros may draw the line at seaweed wraps but the abc television studio bestowed the holy grail of hollywood freebies on one blogger last january to the dismay of the screen actors guild the studio cast blogger and tv guide writer michael ausiello as an obstetrician a speaking role on the comedy "scrubs " on the feb episode he performed an ultrasound abc says the casting was made in return for coverage particularly on mr ausiellos blog "we got as much promotional value out of it as we could " says sharon liggins a publicist at the studio which produces "scrubs" for nbc tv guide spokeswoman julie farin said abc shouldnt have expected anything "there was certainly no promise of that made in advance in exchange for the casting " ms farin said in a statement either way the casting worked out for "scrubs " since january mr ausiello has posted more than items about "scrubs" on ask ausiello his popular blog in comparison he mentioned "desperate housewives " a show that reaches an audience four times that of "scrubs " fewer than times cbs corp s mr ender and his counterparts emphasize that blogs havent eclipsed traditional media outlets in promotional importance and although most tv critics and writers for print outlets refuse to accept expensive gifts they still get plenty of perks indeed the four major broadcast networks wine and dine the member television critics association every january and july critics and tv writers fly to los angeles where they gobble mounds of free food wander the sets of hit shows such as "greys anatomy" and rub elbows with tv stars at cocktail parties the annual "press tour" tab for each of the four major broadcast networks ranges from &# to &# million but as bloggers rise in stature and as newspapers and magazines watch their circulations sink and readers age networks are starting to question whether the old line writers deserve such largess "press tour remains highly valuable but with the internet making journalism so immediate maybe the format of the event needs to change " says kevin brockman senior vice president of communications for walt disney co s television unit networks may want to speed up the gravy train blogs are starting to calcify into more traditional media operations as they grow establishing ethics rules about accepting gifts in the process five year old gawker media inc which operates blogs early last year instituted a code of conduct writers now must identify on their various blogs any gifts in excess of &# even ms marie of joy unexpected says she is re evaluating how she handles gifts "ive realized that im inundated with free stuff " she says "i dont want my content to turn into advertising "
