tricks of the auction trade new york attention art shoppers while youre deciding whether to spend some serious millions tonight at sothebys on david rockefellers rothko or tomorrow night at christies on the anonymously consigned de kooning previously owned by s i newhouse do take a few moments to rummage through your dresser drawers for some valuable coupons im not talking about the " off" variety im referring to the coupons issued as a result of the auction antitrust settlement of about &# million of the &# million in coupons that were issued to christies and sothebys customers as part of the &# million settlement have yet to be redeemed and time is running out those certificates will be worthless a year from today now the good news starting today you have a new option for redeeming those pesky pieces of paper previously you could only sell them on the open market at less than full face value or you could apply them toward selling costs at the auction houses but now certificate holders can redeem them for cash if youve lost them they can be reissued through the coupon administrator computershare edison n j the auction houses would prefer that you have a memory lapse as the majority of coupon holders in such settlements typically do during separate interviews recently presidents william ruprecht of sothebys who is also its chief executive officer and marc porter of christies seemed slightly disconcerted when i mentioned the coupons "i forgot about them i dont remember them " quipped mr ruprecht not that the auction houses cant afford it back in the dark days of the size of the auction house antitrust settlement and the subsequent fallout almost put sothebys out of business pummeled its publicly traded stock seriously tarnished both houses good names and torpedoed employees morale making matters worse this decline in fortune coincided with a decline in the art market what a difference five years make returning to profitability in after four years of deficits sothebys last year reported &# million in after tax net income mr ruprecht who in the antitrust aftermath had worried not only about his firms financial survival but also about his own has been handsomely rewarded his total compensation in was &# million christies privately owned by french luxury goods magnate francois pinault does not disclose its financials so we must take on faith the claim by mr porter of "record profits" last year what we do know is that auction sales including the nonnegotiable commission charged to buyers known as the "buyers premium" increased to &# billion at christies the increase was to &# billion at sothebys for the past two years christies has outstripped sothebys in auction market share with its sales each year accounting for of the two houses combined total mr ruprecht professes not to care about being no in dollar volume "we sell about one third of the number of objects that christies does and the average price point is a little over twice theirs " he declared one new cloud on sothebys horizon the owner of its headquarters which the auction firm leases wants to sell the building sothebys in its most recent quarterly report alleges that the owner rfr holding has "violated the companys rights" under its lease the auction house through its lawyers "intends to pursue its rights " in todays halcyon art market climate the most enduring result of terminating the auction houses secret conspiracy to fix sellers commissions and divvy up consignors is that competition is back with a vengeance the buoyancy of todays market means that at least for now theres plenty of prize money for both contestants the name of the game is get that property with sellers in the drivers seat some previously unknown or rarely used stratagems for crafting deals with major consignors are now becoming more important even some highly experienced and sophisticated customers including veteran dealers whom i interviewed lack full knowledge about these tricks of the trade one thing they do know is that the houses "have altered the pricing structure to shift much more of the burden to the buyer " in mr porters own words for some properties the buyer bears all the burden and then some not only are some sellers commissions reduced to zero but a portion of the buyers premium is sometimes funneled by the auction house to the seller who thereby walks away with even more than hammer price auction house personnel and clients say these arrangements have become far more common in the past couple of years as the competition for consignments intensifies this was news to veteran london dealer martin summers who was the longtime managing director of lefevre gallery and is now chairman of his own eponymous gallery he confessed to me at a presale auction viewing last week at sothebys that he was previously unaware that part of the buyers commission was sometimes "kicked back" as he termed it to the seller he took this in stride though echoing the auction houses view that they can use the commission as they see fit but some buyers who have seen their fees the same at both houses increasingly subsidize preferential treatment for sellers might reasonably object also not widely understood is the auction house practice of enlisting dealers collectors or other backers to provide funds guaranteeing a prearranged price to sellers these "third party guarantees" enlarge the pool of money available for such arrangements which are usually provided just by the auction houses and reduce the houses financial exposure if bidding falls short of the guarantee if the work sells for more than the guaranteed amount the auction house and or the unaffiliated guarantor get a large percentage of the upside if it sells for less the auction house the third party or both pay the guarantee and may take possession as of april sothebys had &# million in outstanding guarantees with third party arrangements reducing that risk by &# million mr porter of christies said his houses outstanding guarantees were about the same as sothebys but he would not say how much was third party although its a small weapon in the auction house arsenal roland augustine president of the art dealers association of america and co owner of luhring augustine gallery in new york finds the third party guarantee problematic he told me he had recently declined an invitation from an auction house to guarantee a work by one of his gallerys artists rachel whiteread in the belief that there could be a conflict of interest when a dealer hypes to his clients an auction offering that hes guaranteed "youre working for yourself and the auction house simultaneously " he observed "there are a lot of gray areas here " even grayer in the view of many dealers is the appetite of auction houses for acquiring private galleries which give them access to more merchandise entree into dealers art fairs and new venues for executing sales privately rather than through public auction sothebys has just collected &# million from its "key man" life insurance policy for robert noortman the dutch dealer in old masters who died unexpectedly in january only seven months after the auction house acquired his gallery and its &# million inventory in exchange for sothebys shares worth about &# million as well as the assumption of about &# million in debt this february christies acquired the london contemporary art gallery haunch of venison which is not allowed to bid at christies auctions sothebys does allow noortman to bid stating in its catalogs that the gallery "has had no access through sothebys to any confidential information relating to the sale of any property " mr augustine regards the inter species mating of galleries and auction houses as possibly "monopolistic" and further argues that when an auction house owns a contemporary art gallery it may make preferential efforts to promote buyer interest in works by artists represented by its own subsidiary the auction houses say that theyre just trying to provide more services that their clients want mr summers worries that "if the auction houses try to be all things to all people dealers will disappear " he would doubtless be disquieted by mr porters stated receptivity to future direct consignments by artists to auction "it wouldnt surprise me at all if artists demanded numerous channels of distribution for their own work " for christies and sothebys art specialists on the front line in engaging both buyers and sellers the seismic shift in market terrain has dramatically shaken their own world "i used to talk about what was special about an artists work and what its merits were " reflected amy cappellazzo christies co head of postwar and contemporary art "now im just fulfilling some larger banking function its about how to make the deal " ms rosenbaum writes on art and museums for the journal and blogs as culturegrrl at www artsjournal com culturegrrl
