visa looks for a ceo and finds one in its wallet three months ago credit card industry veteran joseph saunders was tapped to help visa international inc recruit a new chief executive as it becomes a publicly traded payments company from a bank owned cooperative he didnt have to look very far visa today is expected to name mr saunders years old as the first chief executive and chairman of what will eventually be known as visa inc when it goes public early next year a former high ranking executive at a number of large credit card issuers mr saunders is best known for overseeing a big turnaround at providian financial corp about five years ago "the more we met with people and the more we talked with people we really felt that we wanted someone with direct industry experience and we couldnt get someone with more experience than joe who can hit the ground running " said william campbell chairman of visa internationals board visa international based in san francisco is an umbrella organization that oversees a handful of regional visa entities that operate independently mr saunders will be taking the post at a time of enormous change in the payments industry not only are consumers and businesses increasingly using credit and debit cards instead of traditional cash and checks but the industry is also trying to pump up transaction volume by finding new ways to pay from making payments on a cellular telephone to speeding through a check out line by waving a card at an electronic reader "visa isnt a broken company but we have to focus on how the industry is changing and what we need to do to remain at the forefront of that change " mr saunders said visa international rang up &# trillion in transactions last year up from by comparison mastercard inc booked about &# trillion debit and prepaid cards now account for of visas global total consumer volume and more than of the number of transactions although visa is far bigger than mastercard it has lagged behind its chief rival in structural change mastercard based in purchase n y went public a year ago in an initial public offering that surpassed expectations separately morgan stanley is planning to spin off its discover payment network into a stand alone company this year visa announced its ipo plans in october but the process was expected to take as long as months because it has to unravel its unusual structure which has long been considered unwieldy the new company will include all of its geographical units except for europe which will operate as a minority stockholder in the larger company that is partly so visas european operation can deal with issues that emerge as the european union establishes a unified payment network across national borders many details about visas ipo still arent known because the company hasnt yet filed a prospectus with the securities and exchange commission at the time the plan was announced some analysts estimated that visa might have a market value of about &# billion but that figure is likely to be far higher now because of a run up in mastercards share price mastercard which went public last may at &# a share is trading at more than &# a share giving it a market value of more than &# billion visa and mastercard are essentially processors of electronic transactions they dont issue cards set interest rates or accept payments from cardholders indeed they dont have any direct relationship with consumers their customers are the financial institutions that issue the cards visa and mastercard charge the banks to process their card transactions and brand the cards that the banks issue to cardholders visa and mastercard also set the fees that banks charge to merchants for accepting and processing card transactions merchants have sued the payment networks and the banks over those fees charging them with colluding to set the rates the financial institutions have denied that the fees are anticompetitive before being named as visas executive chairman in february mr saunders ran the card business of washington mutual inc having joined the seattle bank when it acquired providian in mr saunders was hired as the chief executive of providian in after the big card issuer ran into problems after borrowers with spotty credit histories defaulted on loans he turned around providian by slashing costs and selling some assets ultimately selling it to wamu for more than &# billion mr saunderss career also includes senior roles in the card businesses of fleetboston financial corp and household international inc "ive got a pretty clear understanding of the path that is in front of us " mr saunders said the choice may surprise some industry insiders who had thought visa might tap a leader from the technology industry since electronic payments are increasingly becoming more sophisticated and complex mr saunderss appointment will overshadow the role of john coghlan who was hired two years ago as chief executive of visa usa inc visas biggest unit mr coghlan said in a prepared statement yesterday that he intends to remain at the company "theres much more to be done as we transform this organization and further visas industry leadership " he said
