borrowers finances they are taking a tougher look at how much the property a borrower wants to buy is worth they are peering further into clients pasts for credit problems and requiring more in depth reviews of borrowers who say they are self employed some lenders are taking a harder stance when it comes to whose credit score a couple can use when applying for a mortgage rather than simply allowing them to use the higher of the two scores "theres no question that lenders are digging deeper " says doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association "the pendulum is swinging a little farther to the conservative side " he says tighter lending standards are adding pressure to an already soft housing market last week the national association of realtors forecast the first

another lender two weeks later but by that time the rate on his loan had risen a quarter percentage point to "its ended up costing us a lot more over a year period " he says the higher rate could amount to tens of thousands of dollars in added interest payments over that time mr liptons broker daniel jacobs chief executive of empire equity groups st metropolitan mortgage unit says the two

is running each loan it receives through a computer model to ensure that the appraisal submitted with the loan application provides an accurate measure of how much the home is worth if the appraisal

his mortgage broker the increased attention to appraisals and other underwriting policies follows a period when lenders made it increasingly easier for borrowers to get a mortgage often borrowers didnt have to document their income or assets even if they had relatively low credit scores looser standards werent much of a problem when home prices were climbing but as the housing market has cooled more borrowers are winding up in trouble the mortgage delinquency rate climbed to in the first quarter from a recent low of in late according to equifax inc and moodys economy inc some lenders

after the lender determined that it was a bed and breakfast which is considered a commercial property "the increased scrutiny were getting now would have been normal in the s " although the internet gives lenders today immediate access to more complete information says mr redmond the broker says he supports the return to tighter lending standards because it will boost the confidence of investors

a business license theyll check theyll google you " says mitch ohlbaum a mortgage broker in los angeles indymac bancorp inc is among those taking a closer look at applications in which borrowers merely "state" their income instead of documenting their earnings in an effort to assess whether that income seems reasonable underwriters are considering how long borrowers have been on the job where the job is located and borrowers income compared to their assets they also are using sources such as salary com to compare that income to industry averages "like other lenders we are scrutinizing our guidelines in the current climate " an indymac spokesman says lenders are also delving deeper into borrowers employment and credit histories michael moskowitz president of equity now inc a new york based mortgage lender says in recent years lenders would often look back just months at a borrowers mortgage payment history now he says they are looking at two years of mortgage payments and
