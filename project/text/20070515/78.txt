oil firm has little left in reserve repsol revival must overcome sagging output political pressure madrid when it set out to join the ranks of global oil titans repsol ypf sa was seeking to shed its reputation as the oil company with no oil nearly a decade and billions of dollars later it has plenty of troubles to show for its effort one move to increase its heft its acquisition of argentinas ypf for &# billion instead saddled the spanish argentine company with aging production fields and management headaches many of its most important production assets are in venezuela and bolivia where governments are squeezing foreign oil companies for more concessions its reserves are dwindling and its production shrinking "repsol is not replacing its reserves and new discoveries are small " chairman and chief executive antonio brufau said in an interview since he took over in the fall of mr brufau has tried to chart a new course for the company his plan to reinvent repsol as a truly global player by ramping up investment in exploration and production in projects around the world but he admits it hasnt been easy "when youre busy doing something else for three or four years you end up with no projects in the pipeline " mr brufau said referring to the difficulty repsol had in digesting ypf "it takes time to build up steam again" in exploration and production the rest of the western oil and natural gas industry shares many of repsols troubles many of the best untapped oil reserves are in politically closed or unstable nations while the cost of developing new projects is soaring amid a flurry of oil field activity those barriers make it even tougher for companies like repsol to compete with exxon mobil corp bp plc and other major global producers which have bigger wallets and can weather stumbles at some projects by virtue of their breadth mr brufau years old has had plenty of housecleaning to do he slashed repsols reserves early last year to reflect new contractual terms on its natural gas fields imposed by bolivia and to more accurately reflect the companys future prospects repsols challenges were underscored yesterday when it reported first quarter earnings including a drop in operating profit in its production division to million euros &# million because of falling crude prices dwindling production from mature fields in argentina which account for two thirds of repsols production and onerous new output contracts in bolivia and venezuela repsols net profit inched up to million euros thanks to stellar performance from its refining and chemicals arms repsols shares edged up to euros in madrid trading mr brufau who previously worked at repsol affiliate gas natural sdg sa is eager to push forward on diversifying the production portfolio in the first quarter repsol more than doubled its exploration and production outlay to more than billion euros and it has hired more than exploration and production specialists in the past year it acquired rights to a second promising field in the gulf of mexico called genghis khan and in march announced its biggest ever find in libya where repsols long presence ensures it more favorable terms than other western oil companies that only recently started working there repsol has also said it will study investing &# billion to develop a natural gas find in iran despite u s admonishments against doing business there repsol must convince investors it can replace its reserves at a steady rate increase production and diversify out of latin america so far the numbers arent promising first quarter production fell by to million equivalent barrels a day and it will require large capital outlays to keep output at current levels repsol is studying cost effective ways to juice production with new technology at its older wells in argentina for example repsol is pinning its hopes on new seismic imaging technology to give it a clearer picture of deep geological formations that may hold oil but the oil that companies find today is often more expensive to extract than in the past such as the new deep water finds in the gulf of mexico or is located in countries with volatile politics such as libya algeria and iran compounding repsols woes oil companies are fighting over specialized personnel and engineering equipment meaning higher costs and more time before an oil field can start pumping after discovery "repsol is trying to diversify away from argentina and bolivia and create a truly global portfolio " says derek butter an analyst at energy consultant wood mackenzie in edinburgh scotland "the problem is thats what everyone else is doing too and they are all flush with cash so there is very tough competition out there and youve got to pay top dollar for new finds " frances total sa suggested last week it would sell its stake in drug maker sanofi aventis sa worth about billion euros to fund more oil investment eni spa of italy made a string of acquisitions over the past year in africa the u s and russia to boost its flagging pipeline and has promised another billion euros this year for more buys repsols tough prospects have made it the subject of takeover talk which led to a run up in the stock last year however its share structure makes a hostile bid unlikely because more than is held by major repsol shareholders including a spanish builder and a savings bank mr brufau played down rumors of a possible merger with eni last week as well as with spains gas natural in which repsol has a stake he said the companys new focus on revitalizing its exploration activities and expanding to new areas of the globe made any big corporate deals unnecessary "mergers are usually just a way for ceos to try to keep their jobs not a way to benefit shareholders " mr brufau said
