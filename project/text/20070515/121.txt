world bank jobbery the world bank board meets today to consider the fate of president paul wolfowitz and the truth is that the verdict may already be in the board will consider the report of an investigating committee dominated by the same european nations that have been orchestrating the media campaign to depose him as almost daily newspaper leaks have disclosed for weeks in violation of bank rules the committee concludes that mr wolfowitz violated bank rules in awarding a promotion and salary increase for his girlfriend shaha riza weve previously reported on the world bank documents that make it clear this was at worst a misunderstanding if not a setup by bank officials who wanted his fingerprints on any raise for ms riza mr wolfowitz had tried to recuse himself only to be told he couldnt do so and would have to be the one to give her the raise and new job but weve now seen two other documents that reveal the investigating committees clear bias against mr wolfowitz they concern its key witness xavier coll the banks vice president of human resources who has joined those saying mr wolfowitz dictated a raise he knew was excessive and then tried to cover it up in his testimony mr coll claims that "there is no doubt that the president mr wolfowitz knew or had been made aware of by me that this was outside the rules " the investigating panel relies heavily on mr colls claims to support its findings against mr wolfowitz but to reach that conclusion the committee had to ignore a pair of august memos in which mr coll told a very different story mr coll dictated those memos for his own files and marked them "strictly confidential and personal for xavier colls eyes only unless authorized explicitly by xavier " they are a contemporaneous account of his negotiations with ms riza and mr wolfowitz in an august memo mr coll reports that "i also felt that we were in a very difficult situation with no precedent at the bank and that it had enormous potential to damage the banks reputation in balance i thought that the situation required more flexibility than in other past cases and that there was great risk to the bank if we could not come to a workable agreement in a few days " yet the investigating panel now asserts that the situation wasnt all that unusual and that mr wolfowitz should have been allowed no such "flexibility" in how he tried to settle the matter in the same memo mr coll also reports that he had urged a lump sum settlement with ms riza as she left the bank and concedes that mr wolfowitz "agreed that i should raise this alternative with ms riza i felt comfortable that i raised my points of concern with the president and that he has taken these seriously and given due consideration " and regarding a later conversation mr coll had with ms riza mr coll wrote "i indicated that while the president wanted to come to an agreement quickly he was leaving that afternoon for an overseas trip he also wanted to make sure that we came to the right solution both for the institution and the staff " mr coll added that ms riza rejected his proposed "financial settlement " only then did mr wolfowitz decide to settle the matter by dictating its terms to mr coll after mr coll recommended that any future raises for ms riza should be contingent on a review of her work outside the bank by "a committee of her peers " mr coll wrote that "this addition brought the process for potential promotions more in line with current practice at the bank i felt that on balance this was a reasonable way to move forward and find a solution given the very complex and difficult set of circumstances " based on our fast reading late yesterday of the final investigating committee report we could not find these quotes from mr colls memos yet they clearly show that mr coll thought at the time that mr wolfowitz was trying his best to come to a fair conclusion that would not harm ms riza would protect the bank from any possible litigation and would do well by bank rules all of this is further evidence that what mr wolfowitz is facing here is a kangaroo court the europeans and bank staff thought they could get him to leave quietly if they smeared him and ms riza enough in the press but now that he has fought back to clear his name the europeans led by dutch politician herman wijffels have decided to ignore evidence to justify their one sided conclusions they also largely ignore ms rizas own statements to the committee while condemning her for objecting to a process that all but ended her career at the bank so now the full member board will take up the case even as european ministers try to browbeat the white house and treasury to get mr wolfowitz to resign as part of some "plea bargain " but what does mr wolfowitz get out of that except more leaks saying he left under a cloud president bush should understand that none of this is about mr wolfowitzs "ethics " it is all about the european desire to punish a bush appointee for his support for the iraq war and his determination to change the banks policies to fight corruption rather than simply push taxpayer money out the door if the board really wants to oust mr wolfowitz the white house should insist on a recorded vote we wonder if europeans really want this showdown and oh yes president bush could also help by declaring that if the europeans do oust mr wolfowitz his likely choice as a successor would be paul volcker the former fed chairman who has made a recent career of fighting corruption there is certainly a lot of that to clean up at the world bank
