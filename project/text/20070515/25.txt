chryslers private bailout nearly a decade after daimler benz paid some &# billion to buy chrysler the german auto maker has agreed in effect to pay private equity group cerberus more than &# billion to take americas no car maker off its hands this deal to take private one of the putative big three is an intriguing and maybe even encouraging bit of financial innovation it certainly beats a taxpayer bailout the details are complex but the bottom line is that most of the &# billion price tag is going to recapitalize chrysler daimler will pay out what little is left and then some to settle some outstanding liabilities in addition to loaning the newly independent chrysler another &# million in return daimler will retain nearly of chrysler which means it will get a chunk of the upside if the private equity whizzes can do a better job of turning the company around given the recent history of chrysler which lost &# billion last year it would be foolhardy to assume that cerberus can wave a magic private equity wand and make all of the car makers problems go away but cerberus isnt plunking down almost &# billion because it believes chrysler has no future that the purchase entails some financial novelties in divvying up the price should come as no surprise all three detroit auto makers have serious problems many of which come back in one way or another to their long term promises to their workers and retirees cerberuss bet is that if the assets can be had on the right terms those problems can be solved yesterdays enthusiastic declarations from all sides have to be taken for what they are but the fact remains that a big chunk of private capital is being devoted to an industry often characterized as terminal its notable that in keeping with a recent trend in private equity takeouts cerberus managed to get a statement of support from the united auto workers issued at the same time the deal was announced whether that comity will outlast the contract negotiations coming up this summer is no certainty but its barely possible that the uaw has started to come around to the view that a failing unionized auto industry is in nobodys interest least of all that of their still employed members it wasnt long ago that the uaw was declaring itself the enemy of private equity and cerberus itself has run into trouble trying to negotiate wage agreements with the unions at auto parts supplier delphi corp cerberus had led a private equity consortium looking to buy the former gm parts unit out of bankruptcy but the negotiations have been so contentious that no agreement on labor costs has been reached and this newspaper has reported that cerberus may pull out of the delphi deal as part of the chrysler agreement chrysler ceo tom la sorda has assured workers that deep job cuts are not currently planned but the uaw may find that the price of adhering to the promise is high in terms of benefit and pay cuts its hard to imagine a turnaround at any of the big three that doesnt involve winning back some of the concessions on health care and pension benefits that currently burden the u s car makers one intriguing possibility for private owners would be the threat of offshoring production should the unions refuse to play ball in the past the threat of a crippling strike has made this seem far fetched but a newly private chrysler would be debt free and without a shareholder base to worry about in the event of labor action at the moment cerberus is playing it softly softly but if theres a lesson to be taken away from daimlers dalliance with detroit its that changing the name plates on the factory doors is not enough by itself to correct the course of an american auto maker the u s economy is only as strong as it is dynamic and yesterdays agreement on chrysler is the latest example of that dynamism at work however it turns out all parties involved deserve plaudits for trying something new see related letter "letters to the editor heavy german hand removed from chrysler" wsj may
