some investors buoyed by big threes prospects but others are skeptical the u s auto industry has been struggling under the weight of massive pension and health care obligations and just a few months ago there was talk of bankruptcy court filings but yesterday some on wall street were betting on a u turn for the car makers the reason for their optimism cerberus capital management lps deal to buy of daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group for &# billion investors bid up shares of ford motor co and general motors corp betting cerberus might wrest concessions from the united auto workers which endorsed the cerberus chrysler transaction and that these investors believe could finally reduce the labor costs for all of detroits big three "having a big firm full of smart people putting billions of dollars of investment in chrysler is a vote of confidence in the north america auto business " said robert barry an auto analyst at goldman sachs group inc goldman has provided investment banking services to ford and gm in the past months and owns at least in gm shares he has what is equivalent to a "hold" rating on ford and gm but some industry analysts arent buying the story even if cerberus succeeds in restructuring its labor contract for chrysler and rivals ford and gm follow suit their long term survival still is a long shot they said "this is a bar at a m on st patricks day " said peter morici a professor at the university of marylands robert h smith school of business who doesnt own shares in any of the auto makers "everyones around debating how much longer they can stay before the bar eventually closes " gm and ford have been restructuring their u s operations on and off for nearly years as their unionized businesses have steadily lost market share to lower cost nonunion asian and european auto makers health care benefits which the companies are bound to pay under their contracts with the uaw adds roughly &# a car to the cost of their vehicles a cost penalty they cant offset by raising prices because of competitive pressures the uaws endorsement of the cerberus chrysler deal has ignited hopes that the private equity firm which specializes in buying and turning around distressed auto companies will be able to negotiate a shareholder friendly contract with the union cerberus also bought of gmac from former parent gm last year which could be bolstered by chrysler finance stoking their hopes is the agreement in january between goodyear tire &amp rubber co and its largest union the united steelworkers under that deal goodyear agreed to transfer its &# billion health care liability to a fund managed by the steelworkers union goodyear in turn would put &# billion in cash and stock into the fund both gm which has an estimated &# billion in future and current health care liabilities and ford which has some &# billion in such union obligations have been studying the goodyear agreement among other options "we read this to mean that cerberus has received reasonable line of sight visibility from the uaw on the scope of possible concessions " himanshu patel an auto analyst at j p morgan chase &amp co wrote in a research note yesterday he has the equivalent of a "sell" recommendation on fords shares and a "hold" on gms j p morgan has provided investment banking services to ford and gm in the past months gms shares yesterday rose or &# to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange down this year ford saw its shares climb or cents to &# also on the big board its shares are up this year daimlerchrysler shares gained or &# to &# on the big board daimlers shares are up this year some auto parts suppliers which have been attracting interest from private equity firms and other investors lately also saw their shares rise the u s auto makers havent been stellar investments for investors gm and ford both saddled with speculative or "junk " credit ratings have long been struggling with negative cash flow and huge earnings losses which wont begin to go away as long as the companies have to fund health care liabilities for union workers worse they cant compete with lower cost higher quality asian auto makers without big injections of capital to finance production improvements ford narrowed its quarterly net loss to &# million in the first three months on revenue of &# billion compared with a net loss of &# billion in the year earlier period but it still is strapped for cash its return on invested capital assets and equity all are in negative territory and analysts cant value the company on a price to earnings basis gm which has recently made some improvements in its profitability is trading at about nine times its estimated per share earnings according to thomson financial by comparison the standard &amp poors stock index is trading at times estimated earnings goldmans mr barry said the deal results in cerberus buying the auto business for little more than the value of chryslers retiree health care liability "in that sense its not exactly a ringing endorsement " he said the auto makers still would need to overhaul their supply chains and invest in new product development even if they restructured the union contracts in their favor and that isnt necessarily in the cards
