latest attempt to woo them into accepting news corp s &# billion bid for dow jones &amp co but the family which controls about of dow joness shareholder voting power didnt respond to mr murdochs latest push for a face to face meeting leaving continued doubts about his chances of winning enough support to gain control of the company in his latest letter sent to family members friday mr murdoch made a series of commitments including giving the bancrofts a seat on news corp s board and pledging to safeguard the editorial integrity of the wall street journal and other dow jones editorial properties he sought to address a key concern of the family the continued editorial independence of the wall street journal family members had not responded to an earlier request for a meeting mr murdoch portrayed himself as a worthy steward of dow joness journalistic legacy with the business acumen to ensure its future he spoke both personally invoking his father his children and his own devotion to newspapers and in business terms promising the capital to expand farther and faster overseas and online the news corp chairman stopped short of raising the &# a share offer for dow jones but asked for a meeting with the family and dow jones directors and employees so he could make his case directly a dow jones spokesman declined to comment on the letter michael b elefante a dow jones director and partner at boston based law firm hemenway &amp barnes who represents much of the bancrofts holdings couldnt be reached mr murdochs letter with its specific proposals serves to heighten pressure on family members and keep them discussing the offer two weeks after its existence became public instead of just walking away it could give members of the extended bancroft family who dont want to categorically resist the offer additional time to make their case to their relatives many members of the far flung bancroft clan which has about three dozen adult members spoke with advisers on the conference call yesterday afternoon mr murdochs letter which was sent to dow joness new york headquarters wasnt widely distributed among family members until yesterday morning during the call family lawyers from wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz and representatives of merrill lynch &amp co the investment bank advising the bancrofts gave a presentation they discussed what had transpired since news corp s initial offer and the commitments outlined in mr murdochs most recent letter according to people familiar with the call the family asked a number of questions about the proposals focusing in particular on mr murdochs commitment to establish what he described as an autonomous independent editorial board to ensure the companys journalistic integrity one family member said he was unmoved by the approach describing mr murdochs commitments as "the usual stuff " the letter appeared to be the third mr murdoch has written to dow jones or the family in recent weeks he made his initial approach in a letter to the board dated april following up on april with a note to dow jones chairman m peter mcpherson in which he requested a meeting with the family so far the family which controls about of dow joness voting power has rejected mr murdochs &# a share offer for the company though some members have expressed a willingness to meet with him another major shareholder the ottaway family also has rejected the bid shares of dow jones yesterday were up cents to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange if successful in acquiring dow jones mr murdoch said he would set up an "independent autonomous editorial board" to oversee the journal and all other editorial operations under his plan the boards majority would be required to either appoint or dismiss the newspapers managing editor the board also would arbitrate disputes between management and the editorial operations the proposal was aimed at assuaging concerns both inside and outside the bancroft family and dow jones that mr murdoch would infuse the newspapers news operations with his own biases the news corp chairman faced similar concerns after acquiring the times of london and the sunday times in he said the board he established at those papers would serve as a model for the dow jones panel the person editorial board whose members are appointed by les hinton chairman of news corp s british newspaper division has business and editorial oversight for both papers board members have approval over the newspapers editors much like mr murdoch is offering in his bid for the journal the boards seven independent members that is non news corp employees include public figures in british government and journalism such as rupert pennant rea a former editor at the economist and two members of the house of lords two more directors are assigned by the editors of the times and sunday times three are nonexecutives who have or have had links to news corp and three are current news corp executives these directors include mr murdoch mr hinton news corp board member andrew s b knight and the managing editors of the times and sunday times with a nod to clarence barron a journalist who acquired dow jones in and then bequeathed it to the bancroft family mr murdoch stressed his own family history he described his father sir keith murdoch as a "celebrated journalist" who uncovered "the british debacle at gallipoli in " the battle at gallipoli also known as the dardanelles campaign was one of the bloodiest campaigns of world war i a failed attempt by the allies to capture constantinople from the ottoman turks he added that "as a father myself nothing makes me more proud than to see that my own children have inherited the passion that my father nurtured " of his four grown children three have worked for the company in the past years but today only james chief executive of british satellite tv operation bskyb is a news corp employee if the news corp bid succeeds the company would keep current dow jones management in place mr murdoch said in his letter in addition he wrote news corp would expand the wall street journals washington bureau to bolster political coverage improve the newspapers new york headquarters invest in its international operations especially in china india and europe and use news corp s online resources to expand dow joness presence on the web separately times of london editor robert thomson challenged recent criticism of news corp s coverage of china in a letter of his own last week james h ottaway whose family controls about of dow joness voting power attacked mr murdoch for in mr ottaways view putting business interests ahead of editorial integrity he added "i doubt the wall street journals freedom to criticize the chinese government would continue under murdoch ownership " mr ottaways comments mr thomson wrote were "clearly a challenge to the integrity of the journalists at the times and to me personally " "the explicit allegation that we are pandering to the communist party came as rather a surprise " mr thomson wrote he attached a selection of times stories on china and extended an invitation to mr ottaway to visit the papers london office and meet with the newspapers senior editors stephanie kang and susan pulliam contributed to this article
