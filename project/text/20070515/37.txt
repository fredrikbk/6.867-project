drivers seat chrysler deal heralds new direction for detroit cerberus takes gamble on union concessions gm ford may benefit by effectively agreeing to give away of chrysler group to private equity firm cerberus capital management lp german auto maker daimlerchrysler ag has set the table for a potentially far reaching restructuring of detroits faltering auto giants the new york investment firm and the german auto company have set an ambitious goal to work with the powerful united auto workers union to restructure the &# billion that detroits no auto maker estimates it will eventually owe for uaw retiree health care benefits daimler chryslers german parent was unwilling to shoulder that burden many big airlines and steelmakers have chosen to file for chapter bankruptcy protection to reduce such liabilities if cerberus can devise a formula for doing so outside of bankruptcy court ford motor co and general motors corp would almost certainly try to follow suit potentially affecting some &# billion in total retiree health care obligations discussions among big three executives are under way at "the highest levels " one person familiar with the situation says daimlers deal with cerberus announced yesterday represents a watershed moment for both the u s auto industry and the burgeoning private equity sector that is transforming global finance detroits big three have been struggling for years to cope with fierce global competition and rising retiree and health care costs private equity firms like cerberus which often buy public companies and slash costs have amassed large war chests of capital and have been aiming for bigger and bigger targets with chrysler cerberus is betting that it can run one of the nations largest industrial companies more effectively as a private company "people say how can you turn this around and we cant " said cerberus chairman john snow former treasury secretary in an interview it will take patience he said "it might take a couple of years to really show the results and public companies dont have two or three years " cerberus appears to be betting on several things that the u s economy will remain strong enough that consumers will spend freely that chryslers negotiations with unions will be fruitful and that the company will produce vehicles that consumers want investor excitement about the potential for private equity investors to reshape detroit was running high yesterday shares of ford and gm surged in new york stock exchange trading with stock market valuations of &# billion and &# billion respectively ford and gm are potential targets for private equity buyers especially if their retiree health care liabilities can be engineered to more manageable size members of the ford family which controls of fords shareholder voting power through a special class b stock met recently with investment bankers to discuss the future of their holdings a lawyer for the family said yesterday the family isnt discussing the sale of any of its controlling stake last year gm repelled an effort by las vegas billionaire kirk kerkorian to steer the company into an alliance with nissan motor corp and renault sa although mr kerkorian later sold his stake in gm some analysts say gm could again become a target for private equity investment for both cerberus and chrysler the stakes are enormous and the outcome is far from certain the uaw represents about of chryslers workers as well as many other workers in the industry several weeks ago uaw president ron gettelfinger criticized private equity as companies that "strip and flip " last month the uaw refused cerberuss demands for wage and benefit cuts for new hires at parts supplier delphi corp mr gettelfinger called the situation "a mess " cerberus is likely to pull out of an investor group that agreed to buy delphi out of bankruptcy protection but yesterday in the aftermath of a meeting saturday in germany with daimlerchrysler chief executive officer dieter zetsche mr gettelfinger struck a surprisingly conciliatory tone in an interview with detroit radio station wjr a medium he often uses to get messages out to uaw members in michigan mr gettelfinger said that mr zetsche and chrysler ceo tom lasorda had told him saturday that "the status quo for the chrysler group was no longer an option " in a news conference yesterday afternoon mr gettelfinger explained that until saturday his position had been to fight to keep chrysler within daimlerchrysler he was told then that wasnt possible he said several times that he had to work with "the hand i was dealt " for chrysler workers the deal is likely to raise fears for further job cuts in february the auto maker said it would shed about workers and idle a sport utility vehicle factory in delaware part of a plan to cut production capacity by vehicles a year cerberus officials didnt disclose plans for further job cuts yesterday analysts expect cerberus to consolidate chryslers consumer finance business with gmac financial services a similar unit it previously purchased a controlling stake in from gm which could result in job cuts chryslers ceo mr lasorda told employees there are no new job cuts planned in relation to the deal benefits for active and retired union workers however are certain to be a big issue rising health care costs have bedeviled chrysler as its ranks of retirees have grown and health care inflation has hovered around in recent years cerberus is expected to pressure the uaw to make substantial concessions which could raise the costs of prescription drugs and health care premiums for about uaw retirees and dependents cerberus has a history of profiting by acquiring companies and assets others have left for dead to finance its chrysler bid it plans to raise as much as &# billion to refinance the auto makers current debts most of which rest with its financing arm if it succeeds it would be the largest ever fund raising for a leveraged buyout people familiar with the deal said daimlers decision to sell chrysler marks a dramatic retreat from a global expansion drive begun in the late s under former ceo jurgen schrempp mr schrempps plan was to build on daimlers base in luxury cars and heavy trucks by acquiring high volume vehicle marketers in north america and asia in addition to engineering a &# billion merger with chrysler in it sought a controlling stake in japans mitsubishi motors corp and an alliance with koreas hyundai motor corp his bets went sour one by one in daimler unwound its investment in mitsubishi after the japanese company posted huge losses daimler sold its stake in hyundai the same year chrysler meanwhile stumbled into the red in requiring a costly restructuring chrysler bounced back under mr zetsche thanks to hot models such as the hemi v powered chrysler c sedan and ram pickups but it posted huge losses again last year in part due to rising gasoline prices and intensifying competition the uaws refusal to give it the same health care concessions it had given to rivals gm and ford coupled with rising pressure from shareholders sealed the decision to sell chrysler "this decision is for us and above all for me personally not easy " mr zetsche wrote in an email to employees "it is however when viewed objectively the only right one " cerberus beat three major competing bidders to snare the deal the blackstone group lp and centerbridge capital partners canadian auto parts maker magna international ltd and mr kerkorians tracinda corp the proposed cerberus deal which is expected to close in the third quarter calls for daimler to put up &# million effectively paying to get rid of an asset it acquired in for &# billion but daimler will be able to erase chryslers &# billion in pension and health care liabilities from its books cerberus will make a capital contribution of &# billion to the new chrysler holding company chrysler holding llc of the total &# billion will be put into chrysler &# billion into the industrial operations and &# billion into financial services and daimlerchrysler will get &# billion but daimler said it expects to pay out &# billion to chrysler before the deal closes to subsidize its negative cash flow daimler also will loan the new company &# million upon shareholder approval daimlerchrysler will be renamed daimler ag mr zetsche said the elimination of liabilities and risks for daimler weighed more heavily in the talks than price the deal still has to be approved by daimlers supervisory board which is scheduled to meet wednesday "that had greater power and influence on the future balance sheet " mr zetsche said for now cerberus has said it will work with chryslers existing management team led by mr lasorda but cerberus has on its payroll a team of former senior auto executives it can call upon for advice they include former chrysler chief operating officer wolfgang bernhard former ford vice chairman david thursfield former ford sales executive robert rewey and former chrysler sales and marketing executive gary dilts cerberuss chairman mr snow said at a news conference at daimlers headquarters in stuttgart germany that chrysler would be better served outside the public glare of quarterly earnings statements and analyst commentary "our approach is fundamentally long term " he said cerberus named after the three headed dog of greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld was founded in by stephen feinberg a former drexel burnham lambert executive until recently it was best known for buying distressed debt in the u s japan south korea germany and elsewhere then turning a profit by renegotiating or foreclosing on the loans it also provided expensive financing to troubled companies in recent years it has begun buying companies it purchased a failed bank in japan in it has been especially active in the auto industry last year it bought of gmac from gm it recently bought parts maker tower automotive in a &# billion deal and it owns seating fabric maker guilford mills and peguform group a german based manufacturer of plastic parts to snare the chrysler deal cerberus had teams of lawyers bankers and accountants working at the new york and german offices of law firm shearman &amp sterling over the past two weeks daimler began focusing on the cerberus offer over two others according to two people involved in the transaction mr feinberg was deeply involved in negotiating sessions "he was very direct with no posturing or big ego " said one person involved on the daimler side for cerberus the key to making the deal work will be the uaw chrysler has estimated internally that japanese auto makers like toyota motor corp enjoy a labor cost advantage of as much as &# an hour once all benefits and job security provisions are taken into account more than half of that gap is from benefits related to retirees such as health care pensions and group life insurance chrysler estimates that without a fundamental change in its uaw contract the gap will rise to &# an hour by an average labor cost of &# an hour for chrysler including benefits versus an estimated &# an hour at toyota nissan and honda which have far fewer u s retirees and dont pay pensions chrysler gm and ford hope to persuade the uaw this summer to agree to a potentially revolutionary retiree health care plan similar to one reached at goodyear tire &amp rubber co say three people familiar with auto maker plans at goodyear the united steelworkers union agreed to let goodyear shift &# billion in future health care liabilities to a fund managed by the union in return goodyear contributed &# billion in cash and goodyear stock to the fund known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba for goodyear the deal eliminated uncertainty over whether health care costs would rise faster than projected along with the possibility of a future face off with the union over benefits the three auto makers with about &# billion in combined future union and current health care liabilities on their corporate balance sheets have been "in talks at the highest levels on doing something like the goodyear deal " says one person familiar with the matter a goodyear style deal or a hybrid of it would close "a little more than half" of the big threes labor cost gap with asian competitors this person says gm is said to be pushing the hardest to create what is being called a "big three veba " which would set up a separate union managed fund which the auto makers would back with billions of dollars j p morgan chase &amp co has estimated such a fund could be set up with &# billion to &# billion from the auto makers that would make the uaw one of the largest private sector providers of health care in the u s detroits auto makers which have roughly one million union retirees and dependents are considering several different goodyear like models they have to weigh the long term financial viability of such a fund and whether the uaw could sell such a deal to its members say three people familiar with the big threes plans the auto makers have been making none too subtle comparisons to the steel industry warning mr gettelfinger and other uaw leaders that detroits auto makers could face chapter bankruptcy proceedings if they cant reduce their labor costs and close the gap with toyota "this deal by cerberus sets things up for very significant changes in detroit " says pete pestillo former ceo of auto parts maker visteon corp which was part of ford and the ford executive in charge of uaw talks "it will shake up gm and ford as well " cerberus he says doesnt "soldier on with bad contracts they shine things up and sell ron had been against private equity and i think he will find out firsthand now why he was against it " dennis k berman john d stoll and christoph rauwald contributed to this article
