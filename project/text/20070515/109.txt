the middle seat why those government stats on airlines are misleading widely watched data dont include regional partners helping deltas on time rate when deciding which airline to fly travelers can turn to government statistics for details on delays lost luggage canceled flights and consumer complaints but those statistics arent telling the whole story for big airlines as many as half of their flights arent counted in their results including many flights with horrendous service records in february the statistics show that of delta air lines inc flights arrived on time second only to southwest airlines co but include regional jets and turboprops flown for deltas by regional partners comair and atlantic southeast airlines and the on time performance falls to below the industry average the u s department of transportation reports statistics on regional airlines separately from their mainline partners effectively allowing big airlines to distance themselves from service problems and problems are many last year the bottom six airlines in the industry for baggage handling were all regional carriers and the worst airline for on time performance was atlantic southeast which delta sold in to skywest inc the troubles at regional airlines affect a huge number of travelers some mainline airlines delta and continental airlines inc for example offer more flights for sale on regional airline planes than on their own mainline aircraft if american eagle airlines dismal baggage handling in was charged to parent american airlines the mishandled baggage rate for amr corp s american would have been higher the number of flights canceled by northwest airlines corp in march would have jumped if its partner pinnacle airlines inc had been included the dot numbers published monthly are closely watched by both airlines and some consumers several airlines use good performance in their marketing and pay employee bonuses based on their ranking the data are also used in various industry rankings of airlines regional airlines say the operational infirmities often arent their fault they blame the mainline carriers who handle everything from selling tickets scheduling flights and issuing frequent flier miles to deciding which flights to cancel or delay regionals do have control over issues like crews and maintenance that can affect delays and cancellations but when bad weather hits big hubs its the major airlines that order delays and cancellations at their regional partners in order to get the biggest planes moving first jonathan ornstein the chief executive mesa air group inc which operates flights for ual corp s united airlines us airways group inc and delta said he complained to the dot last week that his airline was being unfairly slammed in statistics for problems over which it had no control "combining the results would be a more accurate reflection for the consumer who knows hes booking on united and thats it " mr ornstein said expressjet holdings inc which flies mostly for continental agrees "the majors ought to be held accountable its the major that can put the pressure on the regional to perform " said karen miles an expressjet vice president regional airlines themselves are under increased financial pressure because bankrupt major airlines have negotiated contracts for services at reduced prices and now switch regional partners if one underbids another and as regional operations have deteriorated the issue has grown in importance "the poor performing regionals can effectively hide in plain view of the consumer " says dean headley a wichita state university professor who compiles an annual ranking of airlines based on the dot statistics some big airlines actually support combining their statistics with the regionals even if it would make their numbers look worse "i would be very pleased to do it its our brand thats at risk " said jim whitehurst deltas chief operating officer about one quarter of deltas passengers fly on a "delta connection" carrier and delta wants them to think of it as delta the major airline is trying to hold everyone accountable for regional performance he said to drive improvement other airlines however say combining results would add complexity and possibly confusion "a traveler who doesnt do a lot of regional airline flying might be benefited more by having mainline only statistics available and vice versa " said a spokesman for continental the dot says airlines are required by law to tell consumers the name of the airline actually operating the aircraft so having airlines report separately offers consumers more specific data regional airlines have always been listed separately though it has only been in the past few years that many grew large enough to be required to report performance data publicly "listing the carriers separately enables consumers to learn which has the better performance " the dot said in a statement but since airlines do change dance partners frequently as they look for the best bids for service and most regional airlines fly for multiple mainline carriers checking the record of regional airlines can be difficult skywest airlines which has a good on time report flies for both united and delta and likely would offset some of the damage to deltas record from comair consumers can look up performance of individual flights at services like www flightstats com and the dot report http airconsumer ost dot gov reports index htm does include breakdowns by carrier at major airports so you can check comairs performance at boston in march compared to mainline deltas some industry officials say that if airlines are allowed to segregate results regional airlines will continue to perform poorly in customer service but lumping them together in the dot reports would pressure mainline carriers to make improvements "they should show what the airline that is selling tickets is doing to the public " said john prater president of the air line pilots association which represents mainline and regional airline pilots hidden delays government data on flight delays cancellations and lost luggage often underreport snafus at big airlines because they dont include regional partners some examples delta on time performance was in feb but slid to when including its two biggest partners continental canceled of flights in feb the percentage jumps to when partner expressjet is included
