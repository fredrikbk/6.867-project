business technology talking tech how to build a better program first a designer has to hate it german software maker sap founded in is the worlds largest provider of "enterprise" software the programs with which big companies run themselves with its success however has come a reputation for making cumbersome products that average workers find extremely hard to use hasso plattner the companys co founder and chairman of its supervisor board has in recent years been interested in the issues of software design and how programs can be made friendlier he teaches a class in the topic for engineers at stanford university and its a frequent theme in his speeches he discussed it with talking tech last week q why do you think sap has such a bad reputation in software design a to a large in extent its the consequence of the companys success the broader your software the more people are using it and pressuring designers of the software to move in different directions so the overall complexity keeps growing q is this more of a problem at big companies a having large companies as customers for developing software doesnt lead to the simplest approach large companies are even more complicated than we are i saw this in several projects i worked on as soon as a large company came in as a design partner the complexity went up like a rocket they know its a complicated project but they dont have the energy or the will to make it simple by contrast the smaller company says "i cannot handle this complexity why dont you boil it down to two screens " q dont programmers object to making software complicated a where you give software developers a choice of doing the simple thing or the more complicated thing they go for the more complicated thing because theres more reward for doing it theyll say "anybody can do the simple stuff the complicated stuff only we can do " q how about the way a company like sap designs software a we talk too much to intermediaries we dont talk enough to the real end users in the department we dont live in departments anymore even if we work intensively with the customer we work with their it department q what do your students think of saps software a a student has to hate it you cannot as a student understand why enterprises are complicated you think that the software could just come out of the internet as a service like oh waste management q what would well designed enterprise software be like a it accommodates the needs of different users when i do simpler tasks then the system has to be as smart as helpful as polite as convenient as possible what im when i do major things the system that has to do all the major functions systems need to bridge that span they have to come with multiple attitudes towards the user it shouldnt just be "thats me and thats how you do it " we cant really say it will ever be fun to use enterprise systems because a lot of it is regulations and how the company works the softwares not for you its for someone else but it should be painless it should be helpful
