the goal is mideastern peace at annapolis jeff robbins article "the perils of engagement" op ed nov should be a "must read" for the secretary of state members of the state department and our enlightened media mr robbins would do us all a great service if he publishes a follow up scholarly article on why the hundreds of thousands of jewish refugees from arab lands who escaped to israel leaving all their possessions behind are no longer refugees while the arabs who became refugees as a result of their violent rejection of the u n partition plan for two states one jewish and one arab are still living in refugee camps supported by the u n even at a time when as mr robbins reminds us arab countries are awash with petrodollars the so called moderate palestinian leadership to this day refuses to accept the fact that israel was created as the only tiny jewish state in the world pursuant to the u n resolution of and israels war of survival and independence ezekiel bahar professor university of nebraska lincoln lincoln neb one wonders whether the "poor choices" made by the members of the arab league since so well described by jeff robbins were actually intended to have the continuous irresolution we have witnessed mr robbins correctly asserts that a palestinian state could have been formed by the league during the period yet there was no attempt to do so more puzzling however is that since the war syria has been the only league member demanding the return of captured territory the golan heights when egypt and later jordan entered into discussions with israel culminating in peace treaties neither demanded a return of the territories they administered prior to the war as necessary conditions for their agreements to peace settlements not only would that have been consistent with the leagues current demand for an israeli return to the pre borders but its consummation could easily have resulted in egypt and jordan collaborating in the formation of a new palestinian state out of their returned territories since this condition never occurred calling it a "poor choice" rather than a deliberate choice by two league countries not really wanting a new palestinian state seems now to be obvious bertrand horwitz asheville n c in reading jeff robbins commentary i was struck by the cowardice shown by most of israels defenders in the journal mr robbins states that the failure in the middle east peace process is mainly attributable to the palestinians arab states bill clinton europe and russia if mr robbins is truly confident in his view that israel has no blame in the failure of the peace process why does he hide certain facts such as israel talking peace while continuing to expand jewish settlements demolishing palestinian homes separating palestinian families conducting assassinations cutting off water supply to the population and rejecting gaza investment proposals from dubai the arab side of the debate and conflict is equally guilty of hiding inconvenient and ugly facts if palestinians israelis and the u s are not willing to acknowledge and use real facts rather than myth an end to the conflict is unlikely donald a jordan doha qatar mr robbins assumes that the arab world and palestinian leadership want to improve the lot of the average palestinian not true he assumes they want to solve the palestinian refugee problem not true he assumes they want to live in peace with israel not necessarily true if plo leaders wanted to improve the lot of the average palestinian they would not have started an intifada that resulted in numerous hardships and ill feelings between them and israel if they cared about the refugees they would have resettled them decades ago throughout the world and arab world its time to look at the true goals of the palestinian and arab leadership first and foremost they want to remain in power one must look at their culture and understand what they find of value and what they dont then and only then will peace become a reality charles plushnick brooklyn n y
