promotion sending short films to google inc s youtube and other popular video sites advertising everything from root beer to blenders to bullet resistant backpacks for one thing its hard to beat the price it costs nothing to put something on a video sharing site unlike buying television time or a regular internet ad and the videos let companies use a creative and personal touch that wouldnt work in traditional ads "its so different than the message driven approach to marketing that most kinds of advertising is " says david meerman scott author of "the new rules of marketing and pr " "you dont have to talk about your product per se you can just have fun with it " but that leaves some big questions for companies that want to try their hand at videos how does a small business thrive in a youtube world what makes some videos skyrocket in viewership and others bomb are there guiding principles that will produce a bankable ad many entrepreneurs say luck or timing had at least something to do with their success but a closer look at their stories reveals valuable lessons that any small business can apply here then are some of the most successful small business videos and the factors that took them to the top blendtec be funny by far the most common element among successful videos is comedy rather than offering airless advertisements or canned commercial messages these videos deliver laughs as well as pitching a product case in point blendtec a division of k tec inc of orem utah in the past year the high end blender maker has drawn more than million views for its "will it blend " video series the premise is simple a laconic host blendtec ceo tom dickson uses the companys blenders to grind up everything from credit cards to golf clubs to an iphone cheesy music plays in the background and cheesy jokes fly freely george wright blendtecs director of marketing says the series got started with a simple observation he realized that mr dickson tested his blenders by putting x boards inside and letting them rip retail sales of the blenders have shot up since the company started the series last year this year total sales are projected to top &# million and the series has brought blendtec tremendous name recognition when employees demonstrate the products at big box retailers people come out and say "thats the blender that can blend marbles " says mr wright "before that employees were having to introduce the company " the videos have also brought some new opportunities earlier this year novell inc a waltham mass provider of open source software and services paid blendtec about &# to do a "will it blend " video for a company event in the movie a number of items got blended a microsoft vista cd razor blades a stuffed animal a flash drive and a red bull beverage "we thought this would be something fun for our customer base " says russ dastrup novells corporate videographer the message "novell technology allows you to blend a variety of operating systems and applications into a seamless network " mr dastrup says mj safety solutions tap into current events at first glance "my childs pack" breaks all the rules of online video it isnt funny or entertaining in fact its downright somber but it has gotten nearly hits on youtube since early august because of its timely message the video begins with a startling statistic " school shooting incidents with injury or death in north america since columbine " it segues into photographs and news clips of the columbine and virginia tech shootings then comes the pitch a bullet resistant backpack from mj safety solutions llc of danvers mass co founder joe curran a carpenter for a construction company says the company has sold backpacks at &# each since the video was released he says the company has also received hundreds of thank you letters from concerned parents and a local police officer has started buying the backpacks for his grandchildren the seed for mj safety was planted in in the wake of the columbine shootings mr curran and the other founder mike pelonzi started talking about their own kids and how ineffective their school policy would be in the event of a shooting they decided that there was a need for "products out there to protect children in that situation " says mr pelonzi this summer when the backpack was finally ready for release the boston herald planned to publish an article about it the co founders knew that a visual demonstration would help so they cribbed together a short video with the help of family and employees toward the end of the clip mr currans year old daughter amanda gamely smiles as she holds up the backpack to shield her head and chest the boston herald provided a link to the youtube video and the groundswell started "in reality were just concerned dads " mr curran says "were not business marketing geniuses it just happened that way " all natural maine root find a partner most small businesses dont have the resources for an in house video production staff so finding a partner such as an advertising agency can help get a video campaign off the ground or spiff up a lackluster idea but there are a couple of caveats this option may end up costing thousands of dollars a significant payout for most entrepreneurs and a lot more than most companies spend on promotional videos its also crucial for companies to shop around for the right partner the videos will turn out better if the ad agency understands the small business well and plays to its strengths for instance back in all natural maine root llc an organic soda maker in scarborough maine was looking to boost sales but had scant resources for a marketing campaign it found a good partner in door number inc of austin texas the ad agency liked the product and clicked with the companys founders mark and matt seiler and the agency saw the chance to do a campaign that would showcase its own creative abilities that led door number to give the soda makers a big break on price maine root paid about &# for the campaign but the campaign could have easily cost between &# and &# says mary pat mueller president of door number the two companies decided the best approach to the videos was comedy "the key to a successful viral video campaign is to make people laugh " ms mueller says "that way theyll want to pass it on and that way theyll look like the hero and the deliverer of the entertainment " the concept also fit the seiler brothers personalities "their sense of humor is their brand " ms mueller says "if you meet them at tastings theyre outgoing theyre always joking " together the two firms came up with a premise for the campaign mock exposes about soda root beer activists pull off a late night break in at a corporate root beer facility to free maine root soda bottles from the director of fructose injection a "sugarcane shuffle" rapper riffs about how "i like my root beer all natural cause sugarcane is all my tongue will allow all the others just taste like puppy chow so maine root just stand and take a bow " door number sent the videos to several sites including youtube stupidvideos com ifilm com purevideo com and tvlinks com it also created a dedicated site for the clips freerangerootbeer com to spread the word the agency contacted popular root beer and soda blogs major media outlets such as cnbc and cbss "early show " also picked up on the story the results have been dramatic before the campaign began last fall maine root averaged about &# a year in retail sales so far this year sales have soared to more than &# million "door number played a huge part in our success " says mark seiler maine roots co founder "they kind of took a chance on us and i think it really worked " make magazine be useful entertainment value

life " says phillip torrone senior editor at make "its not like a youtube video thats a second funny thing it might be something that they can watch over and over again " of course entertainment value is still important even if it isnt the main focus of the videos for instance make realized it would need a charismatic host to make the clips lively mr torrone discovered bre pettis an art teacher from seattle who had been videoblogging about his students art projects mr pettis mr torrone says was like mr rogers mr wizard and bill nye "the science guy" rolled into one makes publisher dale dougherty agreed to bring mr pettis on board in early after seeing a video of mr pettis accidentally harpooning his cellphone "there was a bad boy kind of thing that i liked about it " mr dougherty
