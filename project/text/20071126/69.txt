the fcc plays monopoly with all due respect to kevin martin were beginning to wonder if the head of the federal communications commission knows the first thing about the cable industry he regulates at a meeting scheduled for tomorrow chairman martin plans to push a slew of new regulations on cable operators among other things he wants to force cable companies to reduce by as much as the already regulated rates they charge to lease channels to programmers he also wants to require cable operators to settle carriage disputes like the current one involving the nfl network through an arbitration system set up by the fcc apparently mr martin a republican appointee to the agency no less has lost faith in the free markets ability to handle commercial disputes either that or he has some personal animus against cable mr martin says more regulation is needed because monopolistic players are dominating the cable industry but his premise doesnt remotely square with reality comcast the nations largest cable provider recently reported a drop in subscriptions cable share prices generally are getting hammered trading near week lows according to a report last week in broadcasting &amp cable since comcasts last earnings report its stock is down time warner is down cablevision is down and charter communication is off meanwhile cable competitors satellite providers and phone companies are gaining subscribers and market share satellite which is now of the pay tv market added new customers last quarter while former ma bell company video subscriptions were up by more than a quarter million the latter are likely to grow in particular as the companies roll out their new fiber networks these are indications of a robust competitive industry where consumer choice is growing in an attempt to justify expanding the fccs dominion over cable mr martin has dusted off an obscure provision in the cable communications act of known as the " rule " it says that if the fcc finds that cable service is available to of households and or more of those households subscribe then the agency may "promulgate any additional rule necessary to provide diversity of information sources " since cable tv has been available to more than of homes for years the only issue is whether of those homes are now subscribing to that end the fcc issues an annual video competition report last years survey like all the ones before it showed cable penetration rates below given industry trends that show satellite providers and the telcos gaining customers at the expense of cable thats hardly surprising yet this years report to be released at tomorrows meeting is expected to show that cable has finally reached the threshold that gives the fcc the green light to impose more regulations mr martin achieves this result essentially by cooking the books he has cherry picked data and single handedly changed the methodology for determining penetration rates as fellow gop commissioner robert mcdowell put it in a recent speech mr martins compilation of penetration data is a "radical departure for the commission a departure being made without sufficient chance for public comment " if the chairman wants to change the way his agency assesses cable penetration thats his prerogative but it should be done in the open where the changes can be properly scrutinized not in secret to support a predetermined outcome in any case mr martins machinations are in the service of solving a problem that doesnt exist if anything the rule needs to be scrapped it dates to a time when there was no satellite or phone alternative to cable and cable operators controlled nearly all of the programming that appeared on their systems neither situation still exists mr martin likes to point out that cable rates have increased over the past decade which is true but its also true that consumers are getting much more for their money ten years ago the average cable customer received channels today that customer receives on a per channel basis cable rates have fallen more people also subscribe to "bundles" that allow them to receive cable phone and internet service from a single provider as a result consumers today are paying less than it cost to buy those services separately years ago to justify his meddling mr martin describes a marketplace that doesnt exist he pretends theres no directv and echostar option he pretends that verizon and at&amp ts video offerings pose no threat to comcast and time warner but if the fcc chairman is most concerned about costs the goal should be more competition via different platforms in other words he should want current trends to continue his odd and untimely proposals are more likely to retard them
