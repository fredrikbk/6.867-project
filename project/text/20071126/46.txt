politics &amp economics retailers face the test of testing closer oversight of toys is designed to head off costly suits new laws with the start of the holiday season and worries over the safety of imported toys leading retailers say they are stepping up testing before toys hit store shelves retesting toys already in their inventories and toughening demands on manufacturers and importers toys "r" us inc says it now requires suppliers to identify the name and address of the factory that produced items and to certify that third party testing has found each batch of goods to be safe target corp says it has expanded testing for its store brand toys including testing at multiple stages of the production process for small parts and lead paint j c penney co says it is retesting toys that it sold over the past two years and has turned up at least one a christmas tree ornament that was judged unsafe prompting a government recall wal mart stores inc says it has been pulling some toys off store shelves since august retesting them for problems such as lead contamination and choking hazards the company says it has been sending toys a day to laboratories for testing retailers want among other things to head off lawsuits and legislation that could hurt their business but extra testing might not be enough to assuage consumers and stave off stepped up enforcement as well as new laws that would increase fines and give regulators more authority to crack down on unsafe goods lead is a particular concern because it can cause neurological damage especially in young children consumer groups and some state officials doubt that retailers testing is helping last week an environmental health group said it had purchased toys with excessive levels of lead and the u s public interest research group said it too found unsafe toys on store shelves california attorney general jerry brown and new york attorney general andrew cuomo both took action to stop sales of toys containing high levels of lead mr browns office filed a lawsuit against mattel inc and other defendants including wal mart and toys "r" us alleging violations of state environmental laws for selling lead tainted toys mattel said in a statement the case would be "beneficial to all parties " mr cuomos office reached a settlement with retailers and distributors to stop sales of childrens jewelry with high lead content this year more than million toys and childrens items including lunch kits and bibs have been recalled by the federal consumer product safety commission many were made in china prompting calls for greater oversight of imported goods the house and senate are moving separate bills that would increase fines for making or selling unsafe products and apply stricter testing and safety standards including tighter limits on lead in childrens products the bills also would empower state attorneys general to enforce federal product safety laws a step that manufacturers and retailers say would open the doors to more litigation similar house and senate bills were approved in committees before congresss thanksgiving break the legislation would speed up public disclosure about potentially dangerous or defective products addressing concerns by consumer advocates and others that the recall process is too slow and that injuries continue while negotiations between the cpsc and manufacturers drag on in addition several bills in the house and senate would require premarket testing and certification by independent third party laboratories for childrens products the national retail federation and the toy industry association say they generally support legislative proposals to increase funding and staffing for the cpsc so does the national association of manufacturers but they oppose specific proposals to empower state authorities and whistleblowers and the national association of manufacturers is particularly opposed to any measure that would reduce confidentiality protections that shield the identities of manufacturers and their products during an investigation until a corrective action such as a recall is ordered by the agency beyond product safety legislation retailers worry that sales could plummet if consumers fears arent allayed according to a harris interactive poll a third of americans said they will buy fewer toys this year because of safety recalls and nearly half said they will avoid buying products made in china "this is a ceo level problem " says frank burkitt a principal at deloitte consulting llp who is advising companies on supply chain issues unless companies can get a handle on the issue an increasing number will find their reputations and bottom lines hurt by recalls and product liability lawsuits he says insurance companies are adding to the pressure for testing more companies are adding recall insurance which covers expenses of recovering bad products to their product liability coverage says bill harrison managing director of the crisis management practice at insurer aon corp over the past year he says insurers began requiring manufacturers to do better record keeping and vetting of suppliers "they want to know about the procurement process and the quality control mandated of the suppliers and of the co packers as well as of the brand name manufacturer itself " mr harrison says at j c penney peter mcgrath executive vice president and director of product development and sourcing says testing and retesting of products has greatly increased in the past year as concerns about childrens products have grown "we have had only one or two recalls a year while i have been here " he says "the list hasnt been long but we are testing everything now with this lead scare " each recall he figures costs about &# which is usually billed back to the manufacturer charles margulis communications director for the center for environmental health in oakland calif isnt convinced that companies are doing enough "there has been attention to this since the summer and for us to be still finding these products is a problem " he says his group recently found nine toys with unacceptably high lead levels and an additional with questionably high levels gerald l storch chairman and chief executive of toys "r" us says his company is now requiring toy suppliers to certify that they are monitoring factories and subcontractors abroad a safety push that fits in with the toy giants overall marketing strategy "the market had shifted into discounters with a heavy price emphasis and we are trying to bring the focus back to service and quality " says mr storch
