small business a special report talk is cheap word of mouth advertising can be targeted inexpensive and effective if done well advertising can be a big problem for a small business it can stretch a limited budget and often doesnt reach the precise audience the business is seeking one alternative is just to get the right people talking helen modly executive vice president of focus wealth management ltd says the middleburg va investment advisory firm has developed a clear profile of the kind of client it wants to attract a female novice investor with at least &# in assets who is around retirement age a yellow pages ad or even an ad on a search engine would draw too broad a response says ms modly instead she and her business partner consulted a map they plotted the locations of area professionals such as attorneys and accountants who are likely to encounter their ideal client type then they started to invite at least two of them to lunch each week to talk about what services focus provides and what kind of clients its looking for the strategy has attracted a steady stream of new clients ms modly says small firms of all kinds are finding creative ways to win new business through word of mouth many are taking advantage of the growth of social networking sites and discussion groups online to help create a buzz about their products or services whatever the approach word of mouth marketing can be a cost effective way to help get a business off the ground or to stay competitive amid growing economic uncertainty the first step in a word of mouth campaign as in any marketing effort is to define the type of customer the business is seeking ms modly and her partner reviewed their files to find the clients with whom they enjoyed the best relationships they werent searching for the most lucrative accounts but rather clients who were most receptive to their advice and those whose names when announced by the receptionist didnt make them want to pass the call to the other partner once the target market is established there may be a number of ways to reach it by word of mouth in focus wealth managements case the partners study of their clients revealed not only the type of customer they wanted to pursue but also a clear strategy for how to reach them all of the best clients had been referred to the firm by attorneys or accountants the firm uses more than free lunches to encourage referrals it also offers limited free service to the professionals it works with for example ms modly says she often receives calls from divorce lawyers she knows whose clients are in the process of deciding whether to forgo alimony payments in exchange for a lump sum settlement ms modly estimates for no charge the relative value of the proposed alimony and lump sum payments over a period of time the lawyers then share those comparisons with their clients and ideally are more inclined to put in a good word for focus wealth management wherever it seems appropriate studiometro llc an interior design firm in denver is pursuing a similar strategy the firms partners lynn williamson and cynthia peacock had a couple of customers sent their way by a real estate agent ms peacocks family had long worked with now theyre trying to cultivate similar relationships with other real estate agents the partners joined a networking group for small independent real estate brokerage firms in the denver area hoping the agents will mention studiometro to their clients specifically the young single urban dwellers who are the ideal clients for the design firm the fact that the real estate firms are mostly one or two person businesses gives studiometro a better shot at making a lasting impression on them than they would have with big regional or national firms the partners say and the agents could provide entree to a potentially huge market since they cover an area where many high rise residential buildings have gone up in recent years the partners meet agents and others in the real estate industry at weekly tours of residential properties sponsored by the networking group companies looking to attract customers from a broader geographic area are finding the internet to be a powerful tool for generating buzz j&amp ds down home enterprises llc in issaquah wash sells bacon salt a seasoning that makes foods taste like bacon since potential customers may have

began discussing the software on the yahoo site according to mr szalvay he and his brother laszlo danubes co founder and chief executive joined those discussions along with staff experts and also initiated talk elsewhere online about the scrum method in blogs and newsgroups all of these efforts allowed them to reach their target audience and spread the word about their company at no cost danube also worked offline to get people talking about its software by inviting businesses from the seattle area to a demonstration one attendee stood up and gave an impromptu testimonial about how pleased he was with scrumworks mr szalvay says a recommendation that "seemed to provide tremendous credibility" for the product and may have contributed to danubes later winning one of the other
