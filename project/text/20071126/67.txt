the evening wrap pushing peace online edition prime actors in the long stalled peace process between palestinians and israel are about to meet in the u s though many doubt they have the political support at home to deliver any breakthroughs israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas met separately with president bush at the white house today and the three leaders voiced hope that peace could be achieved in a region that been mired in conflict for decades yesterday an arab holdout to the conference syria agreed to send its deputy foreign minister to the summit which marks the first time in more than a decade that israel a large group of arab states and international envoys from around the world sit down together to work on the peace process the meeting gets under way with a dinner tonight at the state department and continues in annapolis md tomorrow the last serious effort at reaching a permanent accord came under president clinton who with only about six months left in his presidency tried to broker a deal at camp david that initiative eventually failed and a surge in fighting in the middle east followed administration officials took pains to point out that tomorrows conference is not a negotiating session rather it would lay the groundwork for formal negotiations somewhere down the line whats on the table isnt exactly clear as israelis and palestinians struggle to agree on what their u s hosts call a "workplan" for the coming talks the lack of an outline hints at the thorniness of the core issues which include recognition of israel the fate of palestinian refugees and control over the holy city of jerusalem finding middle ground would be difficult in any circumstances but both messrs olmert and abbas are facing fierce political opposition at home which weakens their ability to strike any grand bargains leaders of the islamic militant group hamas which won palestinian parliamentary elections last year and then violently overran the gaza strip in june have called mr abbas a traitor even for attending to the meeting and have promised to reject any decisions to come out of it meanwhile in israel more than israelis gathered at jerusalems western wall to protest the conference and israeli opposition leader benjamin netanyahu called it "a continuation of one sided concessions " in such an environment middle east analysts suggest the timing isnt ripe for any major breakthroughs in an opinion piece published earlier this month richard n haass president of the council on foreign relations recently surveyed the political standing of both mr abbas and mr olmert and wrote that "trying to end the middle east conflict in such a climate would be futile worse yet failure would strengthen those on both sides of the dispute who argue that diplomacy is a waste of time " taking note of a recent spate of violence between hamas and supporters of the palestinian government in the west bank washington institute for near east policy analyst mohammad yaghi wrote that "the push for diplomatic progress at annapolis has already exacerbated the confrontation between fatah and hamas " adding that the "diplomatic prospects have raised the stakes of the debate over who has the political legitimacy to negotiate with israel " and writing for the middle east institute greg myre wrote that "olmert and abbas are so weak among their own constituencies that any promises they make at the talks in annapolis maryland will immediately raise questions about their ability to deliver " mr myre added that "the timing of the annapolis talks feels artificial and forced motivated by an administration trying to show it is doing something no matter how long the odds " stocks tumble stocks plunged monday as

gizmo is essentially a video screen that is mounted on a gravestone and programmed with a tribute to the departed four hours of sun provides enough power to play a minute show on a inch lcd screen about six times there are even headphone jacks to listen to the audio a quick visit to the vidstone web site offers you a chance to see a sample tribute strangely dedicated to the serenity panel itself which it seems lived a remarkable full life from to the video montage is replete with airborne camera shots through wispy clouds images of the statue of liberty and a picture of a panting dog under which the words "my companion" appear i found myself getting choked up by the tear jerking piano music that played as a backdrop and i hardly even knew serenity panel it might take a bit of time
