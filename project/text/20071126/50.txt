security labor needs and law enforcement in his nov op ed "food for thought" tom nassif protests our administrations efforts to enforce immigration law with a rule that drives employers to check when their employees have mismatched social security numbers unlike some critics who wrongly claim the rule would penalize legal workers mr nassif is commendably candid about the real complaint this rule will force employers to obey the law and to resolve the mismatches for illegal workers mr nassif fears that if some agricultural labor consists of illegal workers the result would be devastating for agricultural businesses we agree that there is a shortage of legal workers for agriculture clearly the best way forward is for congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform if we are to fully secure our borders uphold the rule of law and meet our economys labor needs we must reform immigration law in the meantime we are also working on ways to fix certain policies within existing law including our h a temporary worker program but we must part company with mr nassifs suggestion that the "fix" for the agricultural labor shortage is for the department of homeland security to allow businesses to close their eyes to the legality of their work force that would amount to a silent amnesty this sort of connivance with illegal work is exactly what has bred deep public cynicism about whether government really intends to enforce the law the answer is that we will continue to enforce the law as it is even as we try to make changes to the law that will enhance legal pathways for agricultural workers stewart baker assistant secretary for policy u s department of homeland security washington so tom nassif doesnt want to enforce the immigration laws by verifying workers social security numbers because he wants to continue to exploit the low wages of illegal immigrants to insure his company profits why does he not instead support an expansion of legal immigration to fill those jobs robert hardaway denver
