small business a special report hr in a box most small firms cant afford a human resources department new software aims to fill that gap when human resources executive ed steinberg joined starcite inc a year ago he found himself facing a big administrative headache the philadelphia event planning company had recently completed a big merger but mr steinberg and other officials realized that the other company hadnt been doing performance reviews so starcite couldnt effectively judge the new workers "it made it pretty difficult to have faith in the team " mr steinberg says he couldnt change what had been done but he wanted to get the whole company on the same page with evaluations a big part of his solution software from successfactors inc of san mateo calif starcites president can post company goals to a central web site and managers can use them to set targets for employees the system stores all of the information about employees such as salary and past performance for easy reference and it creates a pay for performance culture that wasnt possible before mr steinberg says so far starcite has paid about &# for the software including setup costs and monthly fees managing human resources is a common struggle for companies like starcite small companies generally have few if any people dedicated to the job and as the companies grow their ad hoc systems often based on excel spreadsheets and emails quickly become obsolete now a growing crop of software products aim to help growing businesses get their human resources functions up to speed small business people who use the products say they have a number of big advantages the software typically doesnt require complicated installation or database management many of the vendors offer a monthly subscription model making them useful for commitment phobes worried about cost and not only do the products help manage standard housekeeping chores like annual reviews they help companies better identify and reward top employees which keeps them from defecting to outfits with deeper pockets a generally tight labor market "puts a premium on small and midsized businesses to come up with other ways of satisfying their work force to make sure high performance individuals have a career plan " says robert anderson vice president of small and medium size business applications at research company gartner inc in atlanta in the past couple of years more software companies have trained their sights on this market another well known vendor taleo corp focused mainly on big companies until when it acquired a vendor with products for small and midsize companies early this year the company spun out a dedicated unit for small and medium size businesses these days small companies can choose among dozens of human resources products offering web based systems to track employee performance streamline recruiting and create and organize employee reviews "a lot of vendors are targeting this market " says brian wilkerson national practice director for talent management at human resources consulting company watson wyatt in denver "done right it can really reduce the burden on hr " the employee mark he adds is when many companies realize they need a more regimented system that keeps better track of employee and applicant information the right software can ease the transition for a growing company and its managers mr wilkerson says some of the software for example will suggest phrases to a manager who has never completed a written performance review before lets say the software asks the supervisor to rate an employee on a scale of to if the manager chooses a the system might suggest writing that the employee was an outstanding performer and met all goals in a world where even a tiny company may have mobile workers in multiple sites web based systems can also keep a work force connected take opportunity international the oak brook ill nonprofit helps set up loans for small companies and individuals in developing countries although opportunity international has only employees in oak brook it works with partner finance organizations in countries in march jim lemke director of organizational development at the nonprofit visited an affiliated bank in ghana stacks of resumes littered the floor the company was too thinly staffed to respond and had no system for sifting through the applications mr lemke immediately set about looking for a solution and settled on vurv technology of jacksonville fla which didnt charge an upfront fee a boon for the frugal nonprofit instead of soliciting paper resumes vurvs system directs applicants to a web site where theyre asked a series of screening questions about their experience level the results go into the system and the recruiter is automatically notified via email "weve been able to hire faster " says mr lemke "we have a tool to do the work a human was doing on the front end " moreover the product doesnt have to run over the internet which is helpful in a country without universal online access for instance if employees need to review the human resources records from their home computers they can save the files to a flash drive instead of going online to retrieve them the system costs &# a month per user the bank has two for small companies that already have recruiting tools in place a software product can help keep better track of information that comes in in the past candidates interested in jobs at financial information company motley fool in alexandria va could submit their resumes through the companys web site but if recruiter kara chambers wanted to flag and file away information on certain candidates she had to ask her it department to run a complex query it was too much effort to complete on a regular basis after exploring options at an hr trade show and trying out three companies demonstrations she selected a small business product from taleo of dublin calif motley fool pays about &# a month for the product which allows applicants to create a user name and password on motley fools career site and save their information applicants can also modify it later if they want ms chambers gets alerts when someone applies for a job as well as reminders to send feedback to applicants and the software links to her microsoft outlook calendar for scheduling interviews she can also sift through the applicants based on qualifications and keywords the product she adds was "plug and play" she was up and running the same day she paid for it for small businesses the systems dont come without risk for employees who are used to a less structured entrepreneurial environment forms and protocol can seem awfully well corporate starcites mr steinberg says that "some people were concerned about the bureaucracy that this kind of thing brings to the company " he believes though that the ability to identify and reward high performers far outweighs losing a bit of the freewheeling start up feeling without that ability he says "at some point you lose key individuals and lose your book of business " gartners mr anderson also cautions that its easy for small companies to become enamored of the software dreaming of the difference it could make to their business human resources professionals should "make sure they dont bite off more than they can chew " he suggests the product should be easy to manage and use moreover a vendor should be able to demonstrate how the product pays off and have data to back up the claims its not about "a hot demo " says mr anderson "a good vendor worth their salt should have experience selling to your industry and should finish your sentences with regard to your industry needs " another consideration cautions mr anderson is that this market is in its infancy when selecting a vendor he suggests keep in mind the industry may consolidate in the next few years a product could disappear or be folded into a different companys offering on the upside a new highly competitive market means companies are continually adding bells and whistles to their products in august for instance taleo announced a new product that allows a recruiter to hit a button on the companys career site and post job listings on the social networking site facebook because users can subscribe to these products on a month to month basis its relatively easy to move to a product with better features ms covel is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at simona covel wsj com
