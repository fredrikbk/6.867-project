ahead of the tape november slump chills hopes for end of year november has been a dismal month for many of s best performing stocks and that is a potential problem for investors hoping to ride those shares through years end freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold was up for the year at the end of october the miner has fallen this month monsanto was up at the end of last month the agriculture company has fallen since then technology companies have been among the hardest hit apple up at the end of last month is down so far in november and emc which was up has fallen in october alone technology issues in the standard &amp poors stock index rose outpacing the rise registered in the overall index this month the s&amp p has fallen and the technology sector has dropped the technology sectors strong october performance suggests some managers piled into those shares only recently expecting a year end rally to carry them through december and then as the economic outlook deteriorated anew they got caught off side fund managers running underperforming portfolios seem to have been especially prone to this mistake professional investors who are lagging behind the market have a strong incentive to take chances to improve their performance into the end of the year their bonuses depend on beating different market benchmarks one simple way to try for a year end lift was to put money on the stocks doing best and hope they will keep outperforming a great deal of gamesmanship goes into this year end jockeying by professional investors any fund manager chasing the best performing stocks likely knows he isnt alone other investors are likely to do exactly the same thing especially the underperformers so there was some comfort in jumping on the apple or monsanto bandwagon back in october what happens though when everyone starts to lose faith in a momentum trade like this at the same time as seems to have happened in november when the economic outlook deteriorated it helps to think of the game theory classic known as the prisoners dilemma to understand how investors might behave in the prisoners dilemma two suspects are taken by the police and each told separately that they can gain their freedom by testifying against the other if neither testifies they each will serve a six month sentence if one testifies and the other stays silent the one will go free and the other will serve years if both testify both will serve years the best thing is for both to stay mum but the more likely scenario is that each fearful of a long sentence bails on the other and nobody wins similarly for investors hoping to ride the highfliers into the end of the year the best outcome is for nobody to sell most years that is the way it works and year end rallies leave everyone satisfied this year the combination of credit market turmoil and heightened recession risk seems to be forcing a lot of confessions everyone heads for the exits together and that can lead to some unhappy endings send comments to justin lahart wsj com
