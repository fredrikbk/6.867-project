for banks the hurt just goes on options for financing drying up in europe short term rates jump european banks are facing a new wave of financing troubles as the markets where they borrow money take a turn for the worse interest rates in short term lending markets have risen at a pace not seen since august as investors shy away from risk and banks become increasingly wary of lending to one another the trouble has spread to areas that hadnt been severely affected including the trillion euros &# trillion market for covered bonds an equivalent of the u s mortgage backed securities market that was seen as among the safest in an effort to ease the pain central bankers are stepping in with emergency cash injections "theres a genuine fear here of bank failure which i dont think there was in august " said tim bond strategist at barclays capital "the banking systems range of financing options is either very narrow or very expensive " analysts see a number of factors driving the latest bout of stress in lending markets for one banks are hoarding cash as insurance against potential losses on securities backed by subprime home loans many of which still are held in off balance sheet investment funds known as conduits and structured investment vehicles for which the banks could be forced to take responsibility anxiety about losses on subprime investments also has hit money market mutual funds which have been an important source of financing for the conduits and sivs amid concerns they could face massive withdrawals from their own investors the funds are shying away from ious issued by both the banks and their investment vehicles "liquidity specifically cash is king right now " wrote analysts at lehman brothers holdings inc in a recent report "if you do not have it and need to access the capital markets you are likely to have to pay dearly in the current environment " as in august the short term interest rate at which banks lend money to one another known as the london interbank offered rate or libor has increased sharply the three month u s dollar rate reached friday up from on nov the three month euro rate was quoted at on friday up more than percentage point from a week earlier the sharpest rise in that rate since august if sustained the jump in interest rates could take a further bite out of economic growth in the euro zone which already is struggling with the effects of a strengthening currency indeed the latest purchasing managers index a measure of private sector activity fell in november to its lowest point in months according to ntc economics the

archer an economist at global insight and a recent research report from j p morgan chase &amp co suggests the recent tightening in the euro interbank lending rate represents at least as much of a drag on the economy as the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar the mounting troubles in lending markets prompted the european central bank to say friday that it will pump in extra funds through the turn of the year if necessary tomorrow the ecb is expected to supply more than the usual amount of short term loans to euro area banks during its weekly refinancing operation following an operation thursday in which it provided an added billion euros in three month loans the central bank uses the increase or decrease of funding to keep the rates that banks charge one another for short term loans close to its target investors expect the ecb will keep its key policy rate steady at through amid rising inflation even as growth slows a growing minority of economists suspect the market upheaval the strong euro and the u s slowdown will push the ecb to cut its rate by a quarter percentage point perhaps as early as march the actions by central bankers havent been limited to europe last week the bank of canada injected &# billion in short term loans signaling that money markets remain strained throughout the developed world banks are hoping more liquidity arrives next month in the form of stepped up repurchase agreements organized by the federal reserve and the ecb according to a person familiar with the situation in an unusual sign of stress banks are offering to pay well above publicly quoted interest rates for short term loans in the euro commercial paper market where banks and companies issue ious to investors such as money market funds some banks are willing to pay as much as percentage point more than libor according to a person familiar with the market still the market contracted by &# billion in the first three weeks of november as investors shied away
