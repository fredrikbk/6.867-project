to &# billion in funding adding that it doesnt expect a quick fix for the funding problems afflicting such investment entities as a quick refresher sivs are supposed to work by using short term borrowings to finance investment in longer term securities they are kept off the balance sheets to cut risk for banks while also obviating the need to keep more capital on hand to meet federal
