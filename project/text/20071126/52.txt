small business a special report ask nicely theres a right way for franchisers to introduce new technology to their franchisees and a wrong way new technology can create sore spots in a franchiser franchisee relationship franchisers often decide to adopt some whiz bang innovation a new order taking system for example only to run into resistance from franchisees who arent convinced the technology is cost justified or significantly better than what they have franchisees may worry that its installation could disrupt their business require a major employee training commitment prove unreliable or worst of all cost them customers overcoming such reluctance can be tricky and test the strength of a franchise system if franchisees havent been included in the decision making they could view the introduction of what might well be a wise investment in their future as misguided meddling "franchisers say that franchisee satisfaction is one of the most important considerations when theyre rolling out new technology " says jennifer minogue vice president of marketing and strategic services at frantz group a grafton wis firm that helps technology companies achieve sales goals "but too often they issue a mandate you have to do this by a certain date that can be a source of ill will " she knows of one franchiser that was so sure franchisees would rush to invest in a costly computer upgrade that it installed an inbound phone line to take orders for the new system she says the franchiser not expecting opposition was surprised when the phone didnt ring a major equipment upgrade is much more likely to succeed when selecting it is a shared process because "a lot of times franchisees feel they know better what they need than the franchiser " ms minogue says kathy wetzel vice president of information technologies at great clips inc a minneapolis based hair salon chain agrees that involving franchisees early on is a good policy she also finds that salon operators often make a more convincing pitch for technological innovation than do company officials "if you can get a franchisee really excited about the technology its a lot simpler to get it rolled out " she says to speed up credit card and gift card transactions great clips is installing broadband communications in its salons the technology isnt cheap &# upfront and &# a month per site to operate so there were numerous skeptics among the companys franchisees ms wetzel says early on she approached one vocal opponent telling her "if i can convince you and you can see the difference you will be my best spokesperson " the gambit worked ms wetzel says the woman called back and said "youre right i have to eat my words " then proceeded to proselytize other salon owners operators great clips wants eventually to install electronic signature devices in its salons to expedite bill paying ms wetzel already has started explaining the technologys virtues to groups of salon owners many of whom arent technically savvy "i just need to make it easy for them " she says sometimes it is the franchiser that is undecided about a technological change and suggests that a franchisee or two test it out first that happened when joseph gagnon chief executive officer of exit pitched the andover mass firms remote call center system to the fast food chain wendys international inc the response from wendys was "weve got a lot of people telling us they have great concepts we want to see that it works with our customer base our menu our procedures first " mr gagnon says he found a willing guinea pig in miami management a store wendys franchisee in lexington ky miami management agreed to install a call center at one of its restaurant sites to handle drive through orders for all of its stores the system includes devices that take photos of cars so crewpeople at order windows can more easily match meals to vehicles "it is very slick " says brian fields miami managements director of operations "were getting better customer service our order accuracy is better " and because order takers at the call center dont also have to pour drinks or stuff food items in bags they can try to "up sell" customers on additional items he says one way miami management justifies the overall installation expense about &# including construction of a second drive through lane order intercom and menu board at each restaurant plus hardware software and other equipment is by having the center process orders for some wendys franchisees in michigan and vermont too for a fee the more stores the bigger the return on investment mr fields says cost typically is an issue with any operational change and franchisees are always weighing that against how well they are doing an enhancement may look promising but if its payback is years away the investment may not compute vendors continually run up against such concerns "my biggest competition is capital " says exits mr gagnon to ease the financial pain of new technology some franchisers pick up part of the tab mcdonalds corp did that with a new kitchen setup several years ago and many franchisees say they are hoping the fast food giant will do so again if a beverage initiative now being tested is rolled out mcdonalds in an internal memo says it "does intend to participate in the investment" involving the beverage upgrade the company didnt return a call seeking comment most franchisees are focused on their business not technology so when it comes to equipment upgrades the feeling often is "if its not broke its working " says peter barbaresi chief operating officer of delphi display systems inc a costa mesa calif firm that makes electronic order confirmation signs for drive through restaurants "theyre not looking for something to complicate their lives " he says that means that vendors like delphi must make a compelling case that their products will be cost effective and worry free sometimes franchisees push back hard if they think technology is being forced on them when pizza delivery giant dominos pizza inc developed a computerized cash register system in house and called for the software to be run on international business machines corp equipment some franchisees balked they filed suit against dominos in federal district court in minneapolis in objecting to the requirement that they buy hardware from ibm and software from dominos and a federal judge ruled that the plaintiffs should be allowed to procure hardware and software from any source as long as it meets system specifications dominos which contended in court that its franchise contracts gave it the right to require franchisees to use uniform products and equipment and that giving the software source code to franchisees might allow it to fall into the hands of competitors is appealing despite the legal issues the ann arbor mich company says most franchisees are happy with the system which is designed to help stores manage labor and monitor order delivery times in addition to ringing up sales weighing a new computerized cash register system for its restaurant chain churchs chicken decided to first commission a detailed inventory of what franchisees are using now what it discovered was surprising more than a dozen types of devices along with a broad spectrum of technological comfort among operators both findings will figure into the final choice the company says doug pendergast the chains chief franchise officer says he sees little value in picking a complex system that requires a steep learning curve "wed rather our owner operators spend more time dealing with their customers and their teams than trying to learn all the ins and outs of a complex system " he says mr pendergast speaks from experience churchs previous owner afc enterprises inc mandated a single point of sale system for all its fast food restaurants in selling it as being able to do anything a franchisee wanted he recalls the result mr pendergast says was a lot of costly customized programming to fit individual franchisees needs as well as a substantial training commitment when the dust settled the company realized it had spent a lot of time and money on a complex system that many franchisees used only for basic tasks he says this time the decision on what point of sale system to order will be made by a group that includes churchs franchisees with a range of experience and needs "id rather have a solution that works very well for the people who are operating the restaurants" than something that might work best for the headquarters staff mr pendergast says "were not frying any chicken here " mr gibson is a special writer for dow jones newswires in des moines iowa he can be reached at dick gibson dowjones com
