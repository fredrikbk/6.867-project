the health care cost crisis is all too real john r graham in "the health cost myth" op ed nov sees no problem with our rising health costs because our economic productivity is very high and after paying for health care we still have on average more money left per capita in our economy than other countries this spurious argument ignores these facts rising health costs currently threaten to bankrupt the u s treasury according to the congressional budget office the ceos of some of our largest businesses are saying the same thing about their companies public spending on health care is rising faster than gdp so spending on other essential public needs must be reduced or taxes increased most health care spending is not discretionary but is dictated by illness and injury and by the decisions of providers and insurers who profit from a system in which price competition cannot function as it does in other parts of our economy finally as mr graham acknowledges "averages obscure many harsh realities and hide the fact that many americans are unable to afford health care " further the numbers of uninsured and underinsured continue to rise as health costs increase the health cost crisis is not a "myth " arnold s relman m d harvard medical school boston in response to mr grahams commentary i feel compelled to point out that the author assumes that the rationale behind universal health care is cost containment mr graham misses the point the people advocating universal health care are addressing the lack of access to care something the author only acknowledges is a flaw of the current system at the end of the article it is a terrible shame that this country manages to spend vast sums more on health care than other countries it competes with yet still leaves of the population without health insurance our system may allow some workers to take home a bigger piece of the pie but it strikes me as immoral to make profits and celebrate this as mr graham does at the expense of our fellow americans health hillary j mull doctoral candidate boston university school of public health boston mr graham makes some good points but he omits some significant additional costs to the "underpaid" workers of europe their health care isnt "free" they pay to of their income in taxes to support their health care system they pay in most cases an income tax which averages higher than that imposed on american workers with the same base pay additional levies in europe make doing the calculation on the basis of adjusted gross income very difficult they all pay an extremely regressive "value added tax" on most consumption at rates between and americans who say they dont earn enough to pay for their health care but seem to afford suvs soccer camps and second homes really arent paying attention as to how they spend their "disposable" income paul wisgerhof fairfax va
