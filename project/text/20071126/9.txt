cashing in an insurance man builds a lively business in death as life settlements boom banks regulators circle betting on larry king fort washington pa alan buerger wants to show investors the upside of death the former insurance salesman runs coventry first llc which lets investors essentially bet on and profit from other peoples demise his company is in the business of buying rights to life insurance policies in an arrangement known as a "life settlement " coventry pays the holder a lump sum for the policy now takes over paying the premiums for as long as the insured person lives then collects the benefits generally worth far more when the person dies coventry keeps some of the policies in its own portfolio it sells others to institutional investors from an investors standpoint as a general rule the sooner these people die the better this positions mr buerger at the forefront of a controversial but rapidly growing industry so far the life settlement business involves a tiny slice of the &# trillion in individual death benefits pending in the u s but an industry trade group the life insurance settlement association has grown from member companies at the decades beginning to today including major firms such as deutsche bank ag now banks including goldman sachs group inc credit suisse group and bear stearns cos want to expand the industry further in april these banks helped form the institutional life markets association to lobby against efforts to restrict the business some wall street firms are also seeking to buy policies more directly trying to cut out parties such as coventry this year cantor fitzgerald lp set up an internet based exchange for those who want to sell or buy policy rights life settlements stir objections and not only because they make some people squeamish some state regulators have called life settlement terms unfavorable in some cases to policyholders theyve also charged that certain arrangements flout the spirit of laws designed to keep speculators from taking out policies on strangers policyholders too have lodged complaints television talk show host larry king filed a lawsuit in october against a maryland insurance brokerage claiming he got a raw deal when he sold two policies on his life with face values totaling &# million for &# million among his complaints with one of the policies mr king says he doesnt know who has a financial interest in seeing him dead among the biggest critics are the insurers that issue the policies that make up the life settlement trade some such as metlife inc say the concept turns what they say should be protection for surviving family members into a vehicle for speculators insurers dont generally protest when people sell policies theyve held for a long time but many such as axa equitable life insurance co a unit of axa sa oppose deals in which the policy is purchased with the intent of transferring it quickly to an investor a phenomenon some call stranger originated life insurance life settlements also threaten the business model for life insurers each year about of life insurance policies lapse according to the insurance information institute a trade group as people forget about them or decide they dont need them anymore coventry and its rivals raise the prospect that fewer policies will be abandoned leaving insurers to pay out more in death benefits meanwhile insurers already pay an often small sum to policyholders who cancel coverage but they may have to find a way to pay more to compete with life settlement firms payouts "that would drive the premiums through the roof " says metlifes chief executive rob henrikson a battle between the nascent life settlement industry and insurers is expected to play out over the coming year in individual states where insurance is regulated and laws covering life settlements are spotty and varied at the core of the battle is mr buerger his firm based in fort washington pa has bought the rights to life insurance policies with face values of &# billion since he says that puts coventry among the industrys top players overall in the u s life insurance policies worth &# billion were traded from to estimates conning research &amp consulting inc a hartford conn firm that tracks the insurance industry others believe the figure is higher mr buerger wont disclose his privately held companys revenues though he says they increased fivefold from to this year for the fourth year in a row he treated coventry employees and their family members people in all to an all expenses paid trip to paradise island in the bahamas coventry gave each traveler a &# credit to spend on things like fishing trips and restaurants he says mr buerger grew up in the philadelphia area the son of a ham radio equipment salesman who was nicknamed "ham" buerger the younger buerger first tried selling life insurance in his early s eventually joining the former shearson firm where he catered to wealthy clients he left in to start running his own life insurance agency called coventry group now years old mr buerger has the optimistic demeanor of a polished salesman in an interview at coventrys headquarters in this leafy philadelphia suburb he invokes the movie "field of dreams " known for the line "if you build it he will come " he says "thats how we see this business " in the early s mr buerger sold a controversial product called corporate owned life insurance sometimes called janitors insurance in which firms took out policies on their employees and collected when they died in congress pared some tax breaks associated with those policies he sought new opportunities he attended a seminar on "viaticals " a strategy popular in the early s that was tailored to terminally ill aids patients wanting to sell their life insurance policies the development of life extending aids drugs largely put an end to the business mr buerger never sold viaticals but he concluded that the idea of buying life insurance payouts could be applied to a much larger pool he reasoned that relatively healthy wealthy seniors often no longer need policies they may have purchased years earlier for instance to benefit now grown children "i felt like i was struck by lightning " he says he formed coventry first in taking out an &# home equity loan to make early purchases it remains a family business mr buerger is chief executive officer while his wife son and daughter in law hold senior positions life settlements resonated with older americans whose retirement years were stretching longer than many had anticipated the deals also appealed to policyholders who wanted ready cash for a valuable asset much like reverse mortgages which let older homeowners turn their home equity into income that doesnt have to be repaid until they sell their homes or die stephen ellis needed cash quickly when he went over budget on a new house he was building so the year old mortgage banker from annapolis md started shopping two policies with a combined death benefit of &# million that he had taken out on his year old mother mr ellis had been paying &# a year for the policies he says but the insurer would have paid him virtually nothing to cash them out he fielded bids through a life settlement broker chesapeake financial settlements llc in rockville md a small firm offered &# he accepted "i didnt really look at it as morbid " says mr ellis who supports his mother financially "i thought wow what an incredible way to put a value on this " his mother has been in poor health but approved of the sale to benefit him now rather than later he says she was unavailable for comment some critics say families would generally benefit more by hanging on to the policies in the larry king lawsuit filed in u s district court in los angeles the year old talk show host alleges that the meltzer group inc an insurance brokerage in bethesda md breached its fiduciary duties the complaint alleges that in the brokerage advised mr king to set up a trust that would buy and then immediately resell a &# million policy for &# given mr kings age health and finances the suit says he would have been better off keeping the policy to benefit his estate in part thats because the sale of the policy generated income taxes his heirs likely would have taken no income tax hit because life insurance payouts are typically exempt the suit also alleges the broker didnt fully disclose commissions and other fees on this transaction and a second one involving a &# million policy the suit alleges these charges totaled at least &# thats equivalent to the after tax proceeds from the &# million mr king received for the two policies says his lawyer marshall grossman the suit also alleges that the defendants refused to name the buyer of one of the policies "the insured never knows if the guy barreling down the highway in a large truck coming in the opposite direction holds the insurance policy on his life " says mr grossman "we dont know whether the owner is a wall street hedge fund or a mafia don " in court papers filed this month the meltzer group and its chief executive alan meltzer said the king complaint "is fraught with misstatements of fact and law" and that mr king had full knowledge of any risks in the filing the group identified the trust that purchased the policy but said it is "unaware of the identities of the trust beneficiaries " a spokeswoman for the group which is a member firm of national financial partners corp declined to comment further coventry is identified in the lawsuit as the end buyer of the &# million policy but isnt a defendant "life insurance is a valuable asset and policyowners should keep their policies " coventry said in a statement life settlements it says are for people who for some reason want to drop policies mr buerger says the company protects the privacy of its policyholders and sells an interest in policies only to institutional investors such parties are generally considered diversified and less desperate to avoid losses on any individual policy should the holder live an unexpectedly long life the life insurance market was once even more freewheeling in th century england people took out policies on prominent figures in ill health the practice was eventually deemed gambling it led to laws like those in u s states today which generally require that the person who takes out a policy have an established relationship at the time with the insured once purchased however the policy is considered property of the policyholder who is free within certain limits to use it at will that includes selling to someone else the rights to collect the benefits coventry and other firms controlled by the buerger family make money by buying up policies and collecting the death benefits collecting fees on policies they manage for others and arranging loans to people who want to finance their premiums the firm says it pays policyholders on average about three times what insurers pay people who want out of their policies while still alive the so called cash surrender value coventry has paid holders more than &# billion for policies or nearly of these policies face value the cash surrender values of the policies amounted to &# million coventry says hedge funds and investors including insurance giant american international group inc have invested in policies coventry has purchased rates of return vary largely depending on when people die but mr buerger says the compounded rate for the end investor on a portfolio of policies is typically or life settlements appeal to investors appetite for "uncorrelated" investments ones that generate steady returns largely independent of the forces swaying stocks and bonds people die with relative consistency whether markets are rising or falling in conferences in recent years investment banks and ratings agencies have discussed bundling life insurance policies into securities they can sell to pensions or hedge funds much as mortgages have been packaged for years life insurers meanwhile are on the defensive many are lashing out at cases in which investors encourage seniors to take out policies with the chief intent of transferring them to investors as soon as possible a number of life settlement firms drum up business by arranging to lend holders money to pay premiums some insurers are increasingly scrutinizing applications before policies are sold or canceling them before they can be resold typically insurers can rescind a policy unilaterally within the first two years insurers are also giving their own policyholders new ways to get upfront cash new york life insurance co for one is offering to lend policyholders money against their future payout an arrangement akin to a reverse mortgage only about half of u s states have life settlement laws among them maryland florida and texas most that have the laws require individuals to wait two years before selling a policy to a third party state officials are sharply divided about whether to keep the two year rule or switch to a five year ban if the insured person is using an outside partys assets to buy the policy a longer waiting period could make the bet riskier for investors though investors may be paying the premiums if a policyholder dies during that period the family not the investors would get the bulk of the payout authorities have challenged some deals as well a civil suit by the new york attorney generals office last year alleged that coventry made secret payments to brokers to lure business away from other life settlement companies floridas office of insurance regulation made similar allegations in an investigation against coventry announced in may a judge threw out much of the new york case this fall in part because much of the suit didnt involve new york transactions coventry says it believes the few remaining claims "have no merit " coventry settled the florida investigation paying no fines but agreeing to cover the investigations &# million in administrative costs mr buerger portrays life settlements as too attractive to policyholders to be significantly curtailed and he says his firm will thrive amid competition from banks because coventry has life insurance expertise that wall street lacks "theyve got the money " he says "weve got the policies "
