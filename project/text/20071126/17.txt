citigroup feels heat to modify mortgages nonprofit groups press for subprime relief deciding who gets help paulo perez a graphic artist hasnt made payments in months on the &# mortgage on his ranch house in la puente calif it fell to citigroup inc s mortgage servicing unit to decide what to do about that after citigroup moved to foreclose on him mr perez who is years old asked the financial giant to cut his monthly payments to a level he can afford citigroup representatives eventually said no offering him a less appealing suggestion sell your house turn over the proceeds and we wont go after you for any unpaid balance on the front lines of the great american mortgage workout tens of thousands of borrowers are in trouble and looking for relief washington has offered advice about what lenders should do and influential groups that counsel low income borrowers are ratcheting up pressure on citigroup and others to offer struggling homeowners more favorable terms on their existing loans even borrowers whose finances seem hopeless in many ways the pressures citigroup faces mirror those on other mortgage servicers whose job it is to collect monthly payments and pass them on to mortgage investors servicers are responsible for protecting the financial interests of those investors but they also have become targets for criticism that the mortgage industry isnt doing enough to clean up problems arising from years of careless lending to subprime borrowers with shaky credit citigroup however may have a bigger mess on its hands than many in september as the u s housing crisis deepened it bought servicing rights to a problematic &# billion mortgage portfolio it announced a commitment to "help distressed borrowers remain in their homes " working with acorn housing corp a nonprofit group that counsels low and moderate income home buyers but with borrowers already in default citigroup is struggling with the magnitude of the portfolios problems and its relations with acorn are fraying u s treasury secretary henry paulson has called for financial firms to help borrowers by easing terms on lots of mortgages the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp has proposed that mortgage servicers make low initial "teaser" interest rates permanent on performing subprime loans earlier this month the house of representatives passed a bill aimed at setting new rules for mortgage lending acorn and other nonprofit community groups contend that mortgage servicers have no right to play hardball with borrowers subprime lenders these groups say talked customers into loans they couldnt afford by encouraging them to overstate their incomes and by basing the loans on inflated appraisals anyone with steady enough income to make regular monthly payments should get a restructured mortgage the groups argue on the other hand douglas duncan chief economist for the mortgage bankers association argues that lenders arent the only ones to blame for the subprime lending debacle among the many culpable parties he says are the borrowers who didnt follow through on their obligations citigroup declined to discuss in detail its handling of the troubled servicing portfolio "there are no easy answers here " it said in a statement "we are confident that the work we have done over the last two months and our commitment going forward will bring us closer to creating a scalable long term solution " despite the problems citigroups servicing business doesnt carry the kind of financial risk it has on its other mortgage investments surging defaults on subprime mortgages have already taken a heavy toll on the nations big financial institutions complex debt securities tied to the mortgages have plunged in value leaving them with more than &# billion in losses citigroup took a &# billion write down in the third quarter and has said it expects to face up to &# billion in additional losses connected to the credit crunch by years end charles prince resigned as chief executive officer the nations mortgage servicers will help determine how many more billions this giant real estate workout is likely to cost under their agreements with mortgage investors servicers have latitude to decide whether to modify the loans of struggling borrowers or to sell their properties out from under them citigroup stepped deeper into this quagmire in september when it bought amc mortgage services which services &# billion in subprime mortgages the deal boosted the size of citigroups subprime servicing portfolio to about &# billion making it the nations second largest subprime servicer after countrywide financial corp according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication amc was the loan servicing operation of acc capital holdings the parent company of ameriquest mortgage co for years the nations largest subprime loan originator citigroup also bought argent mortgage co another subprime loan originator owned by acc last year acc agreed to pay &# million to settle regulators claims that it charged excessively high mortgage rates and didnt adequately disclose loan risks bruce marks executive director of the neighborhood assistance corp of america or naca another national nonprofit group characterizes ameriquest and argent as "the worst of the worst" subprime lenders "they incentivized brokers and lenders to throw money at people knowing they couldnt afford these loans these homeowners were never qualified correctly and they deserve modification " in an unrelated case in household international inc which has since been acquired by hsbc holdings plc agreed to a &# million settlement over alleged lending abuses a spokesman for acc declined to comment for years groups such as acorn and naca have pressed citigroup and other lenders to step up mortgage lending to lower income customers when subprime mortgages began going bad these groups began pushing banks not to lower the boom on borrowers they have leverage the community reinvestment act requires banks to help meet the credit needs of communities in which they operate and regulators often seek feedback from the groups when deciding whether to permit financial institutions to open new branches the groups sometimes organize boycotts before completing the deal with acc capital citigroup agreed to work with acorn on troubled loans in a news release citigroup said it would work with acorn counselors to help "eligible" distressed borrowers "by offering assistance to prevent a foreclosure we will work with them to explore every reasonable option to help borrowers avoid foreclosure " citigroup added that it would embark on a " city tour to communities that are most vulnerable to foreclosures in an effort to help distressed borrowers " most mortgages are originated by one financial institution then pooled and sold to investors as securities when homeowners miss payments its up to the servicer to pay investors anyway then the servicer has to shake the money loose from borrowers along with delinquent fees if that fails it must decide whether to help borrowers by rewriting mortgage terms the last resort the servicer forecloses recouping its money and passing the remainder to the investors their agreements with loan investors give servicers parameters for modifying loans and authority to decide whats best in some cases it makes more economic sense for lenders to accept less money each month than to foreclose on a property in a weak market and sell it servicers generally charge investors fees of of monthly payments citigroup has originated and serviced mortgages for years including subprime mortgages through its consumer banking arm it was its investment banking arm that decided to buy the operations from acc capital citigroups investment bankers figured that originating and servicing more loans would complement their mortgage securitization operations "for months before they bought this entity they told us they were going to create a world class servicing company " says mike shea acorns executive director who has spoken to citigroup executives in depth about the portfolios problems "now theyre telling us its in worse shape than they thought " after the purchase was complete the volume of customer calls to toll free phone centers in california and illinois quickly overwhelmed employees of citi residential inc citigroups new unit for the amc mortgage and argent operations according to borrowers and housing counselors some homeowners report waits of minutes or more on the toll free line janet wherry who owns a small private school says she tried in vain for four days to reach a citigroup servicing agent before turning to bankruptcy court in october in an attempt to save her redwood city calif home from foreclosure a citigroup spokeswoman says citi residential "is doing everything it can to communicate with customers " of the loans in the portfolio or were in default as of sept meaning borrowers were at least two months late making payments about of those delinquent borrowers faced foreclosure nationwide of subprime borrowers were in default as of june according to the latest figures from the mortgage bankers association a trade group in september acorns mr shea met with jeffrey perlowitz the citigroup bond executive who oversaw the loan servicing purchase according to mr shea citigroup didnt have a plan to modify the terms of thousands of mortgages whose interest rates were about to climb sharply acorn first argued that citigroup should offer to convert many adjustable rate subprime mortgages to year fixed rate ones at original teaser rates countrywide j p morgan chase &amp co hsbc and washington mutual inc have offered such conversions to some borrowers housing counselors and those servicers say citigroup decided that offering such terms would be a money loser for loan investors according to people with knowledge of the matter instead citigroup offered to modify some mortgages for three to seven years "its a short term stopgap measure that puts off the inevitable foreclosure " says mr marks nacas head subprime borrowers are more than five times as likely to default on their loans as borrowers with a better credit history according to the mortgage bankers association statistics suggest that servicers of subprime loans arent inclined to modify very many sixteen mortgage servicers accounting for of all subprime loans modified just of loans that faced interest rate increases in the first half of according to a study reported by moodys investors service more than one third of borrowers whose loans are modified eventually default again bankruptcy lawyers say gayle anderholm who cleans houses for a living says she has been behind for more than a year on the &# ameriquest mortgage on her home in phillipston mass in late september phone calls started coming from citi residential she says someone from its "home retention" department told her foreclosure proceedings would start on oct and asked for information about her employment ms anderholm said she had been unemployed for more than a year due to illness the next day she sent a check to cover a portion of the missed payments she says but citigroup returned it a spokesman for citigroup declined to comment on any individual borrowers citing privacy policies "if the customer wants to stay in their home and they have a stream of income we will do everything possible to keep them in their home " citigroup home retention specialist hala farid told california housing counselors at a meeting last month in acorns los angeles offices in granada hills calif natalie brandon is fighting to keep the three bedroom ranch house she bought in for &# mrs brandon does medical billing for doctors her husband is a dispatcher for a local gas utility last year she got a &# mortgage from argent now owned by citigroup her interest rate isnt set to rise until next june but she already is behind on payments over the past five years she has refinanced her home five times each time taking out cash and paying prepayment penalties last year all she had to do to refinance was state that she and her husband earned a combined &# she says she used the proceeds to pay off &# owed on her white lexus this year she says their income fell after she suffered a short term disability mrs brandon figures if she sold her home today she wouldnt get more than &# what a nearby home sold for in foreclosure she has tried for months to get her loan modified and missed her june and september payments last month damien gutierrez a citi residential home retention manager offered to fix her interest rate at for years she says one week later she says he said he was authorized only to offer her a five year fixed rate earlier this month citigroup offered her a six month trial at saying it would extend the modification to three years if she keeps up with her payments she says mr gutierrez didnt return calls seeking comment citigroups city tour didnt begin until it came up with a loan modification plan that acorn considered acceptable citigroup eventually said it would offer seven year fixed rate options according to mr shea which acorn considered acceptable citigroup began in los angeles where it mailed invitations on acorn letterhead to homeowners for a "free workshop" to explore options "to help you keep your home " a dozen homeowners showed up on oct for a dinner of sandwiches and soda citigroup and acorn representatives discussed possible loan modifications citigroup later told at least five attendees it would stop foreclosure proceedings for days while it negotiated to restructure their loans mr perez the graphic artist facing foreclosure in la puente was one of them he said recently that he spent two weeks talking to citigroup but the bank never offered him a modification earlier this month he says a representative urged him to unload his house through a "short sale " meaning that if the house sold for less than the outstanding mortgage citigroup wouldnt go after him for the difference mr perez wouldnt wind up with a foreclosure on his credit record and citigroup would save money on legal and auction expenses citigroup also met with borrowers in miami and denver where turnout was only slightly better acorns mr shea says citigroup told him in early november that it may reduce modification offers from seven year fixed rate loans to two and three year ones mr shea contends that offer soon would leave borrowers right back where they started facing rate hikes they cant handle a citigroup spokeswoman said in a written statement "we have developed a program that provides modifications for various terms" primarily for seven years and some for longer "to respond to different categories of need " acorn says that in the last two months citi residential has modified the mortgages of about borrowers who sought help from the nonprofit in many cases the modifications were for seven years naca has requested modifications on behalf of more than borrowers since sept says mr marks the groups head citigroup agreed to make changes to only three mortgages he says for a maximum of two years one borrower had his interest rate cut and two got to hold onto their teaser rates he says ana cecillia marin a year old single mother of three owns a year old ranch house on a dusty garbage strewn acre in palmdale calif she says she earns &# a year managing flower sales at a los angeles food store and selling clothes on the side she bought her house in for &# by taking out a first and second mortgage she was able to buy it for no money down at first her ex boyfriend helped make mortgage payments she says but his construction jobs dried up she hasnt paid anything for months on the &# second mortgage serviced by citigroup and she has also fallen behind on her &# first mortgage serviced by a unit of bear stearns cos ms marin says she got a foreclosure notice on her first mortgage judging from recent sales of similar homes in the area its unlikely that citi residential will be able to recoup money owed on the second mortgage in the event of a foreclosure sale because the first mortgage lender gets its money first "im afraid im going to lose it " ms marin said recently of the house already she had moved most of her belongings into a wooden crate in the yard all that remained inside were the mattresses on which she and her children sleep
