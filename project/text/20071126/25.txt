world series he also correctly guessed that scoring would decline by knew the cubs would be baseballs most improved team and expected sam perlozzo to be the first manager to part ways with his team

year old economist in boulder colo who had points and trey elling whose points were good enough for third place out of readers who entered "perhaps i would have finished better had i not gone with brett myers as the nl cy young winner " said mr elling a year old radio producer in austin texas "not only that but he was my no or starter in three different fantasy leagues " ouch myers was with a era and finished the year in the bullpen for the phillies mr saeger who also explains below how luck was crucial to his success credits baseball prospectus saying "to the extent i sound like i know anything about the sport its largely due to folks like joe sheehan will carroll christina kahrl et al " then again the baseball think tank had a mixed record mr sheehan one of its writers finished th

angeles san diego arizona san francisco colorado viereck "i felt the red sox clearly had the most talent but feared the yankees i thought the indians and phillies had a good shot and i thought most people would not pick them the angels seemed like an easy pick in the west and the rest missed picks on the dodgers and cardinals was a guess " steve saeger who had the distinction of picking five of six division winners correctly he missed the red sox chalks up his record to luck because his underlying assumptions were unsound "i thought the phillies starting pitching depth would be a key to their winning the division while the mets aging and thin rotation would still be enough to win the wild card randy johnsons return was going to give the diamondbacks a great one two combination in the rotation with brandon webb while their outstanding young talent would bolster a potent offense derek lee was going to return to his mvp caliber form and lead the cubs past the cardinals in a mediocre nl central and as a life long cardinals fan the chances of a repeat world series win probably seemed greedy after last seasons unlikely championship as a colorado resident i did hope the rockies would improve enough to get to but certainly wasnt crazy enough to think theyd make the playoffs i was a little more on target in the al i thought anaheim would unfortunately be too much for the as this year i also picked the red sox to win it all based on their starting pitching but in retrospect dont know why i didnt pick them to also win the division over the yankees given the state of the yankees rotation " studeman when back in march he picked the cubs to win their division and to have baseballs most improved record wrote "someday im going to look like a genius for picking the cubs and im not going to stop picking them until i do " now he writes "i decided to go cub crazy on my picks and the cubbies didnt let me down though they tried "  which two teams will win the wild cards each al boston new york yankees cleveland detroit minnesota chicago white sox toronto anaheim oakland baltimore tampa bay nl philadelphia new york mets atlanta los angeles san diego st louis chicago cubs milwaukee arizona houston florida colorado pittsburgh san francisco for the sixth straight year at least one wild card team made it to the world series kudos to benjamin hazelwood the only reader who picked the rockies to qualify by this route studeman who picked the mets writes "perhaps the biggest surprise is that the national league wild card team didnt come from the east i really thought the east would be the class of the league but the west was stronger and deeper of course no one should feel bad about missing the rockies or diamondbacks what a great year for the nl west " viereck "i was hoping the mets would get in so the phillies could beat them i have been a phillies fan since and i still believe the phils is the worst baseball collapse ever but the mets was a close second " viereck also told this writer "thanks for writing your columns you do a nice job for a mets fan "  which two teams will go to the world series each al new york yankees boston anaheim detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox oakland toronto baltimore nl los angeles new york mets philadelphia st louis atlanta chicago cubs milwaukee san diego arizona san francisco cincinnati houston florida colorado was picked by no one to make the fall classic let alone to get there without losing a game in the nl playoffs studeman is still holding on to his preseason pick "i still wish the phillies had made the world series red sox vs phillies would have been awesome " bois contemplates the nl postseason "three feel goods phillies cubs rockies and a yawner diamondbacks but not a single powerhouse meanwhile one could argue that all four american league postseason teams red sox indians angels and yankees can be considered powerhouses so from here forth whos the best in the national league the rockies have some talent but it seems obvious to me that they managed to cruise on a thermal of momentum to get to the series momentum is an even mix of talent heart and luck and without all three it doesnt happen they may find some success next year but theyre certainly not the de facto best team in the league in fact there really isnt a best the wide open field this year was kind of fun but i kind of miss the days when there was a clear cut team to beat then again i am a braves fan at the start of the season it appeared as though the mets were the heir apparent they just havent managed to get it together whenever a team looks like it should win but doesnt and a simple short syllabled problem doesnt immediately present itself i usually chalk it up to poor team chemistry so ill go with that fix your chemistry dudes " viereck who like studeman picked the red sox to beat the phillies writes "the best team and my favorite team i had a positive feeling about the phillies before the season and on a challenge purchased a game plan it paid off in i had the same feeling the last two years "  which team will win the world series new york yankees boston new york mets detroit los angeles anaheim minnesota chicago cubs cleveland philadelphia atlanta milwaukee oakland san francisco st louis san diego arizona baltimore chicago white sox houston bois noting that his colleague dallamora picked the astros to beat his beloved red sox in the world series writes "im laughing at nick for actually picking his own red sox to lose the world series is that just the faith rewarded thing in reverse " saeger "the rockies run was hugely enjoyable but also made one realize how thin the margin is between victory and defeat its hard to believe how many times during that improbable streak that one bad break would have derailed the rockies or how badly both the padres and mets had to implode to make it possible and then came the world series when every break seemed to go to the red sox the better team undoubtedly won the series but not much would have had to change for the series to have been tied at two after game "  which team will have the best regular season record new york yankees boston new york mets anaheim detroit philadelphia st louis cleveland los angeles oakland atlanta chicago white sox minnesota san diego houston the red sox and indians tied for the majors

bonus points for it being a unanimous decision " viereck who picked brett myers and johan santana writes "brett myers was my surprise pick i figured he needed a great season for the philles to overcome the mets i think the mets will give up a lot and then spend a lot to get and lock up santana for the season unless the yankees beat them to it "  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each al

question right viereck who correctly chose the nationals to win the most games of the teams in this group writes "i thought the nationals were not that bad and i hope they are even better in thanks for beating the mets down the stretch "  what will be the most runs scored in any one regular season game in the majors this year by the two teams combined how many games decided by one run will there be in the regular season average answer for runs in the highest scoring game median most popular answer lowest highest average answer for number of one run games median most popular answer lowest highest on july the twins beat the white sox as they added a pair of field goals to two touchdowns later that day the twins beat the white sox again this time with four field goals despite minnesotas one day offensive explosion it scored fewer runs than all but five teams for the season as a whole that beats last years high scoring contest by four runs and even tops this years victory by texas over baltimore there were one run games this season topping both the median and mean picks by more than nine people guessed the highest scoring game would feature runs no one predicted there would be one run games but thomas sattler and guest picker nick dallamora came the closest guessing  which team will have the most improved record measured in increase in total victories chicago cubs cleveland arizona milwaukee kansas city tampa bay pittsburgh baltimore atlanta seattle anaheim cincinnati colorado st louis boston houston san francisco texas the cubs improved by wins the indians by the diamondbacks and the rockies by apiece and the red sox and mariners by each  which team will suffer the biggest decline measured in decrease in total victories detroit oakland chicago white sox florida minnesota new york mets new york yankees washington st louis toronto houston philadelphia cincinnati san diego san francisco anaheim atlanta los angeles texas baltimore boston seattle tampa bay it was been a tough year for some al powerhouses from recent seasons the white sox fell by wins and the twins and as by each studeman who picked the white sox writes "it was a simple matter of paying attention to karma if the cubs were to get the breaks someone else would have to pay the answer of course was the white sox "  how many postseason hits will alex rodriguez have how about derek jeter average answer for rodriguezs playoff hits median most popular answer lowest highest average answer for jeters playoff hits median most popular answer lowest highest its unclear what implication

round to the nearest percentage point and specify a direction up or down average answer for percentage change in runs per game rounded to nearest whole number median most popular answer biggest decline biggest increase the average was runs per game down from last year but up from runs the first time we checked in on the contest and runs in august readers got this right viereck who correctly predicted scorings decline writes "i thought less steroid use and better calling of the strike zone would start a decline in runs scored next we need umps to call the real high strike "  name two teams that will have only one all star counting those who are on the active roster for the game and those who are chosen but skip it for each team you get correct washington kansas city pittsburgh tampa bay baltimore seattle colorado milwaukee cincinnati texas houston san francisco arizona florida oakland philadelphia anaheim atlanta san diego in the rosters the mariners rockies and brewers each with two or more players selected as all stars were the big surprises for our readers no one picked these one representative teams blue jays cardinals and white sox  on what date will barry bonds hit career hr no just readers didnt think hed pass hank aaron on the all time list this year of the who expected it this year the median and mean was august the most popular answer was july bonds hit no on august he added six more afterwards six people predicted no would come on august and three predicted august but no one got the correct date after the season he was indicted for allegedly perjuring himself and obstructing justice which could prevent him from resuming his career and adding to his total bois "the timing of barry bondss indictment is kind of fishy the powers that be have been on his trail for a while and just happened to indict him a couple of weeks after the season ended i talked to a friend who teaches law at harvard he seemed to share my suspicions apparently all the lawyers and detectives prosecuting bonds just have to write a bunch of crap down put it into folders mail it to people and do some courtroom law stuff they then go to docket court and confer with their jury that would take like one afternoon to do just kidding i dont have any friends " viereck "i hope ryan howard can break hanks record some day " write to carl bialik at carl bialik wsj com
