neuro muscular therapy to neuro muscular therapy then came a new logo the original emblem showed a dancer on one knee with the company name in whimsical calligraphy the revised design showed the new name in crisp fonts over a rosette insignia the results were dramatic sales more than doubled to &# in and are on track to reach &# this year entrepreneurs have long been wary of rebranding changing a companys image by coming up with a new name and logo for instance or modifying the product line and marketing was seen as a project for big corporations now thats beginning to change as the boom in e commerce and a ferocious global market put competitive pressure on small companies many entrepreneurs are realizing that rebranding can help them get out of a rut and compete more effectively in many cases small businesses decide on a product line an image and a marketing plan and stick with them even if their client base changes rapidly or their sales begin to falter rebranding forces entrepreneurs to take a hard look at their strategies and see whats working and whats not and that can help them take their business to the next level when it comes to managing their brands entrepreneurs "are learning more from larger corporations " says anaezi modu founder of rebrand an online forum studying international rebranding efforts the national small business association reports of small to midsize companies are searching for new advertising and marketing strategies within the next months the big question for those businesses is whether to go it alone or get professional help for most small businesses rebranding is a very low key effort entrepreneurs generally remake their companys marketing materials from their home computer using software such as adobe illustrator and corel photopaint at most theyll hire a calligrapher to work up a logo but a growing number of entrepreneurs are finding that they want something more sophisticated so theyre turning to a new breed of small rebranding firms like schwadesign these companies use free lancers and efficient new technologies to offer rebranding services at prices affordable to more small firms everything from designing a new logo business card and stationery to coming up with product packaging and advertising the prices vary considerably depending on the job and the client for ms adamss job the three month consultation cost &# and included new brochures signs and business cards many entrepreneurs are grateful for professional help "i dont think i would have felt as confident in what i was trying to do if i had just had a little tiny flier made up on my home printer " ms adams says jack and jason dennis were also enthusiastic about their rebranding project in the brothers opened a second outlet of their retail music store earshot in downtown greenville s c the first store in the citys suburbs mostly attracted a younger crowd for the downtown store the brothers wanted to appeal to business professionals who worked in the area without alienating the younger core customers the dennis brothers hired local design firm brains on fire which came up with a bright colorful interior for the store in contrast to the darker edgier atmosphere in the suburban outlet the new stores ads meanwhile featured city residents of all ages in its first year sales were impressive but the cost of retail space soared the brothers ended up closing the downtown location still they dont think the &# they spent on the rebranding was a waste "the rebrand was great for what the theme of the store was " says jack dennis "our business needed that level of professionalism to get it right the first time we plan to use the same concept in the future " still many design firms find that some small businesses arent receptive to a major rebranding kate durkin art director and account manager at bamboo design in minneapolis has dealt with a number of clients who couldnt cope with the process of overhauling their companys image everything from coming up with new logos to keeping the companys founding concepts intact in the face of new ideas from the designers "rebranding is a huge step for a lot of companies " says ms durkin "it sounds like a great idea in the beginning but once companies put things into place it becomes a lot bigger than anyone could have imagine " entrepreneurs also worry that a radical new image could lose them customers then theres the price tag rebranding entrepreneurs fear will mean a big investment with no guarantee of increased revenue some design firms overcome clients squeamishness by offering different levels of service mack burnett owner of powerful impact a consulting and marketing company in great neck n y offers a three tier sales package that lets customers complete a rebranding project in phases with the basic offering the firm creates items such as a logo business card and stationery the next step up is brochures and other marketing

specific prices saying they vary by client "the multiple levels allow clients to try us on for size before they decide to commit to us " he says "it gives us an opportunity to prove our value over time " ms adams has discovered the value of pacing in her own rebranding project she waited to see the results of the initial effort before plunging into a second project with schwadesign an overhaul that involved remaking her web site and developing packaging for products she offers such as a therapy ball and massage tool "rebranding my company was totally worth it " says ms adams "the process gave our company more of an identity and its become something of substance when i hear my staff say hello its so exciting " ms carmichael is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she
