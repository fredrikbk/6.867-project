how a unilever executive is thinning the ranks consumer products giant unilever has cut thousands of jobs in the past two years and plans to cut more by to carry out the sweeping reorganization that started with layoffs of half of unilevers senior executives in chief executive patrick cescau has turned to head of human resources sandy ogg the companys goal isnt just to cut fat but it is to change job descriptions in a company long known for being bloated and slow mr ogg a year old american and unilevers first human resources chief from the outside must improve productivity at unilever which has headquarters in rotterdam and london unilever employs compared with rival procter &amp gamble co which has employees but unilevers sales were &# billion well behind p&amp gs &# billion even worse unilevers operating profit is half that of p&amp gs unilever is at a disadvantage because it makes food as well as consumer products and food has lower profit margins and as thousands more jobs disappear mr ogg also risks declining employee morale "people sitting at one level were dreaming of a job at the next level and all of a sudden the pool has shrunk by half " says mr ogg "the challenge is to keep them motivated when theyre saying where have all the jobs gone " mr ogg has brought to unilever a performance ranking system for jobs and employees that he developed as a top human resources executive at motorola inc where the former u s navy officer worked before joining unilever in mr oggs system lists the companys top positions by criteria such as sales profits and operating costs mr ogg and unilevers executive committee have rewritten job descriptions to create fewer more powerful posts to select employees for the new jobs mr ogg used a grid with financial performance of the employees division on one axis and six leadership skills on the other the leadership skills were selected to reflect unilevers priorities mr ogg says one ranks managers on "action not debate " because the company had often gotten bogged down in internal discussions about strategy next mr ogg and the executive committee ranked unilevers top executives in the nine boxes on the grid the highest performers fell into green boxes in the upper right corner middle rankers were in yellow boxes while the rest were relegated to a red box on the bottom left corner managers in the red boxes are offered mentoring and specific suggestions to improve if they dont they could lose their jobs mr ogg says silvia lagnado a year old from brazil rose on mr oggs charts for her work as brand manager of the dove line of skin cream soaps and shampoo under the old system ms lagnado probably would have stayed in unilevers soaps business because unilever almost always promoted within units but last year mr ogg shifted ms lagnado to a newly created culinary role figuring she could bring tactics from dove to the slower growing food business the move put her in charge of people when ms lagnado needed two senior executives to manage knorr its &# billion soup brand she found them in a week using the new ranking system the task could have taken a couple of months of time consuming networking in the past she says unilever is one of a growing number of companies giving human resources more power overhauling departments that in the past did little more than handle payroll and benefits forms the company has cut hundreds of human resources jobs and outsourced payroll and other tasks to consulting firm accenture ltd harry brouwer the head of unilevers dutch market faces the task of combining unilevers businesses in the netherlands belgium and luxembourg he needs to cut jobs as well as move scores of managers from brussels to rotterdam he and his management team will decide on cuts around the end of the year he says he laid off of his staff in the netherlands in now "a second time its even more difficult " mr brouwer says even so the cuts are improving results by reducing the layers of executives who had to approve a new product or marketing campaign that has enabled the company to react more quickly to new consumer trends and new demands from supermarkets sales in the netherlands rose last year reversing their fall in and a slight drop in unilever had tried to institute a system of ranking employees in but so many people complained it was largely canceled by unilever was under so much pressure to fix its lagging performance that managers were receptive to mr oggs ranking system mr ogg also introduced a degree assessment where managers bosses peers and direct reports all give confidential appraisals of their performance this year unilevers sales growth has picked up and its profitability has improved the groups revenue in the third quarter rose to billion euros &# billion from billion euros while net profit rose to billion euros from million euros but the job cuts have taken a toll on staff morale some employees and union officials say in the netherlands unilever announced last month that it planned to close three factories including one that has operated for years in the town of delft the news triggered a four week strike that ended recently when unilever agreed to give million euros to the workers who had been laid off according to a spokesman for the fnv bondgenoten union "it used to be a great place to work " says marko oudenaarden a year old father of two who operates machines producing hellmanns mayonnaise at the plant he says he expects to lose his job as part of the restructuring "we make good profits but for unilever its never enough " the dutch factory closures are part of the job cuts announced this year and a unilever spokesman says they are necessary because in europe "our supply chain isnt efficient enough "
