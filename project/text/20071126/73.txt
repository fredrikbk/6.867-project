the morning brief sarkozy the yuan the euro and dollar online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here a host of french officials visiting beijing nabbed some important contracts for their companies today even as president nicolas sarkozy raised his concerns about trade imbalances caused by chinas weak currency but europes pain on the foreign exchange front is as much about the dollar as it is the yuan even if officials arent yet saying so mr sarkozys trip to beijing comes at an important time for sino european relations partly because of chinas growing trade surplus with the eu and also because of "a more robust diplomatic tone from a new generation of german and french leaders " as the financial times puts it the ft notes that mr sarkozys predecessor jacques chirac was a sinophile and critic of u s foreign policy and theres "much interest in the degree to which the new president will depart from the chirac line " especially as beijing has cooled relations with the other eu powerhouse germany in the wake of chancellor angela merkels recent meeting with the dalai lama meanwhile the euros rise against the yuan has helped chinas trade surplus with the eu expand to the tune of about &# billion for the first months of this year a little more cash will be flowing westward after today when french state owned nuclear engineering company areva said it signed a near &# billion contract to supply a chinese electricity company with a pair of nuclear reactors plus fuel to power them and other chinese plants the wall street journal writes that the contract might be crucial to the future of areva the worlds largest nuclear company which needs money to decommission aging research reactors and which the french government has recently suggested might be better broken up "with the china deal areva hopes to persuade its main shareholder to leave the companys structure unchanged " the journal writes adding that areva executives would prefer to raise cash through a rights issue another struggling european icon airbus also clinched a big deal today signing contracts to sell commercial passenger jets to china for around &# billion as the associated press reports adding that the order stands to push airbus past boeing in total orders for commercial aircraft this year the ap notes that airbus and its chinese partners this summer agreed to make single aisle a jets there as part of airbuss long term strategy to win a greater share of the chinese market that for years has been dominated by boeing but as reuters points out "the strength of the euro against the dollar the currency in which aircraft are sold is frittering away airbuss share of a global aviation boom as it competes with boeing " mondays deal comes a few days after airbus ceo thomas enders said the low level of the dollar was "life threatening" to the plane maker and may result in further cost cuts particularly in research and development airbus is already in the throes of a cost cutting program which is expected to lead to the loss of jobs which brings us back to foreign exchange mr sarkozy kicked off his china visit yesterday by urging beijing to let its currency rise before global trade imbalances become unmanageable as the ap reports "a great country must have a strong currency " mr sarkozy said adding that "china has an important role to play in consultation with the other players in not letting imbalances accumulate to a point where we wont know how to get out of them " given the continual pressure on china from u s treasury secretary henry paulson and congress it would seem to appear that paris frankfurt and washington are singing from the same sheet of music here but while the chinese currency is steadily moving higher against the dollar albeit not quickly enough for some critics in washington it is moving lower against the euro thats because despite officially being referenced to a basket of currencies the yuan effectively maintains a crawling peg to the u s dollar as dow jones newswires points out the dollar is in broad decline against the euro losing more than this year and thus even though the yuan has appreciated against the dollar this year it has slipped by against the euro so when mr sarkozy in his speech called for "fair balance between the major currencies the dollar the euro the yen or the yuan " perhaps he wasnt just trying to soften the blow to beijing by placing its currency in good company wednesday the eu china summit opens with european central bank president jean claude trichet and eu commissioner joaquin almunia in attendance and more comments on the yuans level are to be expected but as the euro closes in on &# one wonders when europes objections are going to be directed more pointedly at investors and even toward washington "so far trichet has stuck closely to the official g line on exchange rates and wants to see some progress on yuan adjustment before directly addressing euro dollar " ubs economists wrote in a research note today "however if the euro zone is disappointed we expect further verbal warnings to the market if euro dollar refuses to ease " bank bailouts bank troubles a consortium led by richard bransons virgin group was today named the preferred bidder for troubled u k mortgage lender northern rock which in september turned to emergency funding from the bank of england sparking the first run on a british bank in years "the decision brings authorities closer to resolving a casualty of the global credit crunch that has become a political embarrassment for the government " the wall street journal writes noting that shareholders could still block the sale especially as a competing bidder former ubs executive luqman arnold would have bought a minority stake and taken management control of the bank a plan that wouldnt erode the stakes of existing shareholders as much mr bransons proposal values northern rock at pence a share the guardian reports friday the shares closed near pence having traded as high as &lt pound&gt earlier this year virgin plans to take a majority stake in the company and will provide &lt pound&gt million cash to refinance it to raise another &lt pound&gt million existing shareholders would get the chance to buy more shares at pence each the guardian says the bbc reports that mr branson is forking over &lt pound&gt million of his own money the news came as the largest british institution hsbc announced that it would take &# billion of assets onto its balance sheet in order to bail out two of its structured investment vehicles a move that wouldnt result in any losses or changes to capital requirements "we believe that hsbcs actions will set a benchmark and restore a degree of confidence to the siv sector while providing a specific solution to address the challenges faced by investors" in the two sivs said stuart gulliver head of the groups corporate and investment bank as dow jones newswires reports but the journal separately says european banks are facing a new wave of financing troubles with interest rates in short term lending markets rising at a pace not seen since august "as investors shy away from risk and banks become increasingly wary of lending to one another " if sustained the jump in interest rates could damp growth in the euro zone the journal says &lt ndash&gt citing a research report from j p morgan chase which suggests the recent tightening in the euro interbank lending rate represents at least as much of a drag on the economy as the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar also of note bloomberg using the dollar to pay for purchases of currencies
