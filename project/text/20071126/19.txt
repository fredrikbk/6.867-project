loans made to risky borrowers the revelation caused swiss res shares to fall more than on the week dragging down the entire industry the european insurance sector has lost more than this year so far pushing valuations to historic lows the sectors estimated average price to earnings ratio for stands at far below the food industry which has a p e ratio valuations are virtually on par with the heavily subprime stricken banking sector where ratios hover around according to data from reuters p e ratios calculated by dividing stock price by annual earnings per share reflect a stocks relative value and profit growth potential the higher the ratio the more investors bet that profits will grow fast a lower ratio can be a sign of greater value or of potential problems "stocks look cheap but thats the wrong angle " said jaime ramos investment director at standard life investments european equities arm "the subprime crisis is hanging like a cloud over the sector " swiss res subprime hit which came only two weeks after it boasted a third quarter net profit of &# billion was due to its exposure to so called credit default swaps hedging instruments it sold to investors who were seeking insurance against losses on their bond portfolios swiss res p e ratio for this year stands at one of the lowest in the industry despite the recent fall stock prices could erode even further should
