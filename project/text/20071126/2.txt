americas mexican truck stop its hard to say who came out on top in the nov debate among democratic presidential candidates held in nevada but we do know that free trade took a beating a majority of the candidates disapproved of some or all of the u s bilateral and regional trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement and pledged to reverse the trend toward market opening if given the chance hillary clinton stopped short of promising to undo nafta but she called for a "trade timeout " it is troubling to hear the protectionist drumbeat growing louder in the democratic party particularly as it concerns latin america the last time washington adopted an anti trade bias by signing into law the smoot hawley tariffs in it set off a world wide depression and a period of isolationism in latin america that took some years to begin to reverse now democrats seem to be saying that if they can only capture the white house they are committed to reliving this painful history the democrats anti trade agenda is already playing out in congress with both houses continuing to block the full opening of the southern border to mexican long haul trucks under nafta congresss actions could damage the u s economy because mexico has the legal right to retaliate whats worse is what this flouting of u s commitments to mexico suggests to the mexican people about yankee integrity the problem dates back to when bill clinton issued an executive order in violation of nafta which he had signed into law to stop mexican long haul trucks from crossing the border mr clinton was responding to pressure from teamsters who didnt want any new competition he cited safety concerns things like substandard drivers and vehicles which to this day have never been supported by evidence in fact mexican trucking companies have a long history of operating in the u s and with no notably inferior safety record yet their numbers have been limited since when the reagan administration announced that until mexico opened its markets to u s competitors no new licenses would be granted to mexican carriers existing mexican long haul trucking businesses had their permits grandfathered and from some mexican domiciled companies all of which were majority u s owned received "certificates of registration" to deliver "exempt commodities" from mexico to the u s in other words there have been plenty of mexican trucks on u s roads all these years although not as many as there might be under nafta nevertheless in a appropriations bill congress demanded that they be subject to a new set of safety regulations some of which are more stringent than u s standards since that year the department of transportations inspector general has audited the safety process at the border annually and has been able to certify that it is working mexican carriers are also more heavily insured than their u s competitors every mexican truck is required to carry u s insurance on top of the insurance it carries in mexico earlier this year the dot analyzed the safety record of mexican carriers in the u s from it looked at the rate in which trucks received an "out of service" designation by dot inspectors targeting companies with the worst records the out of service rate for u s trucks was compared to a rate for trucks from mexico of mexican short haul trucks operating in the border zone also had a better record than the u s trucks with an out of service rate of these statistics ought to be enough to end the debate but with teamster pull still strong in congress the bush administration this year offered to introduce a pilot program to allow a limited number of new trucking companies to begin doing business in the u s under close dot scrutiny the program kicked off on sept and there are now seven mexican companies operating vehicles in the u s and four u s companies operating vehicles in mexico youd think that those with safety worries would be glad to see such a vigilant approach to the problem but just after the program started both the house and the senate voted to strip its funding in the budget its not clear whether this budget cut will be sustained but the effort makes it obvious that congress is no honest broker as john hill administrator of the federal motor carrier safety administration told me last week "every time we move closer to implementing the provisions of nafta congress adds a new provision its hard to hit a moving target " mr hill also challenges the charge that mexican trucks are not safe "weve applied strong enforcement guidelines and mexico has met them the opponents of nafta are looking for any way they can find to drum up fear among americans even though mexican trucks have been operating safely in this country for years " mexico doesnt have to sit still for this in february a nafta arbitration panel issued a unanimous decision against the u s block on mexican long haul trucks mexico could retaliate with import tariffs on u s goods to the tune of &# billion in the nov issue of the latin american business magazine poder y negocios mexican secretary of communications and transportation luis tellez said that his country has not ruled out that possibility he also expressed frustration with congress "the problem is that the congress is no longer in the frame of mind in which it sees nafta as something important or something that the u s government has to comply with " there are those in congress he said who dont have a clear idea of what nafta is and others who dont want to "lose points and teamster support " during the free trade bashing in nevada mrs clinton said that instead of signing new agreements we "need to get back to enforcing the ones we have which the bush administration has not done " when it comes to nafta and the mexican trucks we can all agree on the first part of that statement but the fault lies with congress not the president
