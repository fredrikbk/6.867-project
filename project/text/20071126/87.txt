writers talks need hollywood ending negotiations to resume as heat rises on both sides risks of going off script as screenwriters and hollywood studios resume contract talks today in hopes of ending a three week strike by the writers both sides have incentives and pressures to negotiate a new deal many in the industry believe that this weeks scheduled three day negotiating session presents the best opportunity not only to resolve the strike before the end of the year but possibly to prevent the total collapse of hollywoods entertainment machine that would occur if the strike continues well into bob daly who was chairman and chief executive of warner bros in when he watched a writers guild of america strike stretch on for five months says "this is their window to make a deal " he adds "if they dont make it now i say happy new year see you next year " but he added that both sides are motivated to make a deal "youre starting to feel the economic pinch in a situation where times are not as good as they were last year between the high cost of gasoline the stock market falling the fires we just had there are a lot of reasons that both sides should check their egos at the door and stay there until they make a deal " it remains unclear how close the two sides are entering todays talks at issue in the walkout are payments that writers receive when their work is used in ancillary markets especially on dvds and on the internet when bargaining broke down nov the writers had taken off the table their demand for an increase in payments from dvd sales but the two sides couldnt agree on how the writers would receive residual payments for their work distributed on the internet and in other new media the writers have so far staged a walkout that has enjoyed strong unity and well publicized rallies but pressure is mounting a number of key players in the television business already have been agitating for the two sides to reach a deal some late night talk show hosts for instance have been reaching out to media executives and encouraging them to return to the negotiating table they have also been considering crossing the picket lines and returning to work without their writing staffs as early as next week according to people who work on the shows some television studios have been applying pressure on the writers by warning of cuts to nonwriting staff on prime time shows several "showrunners" writer producers who are responsible for running their shows have decided to return to work as producers without resuming their writing responsibilities the studios face pressures of their own the television networks potentially have the most to lose if the stoppage drags on it comes at a vulnerable time for broadcast television which faces a challenge in holding onto viewers even in the best of times the fear is that when scripted shows run out of episodes fans may be slow to return if they ever do after missing several episodes of a favorite show viewers may be tempted to move on to a new show the following season or worse they may defect to other forms of media altogether such as the internet on the movie side the strike is slowly starting to affect the production schedule of feature films in the past days studios including sony corp s sony pictures time warner inc s warner bros and weinstein co have all seen projects delayed because of script problems lurking in the background are studios contracts with the directors guild of america and screen actors guild which both expire on june for now the dga which in the past has negotiated a new deal months ahead of the deadline has sat on the sidelines during the first weeks of the wga strike but should a deal fail to materialize this week the directors union could step in to make its own new deal with the studios in the past hollywoods guilds have generally accepted the terms of whichever union negotiated first a resulting directors deal could be disadvantageous to the writers as the directors have different priorities and less concern about residuals should the screen actors accept the same deal the directors take as has happened in the past the writers would be alone in their quest for a better deal if actors spurn a deal made by directors however the writers would likely have to wait until at least the end of june to join forces with sag members who could go on strike then officials from all three guilds and the studios alliance declined to comment separately negotiations resumed yesterday between striking broadway stagehands and theater producers as theaters faced a third week of dark stages and mounting box office losses resumption of the talks came after a week of no negotiating more than two dozen plays and musicals in new york city have been closed since nov when the stagehands walked off the job
