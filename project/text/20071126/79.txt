victor in australia inherits challenges rudds top tests inflation worries future of u s ties sydney newly elected prime minister kevin rudd assumes power at a time when australia and its economy are as strong as at any time in a generation thanks in large part to booming trade with china but mr rudds center left government which on saturday unseated the longstanding conservative administration of john howard a staunch ally of president bush also inherits some challenges chief among them is keeping australias red hot economy from boiling over at a time when demand for the countrys vital natural resources is outstripping its ability to provide them inflation is already running at an uncomfortably high level and australias ports and rail lines are so jammed they cant keep up with orders for iron ore coal and other materials another issue for the year old mr rudd will be maintaining australias historically strong relationship with the u s at a time when the countrys economic fortunes are increasingly determined by china although he emphasized the "centrality" of australias ties with the u s during a news conference yesterday mr rudd has promised to take several steps that are likely to test that bond at least in the short run these include pulling some of australias troops out of iraq and in a reversal of mr howards stance ratifying the kyoto protocol the international accord aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions approving kyoto would deprive the u s of one of its major supporters on climate change issues and put new pressure on the bush administration ahead of a meeting next month in bali indonesia where world leaders will discuss what to do when the kyoto protocol expires in the u s has refused to ratify the kyoto plan with most of the votes counted yesterday mr rudds labor party had captured at least of the seats in australias house of representatives where governments are formed up from seats in the last election in the governments defeat was so complete that the year old mr howard australias second longest serving prime minister after sir robert menzies appeared likely to lose his own parliamentary seat which he has held for years final election results wont be known for several days mr rudd said yesterday that he had spoken with mr bush british prime minister gordon brown and indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and that he intends to visit the u s early next year he promised to act quickly on improving education rolling out a nationwide broadband network and other issues by contrast mr howards liberal party which governed in a coalition with australias rural based national party appeared in disarray departing treasurer peter costello said he wont seek leadership of the liberal party despite an endorsement from mr howard in his concession speech saturday night that surprise move leaves a vacuum at the top of the liberal party as it licks its wounds and tries to chart a course forward the sweeping defeat also appears to end the political career of mr howard one of the asian pacific regions most enduring conservative leaders mr howard can lay claim to a number of achievements including major changes to the australian tax system steps to affirm the independence of the australian central bank and improvements in the governments financial health under mr howards watch the country of million people enjoyed a long economic expansion and emerged as a far more important financial center "ive led a government that has reformed the australian economy and left it the envy of the world " mr howard said in his concession speech but many voters appeared to have grown tired of mr howard who was seeking his fifth term especially after his government approved a set of unpopular changes giving employers more power over workers to set wages and benefits while mr howards support of the u s led war in iraq has been a controversial issue in australia in recent years it played a relatively small part in the latest campaign mr rudd made inroads by positioning himself as an economic conservative similar in many ways to mr howard who aimed to better spend the countrys boom time gains he assured investors he would continue the howard governments generally free market policies while investing in education and health but it is in economic affairs where mr rudd may face the most trouble both parties sketched out enormous spending plans during the campaign that economists feared could add too much stimulus to the economy at a time when inflation is believed to be at or above the central banks preferred level of mr rudds party made campaign promises amounting to about billion australian dollars us&# billion in benefits to australians including a&# billion in tax cuts in a worst case scenario economists say the rudd government could be forced to scale back some of its promises slash other programs or face further increases in interest rates that would likely sap the governments popularity "these are not trivial issues " said john edwards chief economist at hsbc in sydney with growth possibly accelerating "all the pressure is set to increase " mr rudd is expected to appoint wayne swan the labor partys economic spokesman to the major economic post of treasurer in his new government mr swan generally is regarded by economists as a competent administrator who would do little to alter the core economic policies of the howard administration and would maintain the independence of the reserve bank of australia the central bank mr rudd has vowed however to roll back parts of the howard overhaul that gave employers more leverage over workers and his party has pledged to set tough targets for lowering carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy mr rudd has said he will withdraw about troops from iraq though he would leave several hundred security personnel there a fluent speaker of mandarin chinese mr rudd also wants to boost relations with china which has emerged as australias key new trading partner in recent years but australias relationship with china could come under strain in the near future thanks to a bid of roughly &# billion by australian mining giant bhp billiton to take over rival miner rio tinto plc should it proceed the merger would give the melbourne based company enormous control over the worlds iron ore an ingredient for making steel chinese steelmakers have expressed concern about the deal and could put pressure on australian authorities to change it or block it mr rudd has said "normal processes of australian law" will apply to the merger proposal mr rudd grew up in a dairy farming family in australias queensland state and studied chinese history in college he joined the countrys diplomatic corps and served in the australian embassy in beijing in the s he also worked as a china consultant with accounting firm kpmg and emerged as a labor party star in part because of his foreign policy experience rachel pannett contributed
