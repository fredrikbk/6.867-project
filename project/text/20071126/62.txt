wine retailer vine wine inc in long island city n y started offering coverage to its handful of employees in february after owner talitha whidbee discovered the healthpass purchasing cooperative healthpass founded with a grant from new york city reduces the administrative burden for employers by handling much of the back end work it gives small companies access to more than coverage options

younger workers with no children take the bare bones plans an older employee and ms whidbee herself who has a child have more extensive coverage ms whidbees involvement meanwhile was limited to a few conversations with an insurance broker and giving her employees a single form to fill out which ms whidbee returned to healthpass by fax ms whidbee contrasts her co op experience with shopping for insurance on her own six years ago when she was the manager of a new york restaurant at that time she spent more than a month shopping for plans and in the end could offer employees only one plan which carried premiums of about &# a month paid mostly by the employees "you were either on the plan or not " ms whidbee recalls healthpass focuses on small businesses in new york city and surrounding

california washington oregon nevada and hawaii costco says members can save from to depending on the state sorting options for small businesses that go it alone when purchasing insurance it might help to engage an insurance agent to sort through options agents are typically paid by the insurers so their services are free to the business one idea popular with agents is an employee elect arrangement which allows even small companies to choose from the gamut of a carriers plans in the past small employers could offer only one or two plans to their workers they sometimes felt obligated to pick the most comprehensive and expensive plan so that employees with greater health needs had enough coverage but as insurers try to snag market share by bestowing big business options on small companies there is more to choose from employees who need less coverage can opt for cheaper programs thus reducing premiums some carriers addressing this market as employers keep cutting benefits to try to reduce costs include aetna inc hartford conn and blue cross of california a unit of wellpoint inc and says neil crosby director of sales at warner pacific insurance services a westlake village calif general agency that works with brokers and agents employers who have a mix of young single workers and older employees tend to benefit most from employee elect arrangements employers often pay to of the premium and employees pay the rest plus any upgrades another option brokers find promising is an exclusive provider organization or epo plan which keeps premiums low in part by limiting choice of doctors and hospitals with an epo plan people can get reimbursed if they see any doctor that has a relationship with the insurer but they typically wont get reimbursed if they go outside the epos network of doctors and hospitals empire blue cross blue shield a subsidiary of wellpoint recently introduced its prism suite of epo based plans these plans have a relatively low inpatient co pay of &#

j the plans cited do not include drug benefits mark wagar president and chief executive of empire says the prism plans are able to offer lower premiums in part because everyone is on the same epo plan helping keep the pool of plan participants large consumers decide another choice for small business owners is a consumer directed plan a high deductible plan that works with a health savings account or a health reimbursement arrangement two ideas that have become more popular within the past five years with an hra an employer can set aside money to help employees meet the new higher deductible the funds belong to the employer and can be rolled over from year to year to pay for future medical expenses money from the fund spent on reimbursement is tax deductible to the employer which can heighten the appeal an hsa works similarly only an employee or an employer can fund the account and the money belongs to the employee the funds are used to pay qualified medical expenses and unused portions can be rolled over for use in future years the account is tax advantaged meaning employees can invest the cash in products like mutual funds and let it grow tax free withdrawals are also tax free on qualified medical expenses plus employees can get a break on taxes just by contributing the treasury department estimates a single taxpayer making &# a year and contributing &# to an hsa can reduce his or her federal income tax by &# ms waxenberg says hsa options tend to make the most sense for employers paying or of the premium if the employer is paying or of the premium neither the employer nor the employee sees enough of a break in their premium to feel good about the deal employers should be aware though that theyre likely to face some dissent from workers if they cut benefits and raise the employees costs "in those cases you really need employees who understand the big picture " ms waxenberg says ms badal is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n
