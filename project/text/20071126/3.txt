aussie ouster sometimes politicians overstay their welcome and that seems to have been the case with john howard the australian leader lost the premiership saturday and if projections are right he may suffer the further ignominy of losing his seat in parliament its an embarrassing shove into retirement for a leader who in years in office has revived his countrys economy and enhanced its place in the world at home the howard government reformed welfare balanced the national budget trimmed taxes freed labor markets privatized the national telecom provider and confirmed the central banks independence unemployment is now at year lows and growth remained steady through the asian financial crisis the sars panic and the recent credit crunch the economy is forecast to grow by more than this year business investment remains strong abroad mr howards signature achievement is the antiterror alliance he forged with president bush and british prime minister tony blair after september australia sent troops to iraq and is taking a key role in fighting the taliban in afghanistan the terror attacks in bali in which australians died helped secure public support for mr howards antiterror efforts australia has also become an increasingly important anchor for stability in the asia pacific mr howard sent troops to stabilize east timor in and intervened in the solomon islands he forged closer ties with other democracies in the region such as japan and india while improving relations with china no easy feat australias new prime minister is kevin rudd a mandarin speaking former foreign service officer who calls himself both a "socialist" and an "economic conservative " on the campaign trail mr rudd promised voters an agenda similar to the fiscal responsibility tax cuts and free trade that mr howard had pursued but such policies are opposed by many in his labor party and mr rudd has a tough political balancing act ahead of him as our mary kissel explains nearby on foreign policy mr rudds policies also arent likely to be radically different from those of mr howard though his rhetoric tilts more toward the united nations even in iraq where he opposed the war he has indicated he wont withdraw all of australias forces as a china expert he understands the economic and security challenges posed by that country and australias need to influence its behavior one digression from his predecessors policies will probably be the kyoto protocol which mr rudd wants australia to ratify as the elections approached mr howard didnt realize that voter concerns were shifting away from the buoyant economy which they could now take for granted and toward the populist concerns of a rich society such as global warming and labor protections in september when polls showed mr rudd far ahead the liberal party leadership demanded that mr howard make way for his deputy treasurer peter costello but mr howard vowed to stay with the caveat that he would pass power to mr costello once he mr howard was re elected he wont get that chance on saturday his liberals suffered one of the biggest incumbent defeats since world war ii voters in democracies sometimes tire of even popular and successful leaders think churchill after the war and australians will now get the chance to see if the "change" theyve endorsed is for the better see related article "turnover down under" wsj nov
