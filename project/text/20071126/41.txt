obama is right on iran after a recent democratic presidential debate barack obama proclaimed that were he to become president he would talk directly even to americas worst enemies one could imagine president obama as a kind of superhero taking off in air force one for tehran there to be greeted on the tarmac by the villainous mahmoud ahmadinejad was this a serious foreign policy proposal or simply a campaign counterpunch hillary clinton had already held up this idea as evidence of mr obamas naivete wasnt he just pushing back displaying his commitment to "diplomacy" now the most glamorous word in the democratic "antiwar" lexicon whatever mr obamas intent history has given his idea a rather bad reputation neville chamberlain springs to mind as a man who was famously seduced into the wishful thinking that seems central to the idea of talking to ones enemies today few americans left or right would be comfortable with direct talks between our president and a character like mr ahmadinejad wouldnt such talk only puff up extremist leaders and make america into a supplicant on its face mr obamas idea seems little more than a far left fantasy but perhaps it looks this way because we are viewing it through too narrow a conception of warfare we tend to think of our wars as miniature versions of world war ii a war of national survival but since then we have fought wars in which our national survival was not immediately or even remotely at stake we have fought wars in distant lands for rather abstract reasons and there has been the feeling that these were essentially wars of choice we could win or lose without jeopardizing our nations survival mr obamas idea clearly makes no sense in a context of national survival it would have been absurd for president roosevelt to fly to berlin and talk to hitler but mr obamas idea does make sense in the buildup to wars where survival is not at risk wars that are more a matter of urgent choice than of absolute necessity i think of such wars as essentially wars of discipline their purpose is to preserve a favorable balance of power that is already in place in the world we fight these wars not to survive but once a menace has arisen to discipline the world back into a balance of power that best ensures peace we fight as enforcers rather than as rebels or as patriots fighting for survival wars of discipline are pre emptive by definition they pre empt menace to the peaceful world order we dont sacrifice blood and treasure for change we sacrifice for constancy conversely in wars of survival like world war ii we fight to achieve a favorable balance of power one in which a peace is established that guarantees our sovereignty and survival we fight unapologetically for dominance and we determine to defeat our enemy by any means necessary we do not harry ourselves much over the style of warfare whether the locals like us where the line between interrogation and torture might lie whether or not we are solicitous of our captives religious beliefs or dietary strictures there is no feeling in society that we can afford to lose these wars and so we never have all this points to one of the great foreign policy dilemmas of our time in the eyes of many around the world and many americans as well we lack the moral authority to fight the wars that we actually fight because they are wars more of discipline than of survival more of choice than of necessity it is hard to equate the disciplining of a pre existing world order a status quo with fighting for ones life when survival is at stake there is no lack of moral authority no self doubt and no antiwar movement of any consequence but when war is not immediately related to survival when a society is fundamentally secure and yet goes to war anyway moral authority becomes a profound problem suddenly such a society is drawn into a struggle for moral authority that is every bit as intense as its struggle for military victory america does not do so well in its disciplinary wars the gulf war is an arguable exception because we begin these wars with only a marginal moral authority and then as time passes even this meager store of moral capital bleeds away inevitably into this vacuum comes a clamorous and sanctimonious antiwar movement that sets the bar for american moral authority so high that we must virtually lose the war in order to meet it there must be no torture no collateral damage no cultural insensitivity no mistreatment of prisoners and no truly aggressive or definitive display of american military power in other words no victory meanwhile our enemy is fighting all out to achieve a new balance of power as we anguish over the possibility of collateral damage this enemy practices collateral damage as a tactic of war in iraq al qaeda blows up women and children simply to keep alive the chaos of war that gives it cover this enemys sense of moral authority as misguided as it may be is so strong that it compensates for its lack of sophisticated military hardware on the other hand our great military might is not enough to compensate for our weak sense of moral authority our ambivalence if we have the greatest military in history it is also true that we lack our enemys talent for true belief our rationale for war is difficult to articulate always arguable and distinctly removed from immediate necessity our society is deeply divided and there is a vigorous antiwar movement ready to capitalize on our every military setback this is the pattern of disciplinary wars their execution is always undermined by their inbuilt lack of moral authority in the end our might neutralizes our might our vast power makes all such wars come off as bullying even when we fight selflessly for the freedom of others great power scares unless it is exercised within a painstaking moral framework thus moral authority is the single greatest challenge of american foreign policy this is especially so in wars of discipline wars fought far away and for abstract reasons we argue for such wars as if they were wars of survival because we want the moral authority that comes so automatically to them but iraq is a war of discipline and no more if we left iraq tomorrow there would be terrible consequences all around but we would survive our broader war against terror on the other hand is a war of survival and it is rich in moral authority september introduced necessity and in its name we have an open license to destroy that stateless network of terrorism that attacked us america is not divided over this it was iraq a war of discipline that brought us division this does not mean that the iraq war is invalid ultimately it may prove to be a far more important war in preserving a balance of power favorable to america than our war against al qaeda the point is that wars of discipline will always have to be self consciously fought on a moral as well as a military front and the more we engage the moral struggle the more license we will have to fight these wars as wars of survival in other words our military effectiveness now requires nothing less than a smart and daring brinkmanship of moral authority if mr obamas idea was born of mushy idealism it could work far better as a hard nosed moral brinkmanship were an american president or a secretary of state for the less daring to land in tehran the risk to american prestige would be enormous the mullahs would make us characters in a tale of their own grandeur yet moral authority would redound to us precisely for making ourselves vulnerable to this kind of exploitation the world would witness not the stereotype of american bullying but the reality of american selflessness courage and moral confidence if we were snubbed if all our entreaties to peace were flouted if war became inevitable then we would have the moral authority to fight as if for survival either our high risk diplomacy works or we have the license to fight to win in the meantime we give our allies around the world every reason to respect us this is not an argument for mr obamas candidacy only for his idea it is a good one because it allows america the advantage of its own great character mr steele a research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution is the author most recently of "a bound man why we are excited about obama and why he cant
