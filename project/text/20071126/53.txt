stevens a business consultant and president of msco a marketing firm based in rye brook n y but for a partnership to work he says you have to plan for "tomorrow and the day after " what follows is a primer on how to set up and sustain a business partnership know your partner communication is important at every stage of a partnership and especially so at the outset "the biggest mistake business partners make is jumping into business before really getting to know each other " warns michael lee stallard co founder and president of e pluribus partners a consulting firm based in greenwich conn mr stallard suggests taking personality tests and chatting with each others colleagues and family members key questions do you and your partner share personal and professional values ideas and goals do you trust your partners motivations and character in what areas of everyday life and business do you agree and disagree "you must be able to connect in order to feel comfortable expressing your opinions ideas and expectations " says mr stallard consider the fit partners professional skills should complement one another alicia rockmore and sarah welch co founders of the organizational products company buttoned up inc had worked together on and off for eight years before they became partners their professional relationship began in when ms rockmore then a senior brand manager at a consumer products company and ms welch then an account executive at an ad agency collaborated on the development of an advertising strategy ms rockmore says she instantly appreciated ms welchs practical approach to marketing and continued to consult her on projects over the years so when the idea for buttoned up surfaced she instinctively turned to ms welch for advice soon after they decided to pursue the venture together and a partnership ensued "rooted in respect for each others business judgment " ms welch says ms rockmore the detail oriented taskmaster of the two brings a background in brand management and new product development ms welch the big picture thinker has the advertising and consulting experience for those who dont have the luxury of nearly a deade of shared experience mr stallard suggests that prospective partners tackle a small business project together that showcases each others skills and requires cooperation this is also a way to learn about each others personality and core values he says sign an agreement once the decision is made to start a business together its vital to create a partnership agreement with help from a lawyer and an accountant "any partnership that operates without a written agreement is simply playing russian roulette " says leslie d corwin chairman of the litigation business disputes group at international law firm greenberg traurig based in miami before even meeting with his clients mr corwin typically sends them a checklist of issues to consider he then facilitates a discussion between the partners gives them his advice and drafts a binding document its an arduous process that usually takes weeks and costs &# to &# if there are no complications mr corwin says but it can also serve as a kind of litmus test he adds "if they cant get through the agreement in my office there is no way they will realistically launch a business " mr corwin says every agreement should address three crucial areas compensation exit clauses and roles and responsibilities compensation include who owns what percentage of the business who is investing what where the money is coming from and how and when partners will be paid typically partners set up equal ownership and each contributes of the initial investment but terms can vary greatly for instance one partner might contribute more money if the other partner can bring in expertise or business contacts as the business grows and changes mscos mr stevens suggests adjusting compensation accordingly for example partners may agree to work initially without compensation and to get paid after a certain revenue target is reached in addition if the business partnership brings on more people or if a particular partner is putting in more or less time building some flexibility into the contract can let you adjust payments he says exit clauses its necessary to spell out cases in which one partner is obliged to buy out the others interest for instance if one wants to quit the business if neither partner wants to continue the business partners can also liquidate and divide all assets the agreement should specify how to assess the total value of the business upon dissolution says alan lash a co founder of the miami based law firm lash &amp goldberg "both parties should agree upon a cpa they trust the methodology the cpa might employ and how to value certain interests " mr lash says such decisions should be binding he adds when shaparak kamarei asked a longtime friend and colleague to become a partner in solaris laser institute a laser hair removal business she had started in los angeles and neighboring orange county their agreement required that the partner marjaneh hedayat invest enough money to make her half owner the page agreement signed by the doctors also considers a number of outcomes from personal and company bankruptcy to accident and death if either of them leaves the company within the first two years the partner who steps away must forfeit her investment and receive no compensation "now we always have security and are both protected " says dr hedayat adds dr kamarei "although you can work toward the best outcome it is necessary to plan for the worst scenarios " roles responsibilities and expectations clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of the partners based on their skills and desires this will eliminate turf wars and clearly show employees to whom they should report while dr kamarei devotes her time to the california offices staff management and office promotions dr hedayat oversees a new dallas office marketing and the companys web site "we have a running list of projects " dr kamarei says "and next to every one there is either my name or marjanehs there is no room for confusion " keep talking lastly experts say clear and effective communication is key to a successful partnership "partners must share a common vision for the business " says larry goddard founder and president of the parkland group a cleveland based management consulting firm they must maintain an honest and continual dialogue addressing all of their expectations mr goddard says through trial and error drs kamarei and hedayat have established routines for daily communication while at first they called each other at all times of day and night disrupting their families lives they now keep lists of important daily events and thoughts to discuss in twice a day phone conversations at designated times they also select management or self help books of the week to read concurrently discuss and integrate into their business practices mediator elinor robin suggests that partners in addition to communicating daily re evaluate their goals on a regular basis at least once a quarter sit down and discuss how you envision the future of the business and what steps to take in getting there says ms robin who is based in boca raton fla to help make these important decisions mr goddard recommends setting up a group of "independent advisers who you both respect " drs kamarei and hedayat also advocate cultivating a group of mentors or board of directors such groups can include spouses advisers professional organizations and mediators who can act as sounding boards for additional advice meanwhile the partners say their mutual respect and openness prevents misunderstandings and frustrations "even if we dont agree we talk about everything come to an understanding and move on " says dr hedayat "thats how a business grows " ms banjo is a staff reporter for
