turnover down under sydney australia australias new prime minister kevin rudd outlined his vision for his country in an article he wrote last year for a local political magazine the monthly riffing off dietrich bonhoeffer a th century german pastor and theologian the bookish former bureaucrat decried what he called "rampant individualism " john howards conservative government mr rudd argued had gone too far by liberalizing labor markets and sacrificing "family time" at "the altar of market utility " australia needs a new kind of socialism he said one that keeps the economy running but simultaneously emphasizes "equity community and sustainability" and gives "power to the powerless " mr rudds pitch came at just the right time mr howard was entering his th year as prime minister the economy was humming along like it hadnt in a generation boasting full employment manageable inflation and years of economic expansion why not try something new mr rudds "kevin " campaign asked "its time for a change " the slogan went on saturday voters agreed mr rudd and his labor party surged to victory in one of the largest swings against an incumbent government since world war ii winning at least seats in the seat lower house of parliament now the big question is what mr rudd will do with his mandate the answer lies in large part with how much power the prime minister can wield within his own party mr rudd is a relative political lightweight compared to his deputy julia gillard who earned her stripes in the rough and tumble trade union movement mr rudd who is is not a career politician he was elected to parliament in joined the front bench in and was named party leader last november the labor party is underpinned by trade union money and influence and mr rudds brand of socialism is too far right for many its a risky balancing act if ms gillards hard line socialism prevails australia could see trade unions gain power as the global economy is slowing in other words just as australia the worlds th largest economy should be liberalizing not restricting its domestic markets fortunately mr rudd is also hemmed in by his campaign promises particularly on economic policy in a bid to "reclaim the middle ground" and make labor electable mr rudd effectively copied the howard governments program of fiscal responsibility lower taxes and support for free trade when mr howard announced a billion australian dollars us &# billion tax cut plan mr rudd rolled out a strikingly similar a&# billion program dubbing himself an "economic conservative " he persuaded voters hed be a safe pair of hands if he strays too far toward redistributionist policies he risks losing public support rapidly while economic policy may have been the bigger campaign issue down under its on foreign policy where mr rudds leftist idealism might have the widest leeway it certainly will have an impact on ties with the u s with which the howard government has been a staunch partner in the war on terror mr rudds vision of a "fair society" extends beyond his own shores in his words "we need to be guided by a new principle that encompasses not only what australia can do for itself but also what australia can do for the world " that means a rudd government will stand by the u s alliance he says but will also give more weight to international institutions such as the united nations the new prime minister has already promised to ratify the kyoto protocol which mr howard opposed and he plans to attend the u n climate summit in bali next month unlike mr howard who boosted defense spending sent troops to iraq and afghanistan and envisioned australia as one of asia pacifics "three great democracies " mr rudd has repeatedly called australia a "middling power" that has a "fundamental national interest at stake in an international rules based order that protects smaller states from more powerful states " for now that likely means pulling some but not all aussie troops out of iraq a war that he has consistently denounced he will likely keep soldiers in afghanistan where they are doing some of the toughest fighting but for the wrong reasons a rudd government would look to the u n for legitimacy not to its own moral compass mr rudd isnt a faddish man who came to his beliefs lightly when he was a child his father was accidentally killed and his mother was put on the dole watching his family and neighbors struggle to better themselves made him a believer in "activist government " he said in his article for the monthly last year mr rudd argued that governments can manage markets to achieve better social outcomes which the bureaucrats themselves pick and choose australia tried that in the s under former prime minister gough whitlam with disastrous results how long the rudd government will last will depend on how "equitable" and "fair" the public finds his "progressive" theories once theyre put into practice ms kissel is editor of the wall street journal asias editorial page
