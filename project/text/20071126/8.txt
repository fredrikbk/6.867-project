arevas china deal may influence breakup decision france must weigh needs of customers around the world paris french state owned nuclear engineering company areva sa said it clinched contracts valued at as much as billion euros &# billion to supply a chinese electricity company with two advanced nuclear reactors fuel to power them for years and more uranium for other plants the deal between areva and china guangdong nuclear power holding co disclosed monday in china was to be signed later in the day during french president nicolas sarkozys visit to beijing it is part of chinas plan to build dozens of reactors during the next two decades to help meet increasing demand for power the contract might also be crucial to the future of areva the worlds largest nuclear company by revenue not long ago the french government indicated it was thinking of dismantling areva which offers production services such as uranium mining reactor building and fuel waste management the government argued that areva could no longer cope with increasing global need for nuclear energy and should be split into several companies to better serve clients in such places as the u s china britain and south africa delays encountered as areva builds a nuclear plant in finland europes first such plant in years fuel the debate "nuclear power is one of frances trump cards we dont want to spoil it " henri guaino special adviser to mr sarkozy said in a recent interview areva is eager to retain its one stop shopping structure saying customers such as chinas cgnpc see advantages in buying fuel and reactors from one company exact terms of the china deal werent clear last night but it was expected areva would sell two megawatt reactors to cgnpc and fuel to power them until according to people familiar with the matter under a separate contract areva is expected to supply uranium for less powerful reactors cgnpc plans to build in the long term areva may help china build a used fuel reprocessing plant these people said a cgnpc official declined to comment the tussle between areva and the french government is part of a debate over how the global industry will handle renewed demand for nuclear energy the industry had gone into decline following accidents at the three mile island plant near harrisburg pa in and at chernobyl in the former soviet union in the international atomic energy agency anticipates the construction of at least plants world wide during the next years areva was created in when a drop in demand for nuclear energy led the government to pool its nuclear assets into one company partly to save costs and to retain engineers germany which had just phased out nuclear power at home joined the project german conglomerate siemens ag transferred its nuclear assets to the newly created areva in exchange for a interest in areva np the groups reactor making arm today areva owns mining operations to extract uranium notably in niger and canada and enrichment plants to make nuclear fuel the group designs and builds nuclear reactors and high voltage electrical equipment it also reprocesses nuclear fuel one of the more sensitive parts of the nuclear chain as it involves handling of radioactive plutonium the french government said this summer it planned to review the structure of areva including possibly breaking it up and selling some parts frances nuclear research agency commissariat a lenergie atomique which manages most of the states interest in areva said it would like to sell a to block on the market or to an industrial buyer to raise some of the money it needs to decommission aging research reactors many suitors are emerging french power plant and bullet train builder alstom sa has said it would like to merge with areva to create a diversified engineering giant for clients around the world construction and media group bouygues sa which holds a interest in alstom and oil company total sa have said they would be interested in buying shares or assets of areva if it were privatized or split up japans mitsubishi heavy industries ltd which has industrial partnerships with areva has said it would be interested in areva shares if they were made available some of areva already trades publicly as nonvoting investment certificates based on the certificates latest price the companys market value is more than billion euros alstom has a billion euros market value with the china deal areva hopes to persuade its main shareholder to leave the companys structure unchanged areva executives say they would prefer to obtain the government green light to raise cash through a rights issue the issue combined with a sale of a partial stake by the commissariat a lenergie atomique would result in a partial privatization selling an areva stake on the market would also give the government an indication of the companys real value which analysts say may not be as high as billion euros "areva needs to raise funds to finance its expansion " chief executive anne lauvergeon said in a recent interview "but why would someone want to dismantle areva when russia japan and other countries are trying to emulate our integrated model " this summer japans toshiba corp owner of u s nuclear reactor maker westinghouse entered a partnership with kazakh uranium producer kazatomprom the deal will allow the japanese company to guarantee long term uranium supply for the reactors it sells to power companies it is unclear what role would be left for siemens should areva be partially privatized or split up officials at areva say they hope to continue working with the company a siemens spokesman said the company "has no intention to pull out " yet the french government has warned that it might squeeze siemens out of areva unless germany reverses its decision to phase out nuclear power "it is hard to say i want to stop nuclear power at home but i want to build reactors elsewhere in the world " said mr guaino the special adviser to mr sarkozy areva holds an option to buy siemenss stake in areva np the reactor making unit in if areva wants to exercise the call option it needs to inform siemens by
