consider the subtleties of mainstreaming as a parent and an educator i share the indignation of the mother you cited in the article "schools accused of pushing mainstreaming to cut costs" page one dec no parent wants to see his child mistreated or underserved in a school district but to place the blame on inclusion is to miss the real problem schools that dont adequately implement the principles or practices of full inclusion with the necessary training supports and resources required there have always been schools and school districts that have cut significant services for students and students with disabilities have often been left to flounder without necessary educational support however thats not inclusion its educational irresponsibility and malpractice inclusion properly implemented which takes a serious commitment from the district and all personnel isnt the same as dumping students back into the non responsive "mainstream" and calling it policy responsive and responsible inclusion requires changes in curriculum pedagogy and school climate as well as enriched teacher education these are changes that benefit all children not simply those with disability labels teaching children to live in a diverse democratic society in which all people are valued and connected demands that we commit to doing inclusion well and not reframe cost cutting measures as if they represented our best educational thinking or practices mara sapon shevin professor of inclusive education syracuse university syracuse n y dr sapon shevin is author of "widening the circle the power of inclusive classrooms " beacon press while reading your excellent survey of the mainstreaming movement and the controversy it has generated i was struck by its parallels with the controversy over the deinstitutionalization movement both movements were started by the same pair of factors the premature belief by some professional researchers that a dramatic cure was at hand and the eagerness of elected officials to reduce spending on groups that represented relatively few votes hopefully the debate on mainstreaming will learn from the experience of the deinstitutionalization movement concepts that sound great on paper get much more complex in practice dave m oneill adjunct professor of economics baruch college new york thank you for continuing to prominently highlight special education however you fail to provide a balanced treatment of how and when inclusion works well our five year old son with disabilities is in an inclusive environment with adequate supports augmentative communication devices an educational assistant and peer supports and it has transformed his life he has grown in ways we were told were not possible my family and i worry that even a very careful reader of your article and series on inclusion might conclude that separate but equal is necessary in special education that would be a travesty in direct contradiction to research on the matter as well as our experiences tim vogus brentwood tenn
