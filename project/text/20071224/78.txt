theory &amp practice management leaders turn attention to followers firms should rely more on passionate staffers some experts believe experts in leadership are plentiful and barbara kellerman a lecturer at harvards kennedy school of government counts herself as one of them now though ms kellerman and some other management experts are turning their attention to the other extreme of the organization chart what matters to followers in "followership " a book being published this winter ms kellerman argues that a big organizations fate can be surprisingly dependent on how well it understands thousands of low ranking employees and makes them more effective entrepreneurs ori brafman and rod beckstrom took a similar perspective last year in their book "the starfish and the spider " suggesting that lower ranking employees called catalysts need to drive organizational change instead of top bosses among these authors precepts companies should look for passionate employees keep them informed and give them room to carry out useful projects whats more ms kellerman says all followers shouldnt be lumped together she divides them into five categories based on how much they care about the organization ranging from "isolates" to "diehards " savvy managers should treat each type differently she argues such messages resonate at a host of big companies including best buy co united parcel service inc and hewlett packard co executives at such companies say theyve grown more interested in followers as theyve seen the internet flatten traditional lines of command and empower grassroots employees some executives also believe that leadership has been studied to exhaustion making fresh insights rare by contrast theres been much less attention to what makes followers tick companies that can achieve breakthroughs in this latter area may be able to build lasting competitive advantages "look at why big companies die " says shari ballard best buys executive vice president retail channel "they implode on themselves they create all these systems and processes and then end up with a very small percentage of people who are supposed to solve complex problems while the other of people just execute you cant come up with enough good ideas that way to keep growing " when she visits best buys electronics stores ms ballard says she asks managers "what do you know about your customers that i couldnt possibly know " the question encourages local initiatives that help best buy grow for example ms ballard says a store in a heavily polish american section of chicago built a profitable polish music section a minneapolis store rearranged its display of ipod accessories so customers could more easily find the right cases and power chargers for their particular models of music players she says she couldnt have driven those changes from above they had to take shape at the local level best buy also learned the hard way that rank and file employees not bosses determine the fate of clever sounding software tools designed to share knowledge within big organizations best buys bosses have bought several such tools and urged employees to embrace them "but the problem is people dont use them " ms ballard says instead she says front line employees at the worker company created their own site www blueshirtnation com where employees share tips gripes and personal interests its proven far more popular than its management driven predecessors at ups which employs people world wide executives seek help from "followers" to guide the implementation of new technology john saunders vice president for human resources notes that ups generally has higher paid more experienced employees than rivals ups managers now schedule one on one conversations with individual drivers each year in which the company shares its road map of new hand held devices and other technology that gives employees time to adjust to change it also gives the company a better sense of potential sticking points so that it can deal with them early in the past ups briefed its drivers mostly in group meetings those are still useful mr saunders says but the one on one meetings allow for fuller more candid exchanges that are customized to each employees situation hewlett packard meanwhile has expanded its traditional employee surveys to ask more questions about whether the company is being as fast and nimble as it should be the company started doing so about five years ago soon after it acquired compaq computer corp at first scores were disappointing says marcela perez de alfonso the computer and printing companys head of human relations but they have improved significantly she says chief executive mark hurd gets many questions at staff meetings in the u s and china about how h p can move faster and that those expressions of employee interest are valuable to top management as harvards ms kellerman puts it "better followers beget better leaders " follow the leader barbara kellerman a lecturer at harvards kennedy school of government classifies followers in organizations bystanders observe but dont participate at peace with the status quo participants somewhat engaged can support or oppose leaders activists eager energetic and engaged can support or oppose leaders diehards highly dedicated their cause is all consuming isolates detached dont care about their leaders
