judging lawyers its a sunny day in seattle when two lawyers can bring a class action suit on their own behalf and then see it rejected on first amendment grounds thats what happened last week in the emerald city when federal district judge robert s lasnik ruled that there was no basis for cracking down on a lawyer rating web site merely because some of its ratees didnt like how they were portrayed the site called avvo does for lawyers what any number of magazines and web sites have been doing for other professions for years magazines regularly publish stories that rank an areas doctors and dentists there are rating sites and blogs for the "best" hairstylists manicurists restaurants and movie theaters almost any consumer product or service these days is sorted and ranked professional ego aside its hard to see why lawyers or judges should be any different at a time when the judicial system is under increasing scrutiny the courtroom performances and verdicts of its practitioners would seem a reasonable object of public interest for those shopping for legal counsel an online rating service might at least provide some measure of transparency in an otherwise opaque profession noting his own billing as a top flight judge by another web site called lawdragon judge lasnik recalled in his opinion the old admonition that "that and five cents will get you a ride on the ferry " one of the lawyers who brought the case claimed his shoddy rankings were inaccurate thanks to his previous recognition as a "super lawyer" by "washington law and politics " well let our readers decide if being called a "super lawyer" is a compliment
