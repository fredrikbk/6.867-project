in hoc anno domini when saul of tarsus set out on his journey to damascus the whole of the known world lay in bondage there was one state and it was rome there was one master for it all and he was tiberius caesar everywhere there was civil order for the arm of the roman law was long everywhere there was stability in government and in society for the centurions saw that it was so but everywhere there was something else too there was oppression for those who were not the friends of tiberius caesar there was the tax gatherer to take the grain from the fields and the flax from the spindle to feed the legions or to fill the hungry treasury from which divine caesar gave largess to the people there was the impressor to find recruits for the circuses there were executioners to quiet those whom the emperor proscribed what was a man for but to serve caesar there was the persecution of men who dared think differently who heard strange voices or read strange manuscripts there was enslavement of men whose tribes came not from rome disdain for those who did not have the familiar visage and most of all there was everywhere a contempt for human life what to the strong was one man more or less in a crowded world then of a sudden there was a light in the world and a man from galilee saying render unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods and the voice from galilee which would defy caesar offered a new kingdom in which each man could walk upright and bow to none but his god inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me and he sent this gospel of the kingdom of man into the uttermost ends of the earth so the light came into the world and the men who lived in darkness were afraid and they tried to lower a curtain so that man would still believe salvation lay with the leaders but it came to pass for a while in divers places that the truth did set man free although the men of darkness were offended and they tried to put out the light the voice said haste ye walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth along the road to damascus the light shone brightly but afterward paul of tarsus too was sore afraid he feared that other caesars other prophets might one day persuade men that man was nothing save a servant unto them that men might yield up their birthright from god for pottage and walk no more in freedom then might it come to pass that darkness would settle again over the lands and there would be a burning of books and men would think only of what they should eat and what they should wear and would give heed only to new caesars and to false prophets then might it come to pass that men would not look upward to see even a winters star in the east and once more there would be no light at all in the darkness and so paul the apostle of the son of man spoke to his brethren the galatians the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his lord stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage this editorial was written in by the late vermont royster and has been published annually since
