debt poets society credit crisis goes from bad to verse financiers pen cheeky odes on the markets mayhem i pass through peons gate the squalid factories of englands industrial revolution inspired charles dickens to write "hard times " the great depression spawned john steinbecks "the grapes of wrath " this winter the global credit crisis has unleashed its own burst of creativity if only subprime art were sublime most of it is low grade spoof such as a "green eggs and ham" knockoff called "broker joe " "joe" is the brainchild of cameron crise a year old american currency investor working in london for dutch belgian financial conglomerate fortis the narrator of his poem chides pesky bankers who try to sell clients collateralized debt obligations and other foul looking securities much like the character in the dr seuss classic who is hounded by sam i am into eating green eggs i would not like it here or there i would not like it anywhere i do not like your cdo i do not like it broker joe gallows humor in times of crisis is a wall street tradition a widely circulated email at the time of the tech stock crash held that beer would have been a better investment than the shares of enron worldcom or nortel mr crise writes a christmas poem every year he sent "broker joe" to about colleagues and salespeople around the city of london financial center who later forwarded it to colleagues around the globe mr crises name rather aptly means "crisis" in french though he says his name is german as a teenager he aspired to be a novelist in the hemingway mold his latest opus was alas not composed in a parisian cafe but at his home computer while his wife was out and his young children were asleep "those of us who grew up wanting to be writers and are now in the financial markets dont get to scratch that itch very often " says mr crise "most people i deal with are not like broker joe " he adds "they are generally good people " david resler chief economist at nomura securities in new york has used clement clarke moores classic poem "a visit from st nicholas" as the inspiration for year end send ups of the market for years "the real challenge each year is to come up with a theme " he says "this year it was easy i cant remember a year where any single thing more dominated the financial markets " though spotting the theme was a cinch crafting this years ode wasnt in part because of the complexity of the subprime mortgage universe with its alphabet soup of terms like siv abx and cdo "i had to make sure i was not sacrificing accuracy for the sake of a rhyme " mr resler insists on adhering to the structure and meter of moores poem and he hates imprecise market jargon like the phrase "goldilocks economy " "it makes zero sense " he says it should be called "baby bear economy" because the porridge belonged to the bear not goldilocks "goldilocks was a thief and a bit of a juvenile delinquent " inspiration this year came slowly and at odd times including middle of the night trips to the bathroom it took mr resler a total of hours and at one point he almost gave up but in the end he came up with stanzas including this one in the wake of a flood of sub prime loan losses came layoffs that even hit highly paid bosses these debt market problems posed new risks for the fed it needed to act fast lest catastrophe spread mr resler sent the poem to roughly people including neighbors and officials at his church and at his daughters school he says he got more instant feedback this year than he has before the subprime meltdown has also inspired a skit by the long johns the british satirists john bird and john fortune in it the fictional investment banker george parr is asked in a video circulating via youtube about the inflated u s home prices underlying the credit crunch "surely the reality is that the people that have lent all this money have been incredibly stupid " "oh no " mr parr replies "the reality is that what is stupid is that at some point somebody asked how much these houses were actually worth " michael silverstein a self styled "wall street poet " is using verse to warn of another pending subprime crisis mr silverstein a former editor at bloomberg news writes in "debt rictus a heroic debtors last hurrah " of the dangers of predatory lending to credit card borrowers rendered in the style of th century british poet william ernest henleys "invictus " his poem ends no longer master of my fate no more the captain of my cash soon ill pass through the peons gate but until then a plastic bash hopefully for mr silversteins sake his dire prediction wont come true but for mr crise the currency investor who dreamed up the pushy cdo salesman life is already imitating art of the feedback to his poetic christmas card he says "a real world broker joe whom ive never heard of has added me to his bloomberg distribution list and is now sending me prices in the same sorts of junk that neither the narrator of the poem nor i have any interest in " the poet has one more lament "the most common response ive gotten is you have way too much time on your hands "
