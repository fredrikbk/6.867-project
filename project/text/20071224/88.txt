what makes tesco kroger more than just rivals britains largest retailer tesco plc opened its first stores in the u s last month but americans have already gotten a taste of the tesco shopping experience without realizing it in an unlikely place kroger co that is because a small company that runs krogers loyalty card program in the u s dunnhumby ltd is owned by tesco and runs that chains frequent shopper program in britain dunnhumby deciphers data from customer purchases and uses it to change merchandise selection and target promotions at individual shoppers for grocery stores like kroger which are getting squeezed by upscale food retailers such as whole foods market inc on one end and discounters like wal mart stores inc on the other fine tuning their offerings to shoppers needs can provide an important edge long suffering kroger has posted quarters of identical supermarket sales increases excluding fuel of more than the retailer says its new detailed customer knowledge is part of the reason "our partnership with dunnhumby is one of our key competitive advantages " says rodney mcmullen vice chairman of kroger one of the largest grocery retailers in the u s with stores and annual sales of &# billion and a net profit of &# billion in its last financial year "in our competitive industry remaining relevant to our customers is critical " when dunnhumby started working with kroger in tesco didnt have firm plans for entering the u s last month tesco began opening the first of fresh &amp easy neighborhood markets planned by march for southern california las vegas and phoenix an additional are planned by the end of the british retailer which operates some stores in countries says its arrival in the u s wont hurt dunnhumbys venture with kroger or its own business both tesco and dunnhumby say the data company keeps its different clients separate dunnhumby also works for u s retailers such as home depot inc best buy co and staples inc "dunnhumby works with a variety of retail customers and of course its absolutely essential that they have effective chinese walls within the business not unlike investment banking relationships " says tesco spokesman trevor datson tescos foray into the u s is headed by tim mason the executive who developed its u k clubcard program because its u s stores are so new tesco doesnt yet have a store card in the u s and plans to decide on a frequent shopper program once its stores are established the retailer says tesco says it is considering a national roll out of fresh &amp easy beyond the western u s the stores are smaller than typical supermarkets and sell store brand food like the more upscale chain trader joes except that tesco wants to sell at even lower prices tns retail forward a unit of british market research firm taylor nelson sofres plc estimates that fresh &amp easy could have stores and &# billion in sales by by tns says fresh &amp easy could be one of the biggest supermarket retailers in the u s analyzing customer data has become the hallmark of tescos torrid growth in the u k where it now controls nearly one third of the grocery market tesco owns a majority stake in dunnhumby dunnhumby chairman clive humby who founded the london based company in with his wife edwina dunn still owns a minority stake for kroger its data driven strategy puts the retailer at the vanguard of u s store operators which are beginning to make more use of information collected when shoppers store cards are swiped at the checkout recording their purchases while some of u s grocery stores have card programs most use them only as a way to offer loyal shoppers discounts according to industry research firm amr research inc in boston some million u s households have a kroger loyalty card which make up one of the largest retail customer databases in the u s store cashiers swipe the customers cards at the checkout and give them an immediate discount on their bill in addition the cardholders receive in the mail coupons for products they have already purchased and for those that the computer thinks they might like when dunnhumby began working for kroger its research found americans worried more about privacy protection than britons to calm shopper concerns dunnhumby adjusted its approach applicants for a kroger card provide little information the application form calls for only their name address and a preference for mail in english or spanish in britain by contrast tesco shoppers also provide information on their age household size and dietary needs such as vegetarian kosher or halal the chief executive officer of dunnhumby usa simon hay says the company protects shoppers contact details and buying records its analysts dont create profiles of individuals but use individual buying records to make patterns and group shoppers into segments those categories such as "budget conscious" or "family focused" help kroger to design its stores and mail coupons for products customers have already bought and based on others in the segment might buy in the future "the challenge is balancing customer intimacy with customer privacy " says robert garf vice president and general manager of retail strategy with amr research the new number crunching is bringing big changes to kroger in the past the grocery chain ran price promotions on its best selling products but data showed that this meant discounts for a wide mass of middle income shoppers who would buy the products even at full price now kroger cuts prices on store brands and other value items bought by its most price sensitive customers "as a retailer you can never compete with wal mart because youre not as big and dont have the buying power to match their low prices " says dunnhumbys mr hay "but if you cant compete on everything youve got to compete on something the question is what should that something be " often the data reveal surprising results krogers store in the affluent cincinnati neighborhood of hyde park also draws shoppers from lower income areas across the highway when kroger remodeled the store in it added a starbucks cafe and a fresh cheese counter for upscale customers but it also lowered prices on value items low price products for the cost conscious segment as a result of dunnhumbys data mining kroger introduced three quarter gallon milk containers in its stores for two person households doing their weekly shopping research indicated half a gallon was too little and a whole one too much coffee previously arranged on shelves by brand and origin is now divided into caffeinated and decaf sections because research showed that shoppers look for that distinction first the retailer is also stocking smaller harder to find brands because it now sees the loyalty they can engender with customers alpen breakfast cereal for instance sells less than mainstream cereal brands but an analysis of lifetime total store spending of alpen buyers showed that they were health conscious shoppers prone to spend on nutritious fare and to fill their carts with other high margin products at kroger tamara audi contributed to this article
