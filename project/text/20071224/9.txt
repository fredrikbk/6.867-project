chavez faces challenge from former comrade venezuelas new hero has respect in army a vegetarian mystic caracas venezuela venezuelas political future is shaping up as a battle between two former comrades in arms president hugo chavez and former defense minister raul baduel one of mr chavezs closest friends going back to their days together in the barracks in recent weeks mr baduel has emerged as perhaps the most significant rival to mr chavez since he became president in the year old retired general was instrumental in tilting public opinion against mr chavezs attempts to rewrite the constitution to give himself greater powers including the right to unlimited re election along with allies in the military he is widely seen as having pressured mr chavez to concede defeat in a dec referendum on the changes mr baduels rise could constrain mr chavezs well known twin ambitions to stay in power for good and turn the worlds sixth biggest oil exporter into a cuban style socialist state his opposition to mr chavez also seems to reflect some dissatisfaction with the president within the armed forces the president has politicized the military forced tasks upon it such as running soup kitchens instead of preparing for battle and changed its traditional view of the world turning its longtime ally the u s into its main foe mr baduels role on the night after the vote is fast becoming the stuff of legend in venezuela the countrys electoral commission dragged its feet for hours in announcing the results shortly after midnight venezuelan tv showed soldiers preventing opposition representatives from entering the vote counting hall sparking rumors that mr chavez was planning to rig the vote then mr baduel appeared on television wearing a windbreaker and surrounded by grim faced aides "for the good of the country the election agency cannot yield to any pressures which could lead to undesired situations " said mr baduel whose year military career included stints in elite parachute jungle and antiguerrilla units his message was clear fraud could lead to civil war minutes later the electoral commission stunned the country by announcing that mr chavez had lost the first electoral defeat for the seemingly invincible president immediately it made mr baduel a key player in shaping the countrys future mr chavez who shot to fame as a military officer by launching a failed coup attempt in doesnt appear to be in danger of getting overthrown by the military mr chavez purged opponents in the armed forces after an attempted coup against him in and has sent many younger officers for training in cuba whose security forces are believed to have thoroughly penetrated the venezuelan military keeping a close eye on officers but the defeat and the militarys role show mr chavez may have difficulty finding a way to stay in power past his terms constitutional end in which in turn may weaken him before that and bolster the opposition mr chavezs communications ministry didnt respond to a request for an interview in the week prior to his defeat in the referendum but in a long news conference at the ministry of defense three days later mr chavez said mr baduel was a traitor in the pay of the u s denied he had been pressured to concede by the military and said the armed forces had never been more loyal to the president than it is now the showdown between mr baduel and mr chavez is a remarkable turn in the two mens long and complex history mr baduel was one of three officers who made a secret pact with mr chavez to conspire to overthrow the government when they were climbing up the ranks when mr chavez assumed the presidency in he made mr baduel his personal secretary and it was mr baduel who helped save mr chavez from a brief coup in mr chavez is godfather to mr baduels month old daughter yet mr baduel also stayed out of mr chavezs first attempt at revolution in mr chavez tried to marginalize him early in his presidency and mr baduel abruptly became one of the presidents boldest critics on the day he retired from the administration last july now mr baduel holds a unique place in this divided society he is respected by both the presidents supporters and detractors long a hero to one side for cutting off the coup against mr chavez he is now a hero to many on the other side for staving off a kind of coup by mr chavez himself in an interview mr baduel said it would be best to keep details of what happened on election night private he spoke respectfully of mr chavez as "mr president " but mr baduel doesnt hold his tongue when it comes to the direction he feels the government is going in the referendum "the tendency was to go towards a greater concentration of power around the figure of the president " he says "thats undemocratic " while he says he speaks as a private citizen he also says he has close bonds with many officers with whom he served during his career "its well known that when you share risks with your companions in arms you generate a lot of solidarity " he says "when your companions see you manage risky situations in an appropriate way they respect and appreciate you for it " mr chavez says the election delay was because he wanted more votes counted but people within the opposition say mr baduel spoke to key officers that evening urging them to resist any order that might pit soldiers against citizens many opposition leaders and others believe mr baduels prestige within the armed forces was a critical factor in convincing mr chavez to accept the results "in caracas it is a matter of religious belief" that mr baduel is responsible says luis garcia montoya a leading lawyer and professor at caracass iesa institute a top business school "baduel played a central role in avoiding confrontation preserving democracy and stopping chavez from not recognizing the results of the election " says diego arria a former venezuelan ambassador to the united nations who is a top adviser to the countrys opposition mr chavez and the armed forces high command have tried to dispel the idea that the presidents hold on the troops has slipped three days after the referendum defense minister gen gustavo rangel flanked by a dozen generals and admirals heatedly denied in a news conference that the military had pressured mr chavez on election night to show their absolute loyalty gen rangel shouted out the controversial cuban style salute recently made mandatory by mr chavez for the armed forces "patria socialismo o muerte " fatherland socialism or death "venceremos " to victory the assembled top brass shouted back mr chavez then burst in unannounced grabbed the microphone and during a long and rambling speech lashed out at mr baduel "the empire bought him " he said accusing mr baduel of being a u s agent mr baduel shrugs off mr chavezs criticism and says he still considers the president his friend "we just have different opinions " he says mr baduel a vegetarian with a deep and eclectic interest in world religions is not a typical latin american military man he has spoken publicly of his belief that he has been reincarnated although a practicing roman catholic he is fascinated by the orient and is also adept in the ancient chinese philosophy of taoism in his office filled with statues of catholic saints and chinese warriors he keeps a koran as well as a bible and meditates and works amid burning incense while listening to gregorian chants the religious music also serves another purpose it hinders any listening devices "my telephones are bugged " he contends pointing to what he says is a government listening station on a nearby building few people have been as close to mr chavez as mr baduel both grew up in relative poverty in venezuelas rural plains learned to view the ruling elite with hostility and joined the army for lack of a better way to get ahead in late together with two other young officers mr chavez and mr baduel made a secret oath under a historic tree where venezuelas independence hero simon bolivar made camp during the struggle against colonial spain paraphrasing bolivars words from two centuries earlier the four swore never to rest until they had "broken the chains of the powerful that oppress us " the oath marked the beginning of a decadelong conspiracy that eventually led to mr chavezs failed coup against president carlos andres perez mr baduel didnt join because he felt the uprising was too disorganized mr chavez who never discussed whether he was angry at mr baduel for not taking part spent two years in prison and mr baduel continued his career in mr chavez who had gotten out of jail on a presidential pardon went on to win the presidential election on a wave of voter revulsion at the corruption of previous democratic governments mr baduel then a colonel became the presidents personal secretary a second officer who took the oath was killed during rioting that shook caracas in and the third became an outspoken chavez opponent mr baduel declines to discuss details of his history with mr chavez but people who know both men say the president soon began to view his former comrade as a rival and began to sideline him removing him from the list of officers to be promoted "chavez told him that the only reason he had him around was that he knew how to tie a necktie " says nedo paniz an amateur parachutist and former conspirator who knows both men well mr baduel says he never heard that directly from mr chavez at the insistence of another officer who had taken the oath mr chavez grudgingly promoted mr baduel to brigadier general and put him in command of a paratroop brigade in maracay it proved to be a lucky move for mr chavez four years later low oil prices and mr chavezs divisive rhetoric had brought the nation to the brink of civil war in april mr chavezs generals refused his order to use force against an enormous protest march heading to the presidential palace he was forced from power for two days until gen baduel rallied military support for mr chavez and returned him to office mr baduel personally directed the helicopters which plucked mr chavez from detention on an island navy base and took him back to the presidential palace mr chavez gave him command of the fourth armored division the most important in the armed forces he later promoted him to head the army and then last year made him defense minister but in his rise to the top mr baduel began to view mr chavezs transformation of the armed forces with dismay for decades venezuelas military enjoyed an unusually close relationship with the u s washington was venezuelas main supplier of weapons and training and venezuela was the only south american country to get u s made f s in the s the u s military had an office in the venezuelan defense ministry building until mr chavez closed it and mr baduel and many of his peers took advanced classes in fort benning ga partly as a result of the u s tie mr chavez has never trusted the military fully the mistrust blossomed after the coup mr chavez then purged even officers seen as politically impartial he made several key units of the army including ones based in strategic positions report directly to him instead of the defense minister he depends for his personal security on a cuban praetorian guard on loan from fidel castro a fact that has caused friction with venezuelan units on the night mr chavez lost the referendum two lines of cuban guards in signature red guayabera tropical shirts surrounded the presidential palace as dozens of dazed and drunken chavistas nearby tried to absorb their defeat most problematic for many in the military is mr chavezs creation of a "peoples reserve" militia equipped with the armys old fal rifles which are being replaced with ak s purchased from russia its existence strips the traditional military of its monopoly over the state use of force although the militia was ostensibly formed to protect venezuela against a u s invasion most analysts see it as mr chavezs way of warning the army not to take any action against him mr baduel opposed mr chavezs moves to elevate the militia and take control of military promotions but like a good soldier he held his fire until he retired as defense minister last july he used his retirement ceremony to fire a warning shot in the presidents direction as mr chavez sat stony faced mr baduel gave an extraordinary speech warning that venezuela should not repeat the errors of soviet communism as it tried to define its path toward what mr chavez has vaguely called "st century socialism " "we must admit the theoretical model for it at this moment doesnt exist " mr baduel said of mr chavezs plan four months later mr baduel landed a bigger blow in an unusual press conference he recalled his role in defeating the coup against mr chavez now he called mr chavezs proposed constitutional reforms a "legal coup detat " "if i defended the constitution then i have the moral duty to defend the constitution now " says mr baduel thumbing through his miniature copy which he keeps prominently displayed on his desk mr chavez reacted violently to the speech he led a meeting of thousands of red shirted followers who shouted "baduel traitor to the execution wall " mr baduels rise is seen with suspicion by some in the opposition "i respect him enormously but i never want to see another military man at the presidential palace " says one opposition leader who has worked closely with mr baduel in recent months "you know when they come in but you never know when they are going to leave " nevertheless mr baduel is preparing to enter the battleground of politics he has struck an allegiance with podemos a leftist party which also recently broke with mr chavez some expect the former chavez ally to run for a state governorship next year or for president after that "i dont discard now that i have entered a new cycle of life an incursion into politics " he says as a gregorian chant plays in the background
