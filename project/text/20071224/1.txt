german town is cutting prices on items from fleece sweaters to toy castles at the karstadt store across the street the discounts range from cashmere sweaters to fondue sets not too long ago these sales would have been against the law in contrast to the u s where pre christmas price cuts play a key part in retailers strategies and shoppers buying plans holiday sales mark a small revolution in european retailing for decades european retailers could cut prices only during certain periods set by the government the winter sales usually in january came too late for cash strapped christmas shoppers in germanys retail laws changed to allow stores to hold sales when they please but most retailers still kept prices high in the holiday season now though that last remnant of traditional retail regulation is cracking as well "its so practical that the rigid rules for sales have been lifted " says ute schoppe a year old mother of two in berlin who bought a ski suit for her year old son leon at almost half price last week "in the past i always had to pay attention not to miss the first days of the sale because the real bargains sold out right away and i often didnt feel like fighting the crowds now there are even sales before christmas and i can take my time comparing prices " germanys bild tabloid newspaper recently highlighted the still novel sales in a story headlined "more than amazing christmas bargains save up to " the concept is so foreign that signs in stores often use the english word "sale " european retail regulation began to loosen in the s pushed by efforts to harmonize european union states laws the onslaught of global competition and the rise of internet retailing that allowed for cross border bargain hunting and shopping outside strictly regulated store hours in large parts of the continent governments have dropped restrictions on store hours for instance allowing sunday openings in france where the government still regulates even the setting of retail prices president nicolas sarkozy is preparing a bill to overhaul the countrys deeply entrenched shopping regulations "across europe decision making responsibility is shifting from the state to the retailers " says wolfgang twardawa an economist with the society for consumer research in nuremberg germany but moves to change the rules for when and how people shop have come slowly and brought public soul searching about life in a consumer society as well as stiff resistance from trade unions churches and small retailers who say increased flexibility hurts store workers and benefits only large chains in germany it took years of intense debate to eliminate a nazi era law that prohibited haggling and put limits on bonus schemes such as store loyalty cards enacted in after the economic instability following world war i the so called discount law and another regulation passed at the time the free gift act banning giveaways except for trinkets were seen as a way to protect the distribution of goods to consumers and to protect consumers from the vagaries of the free market for the nazis it was also a way to hurt the countrys department store owners many of them jewish who had been experimenting with creative sales strategies the discount law lived on beyond the war years because many consumers saw a need to protect small shopkeepers from large retail chains some thought that consumers too needed protection it wasnt until this set of laws was scrapped in that retailers could offer deals like gifts with purchases and discounts for volume buys "germans tend to adhere to structures and rhythms that dont change " says rolf pangels managing director of the retail federation bag in berlin "and they tend to want a law for everything an american wouldnt understand all the laws we have here " germany passed another milestone on the way toward a u s style consumer society when it dropped strict national store closing laws last year leaving the rules up to the states in many regions stores can now open or close whenever they want "we enjoy being able to take a relaxed shopping trip after work " says annekathrin nagel a year old postal worker out shopping in berlin one recent night "opening hours should regulate themselves through demand and supply " kaufhof a unit of retail giant metro ag now keeps big city stores open until p m since the law

more than tripled the number of big sales they hold throughout the year and offer spot promotions almost constantly "the amount of goods sold has increased " says the federations mr pangels "but the resulting growth in revenues depends on the size of the discounts with discounts of or the retailers margin is small " europe is still a long way from the shop till you drop fervor of the u s remnants of past regulation live on in laws such as the german "price labeling decree " which mandates that anything in shop windows must carry a price tag to ensure consumers instantly know an items affordability in france the government still sets minimum prices retailers must pay suppliers even in britain one of the most deregulated and shopper friendly countries in europe large stores cant open for more than six hours on sunday some shoppers say they prefer regulation "stores should not be open too long so that the sales people can rest " says sophie coumel who works for a franco german youth organization in berlin and was buying a present at a kaufhof store one recent evening shopping for a suit nearby jakob lange a year old student agreed "stores should stay closed on sunday " he said "i was raised christian and consider this part of christian culture " and retailers havent completely abandoned the traditional twice yearly inventory clearing sales at the long established times
