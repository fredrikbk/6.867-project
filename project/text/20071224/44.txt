politics &amp economics critic of three gorges remains steadfast as beijing admits faults on hydroelectric project a crusader presses her campaign beijing chinas foremost critic of the three gorges dam waves impatiently at the golf course stretching below her apartment window next to a posh new development north of beijing "i hate this view golf is a big waste of water for the rich " says dai qing who moved recently to be near her daughter for two decades ms dai was best known in china for her crusade against building a dam across chinas longest river now that chinas government admits drastic measures are needed to avert a "catastrophe" caused by the dams ecological and environmental problems ms dai should feel vindicated but she doesnt see it that way she says the governments acknowledgment of the problems at three gorges is an attempt to contain public outcry over what she calls a &# billion boondoggle that still must be subsidized through electricity costs "its the thief shouting thief " says the year old ms dai whose diminutive stature conceals an unyielding stubbornness "yes what i said back then was right but this still hurts my country and that pains me " she says ms dai is continuing her campaign against the dam over the internet and through overseas outlets despite the difficulties of making her message heard within china she is even taking on other issues such as the beijing olympics which she describes as a waste of resources in a country where millions still live without access to clean drinking water decent education or health care the government says the three gorges dam the worlds largest hydroelectric project was necessary to stop floods and provide clean electricity for years beijing quashed opposition from critics like ms dai who said the dam wouldnt stem floods and instead would trigger landslides worsen pollution and increase poverty among the million people displaced by the reservoir in ms dai was imprisoned in part for her opposition to the dam and spent months in a jail for sensitive political prisoners where she was forced to write confessions and heard at one point she was supposed to be executed ms dais own story has as many twists and turns as the yangtze river she has fought to protect she was born in in chongqing to devoted communists who were close to the partys founders in china her parents spied against the japanese her father was killed and her mother tortured by the japanese for their work afterward ms dai was adopted by one of chinas top generals and onetime minister of defense marshal ye jianying and she grew up in a life of rare privilege and comfort where she learned to speak her mind later ms dai studied military engineering and worked on guidance systems for ballistic missiles like many others ms dais family suffered during the turmoil of the cultural revolution from to she and her husband were exiled to the countryside and not allowed to see their young daughter who was left behind in beijing eventually the family was reunited and she started working as a designer of surveillance cameras at a military factory ms dai published a short story based on the cultural revolution and the storys success encouraged her to become a full time writer she worked with a writers association while still on the armys payroll as a spy at one point she was supposed to keep tabs on visiting american writer studs terkel whose famous oral histories later served as models for her she acknowledges that she was a spy but laughs at how badly prepared for the job she was her undercover career ended when she was exposed along with others by a chinese agent in contact with americans she says her environmental activism began with a trip to hong kong in the mid s when for the first time she read reports about problems with the proposed three gorges dam ms dai was struck by the stories of farmers who didnt want to be relocated from the land the reservoir would flood the three gorges dam had been debated ever since when sun yat sen one of modern chinas founding fathers dreamed of a hydropowered industrial revolution that could propel china into the future seduced by the grandeur of building the worlds biggest dam the project became a symbol for chinas ambitions to build a modern nation in the mid s the three gorges project began moving forward under the stewardship of then vice premier li peng a soviet trained engineer with a background in the hydropower sector mr li was a powerful bureaucratic operator with little tolerance for dissent he worked to stifle debate on the project over the ensuing decade during which time he rose to be premier and continued to champion the dam there were plenty of doubts about the dams feasibility ms dai began to report on the questions is the ground stable enough where can the million people be relocated why not build smaller dams in early she decided to publish a collection of essays by experts critiquing the project called "yangtze yangtze " the political atmosphere in china seemed to be opening she was able to find a publisher and host a news conference her book credited with persuading the government to delay the project was one of the first efforts to rally public opinion for an environmental cause in china but the climate quickly changed when the government cracked down on student democracy protesters in tiananmen square that spring a clampdown in which mr li then premier played a prominent role in the final days of the protest ms dai tried to persuade pro democracy activists to leave tiananmen square after the tanks rolled into beijing ms dai was rounded up along with many others she spent months in jail upon her release she took up the mantle against the dam once again she published her jailhouse memoirs which included passages viewed by some as favorable to the government that in turn led some to suggest she had sold out to the government which she denies ms dai continued her campaign against the dam even after construction began in the dam was completed last year and the reservoir will be filled by with funding from a series of fellowships and teaching posts at institutions like canadas probe international columbia university and australian national university she also has done research into other taboo political subjects of communist party rule in china in august she joined some chinese activists and writers in signing an open letter calling on china to improve human rights before the olympics she is working on an oral history of water in old beijing as a way to highlight the environmental degradation development has brought today ms dai is apparently no longer tailed by police and is allowed to write and research in relative freedom she is trying to find out how much the three gorges dam really cost she thinks it was far more than the official price tag of some &# billion "people like me are now finding a small chance to speak a little " she says her books still are banned on the mainland but she was recently invited to contribute to one of chinas more famous blog sites "my old readers i miss you very much havent seen you for a long time " she wrote on her opening post earlier this year she still isnt completely free though the web sites administrators blocked anything on current events still half a million readers have logged on commented one "dear dai i wont feel depressed even if i cant see your story i would be happy as long as your blog still exists you are a flag in my heart " ms dai doesnt appear to be slowing down on a recent day she scrambles down a scraggly embankment of the qiaobai river one of the five major rivers of beijing the quarter mile wide riverbed has been dry for the past decade the water has been dammed upstream for one of the reservoirs that quench beijings thirst nearby officials have spent &# million to divert another river into this one for the olympic canoe races elsewhere the government is spending more money diverting other rivers to beijing to ensure water supplies for next years games the latest government attempt to fiddle with nature leaves ms dai exasperated and energized for a new fight against the olympics "theyre all crazy wheres the water going to come from " she says kersten zhang and zhou yang contributed to this article
