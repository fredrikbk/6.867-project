maimuna taal ndure helped make africas dangerous skies a little safer she tightened aircraft inspections on a continent where many planes fly without adequate maintenance checks she ordered repairs to rutted airport runways and grounded decrepit jumbo jets linked to suspected weapons smugglers what it brought her however was trouble she clashed with local airlines state intelligence agents searched her office and she was accused of sabotaging gambian flights to the muslim holy city of mecca in november gambian prosecutors had her arrested and later charged her with embezzlement after months of trial her case was dismissed she left the gambia earlier this year for fear of being rearrested ms taals travails raise questions about how serious african governments are about fixing the continents troubled aviation industry across much of africa and in many other parts of the developing world the safety picture is bleak poorly funded air regulators exert little authority struggling carriers cut costs by skimping on aircraft upkeep safety equipment and staff training geriatric planes operate long past their recommended retirement dates africas skies are the worlds most dangerous between and africa averaged deaths annually per million passengers carried compared with deaths per million in north america according to ascend worldwide ltd a london aviation consulting firm gambia hasnt had any horrific airline crashes in recent years but the u s federal aviation authority which assesses how well foreign countries enforce basic air safety standards has certified only five african nations and gambia isnt one of them in some countries war and disease take higher priorities but often politicians with financial ties to dodgy carriers profit from lax oversight nigerian officials say that a key reason for a spate of deadly crashes in that country was that local politicians with stakes in airlines prevented watchdogs from grounding unsafe operators several international air safety specialists who worked with gambias ms taal contend she was forced out because she refused to bend to the desires of politicians marion blakey former head of the u s federal aviation authority says ms taal was a "courageous voice for improving safety on a continent that has struggled mightily with the issue " in an interview earlier this month gambian solicitor general henry carrol described ms taals indictment as an "action of the government in fighting corruption " ms taal he added "was fighting with everyone and being very arrogant women in high offices do that a lot they tend to be arrogant and bully men " ms taal who is years old categorically denied during a recent interview in london that she did anything wrong she says her experience points to a bigger scourge facing africa "theres a serious lack of political will in our regions " she told an international gathering of top aviation safety officials in washington three weeks before her arrest many african regulators "want to do the right thing but they dont get support " flying in africa long treacherous has grown more so over the past two decades after international attention to the continent waned following the cold war illicit trade in gold diamonds and guns has thrived and much of the merchandise is carried on dilapidated planes registered in countries known for lax oversight gambia a peaceful country of million on africas atlantic coast exemplified the continents weak system of aviation regulation in britain banned gambian planes from landing in the united kingdom due to fears about their safety in gambias civil aviation authority failed to meet minimal air safety standards set by the united nations international civil aviation organization which further isolated the country from international air traffic ms taal arrived in the gambian capital banjul in she was an idealistic aeronautical engineer born in london to gambian parents she had wanted to become an airline pilot but poor eyesight ended that dream when she arrived the wave of optimism that followed the coup staged by current president yahya jammeh was dwindling corruption scandals were plaguing the presidents inner circle and the economy was slowing due to failed development policies around that time u n investigators fingered gambia as a conduit for diamonds used to finance wars in neighboring liberia sierra leone and congo these "blood diamonds " u n officials alleged often bought weapons that were shipped aboard illegally registered airplanes such planes which also carried paying passengers had been involved in fatal crashes across the continent ms taals first job at gambias civil aviation authority or caa was certifying the safety of aircraft she was enthusiastic about her job and new life in gambia where she adopted an orphaned year old girl she recalls working in an office so crammed with desks and filing cabinets that staffers had to squeeze in sideways to reach their seats several months after she arrived officials from the u n s civil aviation organization came to inspect gambias caa and raised its safety grade based in part on improvements already under way the international vote of confidence energized the governments plans to revamp banjul airport which has one of africas longest runways the idea was to make banjul like singapore and dubai a tax free zone and regional cargo hub by the airport project manager musa jallow a friend of ms taals had secured almost &# million in foreign aid the day after he chose a contractor to refurbish the airport however he was fired and arrested on corruption charges he wasnt jailed but he was questioned repeatedly over two years before the charges were dropped mr jallow left gambia in and now lives in britain in an recent interview he said he believes he was detained because he ignored pressure from people claiming to be close to the government to choose one particular bidder "the moment the money is allocated by donors politicians want to find ways to siphon funds " he said an official with gambias national intelligence agency which conducts criminal investigations declined to comment on mr jallows case in sept president jammeh unexpectedly named ms taal the caas director general confident that she had government support she began cleaning house she offered retirement packages to ineffective staffers and fired those who rejected buyouts she lobbied for a new aviation law granting the caa statutory independence ms taal also cracked down on airlines slok air was a nigerian carrier that had relocated to gambia in after its license was revoked in nigeria ms taal forced slok to retrain its pilots and stick to rigorous and costly plane maintenance schedules and fined it for breaking rules on how many hours pilots are allowed to fly david tanaruno a senior slok manager says the carrier asked ms taal three times for leeway on maintenance deadlines but she never granted any ernest bellgam who first ran slok in gambia says ms taal sometimes "took hasty action " ms taal says she was simply following international safety standards she also focused on the caas troubled finances despite a steady flow of airport charges passenger duties and air traffic control fees the agency was heavily in debt the reason ms taal says was that much of the caas income was being redirected to other government offices she battled to regain control of the funds she says she used the money to replace antiquated runway lights and rebuild an airport security fence and spent &# training aviation inspectors international aviation authorities rewarded her efforts in august britain removed gambia from its blacklist so its planes could once again land in the u k and u s faa officials began the process of assessing whether gambia now met international safety standards ms taal says she now believes that wresting back control of caa funds created enemies within the government "it was the beginning of my downfall " she says in interviews earlier this month in banjul officials at various gambian government offices including the caa declined to discuss ms taal mr carrol the nations solicitor general wouldnt discuss the particulars of her case in ms taal says senior government officials pressed her to hand over more than &# million of caa money to another government agency she says she refused soon after she says investigators from the national intelligence agency or nia began searching her offices they said they were looking into operational and financial problems plaguing flights connected to the gambian hajj the nations participation in the annual pilgrimage by muslims to mecca ms taal says she noticed that the investigators were digging into files unrelated to the hajj flights including material on regular operations such as the repairs to the airport fence caa staffers were taken to nia headquarters for questioning she says ms taal says she felt the nia was using the hajj inquiry to find dirt on her she complained "it appears everything is being looked at to find faults where there is no fault " she wrote in a letter to president jammehs secretary general the searches stopped she says in the fall of ms taal received a request from state owned gambia international airlines for permission to lease two boeing jetliners for flights to mecca the year old jumbos were registered in sierra leone a war torn country that repeatedly failed to enforce safety standards and whose planes were already banned in gambia global authorities had linked the two s to people suspected of weapons and diamond trafficking according to william voss then a top official at the u n s civil aviation organization mr voss says he told ms taal about that ms taal says she knew that grounding the two planes which she calls "flying coffins " would be politically risky because she could be accused of thwarting the hajj she demanded instead that the planes undergo expensive maintenance gambia airlines dropped its leasing plan later nigeria also rejected the two jets on safety grounds and they were eventually sold for scrap within weeks of ms taals decision in november nia agents showed up at her office and demanded her office keys and her gambian passport she says they took her to nia headquarters but didnt tell her why she was being arrested an nia official who returned a call seeking comment but declined to give his name said he could not comment on ms taals case "nia administrations come and go " he said "we dont know about past investigations " ms taal says she was locked in an nia conference room she was asthmatic and too frightened to eat she says she slept on chairs for five days until her parents flew in from london and paid her bail soon after her release an article about her arrest appeared in the international herald tribune she was arrested again the next day ms taal says that daba marena then director general of the nia told her that president jammeh was angry about gambias negative portrayal in the article and had assumed she was behind it mr marena also told her that her arrest had been ordered in part because blocking the jumbo jet leasing had "sabotaged the hajj " ms taal says mr marena was arrested in march for allegedly taking part in a coup attempt and has not been seen in gambia since amnesty international has said it believes he may have been "extra judicially executed " international aviation officials were outraged by ms taals arrest and lobbied western governments to monitor the case "we realized that to support reform in africa we had to stand up for the star " says mr voss an american who now runs the flight safety foundation a nonprofit group in virginia if ms taal were jailed on trumped up charges he says "wed never get anyone in africa to stand up and enforce the standards " on jan ms taal was arraigned on seven criminal counts of "economic crime " mostly related to the banjul airport hub improvement project during the trial which stretched intermittently over months prosecutors argued that ms taal had violated government contract procedures had inappropriately received a &# monthly stipend connected to her service on a caa committee and had broken other rules ms taal denies that she improperly enriched herself some prosecution witnesses offered testimony that appeared to support her "she was a very good director general " caa chairman august prom testified according to a transcript of the trial in may the judge dismissed the case mr carrol gambias solicitor general insists that ms taal was corrupt and the government simply "didnt have the evidence to convict her lawyers are very clever and find technicalities to get their clients off " others saw ms taals case as an attempt to intimidate her into scaling back her regulatory efforts "theres a tendency to arrest first and build a case after" in gambia says sam sarr publisher of foroyaa one of gambias few opposition newspapers after her case was dismissed ms taal climbed into a car with friends who drove her across the border into senegal she flew on to london since then aviation reforms in gambia have slowed one international organization that was planning to give gambias aviation industry &# million in aid diverted the funds to another country after ms taals arrest according to a person familiar with the matter the faas examination of whether gambia now meets international safety standards has stalled that could make it tougher for gambia to expanded foreign trade and tourism ms taal now living in another african country says she is eager to resume air safety work on the continent but she does not intend to return to gambia because shes concerned about her safety "there was so much more we could have achieved " she says
