lebanon crisis threatens u s syria thaw political impasse in beirut has bush accusing bashar of impeding reconciliation lebanons worsening political crisis is undercutting a hoped for rapprochement between the u s and syria and potentially undermining the bush administrations wider peace initiative in the middle east in recent days lebanons political factions failed for the th time to elect a new president increasing fears in the region of a prolonged political vacuum in beirut and a possible return to civil strife the lebanese pro western bloc and its opposition led by the iranian and syrian backed hezbollah militia and political party have agreed on a lebanese general for the presidency but the two sides are at loggerheads over the makeup of a new government as well as over who would control the countrys security services many lebanese politicians fear that it could be months before a new president is selected and that the uncertain political situation risks further eroding their countrys national institutions there are also mounting concerns that the stalemate could feed into already rising tensions between lebanons myriad political and religious factions "we could go through without a president " said walid jumblatt a key leader in the ruling political block known as the march movement "a government without a president faces real problems " the political stalemate is also sparking a war of words between the u s and syria just weeks after the two countries appeared on a path toward political reconciliation it also comes as the u s is praising damascuss principal ally in the region iran for its efforts to curb violence in iraq washingtons ambassador to iraq ryan crocker said yesterday in baghdad that "the iranians have indicated not to us but to others that they have had a role in" a reduction in violence "if thats the case then its good " syrias attendance at the u s brokered annapolis peace conference last month in maryland fueled hopes of greater cooperation between washington and damascus in promoting stability in the palestinian territories iraq and lebanon and american diplomats have been talking of backing direct peace talks between israel and syria over the golan heights a region captured by israel from damascus during the war but last week president bush directly charged syrian president bashar assad with undermining reconciliation between lebanons rival factions and u s officials are again talking of ratcheting up pressure against damascus through financial sanctions and diplomatic isolation french president nicolas sarkozy called mr assad last week to seek his assistance in brokering a compromise in beirut but mr bush said the u s wouldnt be making any similar overtures toward damascus "my patience ran out on president assad a long time ago " mr bush said thursday "and the reason why is because he houses palestinian militant group hamas he facilitates hezbollah suiciders go from his country into iraq and he destabilizes lebanon " mr bush said washington now supports the march movements right to unilaterally select a new president this could be achieved through a parliamentary vote based on march s simple majority rather then the two thirds consensus it has been seeking syrian and hezbollah leaders both attacked president bushs suggestion of a unilateral presidential vote saying it could spark an internal conflict "bush your orders will not be implemented and your tutelage is rejected " hezbollahs deputy leader naim kassem said in a statement friday "lebanon is not a farm that you can do whatever you want with it " mr jumblatt and other march leaders also say that such a move risks sparking a civil war and that they remain committed for now to electing the agreed upon presidential candidate gen michel suleiman the commander of the lebanese armed forces but march has refused the oppositions demand that it be given a blocking number of seats in any new lebanese cabinet and more control of the security forces the assassination this month of gen suleimans deputy brig gen francois hajj is further roiling lebanons political stability gen hajj worked closely with the u s earlier this year in putting down an islamist uprising in northern lebanon led by an al qaeda inspired militia fatah al islam privately some u s officials believe damascus played a direct role in gen hajjs murder viewing his potential promotion to lebanons military commander as a threat to syrian interests lebanese military investigators say they are looking into fatah al islams possible role in the attack president assad ended years of syrian military occupation of lebanon in following the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri a united nations investigation has implicated senior syrian officials in the murder damascus denies any involvement in the deaths of either mr hariri or gen hajj the discord over lebanon could affect the arab israeli peace effort say senior u s officials syria is a principal supporter of the palestinian militant groups hamas and palestinian islamic jihad and is seen as potentially playing a spoilers role in any advancement toward reconciliation between israel and the palestinians u s officials say they specifically sought damascuss attendance at the annapolis summit as a means of bringing president assad into the wider peace process now bush administration officials are questioning the merits of this strategy russian president vladimir putin has floated the idea of a moscow conference in the coming months as a venue where israel and syria could directly discuss peace but bush administration officials say it remains unclear how much international support exists for this effort while damascus is seen as threatening lebanons stability "a lot of people had real hopes at annapolis" that it "would bring a change in syrian behavior " said a senior u s official working on lebanon "it just hasnt happened "
