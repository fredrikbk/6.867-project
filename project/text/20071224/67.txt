business day sign up for the e mail here the thai election victory of former prime minister thaksin shinawatras party is a blow for the military that ousted and essentially exiled mr thaksin months ago but it also seems to threaten any post coup stability sought by the country the pro thaksin peoples power party won seats yesterday in the member parliament and party officials said today they had
