holiday spending may defy gloom of consumer polls early indications that christmas sales have been decent though not spectacular suggest that americans may be opening their wallets wider than consumer confidence barometers have been signaling they would with the economy sending mixed signals the issue of how well those barometers predict consumer behavior has taken on greater than usual significance this holiday season amid widespread concerns that a credit crunch will tip the nation into recession economists have been poring over sentiment indicators and retail sales data looking for clues about consumer spending by far the biggest contributor to the u s economy their recent interest underscores a long running debate about whether confidence numbers are useful in predicting how freely consumers will spend or anything at all indeed while the surveys show confidence has plunged in recent months a resurgence in spending during the final weekend of the holiday shopping season appears likely to bring a sigh of relief to many of the nations retailers data released friday show why many economists have reservations about the surveys at a m in washington the commerce department reported that consumer spending rose in november at the fastest clip in years ninety minutes later the reuters university of michigan survey reported that consumer sentiment in december had fallen to a two year low and excluding the aftermath of hurricane katrina had hit its lowest level in more than years the monthly survey by the conference board a new york business research group has also suggested an upswing in pessimism the groups index of consumer confidence sank in november by points its largest point change in two years to a two year low of but it isnt clear what the low readings mean other than that consumers are worried although holiday sales estimates wont be available until today at the earliest retail industry observers who track seasonal sales were upbeat yesterday "we had projected a increase in dollars spent this holiday season and we expect that number will be hit and potentially could go a little bit higher " said bill martin co founder of shoppertrak rct corp the apparent resilience of consumer spending only adds to the growing skepticism about the usefulness of consumer surveys part of the problem is the age old debate between causation and correlation jeremy piger an assistant professor of economics at the university of oregon who studied consumer sentiment while working at the federal reserve bank of st louis explained that early academic studies of consumer surveys found that there was a correlation between the level of consumer confidence and future economic activity but he said later studies "got more sophisticated " they took a close look at other economic data released each month to see whether the confidence surveys in and of themselves had any predictive power "the answer has pretty uniformly been no " he said the consumer numbers reflected other developments on jobs and prices for example a study by dean croushore an associate professor of economics at the university of richmond concluded "if you are forecasting consumer spending for the next quarter you should use data on past consumer spending and stock prices and ignore data on consumer confidence " but many wall street economists continue to use the confidence surveys when making their consumer spending forecasts particularly when the surveys move sharply or approach levels consistent with previous recessions deutsche bank chief u s economist joseph lavorgna recently told clients that if the michigan survey stays below and the conference boards remains below for three months or more "then consumer spending will be much less than what we are currently predicting " richard iley senior u s economist at bnp paribas said "clearly if consumer confidence is sustained at very low levels it points to a reasonably bleak level of consumer spending " and minutes from the federal reserves october meeting when policy makers cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point show that "a number of participants cited notable declines in survey measures of consumer confidence since the onset of financial turbulence in midsummer as factors likely to restrain consumer spending going forward " consumer sentiment surveys get close scrutiny because consumer spending accounts for about of the nations economy activity that means any change can have a huge impact on economic growth the preliminary university of michigan report is also valued because it is released near the beginning of the month before the governments tally of retail sales is available providing an early signal of consumer attitudes david resler chief economist at nomura securities says the overall confidence numbers dont tell him a lot he doesnt already know "if consumer confidence is down its probably because employment is weak inflation is high or some combination of those things " he said still he looks closely at data on specific trends such as plans for buying cars and other big ticket items "were looking hard at every shard of data we come across to ascertain where spending is headed " he said joshua shapiro chief economist at the research firm mfr inc parses the surveys for his clients but has a disclaimer at the end of his comments "in our view consumer sentiment and confidence indicators have never been more than loosely correlated coincident indicators of economic activity and this relationship has become even weaker in recent years " the consumer polls in one form or another have been around for decades the michigan survey dates back to world war ii when government officials sought information about consumer attitudes as policy makers fretted there was danger of a postwar pullback in spending the survey now released monthly is conducted over the phone and is based on interviews of about people the conference boards index was introduced in and has been tallied monthly since it is based on a questionnaire mailed to households homes typically respond both surveys use a handful of key multiple choice questions to produce an overall index of consumers sentiment as well as indexes on current and expected economic conditions they also ask about buying plans the jobs market and price expectations a drop in consumer confidence was one of the first signs that the u s was headed for recession in but sentiment also sank after the stock market crashed in and there was no follow on recession more recently confidence dropped in and again in after hurricane katrina hit the u s gulf coast there werent recessions following those declines whether recent nose dives in confidence will translate into a recession remains to be seen but one thing is clear apprehension alone doesnt mean consumers will stop spending
