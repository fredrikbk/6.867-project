philipss medical malady unit looks to expand in emerging markets as u s business slows philips electronics nvs medical equipment division has been a growth engine in recent years but this year it hit a speed bump budget conscious u s officials the federal government concerned about ballooning u s health care spending beginning this year cut its medicare reimbursement for out of hospital scanning procedures such as x rays cat scans and mris in large part because of the change philipss medical division which had been pegged to grow at a year is now expected to grow no more than to as hospitals and outpatient clinics postpone buying expensive medical scanners half of the companys medical business comes from the u s the companys trimming of its forecast caused its stock to drop from euros &# at current exchange rates on the day of the announcement in october though it has regained some ground since then in fridays trading in amsterdam philips shares fell or european cents to euros apiece competitors general electric co and siemens ag have also been affected and have said sales in their medical businesses would be mostly flat this year but ge and siemens have large units in other areas including aviation infrastructure and construction to compensate for the slowdown as a result ge and siemens are forecasting overall revenue growth of or more while philips expects overall revenue to grow to to offset the slowdown in the u s imaging market philips is stepping up its efforts in fast growing emerging markets the company is also pushing into businesses aimed at medical procedures that appeal directly to consumers and are less dependent on government reimbursement policies one reason behind its deal disclosed friday to buy respironics inc a u s maker of sleep and respiratory products focusing on the u s home health care market for billion euros the companys approach differs from that of ge and siemens which seem to be willing to ride out the short term slowdown in the u s the two companies declined to comment "were trying to diversify our health care portfolio to move into the home " said stephen h rusckowski who runs the companys philips medical systems division "we see it as a way we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors " philipss medical division was supposed to cure the ills that had begun to plague the year old company when chief executive gerard kleisterlee took over six years ago the companys big brand name business of making compact disc players and tv sets was getting crushed by cheaper asian competitors while its computer chip division was hemorrhaging cash following the bursting of the internet bubble mr kleisterlee retooled the company to make health care the new center of its business along with its fast growing lighting division he won over investors by arguing that focusing on higher margin products in health and lighting would deliver strong long term growth but the slowdown in the medical business has exposed the pitfalls of betting on health care although health care spending increases every year it isnt always easy to translate that big promise into profits since governments spend so much on health care their policies have an outsize impact on sales of drugs devices and treatments companies like drug maker pfizer inc and insurer aetna inc are accustomed to managing the risk of reimbursement policies but philips is new to the game mr rusckowski predicted that the difficulties in the u s market would continue for at least an additional six to months but he was confident that medical sales would eventually rebound "what happened in was a slowdown in one specific country but it doesnt change our long term expectations for the medical marketplace " he said mr rusckowski described a confluence of factors that led to the slowdown first the u s government ratcheted down the amount it pays each time a patient on medicare gets a scan or x ray at a medical clinic outside the hospital although the reimbursement for in hospital scans didnt change some hospital administrators began to worry that the new lower rate would eventually be expanded to hospitals and backed off purchasing new equipment said mr rusckowski in addition a new generation of ct scan machines was due to be released by ge siemens and philips in mid november so hospitals stopped spending in anticipation of the new technology spending on ct scanners was down this year lastly medical research has focused increased skepticism on devices that open clogged arteries called stents that led to a drop in operations to insert stents lowering demand for equipment for catheterization labs where the operations are performed philips is a leader in catheterization lab equipment mr rusckowski said new studies that reach different conclusions on the issue have since been released and doctors would have to debate the best treatment options scott geels an analyst at sanford c bernstein &amp co said despite the downturn he still believed that medical was a promising high growth market for philips "this is a glitch that will work itself out with time " he said philipss medical division grew to billion euros in revenue in and to reach billion euros in revenue in mr geels is forecasting growth and billion euros in revenue this year philipss guidance is for to growth on the year the medical division accounted for about of philipss billion euros in earnings before interest taxes and amortization in the first three quarters of with lighting contributing and the rest coming from consumer electronics and household appliances the overall company reported net income of billion euros during that period as part of its efforts to reach emerging markets philips signed a joint venture in china with neusoft a software and medical technology firm to design new low cost imaging equipment tailored for poorer economies and bought an x ray company in brazil called vmi sistemas medicos in june philips is also building a consumer health care business to sell things including home health monitoring and disease management software philips can pitch these products or services directly to patients or their family members who help with their medical care for example its lifeline business connects elderly people to call centers at the push of a button to allow them to live independently
