some holiday books about inspiration and delusion at work many business books are heavier on jargon than on wisdom executives often complain but among this years titles are some that can sharpen managers thinking about technology management and careers other simply offer pleasure as the holiday season gives some respite from meetings and business trips the exchange of ideas on the internet for example is bound to keep proliferating which is what makes "wikinomics how mass collaboration changes everything " by don tapscott and anthony williams worthwhile reading the book highlights how traditional collaboration among employees in meeting rooms is fast being superseded by collaboration on a much vaster scale thanks to the internet masses of people beyond corporate boundaries can exchange thoughts and innovate to produce content goods and services web sites such as wikipedia the user edited online encyclopedia myspace and even the human genome project encourage this interaction which spurs growth some corporate executives still lament the competition this poses to their proprietary marketplace offerings but mr tapscott a proponent of open sourcing argues that the more you share the more you win he and mr williams outline ways to exploit the power of online collaboration they describe how companies from flickr to the more traditional procter &amp gamble have benefited from inviting in ideas from customers and others browsing the web for a trenchant view of business and business advice take a dip into "the halo effect and the eight other business delusions that deceive managers " by phil rosenzweig the author a former manager turned professor asserts that a great deal of analysis offered by consultants academics and the media is simplistic and often "deeply flawed " when a company reports that sales and profits are on the rise for example people say it has a visionary leader and a brilliant strategy when performance then falters they say the leader was myopic and had the wrong strategy yet little in the way of leadership and strategy may actually have changed the book illustrates this point by delving into good and bad times at big companies such as cisco and ibm it identifies nine common business delusions including "single explanations" for success or failure and "absolute performance " because company performance is relative to competition following one formula can never guarantee results mr rosenzwieg asserts success comes only from doing things better than rivals do them "the halo effect" is for executives who arent looking for a quick fix prescription and who understand that winning depends on knowing ones own company and on executing smart decisions well with a little luck mixed in managers who want to be
