japan seeks to loosen regulations overhaul is intended to improve prospects for financial services tokyo japan trying to strengthen its financial services industry announced a proposal for large scale deregulation of stock exchanges funds and financial institutions that suggests a fundamental change in industry regulation the plan released friday by the financial services agency is part of a review aimed at boosting the appeal of the countrys capital markets although tokyo is still a major financial center the citys status has slid over the past years that is partly a result of the popping of the s asset bubble but also because costs and regulation have led money managers to take their business to less regulated centers such as singapore and hong kong during the past year or so bolstering the countrys financial markets has become a goal for the japanese government the financial services plan which could be submitted to parliament as early as march would allow a greater breadth of funds more disclosure in english and the creation of comprehensive financial exchanges the scope of the plan suggests the agency wants japan to lose its reputation as an expensive bureaucratic place for financial services the nine year old agency has been criticized for micromanaging financial markets and making tokyo a difficult city in which to do business now it seems to be more willing to allow financial institutions to operate more freely and to deregulate the types of products that can be sold here industry participants said the plan exceeded their expectations "it is absolutely in the right direction and further in that direction than the skeptics would have believed possible " said mark branson the head of the tokyo unit of swiss banking group ubs ag "when i came here years ago people said that kind of change was impossible in japan " for example the agency headed by yoshimi watanabe said it would abolish a rule that requires exchange traded funds or mutual funds that trade like stocks to be based on designated stock indexes instead the agency wants to allow exchange traded funds based on any stock index or listed security including bonds or futures if approved the plan would allow foreign issuers of bonds equities and funds to submit disclosure documents to the agency in english removing the time consuming and costly task of translating documents into japanese the agency hopes this will encourage more foreign entities to raise money in japan where household assets amount to roughly &# trillion more than the annual output of the u s much of this earns relatively low rates of return the agency also hopes to foster innovation by allowing exchanges for different types of financial products to partner with or even to buy each other moves that currently require governmental approval by making it easier to form partnerships it hopes the exchanges might provide one stop shopping for financial products something it hopes will entice investors the plan would also lower the barrier between banks and brokerages such barriers are often referred to as glass steagall provisions after the u s legislation that created them in that country while the u s and other countries have lowered those barriers japan still has restrictions that prevent staff from banks and brokerages in the same group from occupying the same offices and sharing information on corporate customers relaxing those rules could help banks and their investment banking arms to generate more business
