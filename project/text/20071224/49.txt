politics &amp economics a web trolls toll on the clinton campaign fort mitchell ky in norse mythology trolls steal babies and leave their own shape shifting offspring behind on the internet they just steal attention as candidates increasingly use the internet to build political bridges their message boards have become homes for trolls users of an online community who leave messages that are ideologically opposed off topic or off color brian oneill a year old part time bartender and full time college student has been marauding on sen hillary clintons web site for the past few months even though his posts attacking the candidate are frequently scrubbed from the site within hours mr oneill turned to mrs clintons site after being booted from online forums of former sen john edwards sen barack obama and the democratic national committee although mr oneill says he isnt familiar with the term "troll " he has been labeled as one and not just once "i thought they were calling me like the you know little garden trolls " mr oneill says "and im like im not a garden item " mr oneill who lives in this small town outside cincinnati has a "special blogging place" two levels underground at the library on the campus of northern kentucky university in nearby highland heights on a break between classes he sits down at a bank of computers in the back corner of the stacks places his large cup of nutmeg seasoned french roast coffee on the table and logs on while many of the students browse the social networking site myspace mr oneill gets right to work posting an unfavorable article from the online drudge report to a bulletin board on mrs clintons site he keeps looking for disparaging news before finding a link to her personal financial disclosure filing he adjusts his chair and leans in toward the screen muttering "lets get me some dirt " grabbing a piece of unlined copier paper left on the desk next to him he begins scribbling notes about her stock holdings for his next raid mr oneill is hardly alone although the number of trolls cant be measured they regularly haunt online political sites which have mushroomed in recent years technorati which follows blogging trends now tracks english language politics blogs "the ability of trolls to gain attention to secure an audience if ever briefly is much greater than before " says derek gordon a former vice president at the company sites try various weapons to combat trolls campaign trolls popped up en masse in on democratic presidential hopeful howard deans web site dean supporters batted them back with a "troll goal " donating money to the campaigns coffers each time they spotted an offending post the supporters crowed about each sighting eliminating the trolls incentive to disrupt most campaigns and individual bloggers invite readers to report offensive comments and others approve each comment before it appears at the liberal discussion web site daily kos "trusted users" can block people whose comments regularly offend members daily kos has another tactic the recipe when a troll attempts to start a conversation at that site loyalists post recipes instead of engaging them with so many trolls the recipes have proliferated enough so that daily kos compiled a page "trollhouse cookbook " including crab bisque inspired by president bushs second inauguration and "liberal elite cranberry glazed brie " while that approach seems comical the problem is real michael lazzaro a daily kos contributing editor who goes by "hunter " says about people are banned each week but many return by setting up new accounts one person easily identified by his writing has opened more than accounts since he says "he basically comments for awhile really nicely and then out of the blue hell start ranting about women or jews or something like that " mr lazzaro says the clinton campaign simply yanks the posts of mr oneill and others "we have very clear cut terms of service that we ask people to read before posting to the site " says peter daou the clinton campaigns internet director the terms of service prohibit content that is "harmful" or "defamatory " among other things and lets the campaign delete comments for any reason mr daou declined to comment on mr oneills posts or the extent of the abuse at the site readers on the clinton site often take measures into their own hands "its nice to see you here on hillarys sight sic" one wrote to mr oneill "it shows your fear that hillary can win " mr oneill who goes by the handle "thepoliticalguy " doesnt let the comments get him down "if they think im a troll then so be it " he says before immediately rejecting this premise "its wrong its wrong wheres the freedom of ideas " he pounds the table "if youre on a site and youre just agreeing with each other all day wheres the argument " mr oneill has lived in northern kentucky since he was save for a few years spent in the army he worked hour shifts for seven years he says keeping baggage flowing underneath the cincinnati airport he returned to college three years ago where he started to follow domestic politics with newfound zeal "its the arguments " he says "i love to argue " when he returns to his one bedroom apartment mr oneill flips on the computer and checks mrs clintons web site his comment on her stock portfolio is already gone his brief disappointment gives way almost immediately to elation "wait a second " he says jumping to his feet "i still have the little piece of paper " he retrieves the notes from his backpack near the door "well just rewrite it " he recrafts the post and titles it "hillary clinton the oil war and fox news profiteer " he lists mrs clintons ownership in bp plc chevron corp boeing co and news corp despite the fact that the candidate and her husband liquidated their blind trust in april to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest "so the truth comes out " mr oneill concludes "if she is elected looks like we may spent a couple more years in iraq so someone can make more money on there stock dividends and guess what its not bush " mr oneills comment is back on the clinton site in minutes and off again
