push for energy legislation enters a tricky dance of trade offs house passes measure but compromises pose challenge for final bill washington democratic leaders hope to send president bush an energy bill this fall that lessens u s dependence on foreign oil but first they must strike compromises acceptable to both house and senate that will require politically delicate trade offs involving the auto and utility industries in the house of representatives which approved its package saturday on a vote any effort to embrace a big increase in vehicle fuel economy standards would risk eroding support among democrats especially business friendly moderates worried about u s auto makers and their workers in the senate any bid to require electric utilities to dramatically increase use of renewable resources such as solar and wind power would strain ties with republicans whose continued backing is needed the white house is lodging its own complaints including concerns that neither bill does anything to boost domestic oil and gas production "we have fundamental disagreements" that "are going to be very difficult to negotiate " said rep diana degette d colo approval of energy legislation capped a rancorous week in the house as democrats rushed to conclude action on childrens health farm spending and iraq before lawmakers withdrew for the monthlong summer recess with gasoline prices high and voter concern rising about the nations energy security democratic leaders kept the house in session during the weekend to take on the energy issue reflecting the importance party leaders now place on the initiative both the house and senate bills are designed to improve energy efficiency and begin weaning the nation off its reliance on fossil fuels among other things the measures promote wider use of alternative fuels such as corn based ethanol and solar power and would mandate improved energy conservation in commercial and residential buildings there are notable differences between the two bills however michigan democrat john dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and an ally of u s auto makers opposes senate approved fuel economy changes which would raise the minimum fleet average for cars and light trucks to miles per gallon by an increase of more than above current law other democrats including a coalition of moderates have signaled support for an industry backed alternative that would require much less stringent standards given the divisions in her partys ranks house speaker nancy pelosi chose to sidestep the issue last week in hopes that democratic leaders will be able to simply insert raised fuel economy standards into the final compromise package while she personally supports the senate passed increase it is clear those levels stir concern among rank and file house democrats and house leaders may be forced to compromise to avoid a revolt on the issue the utility mandate could force equally difficult political trade offs the measure approved by the house would require electric utilities which rely heavily on coal to generate of their power from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power new hydroelectric facilities would likely count toward that target but not necessarily existing hydroelectric plants people involved with the legislation estimate utilities generate an estimated to of their power from renewable sources but the amount can vary by how "renewable" is defined the department of energy says renewable sources like wind and solar account for the industry contends a federal mandate would be costly to implement and lead to higher bills for consumers while some companies such as florida power &amp light co a unit of fpl group inc supported the house proposal most of the industry led by trade group the edison electric institute strongly opposed it concerns are particularly strong among senate republicans who worry some regions of the country such as the southeast where renewable energy sources arent widely used will have difficulty complying the senate bill didnt include a renewables mandate inclusion of such a proposal in a final compromise package could erode support among the republicans who backed the original senate bill "the underlying energy package would be in jeopardy " warned matt letourneau a spokesman for new mexico sen pete domenici the ranking republican on the senate energy and natural resources committee the house bill includes a &# billion tax measure that rolls back existing preferences for oil and gas producers and boosts incentives for alternative fuels the senate was unable to adopt a similar package amid wide concern among republicans
