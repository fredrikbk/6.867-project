nardelli picked to run chrysler in industry shift cerberus capital management lp is expected today to name former home depot inc chief executive officer robert nardelli to lead its newly acquired chrysler unit sending a blunt message to the detroit establishment no more business as usual mr nardelli who left home depot earlier this year under fire for his pay package and the companys strategic struggles will become chairman and ceo of chrysler making him the second outsider recently named to lead one of detroits struggling big three auto makers he follows former top boeing co executive alan mulally who was recruited last fall to take over ford motor co mr nardellis appointment puts him above chrysler president thomas w lasorda an industry veteran who had been ceo and will remain president the arrival of two ceos who arent part of or beholden to the u s auto industrys culture and traditions is as potent a symbol of the change buffeting the u s auto sector as the news last week that the big threes combined share of the u s market fell below for the first time both will play key roles in what are expected to be tough negotiations over a new national labor agreement with the united auto workers union in which the auto makers want big concessions to narrow a &# an hour labor cost gap with the u s operations of japanese auto power toyota motor corp mr nardelli who before home depot was a senior executive at general electric co comes to detroit fresh from bruising clashes with home depot shareholders and employees over his &# million severance package which many shareholders felt was undeserved in light of the companys performance he had a difficult experience as the public face of home depot most notably at the companys annual meeting which he limited to a half hour by using a clock to limit shareholder comments to one minute mr nardelli also angered employees with the implementation of the six sigma management system which he learned while he was at ge but the move to chrysler puts him in a top position at a private company without pressure from public shareholders that could give mr nardelli freedom to undertake more ambitious restructuring and that in turn could drive rivals ford and general motors corp to rethink the pace and scope of their own overhauls mr nardellis pay will be tied to chryslers performance and based on the equity value of the auto maker people familiar with the matter said further details couldnt be learned these people added that cerberus is not worried about the controversy surrounding mr nardellis departure from home depot because his severance package was based on what was written in his contract and it was not mr nardellis fault for accepting that "i am very excited to be part of a team focused on re establishing chrysler as a standalone industry leader with a renewed focus on meeting the needs of customers " mr nardelli said in a statement "chrysler has many deeply talented and dedicated people and i am confident that together we can continue the momentum of chryslers recovery and return this great american icon to a path for global growth and competitiveness " chrysler already has a restructuring plan in place that calls for the elimination of jobs and a &# billion investment in engine systems designed to improve fuel economy the company also plans to shut down its factory in newark del and will eliminate shifts at other plants until now cerberus had indicated it would keep mr lasorda as ceo mr lasorda in his role as mr nardellis no is expected to continue to be a key player in chryslers relations with the uaw in addition he will become vice chairman of a company made up of cerberus advisers who work on companies the private equity firm has bought "we are very excited to welcome bob to the chrysler family " mr lasorda said in a statement "bob has a proven track record of success " mr lasorda couldnt be reached wolfgang bernhard a former chrysler executive who advised cerberus during its pursuit of the company and was expected to become chrysler chairman will no longer be involved with the company due to family reasons cerberus said in a statement mr bernhard who couldnt be reached will also no longer be an adviser to the firm where he had worked for the past few months as part of its bid for chrysler mr nardelli was also part of the cerberus team studying chrysler in a move that was expected chrysler chief operating officer eric ridenour is leaving the company and the position will not be filled mr ridenour couldnt be reached at ge where he last headed the large power business mr nardelli had been one of the runners up to replace john f welch jr as ceo he was hired at home depot within days of news that the job was going to jeffrey r immelt through cost cuts and aggressive sales and helped by booming demand for power generation mr nardelli drove ges electrical power business to new highs in mr welchs last years during his five years leading ges power systems division it grew to &# billion in revenue from &# billion and its earnings expanded by to he worked closely with ges unions previously he had run mines and locomotive factories home depot a retail business facing tough competition proved to be a difficult adjustment as head of a unit within ge mr nardelli had only limited experience as a public figure and that hurt him when he got to home depot he also didnt have much experience with consumers or the fickle nature of the retail business he lured to the company several of his former ge colleagues who also lacked retail experience mr nardelli instituted a military intern program that put marines at his desk outside his office door company officials have said it came to symbolize mr nardellis ill fated tenure at the company his pugnacious manner helped to drive off many talented and long tenured executives while many employees at its stores felt demoralized mr nardelli inherited an almost year old company with flagging sales and stock performance it had run out of room in the u s to expand at the feverish pace it once kept it also lacked automated purchasing systems that would have made it a more nimble and efficient operator mr nardelli started upgrading systems cutting back workers to save money and instituting six sigma processes for evaluating store operations managers complained that it was too time consuming that they didnt have time to supervise staff and help take care of customers to ignite growth mr nardelli shifted his attention to the wholesale supply business pouring more than &# billion into acquiring more than two dozen companies that catered to large municipal contractors among others net income and per share earnings rose but home depots share price fell during mr nardellis tenure while competitor lowes cos s stock more than doubled during the same period mr nardelli began to draw shareholders ire his compensation in his six years at the helm prior to his massive severance payment exceeded &# million excluding certain equity awards as well some investors questioned his decision to expand into the low margin wholesale supply business mr nardellis experience at ge is one of the main reasons why cerberus wanted him many of cerberus advisers and executives are made up of former ge employees cerberus is also a big believer in the six sigma system and other lean management strategies according to people familiar with the matter six sigma is a complex discipline that combines aspects of statistical quality control and operational efficiency analysis to attack waste the name is a reference to the goal of driving defects or problems in a process down to per million six sigma programs have been implemented at various auto manufacturers and suppliers including ford motor co with mixed results chrysler has already implemented aspects of lean manufacturing such as its flexible production system in which a few of its factories are able to produce three different models in one plant mr nardellis lack of experience with the complexities of auto industry product development vehicle design and marketing could be a challenge and could send cerberus on the hunt for executives who are familiar with these issues so far cerberus and its media shy founder stephen feinberg have given few details about their plans for the auto maker in which they bought an stake from daimlerchrysler ag in exchange for investing &# billion in chrysler and &# billion in its financing unit but the experiences of other cerberus acquisitions in the auto industry make it clear that the investment firm sets high performance goals and wants results fast and cerberus has been quick to make management changes at other acquisitions cerberuss toughness was illustrated after it took over ganton technologies inc a die casting company in a year later it fired ceo ram thukkaram who had been gantons sole owner cerberus said mr thukkaram didnt hit his performance targets which he readily acknowledged and didnt disagree with in a recent interview a year after cerberus acquired guilford mills inc a maker of textiles in it replaced chief executive john emrich mainly because the company missed its profit targets also in cerberus bought gdx automotive a farmington hill mich maker of automotive plastics since then the company has continued to struggle and cerberus has changed management at least three times cerberus has indicated what it chiefly wants from a chrysler leader is a new approach given that the old approach at chrysler led to more than &# billion in losses last year cerberus chairman john snow said in a recent interview that one of the private equity firms assets is that it brings a "fresh eye" to problems facing a company "we bring an intensity to a business and a new way of looking at issues " mr snow said kris hudson and stephen power contributed to this article
