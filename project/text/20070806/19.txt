according to saeed mortazavi the chief islamic prosecutor at least more people including five women are scheduled to be hanged or stoned to death in the coming weeks the latest wave of executions is the biggest iran has suffered in the same time span since when thousands of opposition prisoners were shot on orders from ayatollah khomeini not all executions take place in public in the provinces of kurdistan and khuzestan where ethnic kurdish and arab minorities are demanding greater rights several activists have been put to death in secret their families informed only days after the event the campaign of terror also includes targeted "disappearances" designed to neutralize trade union leaders student activists journalists and even mullahs opposed to the regime according to the latest tally more than people have "disappeared" since the start of the new iranian year on march to intimidate the population the authorities also have carried out mass arrests on spurious grounds according to gen ismail muqaddam commander of the islamic police a total of men and women have been arrested on charges related to drug use since april a further men and women mostly aged between and have been arrested for "hooliganism" in tehran alone the largest number of arrests totaling almost a million men and women according to mr muqaddam were related to the enforcement of the new islamic dress code passed by the islamic majlis parliament in may most of those arrested he says spent a few hours or at most a few days in custody as "a warning " by last week were still in prison of these men and women are held on charges related to violating the islamic dress code according to the deputy chief of police gen hussein zulfiqari an additional men and women are in prison on charges of "sexual proximity" without being married the wave of arrests has increased pressure on the nations inadequate prison facilities at a recent press conference in tehran the head of the national prisons service ali akbar yassaqi appealed for a moratorium on arrests he said irans official prisons could not house more than prisoners simultaneously while the actual number of prisoners at any given time was above mr yassaqi also revealed that each year on average some iranians spend some time in one of the official prisons since mr ahmadinejad ordered the crackdown work on converting official buildings to prisons has started with contracts for other prisons already signed nevertheless mr yassaqi believes that with the annual prison population likely to top the million mark this year even the new capacities created might prove insufficient there are however an unknown number of unofficial prisons as well often controlled by the islamic revolutionary guard corps or militias working for various powerful mullahs last week human rights activists in iran published details of a new prison in souleh northwest of tehran staffed by militants from the lebanese branch of hezbollah according to the revelations the souleh prison is under the control of the "supreme guide" ali khamenehi and used for holding the regimes most "dangerous" political foes the regime especially fears the growing free trade union movement in the past four months free trade unionists have organized major strikes and demonstrations in various parts of the country they showed their muscle on international labor day on may when tens of thousands of workers marched in tehran and provincial capitals the regime retaliated by arresting scores of trade unionists and expelling many others according to rajab ali shahsavari leader of the union of contractual workers unionists have been fired since april he estimates that now over workers are losing their jobs each day as the regime intensifies its crackdown worse still the number of suspicious deaths among workers has risen to an all time high according to deputy labor minister ibrahim nazari jalali workers have died in "work related accidents" since april labor sources however point out that none of the accidents have been investigated and in at least cases the workers who died may have been killed by goons hired by the regime the biggest purge of universities since khomeini launched his "islamic cultural revolution" in is also under way scores of student leaders have been arrested and more than others expelled labeling the crackdown the "corrective movement " mr ahmadinejad wants university textbooks rewritten to "cleanse them of infidel trash " and to include "a rebuttal of zionist crusader claims" about the holocaust dozens of lecturers and faculty deans have been fired the nationwide crackdown is accompanied with efforts to cut iranians off from sources of information outside the islamic republic more than internet sites have been blocked and more are added each day the ministry of islamic orientation has established a new blacklist of authors and book titles twice longer than what it was a year ago since april some newspapers and magazines have been shut and their offices raided at least journalists are in prison two already sentenced to death by hanging the regime is trying to mobilize its shrinking base by claiming that the islamic republic is under threat from internal and external foes it was in that context that the four iranian american hostages held in tehran were forced to make televised "confessions" last month about alleged plots to foment a "velvet revolution " over people have been arrested on charges of espionage since april in the southern city of shiraz khomeinist paranoia reached a new peak last week when the authorities announced through the islamic republic news agency the capture of four squirrels in the western city of kermanshah and claimed that the furry creatures had been fitted with "espionage devices" by the americans in iraq and smuggled into the islamic republic mr ahmadinejad likes to pretend that he has no worries except "infidel plots" related to the islamic republics nuclear ambitions the truth is that faced with growing popular discontent the khomeinist clique is vulnerable and worried extremely worried the outside world would do well to carefully monitor and whenever possible support the iranian peoples fight against the fascist regime in tehran iran today is not only about atomic bombs and iranian american hostages it is also about a growing popular movement that may help bring the nation out of the dangerous impasse created by the mullahs mr taheri is author of "lirak le dessous des cartes" editions complexe see related letter
