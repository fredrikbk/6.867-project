insuring chinas future the senate banking committee just approved a tighter definition of currency "manipulation" and the finance committee recently increased the penalties for alleged currency manipulators while both committees are trying to reduce the large u s trade deficit with china it would be more fruitful to examine the reluctance of chinese consumers to buy imported goods and services they understandably have deep concerns about their countrys weak social safety net and without adequate retirement security or catastrophic medical insurance rational chinese consumers will continue to be aggressive savers and reluctant spenders in response the national peoples congress is about to consider a major overhaul of chinas social insurance laws this presents a unique opportunity to put chinas social security system on sound financial footing but the npc will have to overcome two formidable barriers the financial drag of legacy pensions from the pre economy and the local administration of a pension system for an increasingly national workforce in the communist era of the "iron rice bowl " state owned enterprises regularly promised pensions to workers who made no pension contributions in as china moved toward a market oriented economy it adopted a two tiered payroll tax to finance social security primarily in urban areas employers now should contribute of wages to support a defined retirement benefit employees also are now required to contribute of a workers wages to a personal account with a variable retirement benefit based on investment returns the responsibility for paying social security benefits rests with local governments provinces cities or townships which also collect the payroll taxes unfortunately these local governments are using much of the employers payroll taxes to pay pre legacy pensions to workers who never made any contributions many local governments have even paid legacy benefits with some or all of the in payroll taxes contributed by workers which are supposed to be invested in personal accounts despite recent pilot programs by the national government in several provinces a substantial portion of these personal accounts are not funded with actual investments they are "notional" accounts with only paper credits if these personal accounts remain "empty" until participating workers reach retirement the result will be a new set of large unfunded liabilities for local governments the solution is to pre fund retirement benefits by holding the contributions in separate trusts and investing them this would avoid the huge unfunded liabilities of pay as you go social security systems like those in the u s and europe where the number of active workers supporting each retiree is declining china will face a particularly steep decline because the government is holding down population growth through its one child per family policy researchers yaohui zhao of peking university and jianguo xu of duke university have estimated that china could reduce the employer portion of its payroll tax to below if it pre funded the social security system such a reduction would broaden the participation of chinese employers in the system right now faced with a payroll tax on top of other employment based taxes which together exceed of payroll only half of chinas urban employers make social security contributions the system is virtually non existent in rural china the present system which uses current payroll taxes to pay legacy pension benefits also undermines chinas heightened efforts to crack down on corruption if local officials do not have to deposit all taxes in a separate trust some will be tempted to divert the money for personal gain chinese prosecutors recently brought criminal actions against two senior officials in shanghai for allegedly diverting pension funds to corrupt entrepreneurs to facilitate pre funding the npc should shift the responsibility for paying legacy pensions to the national government to finance legacy pensions the national government could allocate a modest portion of its &# trillion in reserves to the national social security fund this fund already invests the proceeds from certain privatizations of state owned enterprises to help local governments defray their pension obligations in return the npc should insist that social security become a national system provincial officials are pushing hard to become the consolidators of social security for local governments because of the significant economic and demographic differences among regions however provincial officials in china are not well positioned to invest payroll taxes in diversified portfolios more fundamentally as workers move in response to changing employment demands in different regions they need benefits that are easily portable and financially secure with social insurance legislation on the table now is the time for the npc to negotiate the grand bargain relieving local governments of legacy pension obligations if they cede social security to the national government and persuading the national government to invest all payroll taxes in trusts or other accounts dedicated to pre funding the social security system mr pozen is chairman of mfs investment management
