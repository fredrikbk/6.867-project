these little pigs get special care from norwegians but meat people squeal and a lot of other folks are holding their noses oslo farmers have been castrating piglets for thousands of years which is good for the people who eat them but not so good for the piglets "sometimes they get depressed " says bente fredriksen co coordinator of a &# million norwegian research project looking into alternatives to castration studies by europes food safety agency found castrated piglets suckle less and spend more time apart from their siblings responding to such concerns and to animal welfare groups claims that the process causes piglets unnecessary pain norways parliament banned the castration of piglets starting in but thats causing a new constituency to squeal to many people the meat of uncastrated male pigs has an objectional taste known in the pig trade as "boar taint " and the ban could cost norways pig farmers millions of dollars as they trash tons of boar meat many consumers wont touch according to animalia a norwegian meat industry research group the standoff has pushed this scandinavian country to the forefront of a europe wide debate over piglet castration in holland where the party for the animals won two parliamentary seats in major supermarkets in june said that in theyll stop selling meat from piglets castrated without anesthesia swiss lawmakers also recently made anesthesia mandatory beginning in british pig farmers have avoided castrating pigs for decades voluntarily in part because uncastrated males produce leaner meat they say they slaughter pigs before theyre old enough to develop the taint u s pork farmers are watching warily animal rights victories in europe "tend to heighten the debate here " says dave warner of the national pork producers council in washington americas pork producers castrate about million mostly unanesthetized piglets a year researchers at the european food safety authority say archaeological evidence shows farmers were castrating pigs as early as bc that may have been in part to make pigs more docile "entire males fight a lot and theyre constantly mounting each other " says ms fredriksen of the norwegian entire male research program as adults whole males and females cant be kept in the same pens but boar taint is the biggest problem not all pig breeds carry it to the same degree but scientists say up to three quarters of people may be able to smell and taste it the taint comes mainly from two compounds that mix in a male piglets body androstenone a steroid responsible for boar taints tang of sweat and urine builds up in porcine testicles once pigs hit puberty boar taints other main ingredient is skatole which accumulates in male pigs digestive systems together androstenone and skatole create a compound that leaves many people speechless "it tastes like pig like a lot of pig " says eli grindflek a geneticist with the norwegian pig breeders association norsvin noting that the volatile brew reacts to heat cold cuts are less likely to reek still she says "once youve had it youll swear never to serve pork again " thats what worries norways pig farmers harald bohnsdalen years old is a fourth generation pig farmer in leirsund about miles northeast of oslo he used to castrate up to piglets a year on his own but since abiding by norwegian law he has brought in veterinarians to do the cutting and to administer local anesthesia beforehand the process costs farmers about &# per piglet one recent monday morning mr bohnsdalen held a wriggling eight day old piglet upside down wearing heavy sound mufflers over his ears veterinarian hallgeir flo injected an anesthetic and waited a few minutes for it to take then he extracted two little orbs the cuts took about seconds "we dont do it for fun " says mr bohnsdalen a six time norwegian plowing champion "castration costs money and its bad for the pigs " hes resigned to the anesthesia law but thinks the upcoming ban on castration is premature since the european union has officially recognized animals as sentient beings able to feel pain and emotion norway isnt part of the eu but it boasts an even more expansive animal rights code norwegian pigpens for example must have largely solid floors strewn with something soft like straw or wood chips so pigs can lie down comfortably in the u s pigpen floors are mostly hard and grated "its important to me how the pigs are doing " said year old elin braaten after shopping at a downtown oslo supermarket she said she hadnt heard about the coming ban on piglet castration but she likes the sound of it if she ends up with any foul tasting pork she says "ill just start buying more lamb " norway has mounted a full on assault on boar taint in advance of the ban geneticists are studying gene patterns to breed a taint free boar norwegians are also working in cooperation with british and danish researchers to separate the x and y chromosomes in pigs semen that practice already common in cattle breeding would make it possible to breed fewer male pigs still few here believe a boar taint fix will be ready in time for norways ministry of agriculture and food has told the parliament that the problem is unlikely to be solved in time prompting a review by parliament in october "its too much for a small country like norway to solve " says guri tveito director general of the ministrys department of food policy "we need international research on a broad level " norwegian animal welfare groups pushing to keep the castration ban in place say farmers should consider options including "immuno castration " by vaccine since u s pharmaceutical giant pfizer inc has marketed improvac a vaccine that suppresses piglet puberty as a way to sidestep the castration debate while eliminating boar taint farmers in australia brazil mexico and some other countries already vaccinate switzerland approved improvac in january pfizer is applying for entry to the u s and eu markets at up to &# a pig improvac is more expensive than both physical castration and norways anesthesia mandate but farmers say they save on feed costs and produce leaner pork because the vaccine induced castration lasts only for the few weeks before a pig is slaughtered still norwegian researchers and pig farmers arent convinced "it doesnt fit into our concept" of a wholesome clean pig says kristin ianssen chairman of the norsvin board norwegian food scientist kathrine lunde wrote her masters thesis on preparing the meat of uncastrated male pigs she found that the nasty flavor was best disguised by marinades that combined oregano and smoke flavors the year old ms lundes culinary advice may come in handy for norways cooks if the ban actually goes into effect see related letters "letters to the
