investing in funds a monthly analysis the all etf portfolio pros reveal the ins and outs the trophy sitting atop the fireplace mantel in ted feights office is a constant reminder of the weekend his money management business changed for good it was a friday afternoon in september and mr feight was looking for a discreet way to exit a gathering of financial planners at shanty creek a resort area in northern michigan he was due to participate in a weight lifting competition seven hours south in cleveland before leaving though he took in one last presentation on exchange traded funds and became intrigued he made a note to follow up and dashed out the next morning the then year old bench pressed pounds to win the pound category for his age group while etfs which resemble index tracking mutual funds but trade on exchanges throughout the day like stocks werent doing any heavy lifting in the investment world at the time financial advisers like mr feight were growing more receptive to new ideas in with a bear market grinding into its third year mr feight moved most of his clients money out of mutual funds and into cash and took a closer look at the products that had piqued his interest a year earlier in early he put the cash back into the stock market via etfs today of the &# million or so he manages is in these products in an increasingly sophisticated lineup that encompasses every investing size and style "that one presentation became the basis for my current investing philosophy " says mr feight who runs creative financial design in lansing mich welcome to the era of the all etf portfolio championed by legions of advisers like mr feight the proliferation of etfs there are now more than has made it possible to create a well diversified portfolio entirely out of these products say financial professionals such as michael jones chief investment officer at wachovia corp s wachovia securities unit "we hadnt reached critical mass five years ago " he says while etfs exploding popularity with do it yourself investors has been publicized over the past year less highlighted has been their popularity among financial planners with concern growing in some quarters that inexperienced investors can get burned investing in niche etfs we polled prominent advisers across the country about their etf portfolios what we got in return was a wide array of models from blended strategies that still use some traditional mutual funds to portfolios that take on more risk by using country specific etfs or sector funds but first what is it about these investment vehicles that financial advisers find so appealing etfs arent immune to the whims of the stock market but financial advisers say the products can help stem bleeding during down times and juice returns during market rebounds in addition to having low costs and tax advantages etfs are based on published indexes available in real time while mutual funds are required to disclose their holdings only four times a year advisers know exactly what they are getting with etfs so they can use them to precisely flesh out clients asset allocation plans and with so many narrow etfs now available they can plug small holes as needed instead of picking a few stocks here and there in addition etfs help advisers get in and out of aggressive positions etfs have no investment minimums and no penalties for brief holding periods aside from brokers fees advisers can place stop loss orders instructing a broker to sell when an etf reaches a certain price and they can make bearish bets selling borrowed etf shares in the hopes of replacing them later with shares purchased at a lower price not every etf investor should follow the leads of the experts we polled especially if they are saving through k retirement plans to build
