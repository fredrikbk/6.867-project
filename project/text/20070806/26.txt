housing market to weaken even further as mortgage industry takes cure after a binge of lax lending in recent years the u s home mortgage industry is finally taking the cure swearing off high risk loans to people with lousy credit records the bad news is that this medicine is creating a vicious circle that will make the housing market even weaker at least in the near term as regulators and jittery investors force them to adopt more and more conservative lending standards lenders are cutting more people out of the housing market in what would strike most people outside the industry as a

turning down refinancing requests from many people trapped by adjustable rate loans that are proving too expensive after the initial feel good period of low payments "this week is going to be a nightmare " says melissa cohn chief executive of manhattan mortgage in new york lenders are scaling back so fast that it isnt clear which loans are available or on what terms and rates are jumping even on large loans known as jumbos for prime borrowers these stricter lending standards reduce demand for homes and nudge some people who cant refinance toward foreclosure higher foreclosures add to a glut of homes on the market in most of the country and completing the vicious circle a weaker housing market comes back to bite the lenders by wiping out owners equity in their homes and increasing the risk of even more foreclosures down the road "the market is in a panic " says larry goldstone president of thornburg mortgage inc a lender in santa fe n m he says he thinks the mortgage bond

goldman sachs meanwhile many of the people who would still qualify for a loan dont want to buy a house now because they think prices will fall further so the housing market is likely to remain weak
