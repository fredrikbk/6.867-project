losing hand how bear stearns mess cost executive his job ceo faults spector for mortgage fiasco bonding over bridge on wednesday james cayne the year old chief executive of bear stearns cos summoned his top lieutenant to his smoky dimly lit office in midtown manhattan the big securities firm mr cayne had led as ceo for years was under attack two of its mortgage related hedge funds had blown up costing investors more than &# billion and its stock was under siege down this year alone the way mr cayne saw it warren spector bear stearnss co president and the person most often cited as his likely successor deserved some of the blame he told mr spector he had lost confidence in him "i think its in the best interests of the firm for you to resign " mr cayne told mr spector people familiar with the conversation say mr spector was taken aback and responded that hed been working hard to address the firms problems according to one of these people that conversation ended the close partnership between the two wall street veterans a connection forged years earlier by a common love of bridge but one that had become strained mr spector a year old former mortgage securities trader has become wall streets highest profile casualty in the burgeoning subprime lending fiasco what had started as a narrow problem in a small corner of the u s housing market lending to risky borrowers has become a big problem for wall street the trouble at bear stearns has spooked investors bear stearns has long been known as one of the most astute risk managers on wall street its problems come despite repeated assurances from wall street bankers that they have a handle on the booming market for mortgage securities bear stearns which has a huge mortgage business but a less diverse mix of other business than its investment banking peers has been the hardest hit its stock has fallen since the beginning of june and on friday alone a friday afternoon conference call intended to quell investors fears about bear stearnss profitability attracted listeners mr spectors ouster may not allay those concerns it leaves the company without a clear succession plan and without the services of a mortgage and trading expert while mr cayne is deeply involved in running bear stearns he had left much of its day to day operation to a pair of lieutenants investment banker and co president alan schwartz and until last week mr spector mr cayne had been comfortable enough with their stewardship that he didnt come into the office most fridays in the summer preferring to stay at his home in new jersey bear stearnss member board met yesterday afternoon to formalize mr spectors departure for now the firm will have a single president mr schwartz a seasoned rainmaker who has advised on big mergers but doesnt have the trading experience of messrs spector or cayne jeffrey mayer co head of global fixed income at bear stearns will replace mr spector on the executive committee "there is a depth of talent in our senior management team " mr cayne said yesterday in a prepared statement bear stearns has told investors that its "solidly profitable" and that it made money during the market gyrations of both june and july the firm said that in recent months it has moved to secure more stable financing by replacing some of its commercial paper holdings with longer term loans "they have weathered a lot of storms before but this is a tough hole to dig out of " said glenn schorr an analyst at ubs ag "they have funding to carry them for a while " nevertheless wall street has been buzzing with speculation that the firm will need to seek a strategic investor in investor warren buffett bought a large stake in salomon brothers inc as it struggled to fend off unwanted offers and he later served as interim chairman to restore confidence during a crisis last year bear stearns held talks with china construction bank corp about taking a minority stake which would have given bear stearns a larger capital base and a foothold in china but the talks fizzled after the then president of ccb chang zhenming left the bank bear stearnss los angeles based vice chairman donald tang has continued to pursue the idea with other entities such as china citic group according to people familiar with the matter a person close to bear says the firm is only interested in a joint venture partner but following the chinese governments &# billion investment in private equity firm blackstone group other wall street firms have been seeking similar ties which gives chinese entities more attractive alternatives than bear stearns bear stearnss troubles started in the housing market where it had developed a lucrative business originating mortgages and packaging them into securities that were sold to investors and traded in home prices were beginning to taper but "subprime" borrowers with sketchy credit continued to get mortgages by the second half of that year however late payments and defaults were rising shaking the subprime market and the picture worsened after the new year home prices also were starting to slip raising fears of a housing bust at monday meetings of bear stearnss executive committee the housing market became a frequent point of discussion the committee didnt foresee trouble at two internal hedge funds run by ralph cioffi a former mortgage bond salesman who had been with bear stearns since and was a close colleague of mr spectors in mr cioffi had approached his superiors about using the firms own capital to buy and sell securities in a portion of the fixed income market that included collateralized debt obligations or cdos some cdos are based on pools of mortgage loans he was successful enough that at the end of that year bear stearnss hedge fund committee allowed him to open his own fund as part of the firms asset management unit his fund called the high grade structured credit strategies fund raised about &# million from investors and invested in cdos for several years it notched positive monthly returns last year he launched a second fund with roughly &# million in investor capital he loaded it with debt to magnify returns this spring as the housing market weakened further and subprime defaults mounted results began to slip bear stearns officials didnt worry much at first mr cioffis investments were considered by rating agencies to be high grade investment vehicles and their valuations had remained largely intact but in may brokerage firms that had sold cdos to mr cioffi began slashing the prices or "marks " they had previously put on those securities leaving the two hedge funds with double digit paper losses in early june some investors in the more leveraged fund asked for their money back because their requests added up to about &# million more cash than mr cioffi had on hand redemptions were frozen bear stearnss stock began dropping in value and the executive committee started meeting nearly every day to discuss what to do to the committee it looked as though the enhanced leverage fund had little chance of surviving but that the first fund might be salvaged by mid june the enhanced leverage fund had missed margin calls requests for additional cash and collateral from lenders including merrill lynch &amp co and j p morgan chase &amp co the lenders wanted to be made whole some wall street executives were pressuring bear stearns to stop the bleeding initially the firms executive committee balked bear stearns executives felt they shouldnt feel obligated to lend money to a fund whose operations were separate from bear stearnss and whose investors were knowledgeable about the risks on the afternoon of june j p morgans investment banking co chief steven black and his top risk officer had a tense phone call with mr spector in which the lender urged bear stearns to give the fund some emergency credit participants in the call say calling the j p morgan executives "naive " mr spector said bear stearns was the resident expert in the mortgage business recalls one participant and that the lenders should back off early that evening j p morgan sent an in house lawyer to bear stearnss headquarters with an official default notice but a bear stearns receptionist told the lawyer that the firm was closed for business and that the documents couldnt be accepted people familiar with the matter say the blow to bear stearnss reputation however caused the firm to reverse course late the following week after hearing a presentation from bear stearnss in house mortgage team suggesting that the older fund might still contain value the firms executive committee authorized a secured loan to the less leveraged fund of up to &# billion the fund ended up borrowing &# billion which it didnt repay entirely leaving bear stearnss loan officers to seize the collateral remaining in mr cioffis fund bear stearns could lose much of the &# billion the fund still owes it public filings indicate because the asset management division reported to him mr spector was under fire as well he replaced the chief of that division with jeffrey lane a money management veteran who had once run neuberger berman llc working long days and nights and seeing little of his wife mr spector told friends he was chagrined about the crisis and that he understood that the stakes were high nevertheless mr spector had agreed months earlier to play with partners in a national bridge tournament in nashville tenn so he flew there in mid july to compete with bear stearnss shares reeling and concerns about the firms management mounting he spent about a week at the tournament rising early to work the phones in his hotel room and jumping into the game in midafternoon along with his partners mr spector won the tournament still mr cayne who also played in the nashville competition was steamed that his lieutenant had been away from the office according to people familiar with his thinking years earlier it was mr spectors bridge playing skills that had helped bring him to the attention of mr cayne a former scrap iron salesman who had made his name as a stockbroker mr spector who grew up outside washington had won the title "king of bridge" in a national youth contest after graduating from bethesda chevy chase high school in he attended princeton then switched to st johns college a small school in annapolis md during his junior year mr spector wrote to alan "ace" greenberg then managing partner of bear stearns to ask for a summer job he got an offer but turned it down because he couldnt afford to live in new york on &# a week several years later after graduating from business school he contacted mr greenberg again this time he accepted a job offer he started on the firms government bond desk where he helped establish the metrics and systems bear stearns uses today to research and trade mortgage backed securities by two years after bear stearns went public mr spector was one of the best paid people at the firm around that time mr cayne who had not yet become ceo was reviewing some compensation figures and mr spectors name rang a bell he picked up the phone and dialed mr spector "are you the warren spector that was the king of bridge " he asked mr spector said he was and mr cayne invited him for a chat in mr spector became a bear stearns director and a few years later he was named one of two people to run fixed income in mr spectors partner in overseeing the group john c sites jr left amid speculation that mr spector had pushed him out mr sites did not return calls for comment mr spector who wears black rimmed glasses and maintains a trim physique kept a relatively low profile on wall street he and his wife margaret whitton a former actress who had a supporting role in the movie "nine weeks" and played the vixenish wife of a ceo in the s wall street parody "the secret of my success " have raised money for various charities including for a hospital on marthas vineyard where they own a beachfront home in recent years mr spector and mr cayne butted heads over several issues they didnt see eye to eye on mr spectors wish to trade derivatives securities whose values are tied to stocks and other products on behalf of bear stearns customers they disagreed about whether bear stearns should have a gym in its madison avenue building mr cayne eventually agreed to add one in mr cayne publicly rebuked mr spector for speaking on behalf of democratic presidential candidate john kerry to whom mr spector had donated money mr cayne discourages bear stearns employees from making public statements about politics "if any of you were upset or offended by these press reports please accept both his and my apologies " mr cayne wrote in a memo to employees that chided his deputy around that time there was also tension over mr spectors pay due to his practice of deferring his annual compensation for a period of years people familiar with the matter say the firm allowed such deferrals but mr spectors total deferrals were becoming expensive for the firm mr cayne and some other executives felt last year mr cayne made &# million and mr spector took home &# million according to regulatory filings henny sender and robin sidel contributed to this article
