insuring against credit risk can carry risks of its own during the s international banks lent dollars to indonesian companies to hedge against the possibility that the borrowers could go belly up the international banks bought credit insurance unfortunately the insurance was purchased from indonesian banks so when the asian financial crisis hit and the rupiah went into free fall the ability of local banks to compensate the international banks for their losses on those loans plummeted as well as u s banks grapple now with turmoil in the credit markets there are some interesting parallels to the indonesian crisis a decade ago banks insurers and others routinely assure investors that they are hedged against adverse moves in markets by purchasing different types of insurance in the form of derivative contracts as a result the market for these contracts has soared in one of the most comprehensive surveys of the market the british bankers association estimated last fall that by the end of the market for all credit derivatives was &# trillion and was expected to be &# trillion by the end of the problem the sellers of this protection are often hedge funds indeed deutsche bank estimates that hedge funds account for as much as of such credit protection with insurers providing much of the rest some hedge funds are thriving in the market turmoil but many others are under significant pressure as a result of sudden losses in the debt markets if many buyers of such credit insurance which include banks traditional money managers and hedge funds decide they want to take profits as companies are downgraded and come under pressure it could be problematic that is because hedge funds that are losing money but also selling credit insurance may not be able to honor their commitments rendering the protection worthless it is like counting on a homeowners insurance policy to pay for a new house after a fire only to discover the company that sold the policy is so financially fragile it might not be able to pay the benefits the boom in credit insurance often in the form of credit default swaps facilitated much of the frenzied buying of bonds and loans in recent months just as the presence of ropes and guides is leading more climbers to the peak of mount everest out of a sense of security that may not be justified many players enthusiastically jumped into the mortgage market and the corporate debt market comfortable in their purchase of insurance against losses in other words lenders and bondholders were willing to make ever riskier loans because these new financial instruments made it possible to lay off the risk of default on others the extent to which wall street relies on such hedges was apparent friday during the conference call bear stearns cos held with investors to allay fears that it was in financial trouble following the collapse of two of its hedge funds bear executives repeatedly referred to their dependence on hedges including credit derivatives to offset their losses on subprime mortgages and loans to poorly rated companies stating that such hedges offset losses feeding worries about problems in the credit derivatives market is the lack of transparency and precise data fearing that even the paperwork backing trades was a mess the federal reserve bank of new york used moral suasion on the financial community in to deal with technical issues of clearing and settlement despite progress on eliminating backlogs in processing trades in the credit derivatives market the market remains opaque it isnt just that entities that sold insurance might not be able or willing to pay off contracts it is also unclear who is holding the risk because it is sold from one party to the other "if you dont know how the risk is spread it is impossible to say how dangerous the likelihood of a systemic daisy chain is " says one fed official that puts the investment banks that are on the other side of hedge funds in a delicate position the prudent thing for any single bank to do when times are tough is to demand more collateral and margin from hedge fund clients but as the banks force hedge funds to put up more of their own capital they could trigger additional losses adding more volatility to financial markets for the worst case to materialize a hedge fund would have to lose all its capital but that isnt so hard to imagine consider the case of sowood capital management in a conference call with investors friday jeffrey larson sowoods managing partner explained his decision to sell his portfolio to citadel investment group at the end of july after huge losses "we were very concerned about our ability to continue to meet margin calls for very long particularly since our losses in july were triggering events that could have required us to post hundreds of millions of dollars in additional margin on our original positions " he said if a hedge fund with losses of that magnitude was also selling credit insurance the situation could become ugly hedge fund losses in the junk bond market can have an impact on a seemingly unrelated market as the funds are forced to sell what they can a phenomenon known as correlation similarly one kind of risk can quickly translate into another kind of risk in this case the risk of losses in the market can quickly lead to counterparty risk or the risk that the party on the other side of a given trade may not be able to perform wall street doesnt always learn from its mistakes a year after losses in indonesia many international banks bought russian government bonds hedging their positions with credit derivatives sadly they bought that credit insurance from russian banks when the government defaulted on those bonds the russian banks which held even more of those bonds than the international banks were unable to honor their commitments
