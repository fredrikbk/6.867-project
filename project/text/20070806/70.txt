surveillance law limits protection for phone carriers a new law expanding the governments ability to conduct wiretaps without a court order fails to resolve liability concerns faced by phone companies that cooperate ensuring prolonged controversy and perhaps continuing problems in carrying out the surveillance program the law an update of the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fisa spells out and broadens the governments ability to tap into communications including email of suspected terrorists it was passed over the weekend only grudgingly by the democratic controlled congress and signed by the president yesterday but the measure lacks a provision sought by the white house and telecommunications companies protection from lawsuits filed against phone companies by privacy groups and customers for past cooperation with government spy programs under the expansion of surveillance authority since sept some major phone companies have complained that their cooperation has left them vulnerable to legal liabilities at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc have been sued by civil liberties groups and state utility regulators some phone companies have curtailed their cooperation with intelligence programs in recent months according to people familiar with the matter the new law instead provides a more limited element of legal cover by compelling phone companies to cooperate congress decided to write the law so that it will be in effect for only six months ensuring that congress and the white house will continue debating specifics of the program into the fall that sets the stage for further confrontation just as an already fevered presidential election will be heating up the bush administration says the eavesdropping program is essential to fighting terrorism for opponents of the administration opposition to spying programs has become a rallying cry for decades in criminal probes phone companies under court orders allowed investigators to place wiretapping equipment in their systems or turned over information after the attacks president bush ordered a raft of new surveillance programs most of which are still not known publicly after the new york times and usa today disclosed the existence of wiretapping and data mining programs in and last year mr bush publicly acknowledged a portion of its surveillance which the administration has come to call the terrorist surveillance program that program allowed the national security agency to intercept certain communications believed to involve terrorist suspects without first seeking approval of the secret fisa court set up to oversee such government activities telecom companies have largely remained silent about their cooperation with the governments post programs congress has tried to probe the role of the telecom providers but the companies have been reluctant to offer public testimony for fear of violating an aspect of the patriot act that restricts them from acknowledging their participation in surveillance efforts a senior congressional aide said in a statement provided by his lawyer last year former qwest communications international inc chief executive joseph nacchio said he rejected a request from the nsa for access to the private telephone records of qwest customers mr nacchio was recently convicted of insider trading during his qwest tenure and sentenced to six years in prison a person familiar with the matter said verizon has felt a "heightened sensitivity" about its potential liability for fulfilling government surveillance requests compared with a few years ago verizon the nations second largest phone company in terms of sales behind at&amp t has stood on the sidelines during the fisa debate on capitol hill leaving the white house to lead the charge the cause and extent of the change in phone company cooperation isnt entirely clear in part because the programs are shrouded in secrecy a court decision earlier this year cast doubt on some aspects of the programs also the justice departments inspector general recently criticized other phone company actions relating to the collection of information both events might have added to the phone companies unease spokesmen for verizon and at&amp t declined to comment a qwest spokesman couldnt be reached for comment partly to tackle the companies concerns the new law includes language that compels telecommunications providers to cooperate with government intelligence surveillance orders the compulsion order is critical because it provides phone companies with a ready made justification if sued the law also explicitly gives telecom companies protection for future cooperation with government surveillance programs however absent from the law is a blanket liability protection to absolve companies for any privacy violations that may have occurred during their cooperation with earlier surveillance activities the white house pushed for such a measure and has promised to try to have it included when a long term update to fisa is considered probably later this year the interim fixes approved by congress also clarify some of the gray areas in which the administration has been operating it allows terror investigators to perform surveillance without a warrant aimed at foreigners located overseas regardless of where the calls are headed or how they are routed under the previous law the minute a call touched u s soil it became subject to stricter rules the bush administration argued congress needed to fix a law that was written long before the advent of cellphones and the internet in some cases conversations between two people overseas can be connected through networks in the u s the administration put heavy pressure on democrats to approve the fisa changes before congress set off for its monthlong summer vacation many democrats were resentful of the pressure and the last minute nature of the changes the bills were approved by the senate late friday night and by the house late saturday night but were fearful of going on vacation and facing blame in the event of a terror attack caroline fredrickson legislative director for the american civil liberties union in washington criticized democrats for "being bullied" by the administration to approve expanded government spying powers without adding the privacy protections to shield americans ms fredrickson said the aclu will continue to fight against blanket liability protection for phone companies but added "after this performance by democrats im not surprised if they get it congress has to look harder at what this really means for american consumers " signing the bill into law sunday president bush argued for further protection for phone companies "when congress returns in september we need to work together on additional reforms including the important issue of providing meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our nation following the attacks of september " he said in a statement
