politics &amp economics republicans test war tolerance president bushs stock remains much higher among republican white house hopefuls than it does among most americans raising the question is it possible to marshal the support of the current president and his many financial backers without turning off the base of independent voters who are likely to determine the next president unswerving advocacy for the iraq war overshadowed the issues of abortion and taxes in yesterdays televised debate in ames iowa as the major candidates struggled to ensure there was little daylight between themselves and the bush administration on the narrow issue of iraq and the broader issue of national security conventional wisdom holds that a majority of americans trust republicans more than they do democrats on that issue but a recent erosion of this assumption as evidenced by national polls sets up potential peril down the road the debate showed that it isnt only former front runner john mccain who faces potential blowback for his support for mr bush the arizona senator who began the campaign seen as the favorite but has fallen far back in recent voter polls has been forced to sharply cut back on campaign spending as his fund raising effort sputtered mccain aides say some of his troubles stem from his strident support of the iraq war and mr bushs military "surge" a strategy that is losing credibility among likely republican voters and turning off independent voters who are likely to decide any close presidential contest a recent wall street journal nbc news survey of voters nationally says mr bushs performance on iraq is supported by about half of republicans by contrast a full of self identified independent voters say mr bushs handling of the war effort is on the wrong track overall mr bushs support stands at among all voters among independents and among republicans moreover on the issue of dealing with a terrorist threat the poll shows americans knotted on the issue with about half believing that democrats could do a better job what is striking about such statistics isnt just the swooning of support for mr bush but the fact that front running republicans are doing so little to distance themselves from him when much of that unpopularity is tied to iraq currently only one in three americans thinks the war in iraq is winnable the poll shows the optimistic view among republican candidates is far higher as evidenced by yesterdays debate indeed none of the three front runners mr mccain former new york mayor rudy giuliani or former massachusetts gov mitt romney offered much more than a stay the course line on iraq and the general war on terrorism "i think were pretty much in the same place " said mr romney of his and his top rivals support for the administrations iraq policies "it is critical for us to win this conflict it is essential and thats why were going to continue to pursue this effort " clearly mr romney is setting a contrast between himself and the democratic candidates for president almost all of whom favor a dramatic troop drawdown if not outright withdrawal from iraq still he seemed to sense the perils of wedding himself to an increasingly unpopular administration when he called for more diplomacy in the middle east and assured the crowd that "im not a carbon copy of president bush " meanwhile as the run of early candidate events continues some republicans have appeared reluctant to embrace new approaches that allow voters outside of the early primary states to directly question them via the internet cnn had to postpone its planned republican debate featuring video questions received via youtube after messrs romney and giuliani criticized the format and said they had scheduling issues after watching the democrats do it yet even yesterday the candidates found that they are unable to escape the new format when abc news solicited video questions from its viewers just a day earlier seven democratic presidential hopefuls also found themselves in a new sort of debate when they placed themselves at the mercy of the liberal blogosphere arguably the most vocal faction of the party during a minute debate in chicago and in smaller hour long q&amp a sessions the candidates sought to establish their antiwar pro change credentials amid sometimes skeptical questioning by the liberal activists bloggers new york sen hillary rodham clinton has had mixed success wooing the "netroots" because of her vote for the iraq war and subsequent refusal to apologize for it mrs clinton cast a long shadow at the event organized by the liberal blog daily kos receiving a standing ovation at a q&amp a session and mostly innocuous questioning after the event some bloggers were saying they were impressed by illinois sen barack obama and former north carolina sen john edwards and believed they did the best at the debate mr edwards received several standing ovations from the crowd and mr obama was serenaded by the bloggers with "happy birthday " after they learned he had turned that day laura meckler contributed to this article
