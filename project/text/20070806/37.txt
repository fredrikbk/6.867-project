investing in funds a monthly analysis do target funds hit the mark baby boomers are flocking to them as retirement nears heres how theyve fared stocks or bonds domestic or foreign stand pat or rebalance for baby boomers struggling with these kinds of questions about how to manage their retirement savings target date mutual funds have been a welcome innovation these funds aim for a mix of investments appropriate to the investors expected retirement date and adjust their holdings as that date approaches to reflect a diminishing tolerance for risk the category has boomed on the promise of safe diversification wrapped in a single mutual fund so how good are these funds at figuring out the optimum balance of investments changes in the strategies of several funds suggest the ideal balance is hard for even investment pros to pin down and performance data that just now constitute a significant track record for this young sector show a wide range of results the upshot is that investors going this one stop shopping route need to pick a fund carefully using figures from fund tracker morningstar inc the wall street journal assessed funds geared to boomers looking to retire in the year in which those born at the midpoint of the baby boom will turn we examined only those funds with a track record of at least three years of the we identified t rowe price retirement is tops clocking a average annual return in the three years through july nestegg dow jones u s comes in at the bottom averaging a year if you invested &# today and it earned a year until you would have &# compared with &# if you earned a year of course no fund in this sector should be expected to continue delivering the same return year after year since target date funds by design become more conservative over time and analysts emphasize that in the past three years these funds havent been tested by a bear market in stocks which could rearrange the rankings but there is little question that differences in investment philosophy and execution lead to significantly different results this partly reflects a debate in the industry over how much emphasis target funds should place on preserving workers investment and how much on seeking higher returns so people dont outlive their money it also reflects that some companies have done a better job managing their portfolios analysts say while others are still trying to figure out the best way to build one "they are learning as they go along " says andrew clark head of research for the americas at fund tracker lipper inc adds lori lucas a senior vice president at investment consulting firm callan associates inc "its one of the fastest changing fund categories ive seen in a while" in terms of the investments being made by fund managers "i would definitely characterize it as an evolving environment " for example two funds we analyzed wells fargo advantage dow jones target and the nestegg fund last year overhauled their holdings to convert to tracking dow jones target date indexes which made their debut in dow jones &amp co is the publisher of the wall street journal and giant vanguard group inc which wasnt included in our analysis because it doesnt have a fund with a three year history made some major adjustments to its target date funds last year it added an emerging markets index fund to the portfolios of its target funds ensured that all its target funds have of their stock investment in international companies and boosted the total stock exposure of its target funds by roughly percentage points to percentage points depending on the fund fund companies say the changes dont reflect on the job learning but rather are nimble responses to new data or investment options "our products need to stay current with financial markets and academic research " says andrew owen an executive vice president and head of product and investments at the wells fargo funds management llc unit of wells fargo &amp co in san francisco john ameriks a principal in the investment counseling and research group at vanguard says the increase in stock exposure at the vanguard funds was influenced by a dramatic decline in company sponsored retirement benefits over the past few years which means many small investors have no safety net to fall back on and thus have to worry more about outliving their savings that development he says is something vanguard couldnt have anticipated when it started launching target funds in for boomers who want to focus on capital appreciation the funds with the most impressive returns tend to be those with higher percentages of stocks based on our analysis the top performing funds also have some other things in common the funds that these funds invest in are themselves worth buying they arent the laggards that sometimes pepper the portfolios of target date funds in general target date funds are "funds of funds " meaning they invest in a range of mutual funds rather than individual securities and the top portfolios long have been well diversified with exposure early on to hot areas like real estate and foreign stocks one of the boldest options in the group is the t rowe price retirement fund the top performers among the funds generally have stock market exposure greater than and the bottom funds have or less this fund from t rowe price group inc has about of its &# billion in assets in stock funds and from the funds inception in it has invested internationally including in emerging markets t rowe price considers outliving assets one of retirees greatest risks says jerome clark who manages the firms retirement funds people are living longer he notes and theyre leading more active lives in retirement which adds to their expenses of t rowe prices relatively aggressive stance he says "well tend to overperform in up markets maybe underperform in down markets we expect it and we want our investors to expect it " t rowe prices offering invests in of the companys mutual funds morningstar says the mix is solid even offering entry into some top notch funds that otherwise are closed to new investors including t rowe price small cap value and t rowe price mid cap growth eight of the funds in the portfolio carry morningstars four star and five star ratings five being the highest and eight meet a criterion of morningstar analyst greg carlson they have managers with five years of experience or more t rowe prices fund is one of the lowest cost target date funds with an annual fee of of assets that is the cost of the underlying funds because t rowe price doesnt charge a management fee on top of the expenses of the funds in the portfolio a practice that is becoming more common among fund companies lippers mr clark says investors should focus on a funds asset allocation strategy and portfolio and consider expenses secondarily expenses matter he says because they lower the investors return but a lipper analysis last year showed "there isnt correlation" between top funds and low costs indeed principal investors lifetime has one of the higher expense ratios among the we examined at but it still managed to post strong results over the past three years returning annually on average the funds performance was helped by broad diversification holdings include principal investors real estate securities fund at of the portfolio with an average annual return over the past three years international stock funds represent a fifth of the portfolio these include principal investors international emerging markets fund at of the total portfolio with a average annual return for the three years according to morningstar a dozen of the funds in the portfolio nearly two thirds get morningstars top two ratings principal says its higher fees are partly due to diversification since some more interesting options like international stock funds tend to cost more the biggest of the funds we looked at by far is fidelity freedom with assets of &# billion it also is one of the cheapest with fees of of assets annually it returned an average of annually over the past three years but morningstar analysts havent been that enthused "we cant pound the table for it " an analyst wrote recently on the research firms web site just half of the underlying fidelity investments stock and bond funds get morningstars two best ratings less than a third of the funds have managers with five years tenure or more like its t rowe price counterpart the fund allows investors to get into a midcap stock fund that is closed to other new investors but there is a flip side that midcap fund is expanding so fast with target date money that it runs the risk of becoming bloated and less nimble at acquiring winning stocks morningstar cautioned the bigger a funds transactions are in the markets the more likely it is to affect the prices of the securities its trading especially if they are smaller or thinly traded stocks it can drive the price up when it is buying shares and down when it is selling fidelity says it picks funds for the portfolio based on their fit in the investment mix not on ratings or recent performance the fund emphasizes diversification which helped minimize losses during the bear market of says jonathan shelon co manager of the freedom funds as for the swelling midcap fund he says the funds size has to be considered in relation to the bull run in midsize stocks "you have a fish thats growing but the tank is growing as well so you still have plenty of room to swim " he says t rowe says it would divert target date fund money into an index fund should asset bloat become a problem the nestegg dow jones u s fund the portfolio ranking last in returns among the funds we examined leans toward preservation of an investors money as a key goal at the risk of a lesser return "one of the worst things that could happen" to an investor is being forced to wait several years to retire because a market downturn near the target date wiped out a huge chunk of savings says fund manager jared goldstrom since march this fund which is managed by american independence financial services llc has invested in the individual securities that make up the dow jones u s target date index mr goldstrom says that investing directly in stocks rather than in mutual funds prevents overlap and keeps expenses down the funds expense ratio was cut to last week from before it switched to the dow jones u s target date index as its investment model the nestegg fund had just under half its assets in stocks well below the average of all funds tracked by morningstar tracking the dow jones u s target date index boosted the funds exposure to stocks to of assets but mr goldstrom says some nestegg clients such as retirement plan sponsors trustees and administrators wanted exposure to international shares nestegg shareholders voted in june to switch to the dow jones global target date index effective last week the switch offers broader diversification mr goldstrom says without taking on more market risk mr goldstrom rejects any suggestion that the portfolio changes by the managers of target date funds are a sign they are still trying to figure out the best way to run these funds the changes are typical of the process of continually fitting a product to clients needs he says ms badal is a staff reporter for the
