left behind the other black gold u s coal miners miss merger wave but industry says time may be ripe just about every area of mining has been immersed in takeovers and consolidation with big copper iron ore and alumina companies trying to nail down good reserves and assets the exception to date coal specifically north american coal but many in the industry say that is about to change coal is an important energy source both globally and in the u s where it supplies about half of the nations electricity but in the short term the industry faces a thicket of problems that could make companies less attractive targets to prowling acquisitive international mining companies like australias bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto plc or brazils companhia vale do rio doce for example u s coal producers face a continued political debate over environmental issues that could lead to fewer coal burning power plants new requirements for increased safety and stricter permitting rules to open mines however many in the industry believe by early next year the industry will see more consolidation especially in eastern states where suppliers remain highly fragmented they say fundamentals are keen for consolidation given that coal is widely viewed over the long term as a low cost solution to the countrys growing energy needs and that the u s has the biggest reserves in the world the same operating issues that favor consolidation in other mining companies including high capital and transportation costs and the ability to extract savings from obtaining reserves and processing facilities near customers are true for coal they argue they say deals will begin to happen once coal stockpiles at utilities fall and coal prices begin to rise along with stocks "this wave of consolidation that has gone through most natural resource sectors will come to coal once the prices get straightened out " says wilbur l ross chairman of international coal group inc and also of an investment company bearing his name icgs own stock is about half what it was at its initial public offering he notes "in that kind of environment people dont have currency they feel they can use " mr ross said he thinks excess inventories at utilities will be worked off by the end of this year giving coal prices some support and that greater consolidation in the u s and abroad is a year away "what hasnt yet occurred are the megatransactions " said mr ross who led a group that invested several hundred million dollars to create icg some industry executives say there is a strong desire to consolidate businesses but that price tags remain too high at a recent meeting with analysts jim roberts chief executive of foundation coal holdings inc said some companies ideas about their value have been "on another planet from what we thought they were " he expects that to change he added as liquidity issues force some small and midsize companies onto the market a string of recent mixed results show the challenges the industry faces in the short term peabody energy corp and arch coal inc reported weak second quarter earnings due to softer pricing and higher costs for diesel fuel and equipment among other things icg had a net loss due to shipping problems and weaker production in central appalachia consol energy inc stood out for its strong results as it was able to sell coal produced in northern appalachia at higher prices but the company also idled production in central appalachia due to weak market conditions there industry insiders say consolidation is desperately needed in the increasingly mined out central appalachian region a total of mines in kentucky and west virginia for example account for about of total u s coal production by contrast in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana coal seams can be about feet thick and two dozen mines produce of the countrys coal industry insiders say conditions in the west are far more attractive to international miners and they dont discount that such companies will make a move "i know theyre showing more interest " says jim thompson managing editor of the coal and energy price report a daily report on coal industry news "i believe its safe to say their primary interest in the u s is in the powder river basin " analysts say peabody of st louis the nations biggest coal producer by output is a likely target because it primarily operates in the west but also because it has exposure to china and the pacific rim through mines it owns in australia peabody is also in the process of spinning off its union mines in the eastern u s which would make it almost entirely union free and more attractive to international buyers that new company is also viewed as a possible acquirer of coal assets in central appalachia vic svec a peabody spokesman said he couldnt comment on potential interest from other companies but he said peabody itself "remains very interested in growth through acquisitions " unlike other natural resource sectors the u s coal industry has huge reserves and fragmented producers which gives companies little pricing leverage since u s coal producers primarily supply domestic utilities red hot demand for coal in china and india has little impact on u s mining companies and the u s is the only region in the world where coal prices arent at multiyear highs "weve been very surprised by the somnolent pace of m&amp a activity in coal given the white hot wave of m&amp a in steel copper nickel gold and aluminum " says john hill director of metals research at citigroup one explanation he says is that three major drivers of acquisitions in other commodities resource scarcity high cash flows that companies are eager to reinvest and favorable valuations of companies based on strong pricing models of commodities are lacking in u s coal in the u s coal company cash flows have been hurt by rising costs for everything from diesel fuel to new safety rules and companies must contend with stagnant prices due to high inventories at utilities many industry analysts predict that the issues that are making mining tougher in the east will lead to more "regional accretion" of coal assets there "high cost mining and things like worker safety and depletion of reserves could very well encourage combinations of companies to try to avoid cost increase " says paul forward a coal analyst at stifel nicolaus &amp co a big government tax credit that applies to coal that is chemically treated to make it qualify as a nonconventional fuel the "synfuel" tax credit expires at the end of year which will also likely force smaller players to go out of business or to merge
