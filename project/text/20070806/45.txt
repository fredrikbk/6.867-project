investing in funds a monthly analysis out of court fight two decades after mandatory arbitration took effect for investors disputes debate over it gains renewed momentum the debate hasnt lost heat in two decades twenty years ago the supreme court ruled that securities brokerage firms could require their customers to take disputes to arbitration now the critics of that ruling are at it again following a stream of statements and letters from legislators lawyers and consumer groups urging the securities and exchange commission and congress to ban mandatory arbitration sen russell feingold d wis and rep hank johnson d ga introduced legislation in mid july that would make pre dispute mandatory arbitration agreements unenforceable motivating some critics is the consolidation of the industrys two primary arbitration forums the national association of securities dealers with nyse regulation a unit of nyse euronext the merger finalized last week "raises the stakes for getting arbitration right" with a forum that is "independent and fair to investors " the head of the north american securities administrators association testified before a senate subcommittee in may have any of the debating points changed will the latest push from arbitrations critics lead to an overhaul of the current arrangement the wall street journal invited two lawyers to discuss the issue ted eppenstein who represented investors in the shearson american express v mcmahon case and is currently a member of the securities industry conference on arbitration and matt farley a partner with the law firm drinker biddle &amp reath who defends brokerage firms in arbitration and litigation and is a member of the securities industry and financial markets association compliance and legal division here are excerpts from the email discussion the wall street journal why has this topic heated up again mr farley could it possibly be that with the market not only fully recovered but seeming to hold steady these past few years most if not all of the meritorious cases have already proceeded through the pipeline to an award it isnt the "investors" who are seeking return to the pre option of going to court it is the attorneys who dont have enough good cases to bring who are seeking new opportunities to "lock and load" with meritless claims that they know experienced arbitrators will likely dismiss mr eppenstein while the dark side is always quick to "blame the victim" or chastise their lawyers here all the public wants is the right to choose the forum in which to fight financial fraud the right of investors to a jury trial proceeding in a court of law was judicially usurped in the mcmahon decision its time for a sea change to give back to public investors the american way the choice to go to court if they desire wsj why is wall street so adamant about mandatory arbitration even though arbitration takes longer than it has in the past it is still faster and cheaper than taking a case through the legal system suggesting that most investors would choose the arbitration route if they had a choice right mr farley it is not a question of one or the other prior to mcmahon a case could and many cases did find themselves in both forums the federal claim in a district court all the other claims in arbitration a &# case that would be "small claims" in most states went forward in a federal action opening the door to every discovery mechanism afforded by federal rules and a parallel arbitration was happening right alongside it covering essentially the same facts and events the situation was logistically and economically a nightmare securities firms rightly and naturally sought relief from the often recklessly wielded bludgeon of wide ranging and all but limitless discovery mr eppenstein the benefits of courts over arbitration are discovery procedures which are monitored by the court defined rules of evidence legal precedents that are required to be followed and most important an impartial judge and a jury there is the right to full appellate review court is an open forum another plus for the public because individual investors have not been permitted to bring their claims of securities fraud unauthorized trading unsuitable investments churning frequent trading to generate commissions common law claims and the like into the courtroom the public is also denied the ability to have the media fully and fairly report on the abuses on wall street that continue to befall the unwary investor these get played out instead in a semi secret arbitration proceeding mr farley arbitration is cheaper and faster and more likely to have a measure of predictability than say a jury trial and for those very reasons like transactions in automobiles credit cards home improvements garment production construction of virtually all types software disputes and major league athletics the industry participants have generally opted for arbitration for the resolution of disputes mr eppenstein matt i agree with you that arbitration run by self regulatory organizations is more likely to have a measure of predictability for the industry than a jury trial thats because the current arbitration system can be viewed as a stacked deck against the investor thus it is no surprise that arbitration would be cheaper faster and a better way for the financial industry to trim its defense costs fast resolution at a cheap rate is what the industry seeks the investor wants justice even if it takes a little longer to achieve in court even the nasd the major provider of arbitration for customers in reports that its "win loss" percentage of is lower than it has been since at least wsj what role has the consolidation of regulatory functions of the nasd and nyse regulation to form the financial industry regulatory authority played in the renewed push for investors to have the option of going to court mr farley i see no connection between the merged arbitration facilities and whether the customer should have an ability to opt for a court proceeding in recent years the nasd has processed the vast majority of filed cases and aggressively served the investor community by making venues more local and convenient throughout the country the attorneys who regularly represent customers have shown no lack of energy and imagination when it comes to urging and getting procedural rule changes that ease the prosecution of customer claims mr eppenstein when wal mart and costco are both in town the consumer can decide where to shop for a better deal the consolidation of the nasd and nyse securities arbitration forums effectively takes the last vestige of choice away from the public there are significant differences in arbitration at the nasd and the nyse forums such as the arbitrator selection process different procedures to administer cases and different locations for the hearings i fully understand matt that you dont perceive any difference after all the arbitrator pools are similar and the win rates for investors are low at both forums however earlier this year all three current public members of the securities industry conference on arbitration and all public emeritus members joined together to complain to the sec that consolidation would not be in the investors best interest wsj would it make sense for investors to have more choice in arbitration forums like opening it up to the american arbitration association or judicial arbitration and mediation services mr farley their fees are significantly higher than nasd nyse because they lack the subsidy that securities industry member firms pay as part of their regulatory fees in a pilot case some years back several of the larger firms opened up their arbitration clauses to aaa but there were few takers mr eppenstein the mini program you refer to was doomed from the start only a handful of large brokerages signed on for a few months and then it was with certain conditions what we need is an independent forum funded by the industry but independently run and operated with sec oversight wsj do you expect the sec or congress to make a change on this issue mr farley with the market up the past several years the number of open arbitration cases has plummeted while the trial bar always has its agenda i dont see any broad constituency for legislation to alter the current situation or any obvious "injustice" crying out for relief there is no empirical evidence at all that investors systematically fare worse in arbitration than they would in court with the same case so i would say legislative or regulatory action is unlikely mr eppenstein anyone with a sense of history can look at the declining dismal results that nasd and nyse arbitration has yielded to the investor over the past years to see that the system is not a level playing field nasd stats show the investor "win rate" has steadily declined and when the customer does win something the award is often only a small portion of the loss this information is well known to the sec but will they act as predicted by supreme court justice harry blackmun in the mcmahon dissent arbitration reform may ride on the seriousness of purpose of our elected members of congress to right the wrong inflicted on the investing public years ago congress must not only step up to the plate by writing letters and holding hearings it has to hit the ball over the fence and pass legislation to reverse the injustice i think it will mr farley the decline in average recovery stats is misleading the recovery rate has been fairly uniform until just the past few years which included two new phenomena claims involving self directed internet trading and alleged reliance on "tainted" research by wall street analysts seeking to please their firms investing banking clients whether in court or in arbitration these are always tough sells and there is no study or any reasoned basis to argue that these cases would have done better in court in fact many of the so called analyst cases that were filed in court seeking class action status were summarily dismissed upon motion the fact that class members might have had individual accounts subject to an arbitration agreement doesnt preclude a class action suit from going forward if the premise of the claim is viable mr eppenstein however you want to argue it the statistics are the knockout punch take your argument that there is no empirical study to show that investors would do better in court of course this is true since there can be no case litigated both before a jury and then re litigated before a securities arbitration panel there will be no study done but this is really just a red herring ms pessin writes the compliance watch column for dow jones
