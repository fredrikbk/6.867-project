ahead of the tape complacency panic whipsaw credit markets eight months ago credit markets reflected dangerous complacency about the risk of default in the economy today there are signs theyve gone too far in the opposite direction jim bianco president of bianco research llc says thats the case with the popular abx indexes which track subprime mortgages using j p morgans model to calculate the scenarios for home prices and defaults implied by the current level of abx indexes he found the current price of the aa portion or tranche is predicting a decline in home prices over the next five years a drop he says has occurred nationally only in the great depression to be sure the homes underlying the abx are concentrated in california and florida and therefore might behave differently from the national average but a decline over five years seems a stretch meantime the triple b minus tranche the riskiest slice is predicting a drop of just in home prices over the same period an unusual discrepancy mr bianco says the divergence of scenarios suggests irrational pricing if so how did the subprime indices become detached from reality stock derivatives seldom wander far from fair value because its easy for arbitragers to trade the underlying stocks and bring the price of the derivatives and the underlying stock into alignment by contrast the assets underlying credit derivatives are relatively illiquid the abx indexes are derived from credit derivatives that are themselves derived from subprime backed collateralized debt obligations that hold the actual mortgages so the index is several steps removed from the underlying assets at times of market stress credit derivatives do often stray from fair value after general motors corp s debt was downgraded to junk in early its credit derivatives at one point implied odds of default in less than five years today says mr bianco "it looks like that was the result of panic " he sees a similar mispricing today in the dow jones cdx index based on credit derivatives derived from high yield bonds that index is now pricing in materially higher probability of default than the price of the underlying bonds themselves dan castro managing director at gsc group a new york asset manager sees a similar disconnect in trading in the lcdx credit derivatives index linked to the cost of bank loans used in leveraged buyouts "thats crazy " he says "theres just this huge disconnect between the fundamental value of the index and where things are trading " mr bianco offers this explanation the abx is one of the few ways to hedge against or speculate on subprime mortgages and anyone who wants to bet or hedge against the mortgages or underlying homes is selling the index trading volume is times the collateral underlying the indexes themselves mr bianco makes two forecasts based on all this first buy and hold investors could do well buying abx at todays depressed levels second "a rally in subprime is the biggest risk now " it is precisely such a rally that began the chain of losses that wounded bear stearns hedge funds which had placed bearish bets on the abx in other words bears beware email to greg ip wsj com
