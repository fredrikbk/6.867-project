politics &amp economics lebanese election tests u s backed regime beirut lebanon an election yesterday for the seat of an assassinated christian lawmaker tested the strength of lebanons u s backed government against parties supported by iran and syria because of the way lebanese political power is alloted by sect the winner of the seat representing metn a district spread across towns and villages dotting mount lebanon will have significant leverage in naming the next president in late september when parliament is scheduled to convene that will be crucial for the future of a government that has been stalled since nine months ago when the shiite movement hezbollah and its christian allies withdrew from the governing coalition and formed an opposition bloc a separate contest in a muslim district of beirut also for the seat of an assassinated parliamentarian was easily won by the sunni pro government candidate in metn amin gemayel a former president and ally of u s backed president fuad siniora was running to replace his son pierre who was gunned down late last year opposing mr gemayel was kamil khoury who is supported by christian opposition leader michel aoun a former army commander and onetime interim prime minister who has allied himself with the hezbollah led opposition bloc with official results still out late last night both candidates claimed victory and accused the other of rigging the vote in the christian neighborhood of jadaidah in metn voters belonging to both sides wore t shirts bearing the color and logo of their parties bright orange for mr auon and dark beige for mr gemayel preliminary data showed high voter turnout nearing in metn despite concerns that the race could trigger clashes between supporters the voting was peaceful at one polling station the crowd went into a frenzy when the wife of the slain mr gemayel showed up to greet voters and rally support for her father in law the crowd beat on drums and chanted "pierre is alive in us " the opposition fell silent waving orange flags above the widows head the polling in metn also signified a widening gap in lebanons once unified christian community lebanons political structure is based on a complex power sharing structure among the countrys main sects leaders are drawn from feudal dynasties belonging to christian maronite and druze families from the mountain ranges shiite muslim clans from the south and bekaa valley and affluent sunni businessmen from beirut and other cities there are christians in many countries across the middle east from iran to egypt in lebanon they enjoy significant political power in the past few years as the country has stumbled from one crisis to another its christian community has often been seen as weak and split with christian leaders throwing their weight behind lebanons sunni and shiite politicians "we have created the only country in the middle east where islam is not the state religion and we can live freely and at peace our position is now threatened as we get pulled in to the sunni shiite divide " said archbishop paul matar the top maronite christian church official in beirut the winner of the metn seat can claim to represent the majority of lebanons maronite christians the alliance nine months ago of mr aouns christian party with hezbollah which is designated a terrorist organization by the u s placed the once isolated shiite party into a position of national political opposition the lebanese government has been locked in an impasse since then over the oppositions demands for larger representation that would grant veto power to groups such as hezbollah the u s deems this unacceptable and has pushed for the beirut government not to compromise the impasse has virtually paralyzed the government it has been nine months since parliament last met to discuss urgent matters such as political reform disarming militias and naming a president if the two sides fail to compromise on naming a president they could split the government an outcome that in a country in which political parties are well armed could possibly lead to civil war that prospect is made all the more troubling because lebanon has long been a proxy battleground today the larger rivalry between the u s on one side and iran and syria on the other is seen as playing itself out in the streets of beirut "at the end of the day we still have two huge power blocks with regional and international backing facing each other " said paul salem the director of the carnegie middle east center in beirut
