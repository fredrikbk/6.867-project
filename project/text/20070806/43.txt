investing in funds a monthly analysis mixing it up picking a skipper fidelity investor editor focuses on fund managers records finding the right fund manager can be the key to achieving your financial goals that is the philosophy of jim lowell editor of fidelity investor a newsletter that recommends model portfolios using mutual funds from fidelity investments in this column we ask prominent financial advisers who use mutual and exchange traded funds to share their model asset allocations for certain kinds of investors mr lowell is a partner at adviser investment management inc a newton mass firm that manages about &# billion largely in a mix of funds from fidelity and vanguard group inc separately mr lowell has been publishing his fidelity newsletter for a decade and it has about subscribers according to mr lowell he shares his recommendations for a model "growth" portfolio targeted for individuals who want market beating returns over a year period the ideal investor for this portfolio he says is at least years away from retirement the portfolio currently is about stocks and a big slice of those are foreign holdings bonds currently total only about though the portfolio held up to about in cash during parts of the bear market of mr lowell says he has changed the portfolios allocations of stocks bonds and foreign stocks only a couple of times in the past years the portfolio is riskier than the big company standard &amp poors stock index he says partly because of the high foreign allocation and partly reflecting his belief that stock markets will do well over the next three to five years mr lowell uses his view of the economy to determine broad sectors to invest in and then seeks to determine the managers most suited to delivering strong results he ranks the managers based on factors like how consistently a manager has beaten his benchmark and how well he or she did in a bad market year mr lowell expects managers to "outperform the benchmark when the going is good and when the going is tough lose less than the market " "while im long term bullish its my nature to be cautious in the short term " he adds here is the current allocation of mr lowells model growth portfolio u s stocks and bonds just over one fifth of the portfolio is in fidelity dividend growth a large company stock fund managed by charles mangum under mr mangum the fund tends to track the broader market during bull markets and outperform in bear markets mr lowell says which helps the overall portfolio reduce volatility he calls mr mangum a good "defensive" manager in his fund lost less than most peers mr lowell also is keen on thomas soviero who manages the fidelity leveraged company stock and fidelity convertible securities funds the model portfolio has stakes in these funds of and respectively the leveraged company fund led by mr soviero since aims to buys stocks of companies that have borrowed a lot and are issuing high yield or "junk " bonds the companies tend to be midsize mr lowell says the funds strategy has worked well especially in a bear market year like when it lost less than the broad market mr soviero has continued the investing philosophy of his predecessor david glancy and "knows how to make money in any market conditions " says mr lowell as the name suggests the convertible securities fund invests in bonds and preferred stock that can be converted into common shares under certain conditions the bond like component makes these securities less risky than ordinary stocks but they have upside if the issuing companys stock does well mr lowell says the fund which mr soviero has run since june helps reduce the portfolios overall risk profile mr lowells portfolio invests about in fidelity contrafund and about in fidelity low priced stock fund however these funds are closed to new investors so as substitutes mr lowell suggests fidelity capital appreciation a large stock fund and fidelity value a midcap stock fund he recommends investing about in fidelity capital appreciation which has been headed by another fidelity veteran fergus shiel since october previously the fund was run by harry lange who left to take over fidelity magellan for fidelity value mr lowell suggests investing the same that would have gone in the low priced stock fund he says he chose fidelity value largely for its focus on midsize shares which he thinks have more potential than large company stocks and will be less volatile than small stocks the funds manager richard fentin doesnt figure high in mr lowells ranking system but his long fidelity record including skippering the value fund since impressed mr lowell more than those of managers at some of fidelitys other midcap alternatives the track record gave a "much greater degree of predictability" of how the fund would behave mr lowell allocates to fidelity four in one index fund the fund invests about of its money in fidelity spartan index and about each in the fidelity spartan extended market index tracking midsize and small cap stocks fidelity spartan international index which tracks stocks from developed countries abroad and fidelity u s bond index which invests in the high quality lehman brothers aggregate bond index the four in one fund "enables me to smooth out the volatility of all the other managed funds in the portfolio " says mr lowell it also reduces the portfolios overall expense foreign securities mr lowell believes the global economy is going to expand for several years fueling both foreign and u s stock markets but "youre going to have to go overseas to basically deliver stellar long term results " he says he allocates to fidelity international small cap opportunities mr lowell believes small and midsize stocks can be mispriced and thus available at bargain prices but he also likes this investing area because he believes large international companies increasingly are correlated with u s markets the fund was launched in august and is managed by andrew sassine whom fidelity promoted from analyst to run the fund at its inception while mr lowell considers mr sassine a "rookie manager" because of his short track record he invests in this fund primarily to get exposure to this asset class mr lowell advises a allocation to a fund that invests in stocks of developing countries fidelity emerging markets robert b von rekowsky whose background includes emerging markets debt analysis has run the fund since january to reduce volatilily mr lowell recently reduced the allocation to emerging markets stocks and added an emerging markets bond fund fidelity new markets income managed by john carlson mr carlson has a long background in emerging markets and is known for investing conservatively the idea behind picking the fund mr lowell says was to "tamp down some of the equity risk without getting out of the emerging markets " the fund represents of the portfolio ms anand is a staff reporter for the wall street journals new
