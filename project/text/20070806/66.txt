ron pauls earmarks texas congressman ron paul libertarian gadfly and current republican presidential hopeful has made a name for himself as a critic of overspending but it seems even he cant resist the political allure of earmarks after reporters started asking questions the congressman disclosed his requests this year for about &# million worth of federal funding for no fewer than earmarks they include such urgent national wartime priorities as an &# million request for the marketing of wild american shrimp and &# million to fund shrimp fishing research when we called mr pauls office for an explanation his spokesperson offered up something worthy of pork legends tom delay or senator robert c byrd "reducing earmarks does not reduce government spending and it does not prohibit spending upon those things that are earmarked " the spokesman said "what people who push earmark reform are doing is they are particularly misleading the public and i have to presume its not by accident " on the other hand good libertarians should want to start cutting somewhere the problem with earmarking is that each year the habit grows by leaps and bounds so that it now represents real money it is also a gateway to political corruption a la duke cunningham and other congressmen currently under investigation for trading favors for earmarks mr paul is one of congresss better fiscal conservatives so the fact that even he feels obliged to grab multiple earmarks is all the more reason to keep fighting for transparency in the earmark process as well as for the line item veto which would give presidents a chance to impose some spending discipline from outside congress
