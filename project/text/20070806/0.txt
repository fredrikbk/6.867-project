great unwind may be here as problems spread to broad bond market top brokers could suffer the problems have been gathering for months beginning with subprime loans and spreading outward now wall street firms face the risk of a broad bond market unwind leaving vulnerable five years of record earnings and stock run ups investors are worrying about more than just reduced earnings growth its the overall uncertainty they say the unintended risks of "bridge" loans stuck on balance sheets or even how to value a new set of exotic securities that cant find buyers this could weigh on wall street stocks be it lehman brothers holdings inc or goldman sachs group inc for months to come analyst brad hintz of sanford c bernstein &amp co predicts "performance will decline" at the top five u s brokers for the second half of the year "the halcyon days " he adds "may be over for now " perhaps thats why chatter around some firms suggests job cuts could be coming if conditions dont improve by september the worries stretch across a number of areas in the past few weeks trading has fallen off to a trickle in some asset backed bonds issued at double a or triple a ratings with no bidders lining up valuations and ratings have been left uncertain investors are also finding it harder to trade some risky high yield or "junk " bonds and leveraged loans for borrowers with high debt levels the pullback in liquidity has been made worse by the usually slow summer vacation season that has hurt the chances wall street securities firms can offload their bridge financing commitments for pending private equity deals which have soared this year for months analysts and bankers had predicted that rising debt levels for hedge funds buyouts and wall street dealers might eventually snap leading to a "great unwind" of lower prices and forced selling now some say the process has begun for the wall street firms analysts say the current crunch could mean cutbacks in lucrative fees for financing and advising on fewer private equity buyouts and the risk of losses on loans to finance hedge fund positions and "hung" financing commitments they also face reduced profits if they must trim their sails by cutting the size of their balance sheets "a lot of investors are realizing that the same very loose lending standards that were applied to homeowners have also been applied to corporate" bonds as well says albert edwards the global strategist at the dresdner kleinwort unit of allianz se who popularized the term "the great unwind" and believes such an unwind has been under way since early this year others disagree "i dont see it as a great unwind but a correction to more reasonable levels its more like the great return to rationality " says peter andersen a junk bond manager at dreman value management "overall its a healthy thing but its quite painful living through the adjustment " so far investors are skeptical that an unwind wont claim some victims bear stearns cos shares are now off nearly a third year to date and its co president and co chief operating officer warren spector resigned yesterday merrill lynch &amp co shares are off by a quarter and lehman shares nearly a wall street executive who markets hedge funds and other alternative investments said the valuation of some collateralized debt obligations pools backed by other securities such as mortgages which sport nominally top notch credit ratings has become highly uncertain "someone says theyre worth and someone else says and you cant sell at because there arent any bids " he said such uncertainty creates a challenge for wall street firms that have made loans backed by such securities should they be marked down and should investors who hold them with borrowed funds be forced to sell assets to give the lenders an extra cushion of safety by the fraught psychology of the bond market this could trigger more problems than it is supposed to prevent "when you have something like this theres a debate about where to mark these things " said alex ehrlich global head of prime brokerage at ubs ag which has extended credit to some clients that hold such securities "nothings trading so you have to exercise great care and caution in where you mark were trying to be pragmatic when youre caught up in this situation you know the market is dysfunctional you have to come up with reasonableness standards we try to come up with a theoretically fair value " one symptom of the ailing market is fewer new issues friday thomson financial said the u s corporate bond deals in july which is ordinarily a slow month constituted "the lowest monthly number since " in recent months several firms have disclosed sharply higher levels of financing commitments lehman reported that its "contingent commitments" for noninvestment grade acquisitions tripled to &# billion in may from &# billion just six months earlier lehman says that number is "significantly greater" than what it will actually have to commit to because some bidders line up more commitments than they need or dont win the deal other firms have also reported commitment increases goldman sachs has &# billion in noninvestment grade financing commitments up from six months earlier morgan stanley has &# billion in such commitments up since november such commitments can produce losses or eat heavily into fees when j p morgan chase &amp co merrill citigroup inc and bank of america corp led a &# billion financing for tribune co in may they had to sweeten terms for investors eating into a third of their &# million in fees wall street executives say some losses are offset by the fees they earned for making the commitments in the first place typically in the range of a report by buckingham research group estimated that even if &# billion in unsold bonds for buyouts needed to be marked down on brokers books by the "hit" would amount to only of revenues some analysts and wall street executives point to the strength of the global economy in their predicting the credit crunch will be short lived buckingham analysts james mitchell and john grassano compare the current debt market pullback to the brief
