braving the subprime storm tech industrial shares have been faring best jitters hit every sector twin forces are battling for supremacy in the stock market right now global economic growth and the credit market bloodbath currently even optimists fear stocks have farther to fall and to understand why just peel back the markets lid and look at the sectors that are doing best and worst the stocks holding up best in the recent downdraft are industrial and technology stocks which investors still hope will benefit from the strong pace of global growth the worst performers are financial and consumer related stocks the most at risk from the credit crunch roiling markets there also are signs of fear that u s growth could be affected by the credit downturn as some growth related stocks such as energy stocks and basic materials producers have joined the retreat for several months investors shrugged off credit problems hoping they would be limited to the lowest quality home loans and the least wealthy consumers even after the credit troubles started affecting the junk bonds used to finance corporate takeovers growth hopes pushed the dow jones industrial average to a record close of on july a little over two weeks ago but now credit problems are threatening higher quality loans as well raising fears about more fallout at financial companies and at hedge funds that invest in loan related securities the dow industrials are down from their july record and many money managers expect a "correction" of perhaps more "we are in a corrective phase and it isnt over " says jeff schappe chief investment officer at bb&amp t asset management in raleigh n c who considers himself bullish over the longer term since june when the dow hit an earlier record only two of the broad industry sectors tracked by dow jones indexes have held their own technology and industrial stocks the dow industrials composed of blue chip stocks are down since june while u s technology stocks as a broad group have fallen just and industrial companies are down financial stocks at risk in the credit market downturn have fallen in that short period stocks of consumer service companies at risk as consumer spending cools are down investors dont think the credit crunch will end world growth but they do think it will hurt consumer and financial companies if credit markets weather the current storm some stocks that have suffered could eventually look cheap but if a recession does hit markets are far from prepared and stocks could fall heavily "we think that there is going to be a great buying opportunity in the financial sector before the year is done some of the stocks that have been the most unloved regional banks for example and money center banks like a citigroup or a bank of america or a j p morgan chase we think we will want to jump in with both feet but it is a little early yet " says e keith wirtz president of fifth third asset management in cincinnati a big worry today focuses on billions of dollars in pending loans to finance huge corporate buyouts fears are swirling that some of these loans could fall apart sending shock waves through the banks and brokerage firms that have underwritten them and the buyout world that depends on them the credit crisis also has affected some higher grade mortgage securities and corporate loans few are betting the trouble is over some investors worry that the credit crisis already is affecting u s growth stocks of energy companies and of companies that produce basic materials such as copper aluminum and steel initially held up well despite the credit crisis but in the past week or two they have fallen amid concerns that u s growth in particular may not be as robust as hoped analysts also view utility stocks recent weakness as an early warning sign utilities typically pay high dividends and because they produce energy they benefit from rising energy prices their decline reflects fears of higher interest rates making dividends a less attractive alternative to bonds as well as fears that energy demand may soften drug companies and makers of staple consumer products often do well at times like this because their sales tend to be steady and predictable regardless of economic strength but drug companies have been hurt by fears about their pipelines and about competition in the industry while consumer staples seem to be suffering from fears about consumer spending some investors are following a "barbell" approach buying technology and industrial companies for their growth prospects and health care and some consumer staples for their stability one widespread approach is to look for "quality" stocks within each industry group at home and abroad for years smaller less established stocks were sought after for their higher growth potential and riskier bonds for their higher yields for now however nervous investors are shifting toward bigger more stable stocks and safer seeming bonds "the credit crunch is temporary the global growth is enduring so the longer term potential for many of these companies is good " says marc stern chief investment officer at bessemer trust in new york but mr stern isnt buying beaten down stocks yet he still is holding around cash in clients portfolios which he will put to work once things seem closer to settling down see related article "abreast of the
