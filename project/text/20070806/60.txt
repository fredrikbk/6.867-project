politics &amp economics how ghanas economic turnaround is threatened falling water level stunts hydro power more energy needed akosombo ghana just as its economy is picking up steam ghana is finding its growth stunted by a force beyond its control climate change rainfall in the west african country has declined so sharply in recent years that the water level behind the year old akosombo dam long the countrys main power source is now at a record low forcing the government to ration power and companies to invest in costly diesel generators economists estimate the water and power shortage could slash as much as two percentage points off ghanas economic growth this year "definitely there are climatic changes affecting our part of the world " says the rev ishmael gansah deputy chief executive of the volta river authority a governmental body that runs the dam and its reservoir volta lake "predictions are that our part of the world will get drier " many scientists suspect that global warming is responsible for decreased rainfall in areas as far flung as australia algeria mali and the american southwest the world bank estimates that global warming is a major reason rainfall in the niger river basin to the east of here has fallen by since the early s and officials at the international development agency suspect the effect has been similar here in the volta river basin which includes parts of ghana benin burkina faso ivory coast mali and togo ghanas experience illustrates how changing weather patterns can have a direct and severe impact on critical parts of an economy the water level at the akosombo dam is at feet feet below the dams high water mark engineers have had to shut down four of the hydroelectric plants six turbines because the water doesnt come up high enough to run them the spillways used to empty excess water in times of surplus are completely above the lake surface in the s the dam accounted for of the countrys power now it supplies closer to while the country has brought two oil fired generating plants on line in recent years that hasnt been sufficient to make up for akosombos diminishing returns and ghana hasnt moved quickly to find alternative sources of electricity to relieve the pressure on akosombo according to economists "from where we stand as a nation i think we could have done better in terms of planning ahead and making alternative sources of energy available " says daniel tetteh head of research for databank financial services group an accra investment bank and brokerage firm officials say they will bring emergency generators on line and hope a long dormant plan to add a chinese financed dam on the black volta river upstream from akosombo will become a reality within a few years it isnt clear however what effect that project would have on water levels in volta lake especially during the long period during which the upstream dam the bui would be closed to allow its reservoir to fill burkina faso has already put a hydropower plant upstream from akosombo which analysts believe may be contributing to the low water in volta lake not all scientists blame global warming for the dry weather here chris gordon senior fellow at the volta basin research center at the university of ghana says he believes global warming is occurring but doesnt know whether the basin is being affected by that or by the dry phase of an extended weather cycle "for the past years we have gone through a dry spell " prof gordon says "on a global timescale its nothing the wingbeat of a hummingbird but on the scale we live in its important " whatever the cause of the dryness the potential impact could be devastating ghana "may have to shut down the whole hydro operation and switch to thermal energy which they dont have " says john mason executive director of the nature conservation research center in accra he says excessive use and poor management are in part to blame for the dismal state of the volta reservoir the volta river authority began rationing power a year ago and increased the power cuts this year after a disappointing rainy season the authority publishes a rotation of hour outages in the newspapers "you dont have an option " says rev gansah databank estimates that the outages are forcing companies to spend &# million a month or about &# million a year on extra power generation or about of the countrys entire economic output databank forecasts the power shortage will cut economic growth from to between and "power rationing is taking its toll on industry " says tony oteng gyasi president of the association of ghana industries which counts member companies among those hard hit is unilevers unilever ghana ltd s plant in the industrial town of tema the factory produces margarine oils laundry detergent hand soap and other consumer goods when the power rationing began the authorities gave unilever a choice either the factory could voluntarily cut power consumption by or adhere to the schedule of rotating power cuts unilever chose the first track but had to purchase diesel generators to make up for the lost electricity from the power grid in the meantime turning parts of the grid on and off so frequently has itself made the power system less reliable above and beyond the planned cuts "the systems keep breaking down " says richard nkrumah unilevers chief engineer
