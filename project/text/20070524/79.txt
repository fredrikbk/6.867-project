plasma tvs battle to hold big screen advantage plasma display televisions were the first type of flat panel tvs to become popular but now that they are starting to dominate the overall market plasma models are losing share to lcd or liquid crystal display technology and will soon only be able to compete in the market for the largest screens plasma models have long been cheaper to make than lcd tvs in larger screen sizes those bigger than inches but lcd tvs are getting cheaper to make in larger sizes because of efficiencies in new factories that produce the displays in addition many consumers favor the brightness of lcd tvs which are lit from behind by a series of fluorescent light bulbs the liquid crystal forms millions of small points that act as shutters in front of the light plasma tvs offer better color representation because each point on the screen is its own source of illumination and can go completely dark in the u s the worlds largest tv market lcd tvs outsold plasma models in the to inch range for the first time in the october december quarter of last year by the end of next year lcd models will outsell plasma in that size range on a global basis analysts say the change is significant for tv makers who bet heavily on plasma in the belief that the technology would continue to dominate the to inch range which is expected to account for of world wide unit tv sales by this past week lg electronics inc of south korea decided to close the oldest of its four factories where it makes the key screen component two pieces of glass that are sealed together filled with plasma gas and then equipped with chips to control how they are lit up for plasma tvs lg electronics which supplies the component to several other tv manufacturers as well as to its own factories posted a first quarter loss because of the cost of idle production in plasma screens pioneer corp and hitachi ltd both of japan earlier this year delayed plans for new plasma component factories funai electric co recently said it would stop making plasma tvs most tv manufacturers that make plasma tvs also make lcd models and some are also sizable makers of lcd components a huge business because those parts are also used in computers and cellphones the biggest trend in televisions is the disappearance of traditional tube based sets in a total annual market of about million tvs world wide sales of plasma tvs are expected to grow about to million units in from million units last year according to displaysearch a market research firm based in austin texas in that same market however lcd tv sales are expected to nearly triple to million in from million in larry weber former chief of the u s plasma research unit of japans matsushita electric industrial co the maker of panasonic products says the current upheaval in plasma component manufacturing is temporary as companies adjust factory capacity to the changing market "if you have an old plasma plant you cant decide to sell screens for cellphones " mr weber says "the only thing you can do is get rid of it " matsushita is the worlds leading builder of plasma screens and the top seller of plasma tvs and has continued to thrive despite the pressure in the plasma market the company posted an gain in operating profit for the fiscal year ended march and is currently finishing the construction of a sizable factory for plasma components and tvs but even matsushita has indicated that shipments of its lcd tvs a product it doesnt focus on as much will grow that compares with growth of slightly more than expected for its plasma sets under pressure in the to inch category plasma tv makers are already stepping up efforts to market inch and larger sizes where they still have a cost advantage plasma tvs will outsell lcd models by three to one in the inch and above category this year but that edge may not last long sales of inch and above televisions are expected to grow to more than million units in but plasma and lcd models will be neck and neck by then according to a forecast by isuppli a market research firm in el segundo calif during the next few months however big demand for lcds means prices arent likely to drop much something that may provide a short term respite for plasma tvs the price for lcd panels leveled off in april earlier than the normal seasonal pattern and a sign that lcd tv prices will be fairly steady for the rest of the year "plasma is now starting to create a price gap versus lcd " ross young president of displaysearch says
