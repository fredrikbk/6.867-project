the daily fix milan wins seventh cup final as liverpool magic falls short online edition two years ago in istanbul ac milan thoroughly dominated the first half of play in the champions league final against liverpool took a lead and then lost in stunning fashion last night in the rematch in athens milan was outplayed in the first half but took a lead then dominated the final minutes and won both goals were scored by filippo inzaghi who deflected a free kick with his shoulder which was inadvertent and therefore legal then outwitted liverpool goalkeeper pepe reina for what proved to be the clincher milans tentative opening and fluky first goal made for a second consecutive underwhelming champions league final both lost by an english club "milan good but hardly invincible were there for the taking kaka impressed as did inzaghi and massimo oddo but an unspectacular side won an unspectacular final " henry winter writes in the daily telegraph mr winter blames the liverpool manager for lack of ingenuity "during the post mortem examination rafa benitez must admit his own culpability this was death by lack of adventure " nonetheless mr inzaghi and milan veteran paolo maldini acquitted themselves well in securing the clubs seventh champions league victory richard williams writes in the guardian "in a moment of realism and generosity the ranks of liverpool applauded paolo maldini as he lifted the european cup last night for the fifth time at the end of his eighth final and at the age of " mr williams writes "this was a marvellous consecration for one of historys great footballers and it was wonderful to witness his opponents supporters rise above their disappointment " much of their disappointment centered on steven gerrard the liverpool captain who played hard but not always smart and misfired on many of his clubs best scoring opportunities times of london columnist simon barnes explains how mr gerrard belongs to a rare soccer genus and thus when he fails its a bigger letdown than with most of his peers "one man can still dominate a team in football but it is a much harder trick to pull off " mr barnes writes "you can find one in every game ever played in the american sports but it is a much rarer thing in football in football one man can never do everything but instead he can be everyone he can make every player on his team play with added power added purpose added courage he can in short inspire it is the greatest of the gifts given to all of the players we traditionally consider truly great pele maradona beckenbauer cruyff zidane but at club level no one has produced that ability more often and to such devastating effect as steven gerrard now two years after giving the performance of a lifetime he was out there trying to do it all over again " and yet the magic of istanbul failed to materialize "the world seemed to have turned against him to be saying youve worked your share of miracles now try a taste of being ordinary " this past offseason six penn state football players were charged with crimes stemming from a fight at a party four of the six were legally cleared while two still face criminal charges those players will be punished along with all of their teammates after each home game this fall theyll have to clean out seat beaver stadium which has been expanded from its prior capacity of a mere seats as cited originally and incorrectly by the fix the designated mass punishment by year old coach joe paterno is either a masterstroke a calculated political move or a sign of senility depending on which columnist youre partial to "in a coaching business so full of phonies who talk character only to bend the rules who consider the definition of discipline a players weight room attendance who wouldnt dare pull something like this because it might hurt recruiting heres joe pa four decades on the job and not giving a damn " dan wetzel writes on yahoo sports "except about whats right " centre daily times sports editor ron bracken says whats right is far from mr paternos top concerns here instead the coach is attempting to pre empt the schools office of judicial affairs which may find any punishment it metes out to be deemed overkill in the court of public opinion now that joepa has garnered publicity for his own remedy "what paterno does with his team is his business and if he decides to have them scrub out the urinals in the stadium with tooth brushes thats up to him " mr bracken writes "its the teams business but this appears to be designed to subvert judicial affairs and prevent them from performing the function theyre charged with in an effort to save his football team and the season if thats the case then its not nearly as noble as it appears on the surface " but philadelphia daily news columnist bill conlin says the stadium cleaning punishment shouldnt be team business mass punishment for individual players misdeeds smacks of military discipline and isnt appropriate for civilians "look joe if these kids were looking for group punishment maybe some of them would have joined the marines " mr conlin writes his devastating critique suggests that mr paterno could soon merit the nickname captain queeg two nba teams stuck in that uncomfortable no mans land of first round playoff losers neither a series win nor a lottery pick in the draft to show for last season are changing coaches the houston rockets who fell in seven games to the utah jazz despite having stars tracy mcgrady and yao ming are replacing jeff van gundy with rick adelman the veteran western conference coach is a good choice john p lopez writes in the houston chronicle but the disputed circumstances around mr van gundys departure and severe needs for better complementary pieces to the stars will make for a troubled offseason "the rockets were close to being a title contending team three weeks ago " mr lopez writes "if they cannot resolve a decades worth of bad front office decisions and bad contracts that is exactly where they still will be three years from now " mr mcgradys former team the orlando magic axed coach brian hill who performed exactly as could be expected david whitley writes in the orlando sentinel the magic apparently hoped "he might turn into a different kind of coach at age " in his second go around with the team mr whitley writes he adds "whoever the next coach is he should take a look at his predecessor hill worked hard believed in himself and pretty much lived up to his reputation in a lot of jobs that can get you promoted in pro sports it can get you fired " "in a game smeared with too many ugly headlines involving lawyers guns and bail money doesnt the league have worse things to worry about than if a player is using marijuana " thats the question posed by denver post columnist mark kiszla its a query that carries special weight for broncos fans now that their team has acquired a few players who have a history with pot its also relevant to fans of the miami dolphins because running back ricky williams may be suspended again for marijuana use "williams is seemingly just a harmless and hopeless pothead on the verge of being drug tested out of the league because nfl powers that be have declared marijuana to be evil " mike bianchi writes in the orlando sentinel "i can just hear the nfl muckety mucks now as they sit at the big mahogany bar at the owners meeting ordering single malt scotches and vodka martinis and lamenting to each other why in the world does ricky williams need marijuana to get through the day " eighth grader jake floyd is the general manager of the ash fork ariz miners who play in baseballs desert cactus independent league and hes hustled baseball executives five times his age now hes close to signing sidd finch mr floyd may be too good to be true but jason gays profile of him in gq is still worth a read as is nbcsports coms john walters explanation of how the story came about
