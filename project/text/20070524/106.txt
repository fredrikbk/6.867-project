vodafones name for handsets its own company challenges cellphone makers with new low cost brand cereal and cellphones may have little in common but wireless service provider vodafone group plc has been cruising the supermarket aisle for inspiration the worlds largest cellphone service provider by revenue is rolling out lines of vodafone branded handsets akin to supermarkets stocking their own store brand products alongside established brands with this push it is pitting itself against its traditional suppliers handset giants such as nokia corp and motorola inc behind the move is vodafones desire to drive more people to use its services both high speed data services in established markets as well as more basic calling and text messaging services in emerging regions in some cases the handsets may be packaged with vodafones or a partners service this week vodafone unveiled two very low cost handsets aimed primarily at customers in emerging markets such as africa the move follows a launch last year in europe of a handset that works with high speed wireless networks known as g which cost about less than customers could expect to pay for a similar phone from larger handset makers in both cases the handsets are being made by asian manufacturers vodafone doesnt expect to displace established players such as nokia which has a globally recognized brand and sells more than one in every three mobile phones sold around the world but it does hope to fill gaps in the market by using its purchasing muscle to offer affordable phones more important however it hopes to force the established players to react by lowering prices on their own phones "our main intention is to stir up the market " says jens schulte bockum head of vodafones handset strategy mr schulte bockum a former management consultant says he looks to the supermarket model where store label goods such as cereals can account for as much as or of sales established handset makers "continue to extract a premium for their brand " he says "thats fine but thats not aligned with our interests as an operator " while carriers in japan long have branded their own phones it is only in the past few years that some of their western european and u s counterparts have shown interest western operators typically have experimented with higher end gadgets mostly aimed at business customers vodafone has had some initial success with the lower priced models since launching its own line of g phones in september it has sold about of the clamshell shaped handsets in europe made by chinas huawei technologies co the phone is customized to give users easier access to services sold via vodafones wireless portal including a button that takes customers straight to vodafones music services the company now plans to roll out more models in coming months including slider and candy bar styles it also has prompted a reaction from vodafones traditional suppliers mr schulte bockum says he gets some barbs on the initiative during meetings handset makers also have been dropping their prices on g phones mr schulte bockum says much of that is due to a general improvement in g sales which helps economies of scale but he also believes vodafones initiative has had an impact the big handset makers for instance have been trying to intercept vodafones moves by coming out with competing offers and specials on phones they plan to discontinue vodafones latest handsets are designed to undercut the largest handset makers by being priced at retail for as little as &# currently the cheapest phones available in emerging market regions like africa where service providers dont typically subsidize handsets cost about &# the most basic model the vodafone that was launched on monday is a candy bar shaped phone with a black and white screen the company also launched the vodafone that features a color screen and slightly more contemporary design both models made by chinas zte corp are designed for basic calling and text messaging but they dont support multimedia features such as music downloading or watching television the two models are being rolled out across about markets including egypt south africa and romania the phones also will be launched in india where vodafone recently acquired a controlling stake in operator hutchison essar ltd for &# billion vodafone expects the phones to be sold predominantly to customers who buy pre paid services which accounts for the vast majority of cellphone users in emerging markets as opposed to paying a monthly subscription fee vodafone also is working on a slightly more design focused model produced by sagem a unit of frances safran sa in conjunction with ningo bird co of china the united kingdom operator hopes it will also appeal to price sensitive customers in other markets such as southern europe the company says it doesnt expect to launch its vodafone branded handsets in the u s where it owns of verizon wireless the rest is owned by verizon communications inc mr schulte bockum says he doesnt have specific sales targets but that across vodafones emerging market operations it adds about two or three million customers a month if vodafone sells its own branded handsets to or of those new customers "theres a huge market " he says and with the cost of chips used to make mobile phones falling he expects handset prices to drop to as low as about &# over the next couple of years vodafone nevertheless faces tough hurdles with its strategy including building retail channels and customer support networks in far flung markets as well as understanding what consumers want from their phones things the largest handset makers have invested enormous amounts of money and time in says mr schulte bockum "we are learning as we go along "
