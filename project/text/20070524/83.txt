recent elections cause u s europe cold war to thaw a bit david b rivkin jr and lee a casey write "little cold war " editorial page may that the fate of paul wolfowitz at the world bank reveals "a new kind of cold war this time between america and europes ruling elites " whoa that there is hostility toward the united states among the leaders of the european left is not news that was obvious long long before the iraq war what is new is that european electorates after rewarding anti american views in the past decade now elect governments whose leaders speak favorably of the u s mr wolfowitz found himself in a conflict he tried and failed to avoid maybe he was mousetrapped but the pettiness of world bank politics does not speak to a new transatlantic cold war andrew hamilton washington messrs rivkin and casey provide an accurate portrayal on the relationship between the u s and our european allies as it now exists through international institutions such as the world bank and the u n european and other countries can have their say about the u s especially in the waning years of the bush administration i for one would seek a "qualified" european candidate to head the world bank and then keep a close watch on its somewhat dubious operations what i found totally out of step was the suggestion that donald rumsfeld be considered for the world bank presidency does the u s suffer from such a dearth of talent that the name of rumsfeld would re emerge william meehan vienna austria whats wrong with this picture european proponents of an ideology that is guaranteed to cause poverty throwing away american money and pretending that they are alleviating poverty the pefidy of the european left completely vindicates the jacksonian belief that europe is ruled by a decadent elite a situation that hasnt changed since the birth of our republic the europeans putsch against mr wolfowitz is a metaphorical reprise of the british officer whipping the young andrew jackson for acting like a prisoner of war instead of his servant from this jackson learned what europeans are truly like and how americans should deal with them which jackson did just downstream from new orleans in the arrogant british commander confused jacksons army of southerners with the effete easterners who allowed washington to be burned and wound up going home in a coffin old hickory would take a dim view of the european scam known as the world bank in claiming that this is a dispute between the american and european elites messrs rivkin and casey are implicitly recognizing that the american left shares the views of its ideological brothers in europe william woodford little rock ark
