why japan hasnt joined the global celebration moderate economic growth after recent strong expansion results in modest gains tokyo japans economy and corporations are enjoying the most stable period of growth they have had for decades so why is tokyos stock market performing so poorly compared with others since the beginning of this year the nikkei stock average of companies which rose or points to yesterday is up less than compared with nearly for the dow jones industrial average most other stock markets also are doing better than tokyo the dax index in germany is up the shanghai composite index has shot up tokyos plodding performance is puzzling because the factors that hammered the worlds second largest equity market during japans years of downturn which started in the early s and carried on until have all but disappeared general land prices had fallen for years eroding wealth for corporations and homeowners but those prices rose last year the economy has had annual growth of between and in the past four fiscal years and is expected to post similar gains this year and next slightly stronger than growth in the euro zone corporate profits the indicator most directly linked to corporations stock prices likely grew for the sixth straight year in the months that ended march despite all this japan doesnt look like the kind of place investors would go in hopes of big returns one reason is that after two decades of spectacular expansion and a long slump japans economy appears unlikely to produce the kinds of happy or unhappy surprises that can dramatically alter share prices from it became clear that japan had fixed its worst economic problems that caused a radical reassessment of the economy and its potential and investors poured money into japanese stocks the nikkei rose from the start of to the end of during the same period the dow jones industrials rose while the shanghai composite fell at present however economists dont see potential for japans gross domestic product to grow significantly faster than the current annual rate of about as the economy is mature and the population is declining nor do they expect japan to fall into problems inflation is low with consumer prices rising or falling by tiny amounts for the past six months or so this means that the central bank wont need to raise interest rates soon its short term rate target is just which creates an environment in which businesses and consumers can borrow money cheaply the result is a lack of major trends that can boost overall stock prices "people are not used to it being so steady " says richard jerram economist at macquarie securities in tokyo that he says makes it "hard to value the market " and while the shares generally used to all move one way "now its more nuanced " he says another reason for investors disenchantment with tokyo is a relative lack of action in mergers and acquisitions that affects the stock market because corporate deals and even just expectations of deals help move the stocks of the companies concerned and others seen as ripe for purchase first acquirers normally pay a premium for the target company second an active m&amp a environment tends to drive corporate managers to improve earnings in order to make their companies more expensive to take over in fact japanese m&amp a activity has been trending upward in recent years with a record number of deals in followed by nearly as many in in the latest sign of activity as corporations seek to gain economies of scale and adjust to domestic markets with limited growth potential optical instruments maker hoya corp said it would likely made a tender offer for pentax corp which makes digital cameras and optical equipment but overall the action in japan remains small compared with that in other big economies in the value of japanese m&amp a was equivalent to of the countrys gross domestic product the widest measure of economic activity in the u s that year it was equivalent to of gdp and in the u k in japan defensive strategies such as poison pills are common such strategies often involve issuing new shares to existing shareholders making it expensive for a hostile buyer to acquire a company last years biggest m&amp a story in japan was a saga involving two paper companies oji paper launched a hostile takeover bid for a smaller rival but the rival sold discounted shares to a friendly trading company and fended off the proposed deal "its difficult to take over japanese companies and run them " says john vail strategist at nikko am an asset management firm the market environment in japan "is not as aggressive as it is elsewhere " the result he says is that "its slow here and moneys not chasing slow actors " asian european markets advance to
