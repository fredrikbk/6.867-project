the call goes out from vermont impeach in regard to john mcclaughrys may commentary "cross country democrats against impeachment" about the vermont impeachment movement after undercounting my towns population by a factor of three mr mcclaughry claims that my impeachment resolution for newfanes town meeting in was the start of a master plan to storm vermont town meetings with resolutions in actually my action in was born in anguish and expectant of nothing more than local notice what occurred instead was a massive wave of media and citizen interest that compelled me forward from that day to this when thousands of vermonters and tens of thousands of other americans are coming realize that impeachment is the remedy this country needs mr mcclaughry refers to the "hyperactive impeachment left " but we are a conservative movement while the bush administrations attempts to change the constitutional balance of powers by establishing a unitary executive branch of government is radical following the proscribed constitutional remedy for such a breach impeachment is an act of conservation to declare himself to be above the law as the president has done in his signing statements is both radical and unconstitutional calling on congress to investigate these actions is an act of conservatism to expect our representatives to honor their oaths of office to defend and uphold the constitution is an act of citizenship neither left nor right mr mcclaughry says there were citizens at the statehouse but more than r egistered their attendance that day he calls impeachment a metaphor for outrage focusing on some of the emotional arguments that were made by vermonters for impeachment but ignored the majority of the arguments heard that day that focused on constitutional and legal reasons why impeachment is needed he praised the confused democrats who condemned the bush administrations actions but who are not willing to do anything about them but neglected to mention the political maneuvering of the congressional democratic party leadership who have decided to ignore hard facts that would force them to take action to defend the constitution instead these democrats have made a crass political calculation to let the president stew in the disaster that he has had simmering for six years the thousands of lives to be lost in the next year and a half of unchecked war as well as the tattered constitution that will have suffered under the bush administration for eight years are apparently collateral damage to be sacrificed for the greater good sure to come about when the democrats regain the white house as mr mcclaughry hopes vermonters who favor impeachment are certainly appreciative that democracy still flourishes in our state what we also realize is that it is citizen action movements just like ours that make it healthy adaptable and useful we take our roles as citizens in defense of the constitution very seriously we will expect no less of our representatives both in vermont and in washington d c the impeachment debate is not over by a long shot twenty massachusetts towns are considering impeachment resolutions this month at town meetings more than citizens in maine have signed an impeachment resolution to be presented to their state legislature across the country americans are taking up the call that we have been issuing in vermont our politicians and professional pundits dont know it yet but americans will not be fooled all of the time dan dewalt south newfane vt
