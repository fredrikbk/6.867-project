job markets strength may have been overstated as the nations economic growth has slowed over the past year the labor market has remained robust and the jobless rate is hovering near a six year low but some economists believe the true employment picture may be less rosy amid new signs official data may have overstated job growth those signs are particularly stark in the home building industry which has been hurt by the slump in the housing market housing starts in april fell from their recent peak in january yet the number of residential construction jobs has dropped by only about over the same period economists cite several possible explanations for the disparity one is that layoffs have lagged behind the housing slump and will weaken further in addition some economists say the monthly figures from the labor departments bureau of labor statistics may be overestimating employment perhaps by misclassifying construction workers or by failing to count large numbers of laid off illegal immigrants the bureau releases two monthly employment figures the unemployment rate which is based on a household survey and a tally of nonfarm payrolls based on a survey of employers both are conducted through sampling and depend on voluntary responses a lesser known employment snapshot based on a quarterly census of state unemployment insurance records shows the economy created about private sector jobs in the third quarter of the most recent data available that contrasts with the indicated in the monthly figures for that period it also shows the number of construction jobs dropped by in contrast with the increase of jobs shown in the monthly surveys the data suggest that "maybe the labor market behaved a little more like we thought it should in times of a slowing economy " said michael feroli an economist at j p morgan chase &amp co mr feroli cautions against drawing conclusions if employment fell as sharply as the quarterly numbers indicate it should have been picked up by the separate household survey he said instead that survey also showed falling unemployment and strong job growth moreover the recent strength in the monthly numbers is generally supported by other labor market indicators "theres a lot of potential answers and partial solutions" to the riddle mr feroli said "with each one of these stories you fix one hole but you spring another leak somewhere else " the quarterly and monthly surveys tend to follow similar long term trends the household survey polls households while the monthly business survey includes about establishments employing a third of the nations work force the quarterly census covers of the civilian work force after excluding farm workers and the self employed though released with an eight month lag it is "a more thorough accounting of the economy " said bureau of labor statistics economist david talan one possible flaw in the monthly data is that many construction workers still counted as working on homes may have shifted to the commercial construction market there has been "a massive divergence between the movement in residential construction and private nonresidential" construction said david seiders chief economist at the national association of home builders the bureau said about of residential construction jobs are "specialty trades " such as painters electricians and drywall specialists who can take their skills to offices and other commercial buildings when demand in that sector is higher edward zaucha chairman of the finishing contractors association a trade group whose members employ union workers said commercial projects have "had some shortages" of labor recently his company apg international in glassboro n j which specializes in glass work "has the strongest backlog weve had in our history" and is training residential construction workers to switch sides he said while commercial construction has risen it isnt enough to make up the difference some economists said employment could be overstated because the bureau isnt registering job losses by illegal immigrants who are frequently employed in the building trades that wouldnt necessarily affect the monthly and quarterly payroll count economists said illegal immigrants using fake or stolen documents "look like any other normal employee and theyd be reported that way as well " said dawn mclaren an economist studying immigration at arizona state university still job losses by illegal workers could explain why the unemployment rate has continued to fall such workers might be less likely to tell surveyors that they are working or that they have lost their job but there are problems with that explanation too if illegal workers or their employers sought to evade employment surveys they probably would have done so when the sector was booming as well as on the way down during the housing expansion however employment rose fast enough that legal workers alone probably couldnt have accounted for the increase
