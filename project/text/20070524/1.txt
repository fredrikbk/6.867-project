a future for newspapers new technology is mucking up the media and newspapers seem to be taking the brunt of it craigslist and ebay took away classified ad sales direct advertisers are allocating budgets to search engines and circulation is receding faster than bruce williss hairline investors seem to prefer the safety of television broadcasters and cable companies with their nice government mandated franchises and pipes that reach directly into homes media after all is about owning a pipe some conduit between the creation of news or entertainment and the eyeballs that consume it media companies sell the owners of those eyeballs lots of things we werent even sure we needed the higher the ad rates the better the business the pipe reaches the consumer directly keeping competition at bay the tighter the pipe the less the competition for broadcasters the pipe is spectrum given or bought from the federal communications commission under the guise that spectrum is scarce for cable operators it is often the sole cable franchise in a town for phone companies its those regulated copper wires some of which are so old they have alexander graham bells teeth marks in the insulation and newspapers wheres the pipe what conduit to readers do they control well there is the guy that drives up and somehow misses your driveway every morning or the sidewalk newspaper dispenser where the homeless man buys one copy and steals the rest so he can peddle them on street corners so unless you are the only paper in town ask warren buffett how much he makes on monopoly papers like the buffalo news there is not much of a pipe to control instead reputation quality news gathering trust and credibility maintain the franchise something the wall street journal and the new york times enjoy on a national level and the washington post and others have locally but so what its all over right the internet has destroyed newspapers business model if google news doesnt kill them blogs certainly will hmm maybe not so fast last i checked the star trek holodeck despite a wikipedia entry is still fiction no one is teleporting a newspaper to your home anytime soon unlike music which can be copied once and stolen a million times newspapers live in the material world thankfully as an author its the same for books even a inch screen cant match the readability of what cheaply spits out of a printing press i really believe that the copy protection mechanism for newspapers is their consumer interface in the form of ink spurted on newsprint newspapers are scrambling to embrace the web paid subscriptions blogs its all a grand experiment on how to monetize their expensive news gathering organization but thanks to a form thats hard to duplicate newspapers still have time in the meantime rather than just charge for content id be licensing every type of newfangled software and web service until i could come up with a tight community of interest around my newspaper local or national dont just start the discussion keep it this means comments reviews personalized newsfeeds social networks of like minded readers whatever give advertisers a little "link love" so they dont stray to generic search engines google microsoft and others dropped over &# billion to buy online ad delivery companies in the last few weeks alone the value is there newspapers arent in the printing business theyre in the ad business technology is making things even more difficult for television and video as well as technology advances broadcast pipes leak like a sieve tv these days like it or not is like music the good news is that its delivered electronically the bad news is that its well delivered electronically six megabit broadband and gigabyte hard drives are wresting control from those who think they have it broadcast is about central control pumping out signals from giant antennas in the middle of town or from cable "head ends " the internet is about moving packets around from hop to hop until it gets where it needs to go no central control the real dark cloud is technology known as peer to peer pp bubbling up from the underground that leverages this architecture heres how it works i might have a copy of this weeks "american idol" on my hard drive you want a copy you stream it from my pc not fox then you share it with five or six people that are close to you geographically so it gets to them quickly they share as well and on and on live video streams like a virus which means once started you cant stop it cable may be the first to get flushed the industry pays bribes in the form of franchise fees to local municipalities to be the only game in town telcos like verizon and at&amp t have lobbied hard to change video franchising rules verizon has had some success in texas and on march the california public utilities commission streamlined the rules to open up video distribution to competition new services like verizons fios fiber to the home may finally become a reality another pipe in town add to that the proliferation of municipal wi fi rollouts and other entrants like craig mccaws clearwire price war anyone the fact that comcast and timewarner are carrying more debt than a condo owning subprime borrower means this could get ugly in a hurry but what about guys who own networks and create shows are they safe well if they decide to harness technology they can license channels like espn and or shows like "greys anatomy" to all comers on the distribution side but this is easier said than done network affiliates still think in p m time slots and cable operators insist on exclusives pp the same stuff skype uses to bypass the old phone network may change the definition of a tv network bittorrent and edonkey are the top pp networks and half the usage is for tv shows pp hogs something like or more of all internet traffic thirty five percent but to replace cable it has to be real time and there are tons of real time pp players especially out of china tvu sopcast ppmate as i write this im watching espn on my pc denying disney another outrageous &# per month they charge me via comcast just as the ipod opened up stolen music to the masses devices like apple tv means i can stream to my wide screen is this napster redux it might well be tv is no longer the safe cuddly business it once was lots of painful restructuring is still ahead but its worth noting that rupert murdoch would bid to expand his newspaper empire perhaps he sees the same pipe busting in the future of tv mr kessler is the author of "the end of medicine" harpercollins
