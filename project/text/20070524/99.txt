the evening wrap kicking iraq down the road online edition congress is on the cusp of passing a war funding bill after months of brawling over timelines for withdrawal from iraq but if the measures approval marks the end of one fight it also sets the ground for another come the fall president bush fielding questions on a range of issues at a news conference in the white house rose garden said that he supports congresss latest attempt at a bill funding the wars in iraq and afghanistan the president vetoed a previous effort that bankrolled combat operations while imposing a timetable for the exit of u s troops from iraq democrats returned to power last fall promising voters that they would hold the president to account on iraq but after months of seeking a way to keep a withdrawal provision in the supplemental spending bill party leaders threw up their hands this week and decided to deliver a bill that funds u s military involvement without demanding its imminent conclusion the measure is widely predicted to pass both houses of congress early this evening though the votes of a number of leading democrats including some prominent presidential candidates remained uncertain congressional leaders conducted a number of test votes to make sure the measure would have the support it needed including a vote to advance the measure mr bush signaled that he plans to sign the legislation when it arrives on his desk "by voting for this bill members of both parties can show our troops and the iraqis and the enemy that our country will support our servicemen and women in harms way " mr bush said lawmakers from both parties could well be pinching their nostrils as they vote however republicans are relieved to finally have legislation that will keep the nozzle open for the pentagon but many were dismayed that the bill included a laundry list of domestic spending initiatives and while there were democrats like sen joe biden who said "as long as we have troops in the front line were going to have to protect them " others couldnt hide their irritation at being forced to drop the withdrawal language rep david obey chairman of the house appropriations panel said "i hate this agreement" but that it was the best lawmakers could do since "the white house is in a cloud somewhere" concerning the conditions in iraq senate majority leader harry reid pleaded with the democrats to get on board "i hope the bill is in a position where we can fund the troops without a lot of animosity at this stage " he said "people can make whatever statements they want in regard to the war but i think that we need to get to this as quickly as we can " the bill funds military operations through the fiscal year which wraps up at the end of september september will likely prove to be a pivotal month for the conflicts both in iraq and on capitol hill democrats agreed not to block todays debate on the legislation so long as the house votes later this year on a separate withdrawal proposal gen david petraeus is scheduled to report to washington in september on the progress of the troop buildup in baghdad and other restive areas and offer his recommendations on how to proceed the president said he expects iraqi insurgents as well as al qaeda to step up their violent campaigns this summer in an attempt to influence the debate "it could be bloody it could be a very difficult august " mr bush told reporters as mr bush and congress tried to keep their spending bill on track iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki was taking steps to keep his government on track naming six cabinet ministers to replace a group who had earlier departed at the urging of radical shiite cleric muqtada al sadr but mr maliki must wait to get his new slate approved in a symptom of just how fitful progress is in iraq there werent enough lawmakers on hand today to vote on the nominees a vote is expected sunday stocks turn lower stocks experienced a sharp jump after aprils new home sales

attributable to a change in the mix of homes finding buyers robust demand for pricier properties helped drive the long real estate boom but lately builders seem to be having an easier time luring
