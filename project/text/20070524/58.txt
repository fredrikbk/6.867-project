key dow jones holder cites opposition to murdoch bid an influential member of the family that controls dow jones &amp co said he opposes selling the company to rupert murdochs news corp for fear such a step would endanger the wall street journals independence "why would i risk that " said christopher bancroft who also is a dow jones director in his first public comments about news corp s &# billion bid "im open to any situation that benefits the wall street journal and dow jones and its shareholders at the moment i dont see anything that would do that " his remarks come as the family which controls of the voting shares of dow jones continues to ponder the offer made in april amid signs of growing tension within the far flung clan family members met yesterday in boston partly at the behest of one branch of the family the hills who felt the family needed to discuss its options said people familiar with the matter but several key members of the family didnt attend including mr bancroft neither did william cox jr nor any of his four children who together represent another important branch of the family that controls about of the familys total class b shares mr cox also has said he opposes the news corp offer in an interview mr bancroft said he has a strong emotional connection to the paper feels personally responsible to the staff and didnt want to "pull the rug out" on them he said he recently sent replies to letters sent to him by journal reporters some of which left him emotionally moved he said the comments by mr bancroft a dallas area businessman are significant because of his position both as a trustee of the familys fortune and as one of dow joness directors he and his two siblings control about one third of the bancroft clans stake in dow jones he has been regarded by some in the news corp camp as a potential swing vote who could steer the family in its favor after the news corp bid became public early this month dow jones issued a statement saying it had been informed that votes representing of the total voting shares of the company had rejected the bid most family members and especially those who control the trusts which possess the bulk of the voting shares have remained united in their opposition to news corp and its chairman like mr bancroft they fear he will diminish the papers quality and feel the family has a responsibility to maintain the companys traditions say people close to the matter but mr murdochs bid has prompted the family to focus on what dow joness future might be as a stand alone entity without a deep pocketed partner so the idea of taking some form of action such as seeking a third party investor is gaining momentum while some bancrofts especially younger ones are open to exploring other alternatives the family is far from reaching a consensus on what course to take according to people familiar with the matter the question of whether dow jones has enough scale to survive as an independent company is fueled by recent upheaval in the news and financial information industries in particular the planned &# billion merger of reuters group plc and thomson corp among those worrying about these matters are some who have told relatives they staunchly oppose mr murdochs offer say people close to the situation but the size of mr murdochs bid which at &# a share carries a hefty premium over dow joness stock price before the proposed deal became public and his ability to increase it further could make finding another buyer or investor difficult dow jones shares yesterday were up &# or to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange indeed news corp s offer has laid bare old fault lines within the family over its stewardship of the company and the sweeping decision making power wielded by trustees of the family fortune one family member described the offer as a "huge eye opener" that has "forced people to look at reality " the bancrofts who now number about three dozen adults have controlled dow jones for generations in addition to the wall street journal the nations no newspaper by circulation after usa today dow jones publishes barrons and operates dow jones newswires like some other newspaper companies including new york times co dow jones has a two tier share class structure that gives the family control several members have complained that the familys initial rejection of mr murdochs offer was made over their heads the family as a whole wasnt canvassed for that vote and some werent notified at all of the offer under the terms of the trusts that govern the familys holdings the bancrofts voting power in dow jones is concentrated in the hands of outside trustees each of the main trusts has three trustees two outside trustees and a third from within the family to determine the familys position on mr murdochs offer lawyers from the boston firm hemenway &amp barnes which oversees the trusts polled only the trustees and individual family members who have direct ownership of dow jones class b shares it didnt consult with all of the trusts beneficiaries and wasnt obligated to some family members feel hemenway &amp barnes is conflicted because of its various roles in managing the familys holdings say people close to the matter besides managing the familys trusts and acting as trustees a representative of the firm michael elefante sits on dow joness board there he is compelled to represent the interests of all dow jones shareholders and not only the interests of the family mr elefante couldnt be reached to comment critics within the family also complain that the trustees have refused to consider pushing for a reduced dividend to allow management to invest more in the companys operations in recent years dow jones has used nearly all its net income to fund its annual dividend which last year totaled about &# million the familys share goes primarily to the older generation of bancrofts their children who one day will inherit the principal in the trusts arent entitled to the annual income a fact that has been a sore point for some in the family in the view of some of the younger bancrofts the trusts have intentionally stifled debate and tried to keep them from engaging dow jones directors independent directors signaled at a recent board meeting that they would be willing to meet with the family to discuss the news corp bid and other issues according to people familiar with the matter but that message was never relayed some family members say susan pulliam and sarah ellison contributed to this article
