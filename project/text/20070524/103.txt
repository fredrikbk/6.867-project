the smarts of the irish dublin when irish voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to the dail or national assembly theyll face no stark left right choices on economic and social issues as the french did earlier this month nor did the campaign produce bitter fights over foreign policy or immigration which loom large for americans nope on the emerald isle the election is about which party can best manage a year boom the campaign in which prime minister bertie aherns fianna fail party seeks a third straight five year mandate over rival centrist party fine gael has been most remarkable for what the contestants dont bother to talk about the countrys low tax rates particularly the levy on corporations sacrosanct the influx of immigrants from africa and eastern europe necessary to keep the construction and service industries thriving the demographic timebomb ticking away elsewhere is no sweat for one of europes youngest populations and speaking of europe even the bugbears that haunt other eu members such as the possible revival of the failed constitutional treaty are nonstarters here "it doesnt make for a very interesting election " concedes christopher farrington a political scientist at university college dublin other countries should be so dull the steady as she goes irish consensus owes largely to the spectacular growth experienced by the celtic tiger since a recession in when one in six irishmen was out of work and the country was almost bankrupt irelands economy has nearly quadrupled in size gdp growth has averaged more than a year over the past years spurred in large part by the governments tax slashing unemployment has plummeted down to last year once one of the poorest countries in europe ireland today has a per capita gdp second only to luxembourg on issues where fine gael and its would be coalition partner labour have tried to distinguish themselves from fianna fail they havent managed to create much daylight "what we want to do here is protect our economy " fine gael leader enda kenny told me by telephone while campaigning in the south of the island "but also translate the benefits of that to quality public services for people " yet when it comes to such proposals as adding hospital beds nurses and policemen and continuing to chip away at personal income tax rates the rival camps sound rather similar and as fine gael and labour try to present themselves as better stewards of irelands success they have to fight the belief among many voters that they were to blame for the countrys economic woes in the s it also doesnt help the opposition that mr ahern remains widely popular receiving a recent boost from the unlikely power sharing deal struck in northern ireland fianna fail has played up the taoiseachs leadership credentials airing a commercial in which bill clinton and tony blair praise his work in securing peace up north if his party wins another term a poll released monday showed of voters support fianna fail putting it four points ahead of fine gael and labour he would become europes second longest serving premier behind luxembourgs jean claude juncker its all enough to make irish voters think twice about scratching a year itch and voting for change just for changes sake "on one hand weve had a successful government in place for years and people are feeling some fatigue " says john dunne head of the pro business group chambers ireland "on the other hand weve had a successful government in place for years do you really want to rock the boat " the conventional wisdom is that the policy consensus will hold up as long as the economy keeps growing while some economists say ireland can sustain annual growth well into the future pat mcardle is less sanguine mr mcardle chief economist at ulster bank says the country will likely see a decline in construction sooner than later new housing stock has grown fourfold in the past decade he says but in the medium term the number of new houses begun each year could fall by as much as one third export growth could offset some of that loss as consumption in other euro zone countries picks up but not all of it "i see us getting into more troubled waters " mr mcardle says he quickly adds however that even during this "slowdown" growth would probably fall "not much below " still roughly twice the eu average "if we dont grow " a year " he jokes "people think its a recession " mr dunne of chambers ireland thinks prosperity might eventually become a threat to pro growth low tax policies while "the underlying consensus is staggering " he says "its harder to sustain consensus in times of extreme wealth because everyone says they want a bigger piece of this or that at least if youre staring into the abyss its easier to get people to take a step back " but for now irish voters seem content with where they are and thankfully wise to the policies that got them there mr wingfield is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal europe
