the afternoon report potemkin sales online edition the government delivered what seemed to be a major dose of good news for the beleaguered housing sector this morning but some economists say that the gleaming sales data are a fancy facade obscuring a still weak market sales of new homes in the u s surged last month the biggest climb in years in a report that offered at last some hope for the long suffering housing market some economists looked askance at the head spinning jump in the sales number and were quick to point out that one month of big gains does not a trend make still there were reasons for optimism even as statistical noise drowned out the fundamentals thanks to the massive increase in demand the supply of homes on the market dipped to months worth from months in march despite the fact that the actual number of new homes for sale dropped just construction firms have been struggling to get inventories better in line with demand with mixed results luxury builder toll brothers which posted a plunge in earnings this morning reported that its inventories decreased on a sequential basis but were still higher than at the same time a year ago this is at a time analysts at credit suisse pointed out in a note that toll has fewer lots under its control than it did one year ago steven wood of insight economics believes that construction will need to slow even more in order to bring the vast inventory of unsold homes under control with so many homes crowding the market other data in the commerce department report suggest that sellers are increasingly willing to accept a lower price for their property and be done with it indeed the national median price plummeted more than &# to &# in april average selling prices also took a big hit skittering down to &# from marchs &# economists remarked that at least part of that decline is attributable to the change in the mix of homes finding buyers robust demand for pricier properties had helped drive the long real estate boom but lately builders appear to be having an easier time attracting buyers to lower priced homes lehman brothers economist drew matus said the large swoon in prices "likely reflects the sharp increase in the low cost southern housing market " where demand for new homes soared last month but most broadly the fall is a symptom of how construction companies are coping with the lean market "the big price decline implies that builders are slashing prices to move the huge overhang of unsold inventory " said barry ritholtz of ritholtz research &amp analytics economists at nomura securities international wrote that builders will need to maintain "aggressive pricing strategies and lower production levels to shed these inventories " meaning that nobody should look for the housing market to begin acting like an engine of growth anytime soon but there could be more hope for another much maligned sector the nations factories a separate report today showed that orders for durable goods crept higher by last month and that investment by businesses climbed many economists had started to worry that tepid spending by firms might turn out to be a sizable hurdle for growth indeed in a wsj com survey in april economists said that weakness in business spending had supplanted the housing market as their biggest economic worry but today stephen stanley of rbs greenwich capital wrote "the stage has been set for a solid advance in business investment" during the second quarter that might move the continuing retrenchment in housing back to the top of the watch list
