ahead of the tape housing data when a sale isnt a sale the bulls new rallying cry on new home sales theyre not as bad as they look but thats only because they were much worse than they looked before economists estimate the government will report today that builders sold new homes at an annual rate of units in april virtually unchanged from march that suggests the dismal scientists have little idea which way the report will go new home sales data are so volatile and subject to such massive revisions that forecasting month to month changes is a mugs game still the direction is clear since topping out in july sales have fallen the drop might actually have been even steeper new home sales are based on contracts sellers have accepted rather than sales that have closed if sales are canceled the government doesnt alter its figures likewise when canceled sales find new buyers those sales dont count last year cancellations soared which meant builders were selling fewer homes than government statistics suggested ubs economists point out that cancellations have fallen lately the upshot is that the new home sales figures understated how weak things were last year and are probably overstating how much weaker they got this year that raises the possibility of stability and recovery but trying to figure out when the housing market will start to improve may be as futile as coming up with a good estimate for new home sales toll brothers which reports results today has warned that housing continues to weaken it said it wouldnt meet expectations that it had set less than three months earlier if the builders dont see the bottom yet why should wall street ethanol fuels the price of meat as well as corn grillers will have to dig deep into their pockets this summer for backyard barbecue thank ethanol feed costs buoyed by ethanols impact on corn prices have caused meat prices to rise the price of grill staple beef is up from a year ago according to the labor department poultry is up higher meat prices are likely to affect todays earnings report by hormel foods corp which sells products such as dinty moore beef stew little sizzlers pork sausage and the tried and true spam analysts surveyed by thomson financial expect the company to register a year on year increase in earnings per share excluding one time items first quarter earnings took a hit because corn prices pushed up costs at its jennie o turkey store unit hormel estimates that every cent increase in the price of corn costs &# million this matters to more than just hormel shareholders because meat producers are passing on the costs a potential sign of inflation hormel has boosted the price of many of its products by about other meat producers are also marking up their goods smithfield foods inc estimates that high grain expenses could cost it &# million a year and says it is lifting prices to offset rising costs tyson foods inc said grain expenses were up &# million in its latest quarter from a year earlier one reason why its beef prices were higher like spam its all hard to swallow scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
