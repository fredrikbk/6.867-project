canadian dollars us&# billion intensifying a three week bidding war the offer at c&# us&# a share was higher than the most recent offer from xstrata plc which lionores board recommended to

exciting pipeline of growth projects " said its general director denis morozov "were reviewing the revised offer from norilsk and will be making a formal announcement in due course " lionore spokeswoman alex buck said if lionore deems the norilsk bid superior xstrata has five working days to match it xstrata spokeswoman claire divver said the deal between lionore and xstrata based in switzerland includes a c&# million breakup fee lionore shares rose to c&# in toronto stock exchange trading indicating some investors hope for a higher bid norilsk shares fell to rubles us&# in moscow while xstrata shares rose to gbp us&# in london lionore is the worlds th largest producer of nickel the price of which has soared in recent years nickel is used to make stainless steel which has applications ranging from industrial uses to high end kitchen appliances lionore also sells copper gold and other minerals and owns mines in south africa botswana and australia russian companies are adding urgency to the global race to secure metals oil and other raw materials amid a three year commodity boom norilsk and its russian peers which in many cases have access to cheap and abundant energy and ore at home are flush with cash from high prices and eager to increase their global footprint but some analysts question if prices for many minerals will remain high enough to justify the recent flurry of multibillion dollar mining deals in march russias oao rusal and sual group merged with switzerlands glencore international ag creating united company rusal which aims to rival alcoa inc as the worlds largest aluminum producer by output steelmaker evraz group sa recently snapped up oregon steel mills inc for &# billion not all deals pan out russian steelmaker oao severstal was thwarted in its efforts to buy arcelor sa of luxembourg which eventually was bought by mittal steel co still severstal has made headway elsewhere joining a group of investors building an &# million mill in mississippi to make high grade steel for auto makers and in buying a steel plant in michigan from rouge industries inc the moves come amid concern over the kremlins tightening grip over russias natural resources speculation has swirled that moscow could move to take a greater role in norilsk but billionaires vladimir potanin and mikhail prokhorov who control the company appear to be in the kremlins good graces norilsk which trades publicly is widely held by foreign investors and has a market capitalization of about &# billion norilsk based on giant arctic nickel mines developed under soviet dictator josef stalin was an early participant in westward expansion it agreed in to acquire a majority stake in stillwater mining co of columbus mont in a deal valued at &# million in norilsk which held a shareholder stake in gold fields ltd backed a hostile takeover bid by south africas harmony gold mining co that ultimately failed norilsk reported net profit for the first half of last year of &# billion up from &# million the latest figure was boosted by a &# million gain from the sale of its gold mining assets norilsk reports under international financial reporting standards which differ from u s generally accepted accounting principles the bidding for lionore is spurred in part by technological advances that will allow it to become a fully integrated nickel producer from mine to metal lionore has been developing a technology called activox to treat a wide variety of metal sulfide concentrates the toronto company has to smelt the concentrates produced before it can refine them but the new technology will remove the smelting step john tumazos metals and mining analyst at prudential in new york said he still sees room for higher bids "the biggest curiosity that i see is that the lionore management was willing to sell on the first deal they struck with xstrata because the price was so low " he said for suitors the question is whether nickel prices will remain high norilsk is at the forefront of a stampede to increase nickel production world wide it recently commissioned a new production complex at its big underground nickel mine on the kola peninsula and is expected to soon unveil joint exploration projects elsewhere in russia with bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto ltd charles bradford a metals and mining analyst in new york with bradford research soleil expects demand for the metal to ease as manufacturers find ways to curtail its use while widely used in stainless steel nickel isnt the component that gives the metal its sought after corrosion resistance rather nickel is used to make stainless steel look better and more pliable still the rush to develop new mines has hit barriers including scarce mining equipment and a dearth of trained geologists and mining engineers causing delays and huge cost overruns "even if you can get trucks from caterpillar you cant get tires " says mr bradford "so the people who have nickel coming out of the ground are riding high at the moment including norilsk " andrea hotter contributed to this article
