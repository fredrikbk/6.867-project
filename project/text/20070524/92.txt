style &amp substance burberry ceo retrenches fewer items faster delivery london walking through the burberry showroom here after becoming ceo last july angela ahrendts looked at the wealth of apparel and accessories and thought she recalls "way too much stuff " now after a decade of expansion that transformed burberry from a dowdy maker of raincoats into a fashion brand churning out handbags bikinis and even dog bowls the company is cleaning out its closet on her third day as ceo at burberry group plc ms ahrendts asked burberry chief financial officer stacey cartwright for a report on what each product contributed to the business its findings of burberrys sales came from of its wares as a result ms ahrendts is reducing the number of burberrys products by almost a third to some styles a year from around stores are getting deliveries of fewer designs but more frequently and designers store managers and marketing teams are working together more closely "what was needed at this time was focus " ms ahrendts said in an interview last week "we needed to simplify on the inside to compete in the complex environment on the outside " thats a big change for a company that became famous for wild growth ms ahrendts predecessor rose marie bravo who arrived as ceo in turned the languishing brand into a fashion leader by splashing burberrys traditional beige black and red plaid check on a myriad of products the new image marked by an ad showing model kate moss in a burberry check bikini sent sales soaring in when burberry first reported its sales after an initial public offering revenues were up from the year before but by sales growth had softened to from the previous fiscal year the companys image suffered as the iconic plaid appeared on counterfeit goods and became popular with british soccer hooligans its back office systems didnt keep up with its expansion and the company often delivered goods to stores after its ad campaigns had run burberry is one of a number of companies trying to improve the efficiency behind the elegant facades of their stores spurred by fast moving chains such as spains zara owned by inditex sa and swedens h&amp m owned by hennes &amp mauritz ab fashion firms are working to get their wares to stores faster and quickly produce more of whats is selling and in burberrys case less of what isnt burberry was making different versions of mens and womens short sleeve polo shirts ms ahrendts who thought they looked too much alike got rid of six kept in place the eight that were selling well and told designers to experiment with the rest for instance by making a dressier style to wear at the office burberry has also reduced its offerings of mens sweaters and shirts and eliminated some handbag and knitwear styles for women to give all three of the companys collections the prorsum high fashion line the main burberry london brand and the casual thomas burberry line a coordinated look ms ahrendts asked burberrys designers to move back to london in the past some were in new york and hong kong on fridays she has lunch with them to ensure that their creations mesh one result is the metal studs that appear on items from patent leather evening shoes to handbags to delicate silk scarves to gardening boots in burberrys spring summer line says design director christopher bailey "there is one brand and one message " ms ahrendts a year old native of indiana was an executive vice president at u s apparel maker liz claiborne inc overseeing brands including laundry by shelli segal and juicy couture before joining burberry she moved to london with her husband and three children last year another innovation she brought was a sharper focus on burberrys core assets especially the trench coat launched by burberry for soldiers fighting in world war i the garment had become a tired symbol of the old burberry now with trench coats back in style burberry is offering new variations including models with sequins and in knit alligator and mink as well as trench coat inspired dresses and capes "this is our dna our core like coffee for starbucks " says ms ahrendts who wore a burberry pants suit patent leather ankle boots and a quilted belt at last weeks interview "we need it in every flavor every size and every price point " ms ahrendts also switched burberry from two big collections a year to five smaller ones shipping fresh merchandise to stores every weeks "we were like a snake that swallows an animal " she says "we had two huge collections twice a year and then digested them " last month ms ahrendts said sales in the fiscal year ended march rose a little more than from the previous year to around &# billion she credited new stores strong sales of burberrys spring collection and a push into high margin accessories that includes a &# handbag since she arrived the companys stock has risen from around pence or roughly &# a share to close at pence in london yesterday but she still faces a host of challenges as she tries to put burberry on a steady and sustainable growth path the company which reports earnings today for the fiscal year has warned that profit will be weighed down by a big investment in computer and logistics systems the recent strength of the british pound has also damped burberrys profits accessories still account for only of burberrys sales less than at many other fashion houses accessories are more lucrative than apparel because profit margins are higher and can be worn by women of all ages and body shapes another part of ms ahrendts strategy is stepping up the pace of burberry store openings for the past decade the company which has stores around the world focused on having flagship stores in major cities now it is branching out into secondary markets such as tampa fla with smaller shops that mainly sell accessories jackets and coats its changing the decor in stores to include dark wood and lacquer finishes in the brands colors displays in the windows are also coordinated to match the companys advertising in the past burberry says the ads often showed key pieces that werent yet in the stores now ad campaigns have three phases early in a new season when burberry ships its most fashionable runway pieces ads show those items when the main collection arrives in stores a few weeks later the images in the ads change accordingly toward the end of the season around now when casual lower price pieces are in stores a third set of ads appears
