wealth of nations globalizations gains come with a price while poor benefit inequality feeds a backlash overseas puebla mexico like millions of other low wage workers here hermenegildo flores was supposed to benefit from mexicos decision to open its economy to foreign trade and investment in the s for a time he did as u s companies boosted purchases from mexican factories mr floress salary nearly doubled to &# a week in then foreign competition from places like india pakistan and el salvador intensified mr flores who sewed pockets onto blue jeans says his foreman "would go around shouting if you dont work harder we are going to shut this plant down and move it to central america " today mr flores is unemployed having accepted a &# buyout in april after the company switched to new machines a decade ago the globalization of commerce promised to be a boon to low wage workers in developing nations as wealthy nations shed millions of jobs making apparel electronics and other goods economists predicted that low skilled workers in latin america and asia would benefit because there would be greater demand for their labor and better wages in some ways globalization delivered as promised but there was an unexpected consequence as trade foreign investment and technology have spread the gap between economic haves and have nots has frequently widened not only in wealthy countries like the u s but in poorer ones like mexico as well many economists now say that the biggest winners by far are those with the education and skills to take advantage of new opportunities leaving many lagging far behind incomes of low skilled workers may rise but incomes of skilled workers rise a lot faster "while globalization was expected to help the less skilled in developing countries there is overwhelming evidence that these are generally not better off at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels " write economists pinelopi koujianou goldberg of yale university and nina pavcnik of dartmouth in the spring issue of the journal of economic literature globalization deserves credit for helping lift many millions out of poverty and for improving standards of living of low wage families in developing countries around the world globalization defined as trading and participating in the global economy has created a vibrant middle class that has elevated the standards of living for hundreds of millions of people thats particularly true in china where the incomes of low skilled workers have consistently risen the poor in countries like vietnam and elsewhere in southeast asia have also benefited greatly since those countries have opened their economies in many developing countries around the world life expectancies and health care have improved as have educational opportunities but because globalization is also creating more inequality it is raising questions about how much inequality countries can bear and whether these gaps could ultimately produce a backlash that will undermine trade and investment liberalization around the world many developing nations seem to be following in the footsteps of the u s where the income gap has grown sharply since the early s a study of latin america a region long marked by profound gaps between rich and poor by world bank economists guillermo perry and marcelo olarreaga found that the income divide deepened after economic liberalization in nine of the countries examined while that could partly be explained by latin americas slow rate of economic growth income gaps are widening in fast growing asian nations as well including thailand and india its even grown in the past decade in south korea a country long known for an egalitarian commitment to education then theres china one of the fastest growing economies in the world has generated significant wage gains for its rank and file yet income inequality is also growing because of the huge gains being posted by the upper crust between and chinas income inequality as measured by the gini index zero is perfect equality and is perfect inequality increased to from according to world bank researchers martin ravallion and shaohua chen from to per capita income of the bottom of urban households in china rose while those at the top saw gains of while mexico hasnt experienced the spectacular growth of china wages of low skilled workers have improved in the past four years since the percentage of mexicans living in poverty has fallen below for the first time ever in the nations history even so skilled workers in mexico still earn far more relative to unskilled workers than they did before liberalization in those in the top th percentile earned times more than those in the bottom th compared with four times as much in according to columbia university economists eric verhoogen and kensuke teshima by other measures income inequality is far greater the world bank for instance estimates that the top of mexicans accounted for of the countrys total spending in while the bottom accounted for less than the benefits of globalization have elevated the standards of living for hundreds of millions of people yet the consequences of widening income inequality are also profound those without much education or skills often find themselves stuck in jobs in the underground economy that dont pay health care or pension benefits thats boosted immigration to better off regions domestically or to the u s and europe where anti immigrant sentiment is surging growing inequality also feeds the populist argument that globalization is a suckers game that benefits only the elites in latin america that sense of alienation has powered populist presidential candidates who won in ecuador bolivia nicaragua and venezuela and came close to carrying mexico last year in china the ruling communist party worries that support for liberalization could crumble the government needs to "safeguard social fairness and justice and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development " said chinese premier wen jiabao in march how does globalization boost inequality the question is too fresh to have definitive answers but its clear that international competition forces local firms to add skilled workers who can handle newer technology and shed workers who cant foreign firms bring new technology to developing nations and boost demand there for skilled workers by paying to more than domestic firms says dirk willem te velde a research fellow at the overseas development institute a united kingdom think tank access to education also plays an important role developing nations rarely crank out enough college trained workers to match growing demand boosting the wages for fresh graduates unskilled workers who get laid off cant find retraining and add to the pool of workers looking for low wage work the effects of globalization are vividly on display in puebla a lively city of million known for its baroque churches and colonial architecture located between the port of veracruz and mexico city miles to the northwest puebla has long been a center of trade and textile as with the rest of mexico its industries were protected after world war ii by high walls of tariffs and quotas and by restrictions on foreign investment during the s those barriers helped produce rapid economic growth but the system collapsed in a debt crisis and deep recession that swept through latin america in the s to restart the economy mexico began dismantling its import barriers in the mid s and tied itself tightly to the world economy through the north american free trade agreement or nafta with the u s in and a passel of other trade accords since then at the time mexicos politicians and economists predicted that globalization would produce many new jobs in mexico especially for those at the bottom as companies that produce low skilled goods set up shop south of the border "mexican wages will not remain low if we are capable of growing " said mexicos then president carlos salinas in when he was promoting nafta for a time that turned out to be true towel maker industrias cobitel sa picked up two big new u s customers after nafta and doubled the number of production workers to by exports accounted for of the companys sales in about the triple the percentage before nafta business was so brisk that many employers didnt care whether new hires had much schooling but foreign investment and competition also prompted a big demand for skilled labor local companies that had gotten by with outmoded machinery either upgraded or closed volkswagen ag the citys largest private employer has had an especially large impact on the local economy the company for years produced "vochos " as vw beetles are called in mexico on an old fashioned production line where dents were banged out with mallets but as mexico opened its economy vw ratcheted up the demands on its work force the company started building the new beetle in puebla in and followed with other models aimed at hard to please u s buyers new machinery was imported now welds are done by lasers robots paint the exteriors of cars for an even finish in the past decade the company has doubled the number of engineers to and is planning to add more this year they make between &# and &# a week and are college graduates at the same time vw slashed its puebla work force by about since to mostly eliminating assembly jobs and outsourced production of seats steering wheels and wire harnesses to factories in a sprawling industrial park outside the gates of the manicured vw campus assembly workers at those factories are paid about one third the &# a week vw line workers make many auto parts companies wont hire laid off vw workers figuring they cant make the financial adjustment ricardo mosqueda martinez lost his job at vw and worked for a time at a parts supplier "when i first saw the paycheck i thought to myself is this a joke " he says he didnt last long there like many other vw employees mr martinez ended up in pueblas informal economy working as a gypsy taxi driver and doing other jobs for poblanos as puebla natives are called with the right education globalization has also opened opportunities that were absent in mexico just a decade ago victor pasilla the year old son of a hospital security guard makes &# a week designing oxygen sensors for a puebla start up biomedical integral sa which hopes to build neonatal surgical beds for export "its been a big leap " says mr pasilla who has outfitted his parents home where he still lives with its first telephone and computer "my parents are quite proud that their children are moving upwards " the surge of well to do residents has changed pueblas look in the once poor south of the city housing developments of small brightly colored homes each topped with water tanks have opened for young families who have become eligible for mortgage financing there are also two new shopping malls with international clothing stores including zara and massimo dutti low paid textile or auto parts workers dont shop at zara although many now frequent the local walmart which offers food clothing and appliances at good prices low wage workers live as they have for many years in cramped urban tenements ringed with razor wire to keep out thieves part of mexicos problem is that u s manufacturers looking for bargain prices have rerouted orders to china where wages are even lower cobitel pueblas towel maker had to cut payroll after a big south carolina textile customer shifted orders to china in overall mexican textile jobs that pay health benefits which peaked at in fell by one third to this year according to labor ministry statistics but chinas success doesnt fully explain the puzzle of growing global income inequality if it did chinas low wage workers would have seen especially fast growth in income reducing income inequality while low wage workers have benefited its elite workers that have benefited most in part thats because the companies in china doing work for overseas markets usually look for a set of skills few chinese have such as foreign language fluency and technical knowledge investment by japanese and korean companies has transformed the coastal city of dalian as crumbling slums and boarded up factories have given way to new shopping malls and fancy apartment complexes but the accompanying surge in real estate prices has made dalian nearly unaffordable for lower paid locals who often complain they are being literally pushed out of the city "the fact that ordinary people in dalian cant afford to buy a house in the city center is indisputable the city government should reflect on this " one dalian resident using the name mu fan wrote in a comment on a government sponsored web site such social tensions have become an increasing political problem for the communist party whose legitimacy rests on its ability to deliver a broad improvement in the populaces standard of living wary of being identified as favoring an urban elite leaders have this year expanded social programs for the poorest and campaigned against wealthy people who flout tax and family planning laws expanded education can ease inequality as more workers qualify for skilled jobs in mexico the income gap has diminished somewhat since partly reflecting improved education levels since for instance puebla state popular autonomous university a large private university has added undergraduate degrees in such specialties as bionics electronics and software and is planning to add degrees in biotechnology power grid administration and plastics another major factor so many poblanos have given up on their home turf and migrated to the u s that competition has eased somewhat for lower skilled jobs the greater number of poblanos working abroad has also increased the amount of cash being sent back home boosting the incomes of many residents in the past decade new york has become a magnet for many poblanos so much so that mole poblano a puebla specialty is now widely available for sale in the borough of queens mr flores the unemployed tailor has two brothers who have decamped for the u s but says he doesnt want to follow suit because he doesnt want to leave his wife and daughter instead mr flores is looking for work as a day laborer building homes for pueblas surging new middle class "i have a fight in front of me trying to find work " he says
