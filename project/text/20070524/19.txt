commute the cross country death vigil valliere wilsons three children grew up in dallas but all eventually wound up on the west coast going back to texas to visit their mother once or twice a year in they learned that the cancer ms wilson had battled for more than a decade had spread doctors suggested she had little time left her children rallied around to see her through their devotion bore a high price ms wilsons son ed sherman moved back to dallas straining his marriage to the breaking point cheryl and charlotte exhausted themselves traveling between california and texas juggling vacation days telecommuting and family leave the sisters worried about losing their jobs and struggled through their grief to keep up appearances at work when a parent is dying the rest of life waits now it often waits longer as medical science gets better at pulling terminally ill patients from the brink of death a loved ones final weeks can stretch into months or years with families often spread across the country or globe far flung relatives face heart rending choices as they wait for the end hospice workers say counseling out of town relatives when to rush home becomes an excruciating guessing game there are certain clues mottled skin a rattle in the chest that can send a child racing to the airport but patients sometimes rally just as the family gathers to say goodbye "you think death is occurring you come and you make that last completing visit then you go home and a month later you find that theyre still there you have to go back " said dave leisure a social worker with the community hospice of texas in fort worth jane swanson worried she wouldnt be able to be there when her mother died after a long illness in "my mother brought me into this world and it was important to me to help her leave the world " she said "i didnt want to do that from afar " ms swanson then an administrative worker at a houston software company took eight trips to her parents home in columbus ohio staying weeks at a time she used up all her vacation and sick time and then took a family leave she ran up more than &# in airfare and estimates she lost &# in salary "thank god for credit cards " she said after ms swansons mother died her year old father declined quickly she took more time off work raising eyebrows in her companys human resources department "ive lost my mother and im losing my father " she told two human resources managers in a meeting "i really dont care what you think about that " not all adult children go to extremes to be with a dying parent they make a final goodbye visit and then wait for the funeral pressure from bosses or spouses prevent some people from being there says ken doka a professor of gerontology at the college of new rochelle in new york and those decisions often echo long beyond the funeral "after they might say i wish i had gone sooner i wish id spent more time " he says in interviews over the course of seven months valliere wilsons children described their efforts to be at their mothers side ms wilson grew up in dallas raised in the depression era by her grandmother when she was years old she married a career army officer and had her two eldest children ed and cheryl she divorced married again and charlotte was born her second marriage ended when charlotte was five for the next decade she was a single mother working as many as three waitress and drugstore clerk jobs at one time while cheryl and charlotte shouldered the household chores tough times cemented a bond between ms wilson and her children "she never wanted us to feel like we were suffering " says charlotte when charlotte was her mother married for a third time ed left home at and hitchhiked to canada with "just a bible and a carton of cigarettes " he says cheryl moved away after college both ed and cheryl wound up in northern california visiting their mother in dallas every couple of years charlotte stayed in dallas where she raised her own two children before divorcing after ms wilsons third husband died in she remained in their brick home on a tree lined north dallas street whenever family arrived for a visit the she would throw open the front door and say "get yourself in here " in she was diagnosed with colon cancer and battled its progression with surgery and five rounds of chemotherapy cheryl called every day after work to check in and flew to dallas for major doctor visits and surgery but as the one still living in dallas charlotte provided most of the care for her mother during the long roller coaster illness "i was always the child who stayed home " she said in late charlotte then a marketing specialist for ticketmaster accepted a job with a new sports arena in memphis tenn two days before she moved her mother got the results from a cat scan the cancer had spread again this time to her lungs ms wilson urged her daughter to take the memphis job anyway still in an interview last december ms wilson said she kept imagining herself spending her last hours surrounded by strangers "oh i wish my kids lived here " she remembered thinking when her daughter moved away charlotte was racked with guilt she reassured her mother that the miles between memphis and dallas was "driving distance " and that shed come home often with charlotte gone eds wife patty suggested moving to texas there ed who had recently completed a college degree could launch a career as a math teacher in the summer of ed and his wife left their rural northern california home of nearly years and moved to dallas "it was the right thing to do " ed said in ms wilsons condition worsened she battled repeated lung infections with course after course of antibiotics and steroids the sicker their mother got the more stress charlotte and cheryl felt trying to deal with it long distance by then charlotte had moved again to los angeles she persuaded her mother to get a cellphone and on doctor days charlotte would wait anxiously at her desk dreading more bad news and thinking "oh god my moms going to call any minute " further north in san ramon calif cheryl was trying to keep her composure as a manager at a major telecommunications firm shed learned to take calls from her mother in a conference room to avoid the risk of crying in her cubicle most of her co workers knew about her mothers illness but some were reluctant to ask about it "id just start crying and wave my hands and have to go to the bathroom " cheryl said ed faced his own crisis he and his wife went back for a visit to california in the summer of ed returned to texas alone patty said she hated to abandon ms wilson but after living all her adult life in the country she felt out of place in the steel and concrete of the city "when it came time to go back for the third winter i literally physically at a cellular level could not go " she said with his marriage of years on the rocks ed sank into a funk he went days without talking to his mom he worried that he should be paying her more attention but he said "im only a half hour away which is better than being miles away thats what i tell myself " in september a new cat scan revealed ms wilsons lungs were filling with fast growing tumors for years she had nagged her oncologist to tell her how long she had left and he would always tell her he didnt know this time he told her "three to six months " charlotte urged her mother to keep fighting during cheryls trips to dallas she and her mother would sometimes spend the whole day in their pajamas reminiscing and gossiping ed didnt always get along with his sisters but he was there to patch his moms roof or wrap the pipes in cold weather on weekends hed help with grocery shopping at her doctors suggestion ms wilson registered with a local hospice vistacare to provide home care and assistance with medications charlotte and cheryl arranged for one of the daughters to be there at least every other week ed was to fill in as necessary as their mother got worse the two sisters would come more often and both planned to be there round the clock at the end ms wilson was elated "why would i even think that they could come that their bosses would let them " she said "i was the happiest person in the world when they told me what they were going to do " worried about the expense ms wilson insisted on paying for her daughters air travel cheryl and charlotte worked out a schedule so that they could buy cheaper advance tickets cheryl took out a new credit card to handle the charges in october ms wilsons doctor inserted a stent to open her tumor clogged airways and help her breathe better ms wilson improved enough that she didnt need anyone with her she could still cook for herself and she even made it to her weekly bridge games packing along her oxygen tank still the sisters kept up their travel rotation from california charlotte installed a high speed computer line in her mothers home so she could telecommute while visiting cheryl struck an agreement with her supervisor to work out of the companys dallas office while she was in town they wanted to spend time with their mom while she was still able to laugh and play "down and dirty uno " the family version of a card game during cheryls visit the first week in december ms wilson coughed up the stent that had helped her breathe cheryl struggled to reassure her mother while holding back her own tears ed hadnt called his mother that week his detachment frustrated his sisters but his mother worried that ed had too much on his mind ms wilson waited several days before phoning him to tell him about the stent "i know how you react when the phone rings " she told him "i do react poorly " ed admitted "sometimes the answering machine will blink for days but i wont listen to it because im afraid its bad news " charlotte returned to dallas to spend her last christmas with her mother for the first time in her life ms wilson was too weak to help cook christmas dinner she had to sit on the couch and watch while charlotte made a mess of the chocolate pie "that nearly killed me " ms wilson said ms wilson turned the corner into a new year her children began thinking that maybe the doctors were wrong maybe their mother would have more time on feb cheryl was with her mother in dallas missing a staff meeting in chicago she grew worried about rumored layoffs at work for the first time in her years at the company shed gotten a poor annual review based on low productivity shed asked for more work but her supervisor had noted that it was probably better that she not be stretched while she was dealing with her mom cheryl acknowledged "actually i couldnt handle any more " meanwhile charlotte had just been told that her companys los angeles office was closing at the end of the year and she would be out of a job cracks had begun surfacing in her longtime relationship with her boyfriend "everything was kind of falling to pieces " she said by mid march there was a marked change in their mother she was more anxious and couldnt sustain a conversation without getting winded for the first time she began to take morphine during the day "shes declining pretty rapidly " warned vicki rhodes the hospice nurse cheryl told her domestic partner rae morgan that she thought she should begin spending more time in dallas ms morgan had been supportive but now she protested worried about the strain cheryl already was under and how cheryls boss might react cheryl didnt want to hear it "i could have strangled her because that just added more stress " cheryl said charlotte took drastic action at the end of march she told her boss she was moving back to dallas and asked permission to telecommute until her job ended later that year he agreed and she scheduled the movers on march charlotte arrived in dallas for her last visit before her move her mother had begun losing weight rapidly and was suffering more bouts of confusion "were looking at less than a month " ms rhodes told the children over the next few days charlotte and her mother clashed her mother was uncharacteristically critical of charlottes efforts to help her charlotte called cheryl in california for support on april cheryl wrote in an email "charlotte and i are physically and emotionally exhausted " the next day ms wilson woke up confused and obstinate refusing to take her medicine when the nurse arrived she found ms wilson looking pale and weak she pulled charlotte aside "you cant leave your mother alone " she told her that night ms wilson had more trouble breathing after she went to bed she woke in a panic around midnight and asked charlotte for morphine an hour later she called out again and charlotte gave her another half dose of morphine forty five minutes later she called for charlotte once more charlotte was worried about giving too much painkiller so she gave her an anxiety medication her mother was quiet the rest of the night shortly after a m charlotte went in to check on her mom ms wilson lay on her side her head on her pillow "shes still asleep " charlotte thought describing the scene later but when she dropped something on the floor her mother didnt stir she put her hand on her mothers arm her body was cold "no " charlotte wailed "please dont do this " she lay her head down next to her mother and held her cheryl knew what it meant when her phone rang at a m in california "i was preparing myself " she said but hearing the news by phone was still hard "i wasnt there when she died and i wasnt there to help charlotte to deal with it " she said ed drove straight over when he got charlottes call and together the brother and sister sat with their mom holding her hand and saying goodbye "you know " ed told charlotte "cheryl is going to have different memories because she wasnt here for this " charlotte returned to work in los angeles a few days after the funeral her plans to move to dallas are on hold ed submitted his resignation to the school where he taught and will return to california in june to try to repair his marriage he says if he had to do it over hed still move to be closer to his mother "she loved that i was here for her " he said cheryl took a week off work to grieve and then returned to her san ramon office she was greeted by sympathetic co workers which made her cry again she has no regrets she hadnt been there with her mom when she died but she sees the time she spent when she was alive as more important "i always told mom that i would be there for her when she needs me and i was " she said bone weary cheryl thought about canceling a visit to see her father on may but he seemed distressed by the idea hes years old and he lives in las vegas so she decided to go after all "and im going to tell him if you want me ill be there for you too "
