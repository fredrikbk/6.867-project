make it yourself star wars lucasfilm will post clips from film saga on the web inviting fans to edit at will george lucas creator of "star wars " has never hesitated to protect his intellectual property which is why some call him "lucas the litigator " but this week his lucasfilm plans to make clips of "star wars" available to fans on the internet to mash up meaning to remix however they want at will the clips about of them from all six star wars movies will land on the starwars com web site tomorrow part of this weeks th anniversary celebrations of the release of his hit movie working with an easy to use editing program from eyespot corp of san diego fans can cut add to and retool the clips then they can post their creations to blogs or social networking sites like myspace more clips will come out from time to time over coming months in essence lucasfilm is going to legitimize and streamline a pastime that has become increasingly popular on the web a search for "star wars" on youtube for example turns up some results many of them videos drawing on original content from the movies but on third party video sites lucasfilm executives "cant control it and they cant monetize it " says jim kaskade eyespots chief executive officer while lucasfilm could fight what amounts to the theft of its property it has now decided to take the opposite tack in doing so it is tackling an issue that faces all media companies today how to keep some semblance of control over intellectual property in the digital age "we see whats going on at youtube " says jeffrey ulin senior director for distribution and business affairs at lucasfilm who says the company began to think about allowing mash ups last summer "we see whats going on out there on the web generally and we wanted fans to come to starwars com as the center of fan activity " currently he estimates the site attracts about two million unique monthly visitors he anticipates the new content will boost traffic significantly the clips which run up to seconds long will assemble memorable moments from the movies grouped under categories like "leia confronts vader" and "the lost limbs" the latter a collection of various characters limbs getting the chop one category devoted to a much maligned lizard like character from the three "star wars" prequels urges fans "dont be shy heres your chance to edit jar jar " the mash up project will come with rules however while it wont stop anybody from assailing characters or casting them in unexpected lights eyespot has set up a program to make sure none of the doctored clips contain nudity pornography and the like as a backup a team of screeners based in costa rica will watch each video before it goes live working with lucasfilm involved "a lot of delicacies and a lot of attention to detail " says david dudas eyespots chief technology officer "theyre very sensitive " lucasfilm says it sees the "star wars" movies as a cross between a big movie franchise and a brand like disney another company with child friendly entertainment that zealously protects its image lucasfilm has multiple motivations for allowing this now that no more "star wars" movies are coming out the mash ups are "part of keeping the love of star wars and the franchise alive " says mr ulin "were really trying to position ourselves for the next years " other parts of that effort include a videogame the force unleashed and an animated tv series both scheduled for next year a live action tv series is coming later to draw in as many fans as possible lucasfilm also wants to make it easy to edit the footage with many desktop programs "you can spend hours maybe days trying to put together a five minute story " says mr kaskade "we have made a significant attempt to keep it simple " the program relies on basic dragging clicking and pasting eyespot already works with various media companies viacom inc s paramount pictures has created promotions where fans can edit trailers for movies like the mark wahlberg thriller "shooter " sonybmg makes some music videos and songs available for mixing but the "star wars" project is the most ambitious yet says mr kaskade the "star wars" team "understands social media and is embracing it " he says "this is a way for lucasfilm to bring youtube to their backyard " that notion may not resonate with fans who remember mr lucass reactions to other attempts to draw on his movies for inspiration last year lucasfilm sued a maryland company that was making "star wars" like light sabers without the proper trademarks previously it sued rapper dr dre for using the booming sound effect that begins lucasfilm movies to kick off his album " " and it also sued to block distribution of an animated pornographic movie called "starballz" that featured some "star wars" like characters but the company says this situation is different if fans are using "star wars" material for fun thats one thing "if someone tries to commercialize it thats where weve drawn the line " says mr ulin he says the company has long supported activities like an annual contest for the best "star wars" movie submitted by a fan mr lucas will pick this years winner on sunday at the "celebration iv" "star wars" convention in los angeles previously the contest allowed only parodies or documentaries this year for the first time it allowed fiction that expands the "star wars" saga beyond the original storylines "in general we have a bit more lighthearted attitude to the series than we did in the past " says mr ulin he points to commercials tied to the last release s "revenge of the sith " which showed yoda hawking pepsi and chewbacca growling through voice tests at a cingular recording studio "its a bit of a natural evolution as star wars becomes a part of pop culture " eventually the mash ups will run with brief video advertising before them with lucasfilm and eyespot splitting the proceeds the efforts should bring refocused attention on all the "star wars" movies helping to boost dvd and merchandise sales
