outside the squeeze box dino saluzzi and anja lechner sottile theatre charleston s c monday p m eugene ore scene "esquina " seated side by side turned slightly toward each other dino saluzzi and anja lechner begin their concert with a stately tune that suddenly swings into double time as ms lechner takes a solo accompanied by sprightly bursts from mr saluzzis bandoneon the argentine button accordion of which he is the reigning master the two musicians exchange grins each swaying into the picked up tempo tossing the accompanying and lead roles back and forth then at some telepathic signal they drop back into a wistful slow tune as mr saluzzi gazes toward the ceiling white buttons clicking on his ebony instrument and glides the piece home in the hushed sanctuary of the shedd an old downtown baptist church converted a few years ago into one of the northwests finest music venues the duo sustained an ineffably poignant atmosphere throughout this first performance on their debut american tour the tour concludes on memorial day at the spoleto festival usa in charleston s c it felt as much like an art house movie noirish s italian say as a concert mr saluzzis cinematic compositions draw listeners in rather than overwhelming them leaving ample spaces that invite them to create their own accompanying stories and images in fact mr saluzzi has dedicated a piece to director jean luc godard and his music has lent pathos to a pedro almodovar film and like so much of mr saluzzis music that opening work "esquina " evokes a scene the six decade old memory of his father and first teacher cayetano playing a sad song in the moonlight of their village in northern argentina one about leaving a small town to go to the big city of paris a few years later mr saluzzi who is now began to travel a similar path moving to buenos aires joining the orchestra of argentinas first radio station playing in small groups and befriending the bandoneons greatest exponent astor piazzolla who taught mr saluzzi to use music to express himself his life his times his feelings "my bandoneon was like a voice for me " he recalls fascinated by many musical genres he led his own groups and tried his hand at composing for various ensembles eventually winning a national reputation for his performances of both folk and avant garde music completing the liberation begun by piazzolla of the bandoneon from strict tango forms he found that his instruments obscurity afforded him great creative freedom unfreighted by historical legacy his growing acclaim throughout south america including a stint with jazz saxophonist gato barbieri brought mr saluzzi to the attention of george gruntz who was traveling the continent in search of unconventional musicians to play in his berlin jazz festival in mr gruntz invited him to berlin to play with a big band when mr saluzzi examined the charts provided at his music stand he found no notation for his instrument "just play " mr gruntz said and mr saluzzis improvisatory skill did the rest mr saluzzis spare eclectic style made him an ideal artist for ecm the munich based record label whose visionary founder producer manfred eicher specialized in atmospheric uncharacterizable sounds since his ecm debut mr saluzzi has played toured and recorded with a wide variety of ensembles and musicians solo with european and american jazz masters such as tomasz stanko and charlie haden with his son jose maria and brothers celso and felix and others scene "duetto " in the eugene concerts second piece ms lechners cello essays a sedate plaintive opening solo and mr saluzzis bandoneon follows with chords a pause and then the tempo slackens still further with another cello solo then the bandoneon leads the pair into a darker harmonic detour followed by another incongruously jaunty section that rapidly stumbles into irregular rhythms and dissonances punctuated by snorting outbursts from the squeeze box mr saluzzis mischievous eyes sparkle and ms lechner smiles as each playfully with glances body language and constant shifting of the beat with each phrase teases and dares the other to halt the proceedings when it finally unexpectedly ends the audience laughs along with the players at their musical joke ms lechner the cellist in munichs acclaimed rosamunde quartet whose ecm album with mr saluzzi won wide acclaim has been performing with mr saluzzi for a decade and the two have built a remarkable rapport ms lechner is an adventurous musician who has explored the music of many contemporary composers shed long been fascinated by tango and had even traveled to argentina to sample it at the source but when she first heard mr saluzzi play at a concert in the early s she quickly recognized that his music transcended its origins "it was much more than tango because his improvising would go completely out of any form " she recalls "he doesnt fit any category there are some romantic moments abstract moments spiritual moments he never plays anything in just one style he always renews the music " scene "el titere " named for the great argentine writer jorge luis borgess ballad about "a guy who nobody takes seriously or respects but in his own way hes looking for love " mr saluzzi says their third song is pagliacci music the bittersweet opening cello tune is like a close up on a glistening tear then the camera pulls back and the bandoneon dances into a jaunty syncopated little tango revealing the visage of a sad clown more smiles between the players when the piece slows to end on a sighing high note the feeling is almost unbearably intimate throughout the concert the pair exploit this tension between the cellos dark weighty tone and the bandoneons melancholy once defined as "the pleasure of being sad" superficial cheeriness but each is also a master of conveying complex varieties of emotion as they prove in two solo numbers both composed by mr saluzzi while the other musician gazes raptly from the wings mr saluzzis expressive face runs the emotional gamut looking surprised at wherever his squeeze box takes him clutching at it like a life preserver scene "serenata " the duo conclude with another nocturnal memory when mr saluzzis mother punished him for a childhood transgression by making him pray at the familys flower bedecked altar it opens with pensive high notes with the cello coming in when the bandoneon seems unable to continue then meanders tentatively down the scale until both instruments suddenly leap in volume to a passionate farewell as the musicians stand the audience immediately leaps to its feet applauding coda "minguito " another nostalgia trip their encore pays tribute to a movie comedy character juxtaposing scenes in which the two instruments vie for the lead role finally settling into a wry bandoneon tune over a plucked cello groove suggesting a welcome morning after stroll after an evening of ethereal reflections or at least thats the scene it summoned in my head its impossible to listen to this intensely evocative music without creating your own film to the soundtrack conjured by these magnificent musicians mr
