capital a bush loyalist gently states his case to neocons when timothy d adams an earnest year old who spent a decade working for the current president bush and his father took the podium at a ceremony on his last day as the treasurys top international official he chose to speak about the importance of humility in foreign affairs humility it isnt a word often used to describe president bushs approach to the rest of the world one often seen both by admirers and critics as speak loudly and carry a very big stick but republicans skeptical of mr bushs approach are emerging like blades of grass in the cracks of a decaying brick wall republican realists who favor a more pragmatic less ideological approach than the neoconservatives led by vice president dick cheney are ascendant one of them robert gates has even replaced donald rumsfeld as defense secretary the son of a construction worker who grew up in kentucky mr adams came to washington in fresh out of graduate school in international affairs and public administration at the university of kentucky he isnt a whiz kid like larry summers who was treasury undersecretary for international affairs in the clinton years nor is he a financier like david mulford or pedigreed academic like stanford universitys john taylor also among his predecessors he didnt confront any big global financial crises on his two year watch nor despite persistent attempts to restructure the international monetary fund to suit st century realities did he make big policy changes but mr adams did travel a lot he visited about countries in the past few years on behalf of the u s government and that taught him something "people envy us they are in awe of us " he says in an interview "but theyre also anxious about us they fear us and those are a volatile combination of emotions that can undermine what we seek to do " tough rhetoric finger wagging and lecturing isnt achieving american aims he says "in many places theyve stopped listening because were so predictable in what were going to say " the alternative "we have to walk more gently and we have to speak more gently " he says that takes more time he acknowledges but it is more likely to succeed mr adams says he is more convinced than ever of the virtues of multilateral institutions the imf the world bank and the like despite their obvious flaws "we need to live by the rules that we want others to live by " he says "hypocrisy is an easy trap to fall into " mr adamss first job in washington was as a presidential management intern at the white house and treasury under the first president bush after sitting out the clinton years at a consulting firm that tries to explain washington to wall street he enlisted as policy director of the bush cheney campaign in and after the election was rewarded with the job of chief of staff to treasury secretaries paul oneill and john snow in august he became international undersecretary a high profile post that comes with an office that has been restored to look as it did when president andrew johnson occupied it after abraham lincolns assassination today mr adams who recently joined a consulting firm founded by former bush aide lawrence lindsey can quote from memory the words mr bush used in an october presidential debate with al gore "if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us " mr adams who remains a bush loyalist ducks a question about iraq "the president made the decision he made at the time he made it its an easy game to monday morning quarterback he certainly doesnt need me to do it " but ask him what he is looking for in the next president and this is what he says "im looking for a candidate who wants to engage the world who has spent time in the world who understands we cant act alone "we need to work in concert with others " he says the u s confrontation with much of the rest of the globe over world bank president paul wolfowitz which came to a climax after mr adams left the treasury suggests the bush administration isnt yet a convert to mr adamss approach still there are signs a few that mr bush is backing away from the tough guy go it alone attitude that has characterized his administration so far his deals with democrats on immigration and trade his reliance on the united nations to restrain irans nuclear programs his dependence almost to a fault on the six party talks to pressure north korea to curtail its nuclear programs and his backing for treasury secretary henry paulsons slow romancing of the chinese mr adams approves
