africa where art historys timeline is anything but straight washington the walt disney tishman african art collection given in to the national museum of african art at the smithsonian institution in washington and on view there until sept brings together works raw and refined from cultures throughout sub saharan africa the objects masks ornaments weapons figures and utensils span centuries and represent wildly diverse sensibilities and artistic traditions many reshaped over time by the rising and falling fortunes of colonial empires and indigenous cultures the timeline of art history in africa the works prove has been an unruly thing princely objects such as a meticulously carved ivory saltcellar from the benin kingdom depicting nude angels and portuguese soldiers predate by centuries far more rough hewn elementary works made in other parts of the continent beginning in the late th century portuguese traders and explorers along the coast of west africa commissioned works for export from royal craftsmen the vibrant trade economy and system of arts patronage of the era fueled the creative culture already thriving in the region carvings in ivory from the period display great virtuosity and polish incorporate sophisticated historical narratives and were coveted by renaissance europeans court artists from the benin kingdom in what is now nigeria took inspiration from both african and european sources and knew how to turn out crowd pleasers for their patrons whether foreign or african a th century yoruba armlet for example is a showpiece of elite craftsmanship impossibly intricate it is carved of a single piece of ivory into two interlocking layers hung with earring sized pendants only about inches long it includes minuscule renderings of hunchbacks holding monkeys on leashes and crocodiles devouring the heads and tails of fish countless similarly exquisite objects became prized jewels in later european collections and one wonders how such an exodus of african treasures over the centuries has played out artistically might the draining off of precious materials such as ivory have been an impetus for african artists to become exceptionally creative with the poorer materials remaining at hand many of the works on view here suggest that this was the case for they display an african genius for resourceful inventiveness just as many of the items represent multicultural influences that may never be pinned down the materials used in some represent a scavengers grab bag of flora fauna and found objects a few pieces stand out as particularly masterly examples of mixed media innovation a late th to mid th century mask from the ivory coast incorporates bells hair teeth cloth and brass tacks a yoruba crown from the early th century uses glass beads cloth plant fibers and iron and a mask from the ejaham peoples employs wood skin metal and plant fibers not to be missed is a haunting yellow eyed mask from the bamun peoples from the grassfields region of cameroon the eyes are encased in silk taken from spider eggs perhaps of a tarantula spiders were thought to impart divine knowledge and the effect is powerful and eerie whose hair is that we wonder on encountering some of the masks in the exhibit and whose teeth because the artists and craftsmen represented in this exhibit and in much african art are so often anonymous and the dating limited to broad estimates the scholarship accompanying the work is necessarily a blend of erudition and creative guesswork for example the male figure on a finial produced in the ivory coast in the late th to early th century may or may not be a portrait of a european his aquiline nose european looking hat and long beard might belong to a high status african as the catalog states "whether this sculpture is meant to assert a rulers continued authority in the face of european colonial pressure is unknown but it undoubtedly indicates the absorption of foreign motifs into local idioms of status and power " the colonial elements that show up in the works presented here are often either subverted or ambiguous an early th century male figure from the bembe peoples of the congo depicts a bearded man in a pith helmet an emblem of colonial authority but the mans physiognomy and facial scarring suggest that he is probably an african chief the bembe it appears absorbed the pith helmet as a mark of rank for their own hierarchical purposes an important late th century hunting horn from what is now sierra leone was commissioned by portugal for king ferdinand v of spain and incorporates coats of arms and imagery taken from european prayer books but figures suggestive of shepherds christian symbols also carry spears and are draped with unidentified apparently dead animals rather than lambs a bowl attributed to the celebrated yoruba artist areogun who died in depicts a helmeted male figure on a motor bike who is smoking a pipe but the figure is probably a reference not to the colonial civil service but to the deity shango associated with speed or to eshu a messenger to the gods in many cases the provenance of an object comes as a surprise a gallery goer might guess that a contemporary urban artist was responsible for a highly abstracted bronze crucifix with a dramatic almost cartoon like expression but it is attributed to the kongo peoples of th century congo one sees in such a figure the seductiveness of bold african forms for later european artists like picasso by contrast a carved door attributed to the tsogo peoples of gabons ogowe river region depicts human stick figures who resemble prehistoric cave wall symbols but were in fact produced in the late th to early th century might a european appetite for a particular "african look" have encouraged stepped up production of some motifs the curators suggest that a distorted female form carved of wood in the congo in the late th to early th century conveys a gifted artists "unconventional interpretation of feminine beauty " maybe so but other exaggerated figure carvings were marketable bits of handicraft catering to european ideas of primitivism in some cases they might simply have been evidence that a given culture preferred its womenfolk with small breasts or sturdy legs a shortage of documentation may be a frustration for some visitors to this exhibition aside from the work of celebrated artists or objects produced within well established courtly guilds the items tend to lack "paperwork " but every piece in "african vision" represents an outstanding example of its type whether or not it comes with a written record all are striking and many breathtaking and the mystery that accompanies them gives wide latitude to the viewers imagination ms finnerty writes for the journal on culture and the arts
