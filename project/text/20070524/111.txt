wonder land dancing with ghosts a recent trip through spain was not long enough to absorb the depths of modern spanish politics but it was possible to take the nations political pulse it felt a lot like whats been going on in the u s the particulars of a nations politics aside it must mean something if the drift of political conversation over tables in madrid barcelona and seville recurringly feels like that in washington new york or san francisco spain is booming propelled by the pro market policies of the previous conservative government of jose maria aznar policies that the successor socialists under prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero havent significantly eroded the countrys economy is vital as here the skylines of madrid and barcelona are filled with construction cranes erecting new apartments and commercial offices a taxi driver negotiating impossibly narrow streets in languid seville remarks "yes the economy is strong but after two years the inconvenience of all this construction is tiresome " welcome to any once quiet neighborhood in new york so as spain heads into the st century of a long ride through history life is good in the nation that discovered america a mere years ago just dont ask them to talk about their politics the spanish are a talkative people they will ask if you saw the grand tintoretto show at the prado museum they will explicate in detail rafael nadals domination of clay court tennis they will explain the economic forces behind the blocks of commercial structures along the diagonal in barcelona but politics by and large the spaniards i encountered would rather not here roughly is the whole of a response from a right of center gentleman to a query about the current state of spains politics around a dinner table in a noisy modern madrid restaurant "well yes the zapatero government " pause "its painful quite painful " pause "its really not something one wants to talk about " the rest of ones heretofore voluble dinner companions mutter assent lets discuss something else how like new york where at this stage of our politics democrats and republicans co exist to the extent they agree not to discuss george bush iraq paul wolfowitz or much of anything deeper than the celebrities of presidential politics there are many things america could profitably learn from spain its good manners an unfailing willingness to help a confused traveler the prideful cleanliness of its cities but spains politics is a cautionary tale for an increasingly harsh american political culture which seems to think no price will be paid for the relentless demonization of ones opponents primarily what many spaniards prefer not to discuss in their politics is socialist prime minister zapateros determination to assign official responsibility for the spanish civil war to the supporters of gen francisco franco some half million died in that conflict after franco died in virtually all political parties were determined to make spain a democracy and achieved it with a new constitution in as important however was the informal social pact to submerge the political bitterness of the civil war no easy thing for spains people at the moment the spanish are doing a pretty good job of negotiating the emotional tripwires and tensions created by mr zapateros determination to dance with the ghosts of those awful years but even an outsider feels a palpable concern that the volatile emotions always beneath the surface of spains politics have the potential to blow apart what has been achieved in the past years i want to suggest that american politics today is talking and fighting its way toward a similar impasse how did it come to this it has been argued in this column before that the origins of our european like polarization can be found in the florida legal contest at the end of the bush gore presidential campaign that was a mini civil war with the popular vote split we spent weeks in a tragicomic pitched battle over contested votes in a few florida counties the american political system by historical tradition flexible and accommodative was unable to turn off the lawyers and forced nine unelected judges to settle it so they did splitting in retrospect a more judicious supreme court minority would have seen the danger in that vote as nixon did in and made the inevitable result unanimous to avoid recrimination a pacto instead we got recrimination from that day american politics has been a pitched battle waged mainly by democrats against the "illegitimate" republican presidency some democrats might say the origins of this polarization traces to the house impeachment of bill clinton after that the goal was payback to lose as the democrats did in was and remains unendurable as likely it would have for republicans if theyd lost to politics of its nature is about polar competition opposed ideas should compete for public support withdraw all possibility of contact or crossover however and "politics" becomes just a word that euphemizes national alienation that effectively is what we have now exhibit a through z is the iraq war a major military undertaking by the united states fought after the resolution with little or no support by one of the nations two political parties when one democratic senator persisted in support his dissent was not allowed as normal in our politics but punished with ostracism feel free to call this take no prisoners opposition "principle " but its also uncharacteristic for our politics one is tempted to settle for a politics whose goals rise no higher than destroying the careers of opposition party figures but the fate of the immigration bill an attempt to resolve a real problem reveals the costs a system in a state of permanent opposition the left prefers unsolved immigration as an issue to "run" on the right more bizarre insisted we "do something" about illegal immigration then revealed this week it will let nothing qualify as a solution a cynic might argue plausibly that so long as the federal reserve and european central bank dont mismanage the dollar or euro the worlds integrated economies will grow and in time reduce the political class to entertainment like professional wrestling europe may be able to slide by on this basis but a u s politics preoccupied with inconsolable grievances will in time erode americas role in the world of course that too could be the point for some in the battle now
