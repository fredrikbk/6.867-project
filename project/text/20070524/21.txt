dared to dismiss on kpmg last june a federal judge in new york accused the justice department of violating the fifth and sixth amendment rights of defendants in the kpmg tax shelter case yesterday an appeals court all but dared the judge lewis a kaplan to throw the whole suit out if he meant it how about it judge what is said to be the largest tax fraud case in history involves defendants most of them former kpmg employees and &# billion in alleged fraud it became a symbol of prosecutorial overreach when judge kaplan ruled that the governments use of the now discredited "thompson memo" guidelines for indicting firms led it to infringe the defendants rights to decline to testify against themselves to counsel and to due process of law judge kaplan accused prosecutors of being "misleading" and "economical with the truth " and he accused the government of letting "its zeal get in the way of its judgment " but he still declined to dismiss the case instead he tried to establish an ad hoc procedure to right some of the wrongs by hearing a separate case on whether kpmg should pay for the defense of its former employees something justice had pressured kpmg into refusing to do kpmg appealed this ancillary case to the second circuit and yesterday a three judge appellate panel ruled that judge kaplan had exceeded his authority in trying to draw kpmg into the criminal case between its former employees and the government but the second circuits reversal applied only to judge kaplans proposed remedy the ad hoc civil proceeding to fix the governments constitutional missteps the appeals court did not address whether his finding of constitutional violations was correct though it did note that if judge kaplans reasoning was sound "dismissal of the indictment is the proper remedy " in other words jude kaplan probably went too far in trying to salvage the governments case in the face of the prosecutors misconduct if he meant it when he wrote last june that the government "has violated the constitution it is sworn to defend " he should follow his argument to its logical conclusion and throw out the whole case in fact the justice departments abuses in this case are larger than the issue of whether the defendants lawyers get paid the defendants are facing charges for selling tax shelters that had never been challenged in court by the irs their prosecution abetted by a do or die deferred prosecution agreement with their employer and a set of charging standards that has since been repudiated by the justice department the second circuits ruling would seem to leave judge kaplan with little alternative to dismissal unless like gilda radner of saturday night live fame he wants to offer a meek "never mind" and allow this tainted prosecution to proceed
