a plea to u s travelers head north eh canada rebrands itself with snazzier appeal finding the sweet spot stung by a &# billion decline in tourism from the u s over the last five years canada has launched a rebranding campaign to inject a little flash and sizzle into the pristine but dull image many u s residents have of the great white north the new canada is less about mounties rumpled flannel and wide open spaces and more about fine dining exotic spas and cosmopolitan night life according to the canadian tourism commission which launched the c&# million &# million campaign this month "people have this image of us that hasnt changed in years " says greg klassen vice president of marketing for the canadian tourism commission "but this is a much different country now " the "canada keep exploring" campaign was three years in the making and included focus groups aimed at understanding how u s citizens perceive canada beautiful clean vast safe and friendly all came to mind but so did boring predictable and not much different than home the new ads highlight images of hikers preparing for helicopter rides from a spa in the canadian rockies diners feasting on balconies in five star hotels in quebec and overnight stays in tony outdoor digs on vancouver island accompanied by the caption "is sipping year old brandy in a luxury tent still considered roughing it " the ads are going up on billboards and in newspapers in new york boston and los angeles theyre aimed at active relatively affluent air travelers but klassen said the "sweet spot" of the campaign is gen xers who have recently surpassed baby boomers as the most active leisure travelers according to the ctc the ads central intent is to intrigue u s travelers about canada and answer the question "how is canada different from the u s " says siobhan chretien executive director u s leisure marketing for the ctc "we need to let people know what they can do here that they cant do at home " other countries have tried similar branding campaigns with varying success the practice dates to the marriage of marketing and diplomacy that took root in the s in the past decade the niche has grown into a specialty within the marketing industry says rina plapler executive director of futurebrand a consulting firm in new york the most frequently cited success story is spain which took advantage of the barcelona olympics to launch an international marketing campaign anchored by the joan miro sun symbol that was attached to virtually every spanish export or advertisement in recent years uganda nigeria costa rica israel turkey and poland have launched similar campaigns but many such campaigns dont work because it is difficult to change the image of a country unless the country really changes says simon anholt a london based branding adviser to governments in canadas case he says "americans have a slightly wrong impression of the reality of canada so i think in part theyre doing the right thing " in canada foreign tourism is a c&# billion industry with u s visitors accounting for about of international overnight stays last year u s tourists on overnight stays spent c&# billion in canada the lowest amount since and c&# billion less than in tourism from the u s to canada jumped sharply just after the sept terrorist attacks when u s residents were reluctant to travel overseas but in the severe acute respiratory syndrome scare in toronto reversed those gains and u s residents began to gravitate to more exotic up and coming destinations in central and south american asia the caribbean and eastern europe "theres this feeling that canada is always going to be there it may be a nice place to live but there are other places to visit first " ms chretien says "that we are nice and safe doesnt necessarily translate to visits " in addition to the heightened interest in other countries canada tourism has been hampered by high gasoline prices an exchange rate unfavorable to american travelers the canadian dollar hit a year high against the u s dollar on tuesday and rose again yesterday and confusion surrounding new u s passport requirements air travelers crossing between canada and the u s have needed a passport since jan people crossing the border by land or water will need one as soon as january says russ knocke a spokesman for the u s department of homeland security about one quarter of u s citizens have passports according to the state department and the uncertainty over what is needed when has scared tourists away "all people heard was that they needed a passport on jan " says gordon orr managing director of the convention and visitors bureau of windsor essex county and pelee island directly across the detroit river separating the u s from canada "the confusion killed the spontaneous weekend traveler " in the windsor area overnight stays have dropped by since the air travel passport requirement began the cumulative effect has been a sharp drop in border crossings in both directions in the number of u s residents entering canada fell to million from million in according to statistics canada a government agency mr anholt the branding consultant suggests that this downturn could be difficult "canada has been incredibly fortunate for the last century its basically had its dinner handed to it on a platter now it has to compete in a global environment with others " mr klassen of the ctc says canada will rebound in time "this is going to be a gradual process " he said "it took years to build this image it may take years to reposition canada to where we think we should be "
