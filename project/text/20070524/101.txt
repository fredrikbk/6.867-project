the hazards of being notorious fallen founder by nancy isenberg viking pages &# societies reveal themselves as much through their villains as through their heroes for years aaron burr has occupied a privileged place in the innermost circle of american political hell alongside benedict arnold and joe mccarthy yet as nancy isenberg reminds us burr is a strange choice for that unholy trinity arnold really did commit treason while burr was acquitted in his treason trial in and while television made mccarthy a universal icon of villainy few if any americans knew burr by sight or even by reputation he spent his final years until his death in living quietly in manhattan a retired lawyer passing through the streets unrecognized now ms isenberg offers in "fallen founder " what gore vidal attempted in his novel "burr" justice to a maligned man her title is apt there is something luciferian about burrs career notably precocious he applied to enter princeton when he was college officials made him wait until he was as an adult he would prove to be a striking public figure handsome eloquent and vigorous he rose from revolutionary war hero he was one of the few americans to come back from the failed invasion of canada with his reputation enhanced to become a u s senator in and then vice president in at age having lost the presidency to thomas jefferson by a single electoral vote yet his enemies marked burr for destruction early on as ms isenberg shows jefferson john adams george washington and alexander hamilton all loathed him and worked together to halt his meteoric rise as early as hamilton declared opposing burr "a religious duty" and nearly wrecked his own career in trying to wreck burrs in hamilton even gave his life in the effort he was severely wounded in their famous duel on the heights of weehawken n j and died the next day it must have been a double calamity to hamilton to realize that not only was he going to die but that burr was going to live he need not have worried the ranks of the founding fathers slammed shut against the shooter as burr wrote two days later the duel "has driven me into a sort of exile and may terminate in an actual and permanent ostracism " rumors flew that burr had shot hamilton in the back untrue when the scandal failed to wreck burrs future president jefferson had burr his former vice president brought up on charges of planning to lead a secession in the west and conspiring to overthrow the government charges that despite the testimony of james wilkinson a supposed eyewitness to burrs perfidy no jury would buy yet the fear and loathing of burr only gathered force and has lasted until today certainly burr didnt help himself by his less than adulatory opinion of george washington burr thought israel putnam the victor of bunker hill the better general burr also got to know and admire benedict arnold when they served together in the quebec campaign again no way to win the heart of posterity as for burrs views they were unusually progressive for his time one of the first books he gave his daughter theodosia was mary wollstonecrafts "vindication of the rights of woman " burr came to lead the anti federalist forces in new york state and to win the respect of men like albert gallatin james monroe and andrew jackson those three would each end up commemorated on a u s stamp but never burr the reason may lie in his choice of vocation aaron burr was americas first unabashed professional politician the other founding fathers clothed their ambitions with elevated phrases borrowed from the bible and the ancients and pretended that they were the high minded modern equivalents of cicero and pericles burr grasped as they did not that the federal constitution hammered out by the framers including burrs princeton classmate james madison demanded a new kind of politics active demotic and partisan to the founding fathers an embrace of party politics smacked of "faction " or what we call special interests to burr special interests were the inevitable face of modern liberty men organizing to get their friends elected to high office to further their own interests and to dominate the public agenda if they could from his first senatorial campaign in burr threw himself into winning votes he loved canvassing and campaigning his opponents by contrast clung to the fiction that they had been only reluctantly called to politics because of their superior integrity both washington and jefferson favored this pose for them it was bad form to be seen actually seeking the presidency but burr had no such scruples he would pioneer all the techniques of political managers from martin van buren to karl rove ms isenberg quotes the diary of a burr supporter in the campaign describing how burr kept his richmond hill house open for two solid months "committees were in session day and night during the whole time refreshments were always on the table and mattresses were set up for temporary repose in the rooms " it was the ancestor of todays war room not surprisingly burrs new york political career turned the old anti federalist tammany society into tammany hall the mother of all modern political machines opponents were horrified noah webster said that burrs campaign style "running about the streets taking every body by the hand squeezing it hard smiling and looking sweet" was not only undignified and dishonest but posed the danger of encouraging a "mr nobody" to think that he was "somebody" by simply running for office this is what hamilton washington and other such eminences most feared about burrs brand of politics that it would stir men without property or status to participate in american politics not just as voters but as leaders in their own right and of course that is precisely what happened it is what unites abraham lincoln and richard daley harry truman and tom delay politics in america burr once wrote was a way of life that brings "fun profit and honor " history has yet to forgive him for pointing this out mr herman is the author of "to rule the waves how the british navy shaped the modern world "
