divers work to bolster oil infrastructure in gulf houston above the waves oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico has almost returned to normal nearly two years after the devastating hurricane season but deep below the surface teams of divers are still working around the clock to steel aging infrastructure against the next storm one of the biggest efforts involves permanently sealing nonproducing wells which can pose an environmental threat when a storm rips apart connecting pipelines and platforms the industry is expected to plug more than wells in the gulf of mexico in from an average of a year between and said neil crawford general manager of applied technologies at tetra technologies inc a woodlands texas based company that specializes in hurricane cleanup "i really think the industry thought these were safe " he said "not many people had any experience in downed platforms until hurricane ivan in " wells can sit idle for years while producers wait for the price of oil or gas to rise to a point where it becomes economical to restart production many of these wells became liabilities for their owners after hurricane ivan in and hurricanes katrina and rita in sank platforms across the region downed platforms more than in alone could often be left where they fell serving as manmade reefs but the damage forced an expensive effort to send divers into the tangle of machinery to prevent connected wells from releasing pent up oil and gas producers are now hoping to avoid a repeat in future storm seasons by pre emptively plugging hundreds of wells they calculate that the expense of insuring wells and government pressure to reduce threats to the environment is more costly than future profits from restarting production mr crawford said "its all about mitigating that risk " mr crawford said speaking to a gathering of the society of petroleum engineers in houston the work is dangerous with divers sometimes forced to blindly feel their way hundreds of feet below the surface through infrastructure that could collapse at any time if a diver comes in contact with oil or gas it can make even routine surfacing and decompression dangerous cleanup is further complicated by the lack of information available about many wells slated to be plugged "the best records are on the platform and if the platform is downed " so are the records mr crawford said some of the biggest challenges remain one platform toppled by hurricane ivan in was later buried by a mudslide at some point divers will need to take care of that mess mr crawford said
