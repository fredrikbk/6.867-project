axis of soros mark malloch brown spoke monday to a crowded auditorium at the world banks headquarters warning that the banks mission was "hugely at risk" as long as paul wolfowitz remained its president only hours earlier news leaked that a special committee investigating mr wolfowitz had accused him of violating conflict of interest rules a coincidence we doubt it mr malloch brown remember was until last year kofi annans deputy at the united nations in that position he distinguished himself by spinning away the &# billion oil for food scandal as little more than a blip in the u n s good work and one that had little to do with mr annan himself last week mr malloch brown was named vice president of the quantum fund the hedge fund run by his billionaire friend george soros a former world bank official himself and ally of soon to be british prime minister gordon brown mr malloch brown would almost surely be a leading candidate to replace mr wolfowitz should he step down not surprisingly gordon brown cold shouldered mr wolfowitz at a recent meeting in brussels the bank presidency would be a neat coup for sir mark and not just because the post has heretofore gone to an american he also stands for everything mr wolfowitz opposes beginning with the issue of corruption consider mr malloch browns defense of the u n s procurement practices "not a penny was lost from the organization " he insisted last year following an audit of the u n s peacekeeping procurement by its office of internal oversight services in fact the office found that &# million had been lost from overpayment &# million worth of contracts showed indications of bid rigging &# million had bypassed u n rules &# million had been lost to mismanagement and &# million had "insufficient" justification thats &# million out of a budget of &# billion and who knows what the auditors missed mr malloch brown also made curious use of english by insisting that paul volckers investigation into oil for food had "fully exonerated" mr annan in fact mr volckers report made an "adverse finding" against the then secretary general among other details the final report noted that mr annan was "aware of saddams kickback scheme at least as early as february " yet never reported it to the u n security council much less the public a clear breach of his fiduciary responsibilities as the u n s chief administrative officer mr malloch brown described the idea that mr annan might resign as "inappropriate political assassination" a standard he apparently doesnt apply to political enemies like mr wolfowitz mr malloch brown never made any serious attempt to reform the u n beyond the cosmetic while doing everything he could to block the real reforms proposed by americans christopher burnham and former ambassador john bolton he was however energetic when it came to lecturing americans about what they owed the u n such as joining the "reformed" human rights council whose only achievement to date has been to castigate israel pursuing a "new multilateral national security " and otherwise empowering the likes of mr malloch brown his multilateral mates and their tax free salaries views like these help explain why mr malloch brown is in such favor with mr soros who has publicly suggested the u s will need a "de nazification" program to erase the taint of the bush administration so close are the two that mr malloch brown lives in a suburban new york home owned by mr soros mr malloch brown says he pays market rent though reporting by the new york suns benny avni disputes that in any case its safe to assume that mr soross widely published views are close to mr malloch browns somewhat more guarded ones so its not surprising that many on the world bank staff would cheer mr malloch brown hes perfect for an institutional culture in which "progressive" thinking goes hand in glove with a tolerance for corruption that culture has been on vivid display in the euro coup against mr wolfowitz this weekend the committee investigating the claims dropped its page report in the presidents lap and told him he had hours to respond in direct violation of world bank staff rule which states that "the amount of time allowed a staff member to comment on an investigative report will not be less than business days " following protests from mr wolfowitzs lawyer the committee gave him hours this is the same kangaroo court that last month leaked its guilty verdict to the washington post before mr wolfowitz even had a chance to plead his case our sources who have seen the committees report tell us it is especially critical of mr wolfowitz for daring to object publicly to the committees methods and thereby bringing the banks name into disrepute the europeans running this red queen proceeding prefer that they be able to smear with selective leaks without rebuttal mr malloch brown warned on monday that if mr wolfowitz stayed as president european countries might withhold funding from the next financing round for the banks international development association we hope hes right though we know few european finance ministers who arent eager to throw good money after bad still its a remarkable bit of chutzpah for the man who downplayed corruption at the u n to seek the ouster of the man who has fought to reduce corruption at the world bank if the bush administration now abandons mr wolfowitz as he faces a decision from the banks board of governors it will not only betray a friend but hand the biggest victory yet to its audacious enemies in the george soros axis see
