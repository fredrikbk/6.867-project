medicare meltdown whats going to happen when the money runs out for medicare a recently released report by the programs trustees found that within seven years medicare taxes will fall short of medicare expenses by more than whats more medicare and social security combined are on track to eat up the entire federal budget while the bulk of medicare dollars comes from payroll taxes and beneficiary premiums a large and growing share of medicare expenses is borne by general taxpayers and although the same law that created the new medicare drug benefit also requires the president to propose remedial legislation congress is not required to actually do anything the trustees wake up call comes none too soon but what is needed are not minor adjustments a major overhaul is in order the projected cash flow deficits in these two programs are staggering for social security the trustees estimate the year burden on general revenues at &# trillion for medicare the comparable burden on general revenues is &# trillion even after allowing the current transfers to grow with the economy thus the total burden these programs will impose on federal finances over the next years is &# trillion more than six times the current outstanding federal debt looking beyond years into the indefinite future the combined long run funding gap for social security and medicare is &# trillion in todays dollars members of congress will not have to wait long to experience the practical effects of all of this until a few years ago social security and medicare were taking in more than they spent on the whole thus they provided revenue for other federal programs that situation is now reversed and last year the combined deficits in the two programs claimed of federal income tax revenues in years these two programs will require more than a fourth of income tax revenues in other words in just years the federal government will have to stop spending one out of every four non entitlement dollars in order to balance the budget and keep its promises to the elderly as more and more baby boomers reach retirement the financial picture will deteriorate rapidly by about the midpoint of the baby boomer retirement years these two programs will require almost one out of every two federal income tax dollars by they will require nearly two out of every three federal income tax dollars eventually the deficits in these two programs will absorb the entire federal budget could we force the elderly to pay for future deficits with higher medicare premiums monthly premiums in constant dollars would more than quadruple by and be almost times their current level by at that point the required monthly premiums would consume more than the entire social security benefit from which they are automatically deducted for average wage earners using taxation to fund the projected medicare shortfalls is equally unpalatable we would need a increase in all nonpayroll taxes by and a increase by the close of the trustees year projection period so what else can be done in general no reform should be taken very seriously unless it is specifically designed to slow the rate of growth of health care spending on the demand side someone must choose between health care and other uses of money that is someone must decide that the next mri scan or the next knee replacement for example is not worth the cost such decisions could be made by seniors themselves by the government as it is in other countries or by private insurers operating under government rationing rules on the supply side the way health care is produced must fundamentally be changed replacing cost increasing innovations with cost reducing ones to examine consequences of beneficiaries making their own rationing decisions my colleague andrew rettenmaier and i estimated the effects of creating reformed medicare based on a &# deductible health savings account hsa beginning with the baby boomer retirees the size of the deductible and the hsa would grow through time as health costs grow and since deposits would be made with after tax dollars withdrawals for any purpose would be tax free in this way beneficiaries would be encouraged to make their own tradeoffs between health care and every other good or service we estimate the effects would result in a reduction in medicares unfunded liability by between and we did not attempt to estimate the impact of this reform on the supply side of medicare however there is ample evidence that when people spend their own money on health services supply side responses are considerable this implies that a properly designed hsa could help us get off of the current spending course in two ways first it could allow the elderly to reallocate health care dollars to goods and services they value more secondly it could spur providers to deliver care more efficiently even with these reforms however we must still address the problem of pay as you go financing today every dollar in medicare payroll taxes is immediately spent nothing is saved nothing is invested the payroll taxes contributed by todays workers pay the medical benefits of todays retirees however when todays workers retire their benefits will be paid only if the next generation of workers agrees to pay even higher taxes the alternative is to move to a funded system in which each generation saves and invests in order to pay for its own benefits yet to take advantage of this potential we need to act quickly we must introduce reforms that capture the earning potential of the baby boom generation before they escape into retirement and leave the young with a burden that will be increasingly burdensome unless we increase our level of saving now we will leave our children and grandchildren strapped with escalating tax rates if nothing is done social security and medicare deficits will engulf the entire federal budget if our policy makers wait to address the growing deficits until they are out of control the solutions will be drastic and painful let us hope that the current wake up call is not ignored mr saving is a public trustee of the social security and medicare system director
