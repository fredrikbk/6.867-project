fiscally fit a driving question donating an suv to charity is worth it but will the deduction trigger an audit online edition gerry and i finally decided to do something about our old suv which has been sitting largely unused for the last months the tired ford explorer has more than miles on it and while it still runs fairly well we havent really needed it since my father in law generously gave us a more reliable car wed originally planned to park the suv on a local lot with a for sale best offer sign but life always seemed to get in the way of that plan then we lent the suv to my brother in law brian when he had car trouble we offered to give it to him but after his car was fixed he declined later gerry and i talked about simply donating the car to get rid of the &# liability insurance coverage and &# annual registration payments and avoid the hassle of selling it our church could probably put it to good use we thought but then i heard about a charitable organization in our community that accepts donated cars and gives them to needy families that need a car to find work growing up in the city i was within walking distance of just about everything the grocery store the movies even my first job i remembered what it was like when i moved from the city to the suburbs and was floored that you needed a car to do practically everything from our home id need to walk the equivalent of city blocks and cross a major state highway just to buy a gallon of milk when i moved to the burbs my car was a clunker so i understood the woes of families struggling financially and lacking reliable transportation the charity sounded like a good cause so gerry and i decided to look into how to donate our suv i wanted to make sure we did it right writing off large non cash donations such as cars real estate or art is one of the quickest ways to trigger an irs audit according to the american institute of philanthropy indeed in the federal government changed the rules regarding car donations after a study by the u s general accounting office found donors were overestimating the value of donated cars on their tax returns according to the irs many taxpayers were deducting the cars top guidebook values regardless of the vehicles actual condition weve got nothing to hide as far as the irs is concerned but wed like to avoid any hassle since our suv is such an old vehicle we expected the write off would be small perhaps too small to risk an audit we itemize deductions so the cars value would be deductible as a gift if we took the standard deduction we wouldnt be able to write off the donation we also needed to make sure the group id found qualified as a charitable organization in the eyes of the irs it was listed as a private non profit organization under irs code c a status i verified by checking irs publication which has a searchable list of all organizations that qualify to receive deductible donations how much of a donation can you deduct depends on what the charity does with the donated vehicle most charities sell the cars they receive if we donated the car to a charity that planned to sell it to raise cash the deduction couldnt exceed the gross proceeds from the sale large charities often sell donated cars in bulk to car dealers or auction houses so the amount of the deduction could be as little as &# in such a case within days the charity would provide a certification that the car was sold "at arms length" between unrelated parties along with the sale price the charity wed chosen will use our suv for charitable purposes rather than sell it so under the new rules wed generally be allowed to deduct the fair market value of the suv to find the fair market value we checked the kelley blue books used car value guide the irs says the deduction cant exceed the "private party value" which isnt the same as the vehicles trade in value or the suggested retail value i was shocked to see that the private party value of our suv in fair condition was &# were the suv in excellent condition which it isnt the value would be &# since the suvs value is more than &# wed need to get a written acknowledgement of the donation from the charity and attach irs form c contributions of motor vehicles boats and airplanes and form noncash charitable contributions to our tax return the charitys acknowledgment letter generally includes information such as the cars estimated fair market value the vehicle identification number and specifics about what the charity intends to do with the vehicle if our suvs value was &# or less wed only need the charitys written acknowledgement if the vehicle was worth &# or more wed also need to pay for an independent appraisal when i contacted the charity i was told it would provide all of the information we needed along with a document confirming the charitys tax exempt status before the charity will accept the vehicle however our suv needs to pass an inspection to make sure its in good working order after the transaction is complete well drop the car from our insurance policy and the registration fees and save &# a year but should we take the &# deduction and risk an audit when we file our returns next year mildred carter a senior tax analyst at tax information publisher cch inc says our concerns may be overblown "i would assume that there would actually be less risk of an audit now because theres such strict documentation required " she says "of course the taxpayers who dont know about the rule change and are still valuing the cars based on the blue book may have some problems " in general the risk of being audited is low about of the million returns filed in were audited still the irs increased the number of audits on individual tax returns to million in fiscal from just in fiscal gerry and i are at a slightly higher risk of an audit because our income level exceeds &# about of tax returns were audited for taxpayers earning between &# and &# million though of these were so called correspondence audits which usually just ask for additional documentation to back up information on the return were we earning &# million or more the odds of an audit would jump to and more than half of those were field audits in which the irs rolls up its sleeves and digs deep into your finances gerry didnt want to invite additional scrutiny by irs computers that home in on car donations you can read more about other audit triggers here but i convinced him we should take the deduction the average amount deducted for a car donation per return was &# in the latest data available right in line with our suvs value so our deduction probably wont send up a red flag as being suspiciously inflated and odds are if we are audited it will be a correspondence audit and well have the proper paperwork to back up the deduction to further support our claim well take photos of the exterior and interior of the car and keep our maintenance records but theres another reason i think we should take the donation charitable contributions are one of the few deductions allowed under the alternative minimum tax amt which were likely to pay this year the amt was enacted in to make sure that wealthy individuals dont avoid paying federal income taxes it was never indexed for inflation however and today many taxpayers making &# or less are paying it particularly those like us who live in areas with a high cost of living and high state and local taxes the deduction will help offset the tax bite of the amt and we hope the donation will help a family less fortunate than ours do you avoid taking certain tax deductions because you fear triggering an audit were you audited after taking a car donation deduction share your audit horror stories
