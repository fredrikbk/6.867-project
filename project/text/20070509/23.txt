business a word to motorola give us more than bafflegab most financial analysts spend their time poring over numbers laura rittenhouse spends hers studying words for the past nine years ms rittenhouse an ex investment banker at lehman brothers has analyzed annual shareholder letters from the chief executives of big companies and ranked them based on candor and the information provided her inspiration is warren buffett whose annual opus has a cult following and who once said every ceo should be required to write his or her own shareholder letter if they cant explain what theyre doing mr buffett reasons theres a good chance they dont know for the past three years motorola has ranked near the bottom of ms rittenhouses list chief executive ed zanders shareholder letter was th out of a hundred last year and th out of a hundred the year before "bafflegab " ms rittenhouse calls it "motorola tells you nothing there are no financial or operating goals " and an immense amount of what she calls "fog" spin jargon cliche and confusion her favorite line comes from the letter "motorolas going to own seamless mobility where todays hottest technology is converging where the mobile me lives where mobile broadband means everything everywhere and anything anywhere " "orwellian " she calls it a motorola representative said the company is "always working to make our annual report letter more useful to our shareholders by outlining our strategy technology and business goals " none of this mattered of course when motorolas razr phone was selling like tickle me elmo mr zander could have quoted from the schaumburg ill phone book in his annual letter and shareholders wouldnt have cared the company was making money the stock was going up and he was a genius but the good times ended last fall in its push for market share motorola turned the razr into a money loser and the company didnt have a phone with the next generation of technology ready to pick up the slack as a result motorola reported a loss for the first quarter and watched its share price fall from &# a share last october to less than &# a share today needless to say shareholders arent happy they now want to know how mr zander is going to turn the company around and the verbal fog isnt comforting i sat next to ms rittenhouse at the companys annual meeting in chicago on monday afternoon she had just come from berkshire hathaways annual meeting in omaha neb and the contrast couldnt have been greater no barbecue no ping pong no celebration and not much candor mr zander put up a powerpoint screen with the words "right strategy right assets right people " he urged shareholders to look at how well the company was doing in businesses other than mobile phones he promised things would be better by the end of and he promised to unveil some new and compelling products next week but i didnt come away with a clear sense of how the company was going to get out of its hole nor did ms rittenhouse "it was all generalities " she said the good news for mr zander is that carl icahn cant seem to articulate clear ideas for turning around the company either when he first launched his campaign against motorola his focus was on getting the company to disgorge the huge pile of cash it was hoarding mr zander has done much of that agreeing to more than &# billion in share buybacks on monday the issue was whether mr icahn should be given a seat on the board of directors shareholders on balance said "no " and for good reason if the question is which of these men can do a better job investing unused cash ill side with mr icahn but if the question is who can fix the mobile phone business mr icahns value is less clear in his comments at the annual meeting mr icahn acknowledged he probably didnt have enough shareholder support to win as a result he said "well have to wait six months" to see whether mr zander has a turnaround plan that works six months is probably all mr zander has while he can take some comfort from his win over mr icahn the message from shareholders was clear if you cant tell us show us and in todays unforgiving environment dont expect our patience to last much longer
