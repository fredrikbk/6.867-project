farmland grows on investors private equity firms are starting to look for profits on the farm in the last year the soaring price of farmland fueled by demand for corn and ethanol and increased popularity of ranch land has attracted a small but budding group of private equity investors several deals for private equity firms to buy farm and ranch land have closed or are in negotiation in states such as illinois which has some of the nations best farmland yet obstacles remain quality farmland is difficult to find the investment isnt liquid and not everyone is convinced that the ethanol craze wont burn out despite massive investments by some agricultural giants despite potential hurdles a lot of people are betting that farmland thrives for at least the next several seasons the returns on both farmland and crops have been good and producers are able to lock in high corn prices "farmland has very little volatility and it has very consistent earnings " says joel r hertz chairman of hertz farm management in monticello ill the annual return from crops has been to a year not counting land appreciation while private equity "cant trade in farmland like they do in stocks and bonds " says mr hertz "theyre now getting into it because of ethanol and land prices going up " in some parts of iowa he says land values have increased to in the past months "its a sellers market " says mr hertz "theres very little land and a lot of people looking to buy " steve wright vice president of the midwest region for j p morgan and a senior farm manager in lafayette ind says "i think the american farmer is going to make more money in than ever " mr wright who is giving a private equity firm advice about farmland says the numbers speak for themselves the demand for ethanol which is created from corn pushed the price of a bushel of corn from &# in early harvest last fall to &# by the end of harvest its currently about &# to &# at the same time land prices have soared high quality farmland in places such as indiana illinois and iowa climbed from about &# to &# an acre to &# an acre "the last six months ive definitely gotten a lot more calls from private equity managers and hedge funds " says jeffrey conrad president of hancock agricultural investment group a farmland investment advisory firm in boston its clients are all institutional and often pension funds don mccabe president of soy capital ag services is working with an east coast brokerage firm to establish a private equity fund before the next buying season which typically runs after harvest he anticipates an to annual return which while lower than many private equity investments is very stable "its a consistent steady type of return " says mr mccabe that he says makes it a good match for pension funds which want predictability and dont mind investing for long term returns "one of the dilemmas is whether the farmland will have the capacity to support the extra dollars " says mr mccabe thats because not only are farmers not selling in several states "anticorporate farming" laws prohibit corporations or non u s citizens from buying the land however in recent years the courts have thrown out several of the laws and more are expected to go carl palmer co founder at beartooth capital partners in bozeman mont has raised more than &# million for the one year old private equity firm the company invests in "ecologically important" ranch land beartooth makes improvements in the ranch land it buys it then sells the conservation rights to environmental groups and the actual land to individuals who want a ranch for hunting fishing and horseback riding the fund requires a &# minimum investment and expects a return of more than investors "love the fact that its a diversification opportunity " says mr palmer an environmentalist who worked on the investment model for the company while receiving his m b a at stanford university "this is a great real estate investment " the price of farmland had been increasing steadily in recent years often because it gets snapped up to feed urban sprawl but the value has continued to climb even as the residential market has cooled says mike duffy an economics professor at iowa state university in ames in the average value of an acre of iowa farmland climbed to an all time high of &# in some counties the price jumped to more than &# an acre and in eastern iowa it was more than &# the highest ever recorded the u s department of agricultures national agricultural statistics service in march said u s farmers intended to plant more acres of corn in producers plan to plant million acres million more acres than in and the largest area since the report attributes the increase to favorable corn prices because of the greater demand from ethanol producers as well as strong export sales how long farmland will benefit is the big question "as i look at it right now " mr duffy says "the next five years look good " but he warns that long term questions remain about farm subsidies the demand for ethanol and fluctuations in the price of oil and gasoline
