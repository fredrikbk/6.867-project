for ge no lack of ideas as frustrated investors identify units to sell others back status quo increasingly restive general electric co shareholders frustrated with six years of meager returns are pressuring chairman jeffrey immelt to break up the conglomerate but some shareholders and analysts argue that ges sprawling businesses are better off together than apart ges big umbrella these investors say can balance differing product and economic cycles while helping all its businesses financially and that would boost the stock price over the longer term "the main appeal of ge is its diversification " says mark demos portfolio manager at fifth third asset management which owns million ge shares he says this isnt the time to break up the company because global economic trends and investor sentiment are moving toward bigger more international companies such as ge "we could be seeing somewhat of a change there " he says merrill lynch analyst john inch who last year advocated spinning off or selling the consumer finance and nbc universal entertainment units appears to have had second thoughts in a note earlier this year mr inch suggested that the technology savvy mr immelt could strengthen ge by bolstering its media and entertainment division with an internet focused acquisition mr inch was unavailable for comment the "keep ge together" crowd appears to have a strong ally in mr immelt who has resisted past calls to sell nbc universal mr immelt has repeatedly expressed his frustrations with ges stock price which is down since he took over in september while the dow jones industrial average is up over the past five years this year mr immelt has taken crucial steps to rejigger ges portfolio strengthening its aviation and oil and natural gas units while putting a for sale sign on its storied plastics unit so far this year ge shares which are listed on the new york stock exchange are essentially flat while the dow industrials are up nearly in p m composite trading yesterday ges stock fell cents to &# the shares currently trade at roughly times ges projected per share earnings cheaper than other big industrial companies such as united technologies corp and honeywell international inc but investor sentiment on nbc may be changing lehman brothers analyst robert cornell who rates ge a "buy " says nbc universal is "coming out of the down cycle " following weak prime time ratings at the network some worry that ge might sell off its entertainment unit before it rebounds robert spremulli managing director of equity research at tiaa cref who has been following ge for nearly years recalls ge selling a unit that owned cable tv systems in the s "right afterward cable took off and became a star " he says mr spremulli says ge which has a market value of more than &# billion should focus for now on improving operations at its existing businesses though he thinks the company might someday consider a sale of the entertainment unit tiaa cref owns more than million ge shares whats more splitting off big pieces of ge could ultimately lower the entire companys valuation if for example it divested itself of nbc universal the company would be even more heavily weighted toward financial services businesses which generally get lower valuations than the industrial units in the first quarter financial services already accounted for more than of ges profit to address that some investors have suggested mr immelt also shed financial units such as the consumer finance unit called ge money or the real estate group but getting rid of ge money would create other issues and mightnt unlock the value shareholders dream about part of ge moneys success stems from ges triple a credit rating which allows the unit to borrow money at lower rates than many competitors get freed from ge the unit would have higher borrowing costs making it less profitable ge money also is one of ges biggest growth engines particularly in emerging markets such as india where it plays a key role in introducing ge to the country ubs analyst david bleustein questions the costs of breaking up ge noting that tyco international will spend more than &# billion separating itself into three parts he also expressed concern over the possible tax consequences of selling a unit and he said ge might have to compensate bondholders who bought debt from ge money backed by ges triple a rating mr bleustein has a "buy" recommendation on ges stock ubs provides investment banking services to ge still the stagnant stock has investors clamoring for mr immelt to do something citigroup inc analyst jeffrey sprague catalyzed the recent debate with an april note suggesting that ge consider spinning off or selling nbc universal and ge money ge shares rose following the analysts call mr sprague who rates the stock a "buy " also argued that ge should divest itself of its rapidly growing real estate unit which has &# billion in assets he says ge effectively limits the growth of its financial businesses to protect its valuation freed from ge he says those units could grow faster and increase in value "its a no brainer they should be thinking about it " says jim bitter an analyst with wilmington trust investment management which has &# billion in assets and has million ge shares mr bitter doesnt expect mr immelt to take immediate action but he says investors "will move away from the stock" if there are no changes at ge in a brief conversation last week mr immelt called mr spragues note "interesting " but he declined to elaborate j p morgan chase analyst stephen tusa who rates the stock a "buy " has argued that ge could divest itself of part but not all of ge money that would allow the rest of commercial and consumer lending to continue to grow without its current constraints
