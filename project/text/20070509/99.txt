politics &amp economics a royal lesson for clinton french candidates loss shows need to balance gender based appeal elections abroad featuring female candidates including this weeks contest in france dont answer the question of how open americans are to electing their first woman president but they do offer this hint voters have become more receptive to females who project gender bending strength and substance as sen hillary rodham clinton tries to do and more likely to reject those who dont socialist segolene royal lost her bid to be frances first female president after a campaign in which she played up her motherhood and underplayed policy details while conservative winner nicolas sarkozy emphasized a hard line platform against crime and immigration in contrast angela merkel won election in as germanys first female chancellor with a campaign so focused on the dry economics of tax rates and labor rules that female commentators complained "she has not shown any enthusiasm for so called womens politics " germanys best known feminist alice schwarzer sniped at the time now as mrs clinton seeks the democratic nomination and the chance to make u s history the dicey politics of gender are central to the new york senators strategy she uses her gender to advantage where she can "this is going to be an election about change " and "one big one is hillarys gender " says ann lewis a top clinton strategist "the excitement she engenders among women is an important asset " yet in her campaign and beyond there is a sense that while voters overwhelmingly tell pollsters they arent opposed to a woman as president in fact they expect women to meet a higher standard for toughness and leadership that is especially true pollsters say for running the worlds richest and mightiest nation "there is a credibility threshhold that women candidates have to cross that more often is assumed for men " says ms lewis even though "voters are far more open to electing women as a general proposition " "one of the challenges is that commander in chief is so much of the job description " says democratic pollster peter hart who conducts polls for the wall street journal with republican neil newhouse "when you are the worlds superpower that is a hurdle that any woman candidate will have to deal with " so mrs clinton doggedly refuses to apologize for her vote authorizing force in iraq despite pressure from party liberals and she vows swift retaliation if the u s is again attacked by terrorists "commander in chief" was the clinton campaigns headline on a news release after her promised retribution in answer to a question at democrats recent debate in south carolina "hillary clinton showed that she is ready to be president of the united states " it boasted ruth mandel a professor at the center for american women and politics at rutgers university in new jersey resists comparing the u s and other countries given the political and cultural differences "with very few exceptions the women who have risen to the top have done so in nations that are not the most powerful " she says often they are members of ruling dynasties propelled to office by assassination or other political upheaval political trends have linked the globes democracies before the ascension of conservative margaret thatcher as britains prime minister in signaled a trans atlantic turn to the right that was confirmed a year later by republican ronald reagans election as u s president followed by the rise to power of helmut kohl in germany by bill clintons election telegraphed a switch toward the left that presaged the rise of tony blair in britain and gerhard schroeder in germany as for gender observers of political trends say women have had an easier time reaching the top in parliamentary systems of government where heads of state are chosen by their colleagues in the ruling party than in places like the u s that pick leaders through national elections parliamentary governments produced some of the best known female heads of state of recent decades including mrs thatcher pakistans benazir bhutto indira ghandi of india and golda meir of israel that same dynamic in which a woman is chosen from among political colleagues who have seen their leadership potential first hand helps explain why the u s has its first female house speaker democratic rep nancy pelosi of

violence and defending frances hour work week for helping working women spend more time with their children she appealed to mothers with reminders of her own four children "i want to urge those who hesitate to make a bold choice " ms royal said at the end of a televised debate against mr sarkozy days before last sundays election "i know that for some its not easy to imagine that a woman can exercise the highest responsibilities " in the beginning ms royals attention to womens issues boosted her popularity helping her rise from back bench socialist politician to the partys presidential candidate in little more than a year but many say that in the end she may have tried a little too hard to play the gender card according to exit polls sunday ms royal pulled in of the female vote
