rx for change sweden clamps down on sick and disability pay once freely dispensed benefits face scrutiny ms lanstroem is cut off lulea sweden lotta landstroem is allergic to electricity so says her doctor along with hundreds of other swedes diagnosed with the condition in recent years she came to rely on state funded sick pay but last year swedens famously generous welfare system cut off ms landstroem a year old former teacher electro hypersensitivity isnt widely recognized elsewhere in the world as a medical diagnosis the decision to end her two years of benefits was part of a broad effort to crack down on sickness and disability benefits according to swedish welfare officials swedes are among the healthiest people in the world according to the world health organization and yet of working age swedes live on some type of disability benefit the highest proportion on the globe to explain this many swedish policymakers doctors and economists blame a welfare system that is too lax and does little to verify individual claims at a time when low cost competition from asia is clobbering europes markets and straining its generous welfare states governments from finland to portugal are trying to cut back and get more people to work swedens bloated sick bay which includes roughly people on extended leave has caused soul searching about whether the system coddles swedes and encourages them to feel sick "if we dont look out we will end up with only two thirds of the labor force in work and one third out living on different kinds of subsidies " said swedens new prime minister fredrik reinfeldt in an interview earlier this year sweden offers two kinds of benefits for those unable to work for health reasons sick pay for those who expect to return to their jobs when they recover and disability pensions for those who arent expected to re enter the work force both types of benefits pay recipients of their previous salary up to a maximum of swedish kronor or &# a month even swedes eligible for sick pay can collect benefits from the government for many years last year costs for these programs totaled billion kronor or &# billion the payments consumed of swedens budget or of the countrys gross domestic product mr reinfeldts government has introduced a range of measures designed to get people off benefits and back into work but its slow going part of the problem is cheating and a system that still relies heavily on trust during the monthlong world cup soccer finals short term sick leave among swedish men suspiciously rose by earlier this year police in swedens capital city stockholm investigated the local chapter of the hells angels biker gang for suspected benefit fraud because of the gang were on extended sickness benefits the same doctor had certified them all as suffering from depression police have closed the investigation while welfare authorities deliberate whether to press charges in europe roughly of the working age population or million people depend on various government benefits as their sole or main income compared with in the u s thats a major economic handicap program costs aside high benefit dependency means fewer workers and less production it also means lower tax revenues and added spending burdens for european governments already struggling to finance the pensions of a burgeoning elderly population that fiscal pressure pushes up taxes on people who do work and on employers already paying much higher wages than their competitors in china and other emerging economies most mainstream politicians in europe stress they dont want to pare down welfare to u s levels which voters would reject but to make europes preferred "social model" of capitalism more viable "im reshaping part of sweden im not tearing it down " says mr reinfeldt still change is under way swedens new government has beefed up programs to get some people receiving sick benefits back into the work force in lulea a windblown steel town on the frozen baltic sea coast miles from the arctic circle four case workers at the local employment service have been selecting people from the long term sick list for intensive personal coaching some have been home so long theyve become reclusive the case workers say "some people shake and sweat just to meet us " says stefan granberg a case worker he and his colleagues find local employers willing to give their candidates work experience with the state paying their wages at first with luck the employer likes them and takes them on so far this year the team has eased people into paid jobs out of cases they have tackled one of them is year old eva eriksson who had been on sick leave for six years after she was diagnosed with depression welfare authorities sent her a monthly check she didnt want to go back to her former job in a lighting store she couldnt deal with always having to be nice to customers she says even driving past the store made her tremble she told the employment service shed rather work with horses so the case workers who knew the stable owner arranged a subsidized job placement when a vacancy arose the stable hired her in the s the united kingdom became one of europes first governments to require people receiving unemployment benefits to actively pursue work or training it borrowed some ideas from the u s where welfare to work programs have weaned many people off benefits and into the labor market helping to raise employment especially among single mothers more recently the netherlands has cut back on generous early pensions that led many people to retire at germany meanwhile has slashed benefits for the long term unemployed in an attempt to push the able bodied back to work mr reinfeldt has introduced a new policy in sweden waiving the usual payroll tax if employers hire a person who has been out of work for over a year since the perk was introduced in january employers have used it to hire more than people most of those however were from the ranks of the unemployed just were from swedens sick rolls which the organization for economic cooperation and development a paris based intergovernment think tank calls "swedens single biggest economic problem " lulea loses days a year per worker to sickness or disability compared with canada which loses days per worker according to government data local employers here complain that labor shortages are holding them back from fully exploiting an economic boom in the region yet thousands are on prolonged sick leave ms landstroem left her teaching job four years ago after she deduced that electro magnetic radiation from lights computers and cellphones was causing her nausea and skin irritations after examining her in an unlit trailer a doctor certified that she was hypersensitive to electricity the world health organization says the symptoms of this controversial condition which has also been reported in countries such as denmark and germany are real and can be severely disabling but it notes there is no scientific proof they are caused by electricity for some sufferers the cause may be psychological the who says welfare authorities awarded ms landstroem benefits worth of her salary she stripped the electric lights and appliances from her red wood clad house in a forest outside lulea social workers delivered food and other supplies to her home the terse letter informing ms landstroem that her benefits wouldnt be renewed described her as having a "completely normal medical status " other swedes who had lost their benefits for electrical allergies advised her to say she was depressed but she refused on principle "im not depressed im electro hypersensitive " she said recently sitting at her kitchen table beneath a pair of oil lamps now she receives regular unemployment benefits but those are limited to a total of days she says she plans to work during the summer as a churchyard gardener but once the snow returns in the fall theres little outdoor work away from electrical sources in lulea "swedish people walk around believing someone will take care of them if everything breaks down i guess i dont trust that any more " said ms landstroem "were gradually copying the american system " swedens last social democrat government began the clampdown pushing the welfare authorities to annul sickness benefits if they had doubts mr reinfeldts new government elected last september is going further its lowering the ceiling for benefits expanding projects to rehabilitate some of the people on long term sick or disability benefits as well as offering employers tax breaks and wage subsidies to hire them most of swedens boom in sickness absenteeism since the late s is about more than simple fraud sick leave for psychological conditions such as depression burnout or panic attacks has rocketed over of the population complain of anxiety syndromes "we are actually the safest country in the world " says david eberhard chief psychiatrist at st goerans hospital in stockholm but "people are feeling psychologically worse and worse " assar lindbeck one of swedens best known economists says the lenient welfare state has changed the country over the past generation in place of the old protestant work ethic it has become acceptable to feel unable to work and to live on benefits he says "i would not call it cheating " prof lindbeck says "i would call it a drift in attitudes and social norms " by being so accommodating the swedish system has encouraged swedes to treat lifes tribulations as clinical issues requiring sick leave posits anna hedborg a former social democrat cabinet minister "as time has passed we have medicalized all sorts of problems " stockholm general practitioner par saberg recently saw a patient who wanted sick leave for double vision headaches and amnesia but after scans revealed no neurological cause dr saberg began chatting with the man it turned out that his wife wanted a divorce his business partner was an alcoholic and his company was going downhill dr saberg counseled the man to sort out his life figuring his symptoms were due to stress in the end the wife stayed the business partner left and the man felt better "i have to be a kind of life coach with this kind of patient " says dr saberg until recently he says swedish doctors including himself were too fast to sign a sick note to authorize benefits welfare officials rarely questioned them in swedens remote northern reaches controls were especially lax from the late s the swedish social insurance agency branch in lulea began receiving a deluge of sick notes "everyone who said they were sick was getting money we didnt demand anything " says ingrid nilsson the local agencys director "i guess that was the wrong way to go " the upsurge began at a time of high unemployment in the area after companies and the public sector laid off workers those left with jobs had to work harder and many complained to their doctors about stress "we tried to take care of people too much " says ms nilsson her staff has since become more rigorous "we dont question that you are sick but maybe you can work anyway " she says truck driver henrik who lives near lulea and would only give his middle name says he relied on state support for four years after suffering a slipped disc the pain didnt stop the big brawny invalid from moonlighting as a nightclub bouncer on weekends though "there were no controls " he scoffs admitting that it was easy to scam the government he tried returning to full time work as a driving instructor but his back pain returned this time despite getting a sick note the welfare authorities said "no " today hes back driving trucks and takes painkillers "we pay a lot of taxes but now we dont get any help " he says benefit applicants used to hearing "yes" dont always take kindly to the new approach earlier this month a client threatened to break a welfare officers fingers luleas social insurance agency installed heavy security doors and keypad locks after receiving a bomb threat and other scares catarina lindgren was on sick leave for years she was when she first suffered panic attacks and her doctor prescribed extended leave therapy eventually cured the panic attacks but while on leave she became depressed and afraid of meeting people "looking back over all these years maybe being at home made it worse " she says last year the welfare authorities finally pressed her to take a job and in january she began working for her parents window fitting business "i thought it was going to be much harder but it isnt " she says
