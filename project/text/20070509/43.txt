drug coated stents are often used off label two studies on drug coated stents show the heart devices are commonly used in complex cases that go beyond what health regulators have approved and that risks are heightened in such cases the studies though came to some different conclusions the studies tracked patients at a large number of u s medical centers and were made public by the journal of the american medical association one study concluded that while there were increased risks seen in more complex cases the risks were relatively low the other study found a higher rate of problems in so called "off label" cases though and urged doctors to be careful in applying evidence from controlled "on label" trials to complex cases the studies come at a time of questions about device safety and off label usage though the food and drug administration has approved two coated stents for straightforward cases one by johnson &amp johnson and the other by boston scientific corp the studies backed signs that the stents are really used about half the time or more in more complex cases
