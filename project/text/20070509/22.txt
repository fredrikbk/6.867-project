business world how the gop won health care how goes the cold war we refer to the never ending twilight struggle between advocates of socialized medicine in america and those who believe economically competent americans should be required to budget and save for their own health care as they do for the rest of their personal consumption any cold war wouldnt live up to its name and reputation if the two sides didnt occasionally change uniforms and borrow each others rhetoric and tactics but from a squinty angle republicans might just be winning this one the latest flashpoint is "medicare advantage " a gop initiative to entice beneficiaries to sign up for a private insurance option in lieu of traditional medicares direct payment of doctors and hospitals bills more than eight million medicare beneficiaries now get their benefits this way about of the eligible population democrats like rep pete stark of california are alarmed they accuse republicans of seeking to "privatize" medicare turning it into a voucher program to buy health insurance with most of the subsidies restricted to needy seniors theyre right republicans like rep jim mccrery respond that democrats want to eliminate the private insurance option for medicare and bring the country "one step closer to a socialist style government run health care system " hes right thats where clarity ends in the twilight struggle notice for starters that medicare advantage is thriving because of deliberate subsidies over and above the cost of existing medicare directed at private insurers taxpayers shell out about more for each beneficiary than they do for a traditional medicare subscriber worth about &# year the extra money buys extra benefits not available in the traditional program as well as reduced copays and deductibles as they did with the big new medicare drug benefit republicans have usurped democrats role as santa claus to the middle class health insurers once reliable bad guys who elicited boos in movie theaters have been reborn as giant government contractors naacp once a reliable democratic ally now lobbies to keep subsidies flowing to private insurers saying the extra benefits are a godsend to poor seniors it gets worse aarp the old folks lobby has been turning itself into the insurance industrys marketing arm it recently signed deals with two of the biggest insurers unitedhealth and aetna to sell aarp branded insurance to the over crowd who will then be ripe to be rolled into aarp branded medicare plans when they hit insurers have been losing corporate business as companies cut back on health benefits and shoo their employees into health savings accounts the industry increasingly looks to government to fill up their book of business result a growing compatibility of interests between insurers and the senior lobby aarp for one expects to earn &# billion over six years by lending its name to plans peddled to seniors even the universal access issue is slipping from democratic grasp as republican governors experiment with mandates requiring all citizens to have private insurance with insurance lobbyists cheering on and democrats are being checkmated on the electoral map according to blue cross any attempt to cut back on medicare advantage would mean reduced benefits for voters in ohio in pennsylvania in michigan etc so far the counterstrategy has been pitiful pitiful led by hillary clinton senate democrats suddenly discovered an urgent need to expand spending on childrens health care by &# billion over five years a sum conveniently equal to medicare advantages subsidy over the same period dutiful newspaper columnists peddled the predictable oldie moldy by resisting cuts in medicare advantage republicans are favoring insurance industry ceos democrats favor children the fallacy here is obvious all federal dollars are created equal if more spending on childrens health care is such a good idea the federal budget is a cornucopia of programs to cut farm price supports ethanol subsidies the homeland security boondoggle and democrats control the purse strings these days no wonder mr stark one of his partys authoritative voices on health care laments the good old days when democrats and republicans had the same agenda for medicare expanding it while trying here and there to make it more efficient "but in no circumstance did republicans feel that we should disband medicare and i think that is the principle difference " he complained late last year his nostalgia is touching but omits a key fact with an unfunded liability of &# trillion in present value business as usual for medicare is not a practical agenda quietly means testing is already arriving to sully the programs image as a universal entitlement starting this year with seniors earning more than &# a year quietly medicares trustees under a new law have been required to declare their first "funding warning" because dedicated taxes and premiums will meet less than of the programs costs within seven years republicans however convoluted and spendthrift have a strategy turning medicare into a welfare program for poor seniors democrats have only a feckless hope that if they stall long enough the problems will be so bad that the american people will vote for a universal government run health system that strategy is already a loser however long the war drags on
