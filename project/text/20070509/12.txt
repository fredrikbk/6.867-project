as web ads grow sites get trickier about targeting you it may not be the bad old days of online hucksterism when inescapable pop up ads used the promise of computerized voyeurism to pitch cheap surveillance cameras but as the internet continues to draw ad dollars away from television and print media advertisers are getting bolder and more graphic in theirs ads and web sites are learning which tricks they can and cant pull to get visitors to watch them advertisers say the biggest thing in online ads these days is "rich media " a catchall phrase for those ads whose contents shimmy and shake lowermybills com is notorious for its endless loops of silhouetted dancers and surprised office workers other ads come alive when you move the mouse over them ballooning to claim even more screen real estate to sell cars movies laundry soap and more rich media also mean video some of the most sophisticated of the new breed of web ads are online versions of familiar tv commercials sitting in freeze frame waiting for you to click them into coming alive video is popular on web sites everywhere and not just for the advertisers news sites are adding video reports as supplements to their traditional print stories they do this in large part because they can charge advertisers more to sponsor them up to triple the rates associated with traditional text stories advertisers in turn are attracted to video because its familiar terrain they can show a version of the tested commercials they broadcast often this is done in a "pre roll " the brief ad segment users have to sit through before viewing the non commercial video they wanted to see in the first place most of the time the fast forward button on the web player is disabled one current debate among web sites involves how long these pre rolls should run because of our ever shortening attention spans seconds is considered the upper limit espn the sports site that is one of the busiest on the web is using a deal with gatorade to dispense with the pre roll but still sneak in an ad during a short online version of its popular evening sportscenter program an espn announcer starts the clip by mentioning the days big story then says hell be back shortly there follows a second or second gatorade commercial usually an athlete talking about sports the espn show resumes to sell these ads web sites need "inventory " or web pages on which the ads will be placed web sites have lately been taking steps to increase their inventory of pages notes michael cassidy chief executive of undertone networks an online ad consulting service to compensate for the slowing growth of total web users as the medium matures hence sites are expanding into seemingly unrelated areas like the "pets" section of the weather channels site which features among more meteorological offerings pictures of viewers dogs and cats web sites are also creating hooks like the top lists slide shows and photo collections now common online you might think that you are clicking through the " cool tech toys of the year " in fact youre helping a web site add new pages to its salable inventory other sites are borrowing a technique from local tv newscasts those teasers that give you a taste of a story but make you return later in the show to hear the rest for example atop yahoos popular home page there often will be a tease of a headline requiring you to click to find out the full story a recent example the news in big type that the father of anna nicole smiths baby had been revealed via dna tests you needed to click to a new page to find out it was larry birkhead in the process yahoo sold two pages of ads not just one yahoo admits to the practice but says it uses it selectively to avoid irritating users and only on news stories that arent especially serious another trick some news sites use to increase inventory is to break up even a short story text into two or three parts forcing readers to click through pages to get all of it readers can circumvent this by formatting the story for printing many of the changes involving advertising are less obvious to users and involve the ability of sites to take advantage of the fact that they know more about you than youd probably wish and thus to target ads to specific users weatherchannel the nets no news site after yahoo news allows users to specify the locale for which they seek a forecast peter greene head of ad sales at the site says experience has taught that users who enter in a zip code are probably residents of the area while those who enter the name of the city are likely to be in the process of traveling there its ad sales people are thus able to sell different ads based on the two kinds of searches local retailers for the zip coders and airlines or hotels for the travelers even as they become more aggressive with advertising most reputable web sites say they are careful not to diminish their brands by going too far cnn for example has in the past year doubled the number of videos it serves every day but it limits to one the number of ads that appear at the top of home page "we call that ad elegance " said greg dalba ad director at the
