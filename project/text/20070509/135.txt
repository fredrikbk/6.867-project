virtual is beautiful but theres nothing like a real musician in regard to "classical music fugue for man &amp machine" by jacob hale russell and john jurgensen pursuits may this is a nicely researched article that posits "virtual" music as a possible remedy for very real problems experienced by orchestras and performing groups but i read the story with a feeling of dismay because of what it signifies about the diminished world of classical music to be sure we have all heard about the declining attendance at musical events and many fine orchestras cite this and the ever increasing costs associated with running an orchestra as being a critical issue as technology has advanced as demonstrated in the article the ability to capture perfectly the tones played by top musicians and then reuse and remix them to create a virtual program has given sound engineers the ability to create virtual orchestras indeed imagine if your entire cello section were made up of yo yo ma slava feuermann fournier casals and maisky what a superstar program you could have with the ability to capture the various tones of these musicians and even the differences in the timbres of their respective cellos the biggest problem would be to ensure that the royalty checks got out in a timely fashion i think that as a curiosity and as backup for dance and broadway programming the virtual orchestra has some interesting applications but i believe that well find that the "virtual orchestra" will only lead to a faster decline in concert attendance patrons are interested in seeing and hearing a performance by live musicians not a dance recital by a putative conductor prancing about the stage by himself with a baton and a rack of electronic equipment regardless how good the musicians were who may have recorded the tones the accomplishments in engineering cannot sadly stem the general decline in listenership of classical music as such the only thing that will be accomplished is to make synthesized "uberorchestras" of digitally recorded tones of the superstars of yesteryear and those who are alive today in a decade the only performing musicians could be some moderately talented teenage girls strutting about a la britney spears holding million dollar instruments while "air bowing" the brahms violin concerto to a digitized recording from reiner the chicago symphony and heifetz we could even one day have the classical music equivalent of lip synching what is needed is a revitalization of the culture of concertgoing and musical appreciation this is a more difficult task beyond the capabilities of sound engineers and finance directors of orchestras rather it is something that starts in the homes and schools with parents who think beyond what will bring a higher sat score and school administrators who think beyond the next funding crisis or swimming pool project or computer lab to get on with the business of teaching children how to grow up to become truly educated men and women the cultural benefit for the concertgoer is an enjoyable performance by talented people who after rehearsing come together and make magic for an hour or so to the delight of their patrons this musical curiosity i predict will have a niche just as the player piano and its modern brethren still do david umlauf deerfield ill
