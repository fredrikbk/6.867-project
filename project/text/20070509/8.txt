an old sad story martins as choreographer romeo + juliet new york city ballet through sunday new york until last weeks premiere of peter martinss two act "romeo + juliet " the history of prokofievs "romeo and juliet" at new york city ballet was short and rather saccharine in the company that george balanchine guided from to there was no place for this shakespeare based work first made world famous by moscows bolshoi ballet in a touring production by leonid lavrovsky then in nycb presented "romeo &amp juliet balcony scene " a nine minute duet with derivative and unremarkable choreography by company ballet master sean lavery and a greeting card cliche setting by drew miller mr martinss hour version which conflates three acts into two tweaking the music here and there and breaking the drama in the middle of prokofievs second act is neither short nor saccharine it isnt especially sour either that would be something overall his narrative dramatic ballet is thin flat and monotonous mr martins is abetted by his designer the geology trained painter and sculptor per kirkeby who is given credit for the scenery and co credit with kirsten lund neilson for costumes mr kirkebys unit set suggesting renaissance veronas architecture alternately resembles a fake fireplace or a toy stage perhaps for a sock puppet show with little doors and curtains that variously open and close with its dull gray surface broken up by brush strokes indicating sooty mortar the boxy movable set looks like something grade schoolers put together with cheap cardboard and poster paint the costumes fare somewhat better with an array of jewel toned velvets in the ballroom scene giving the parading dancers an elegant silhouette even if their gestures seem as artificial as any from a clueless collection of men and women hoping to look animated or refined as spectacle the ballet addresses its story of young lovers feuding families and tragic endings as a dance recital pageant the choreography for the ballroom and street scenes often suggests a ballet schools partnering classes with incidental ad lib moments for the young men and women as they pretend to be living in another time had mr martins thought through with any thoroughness or originality his insistence on featuring young dancers in his production he might as well have set the action in a contemporary ballet school "romeo + juliet"s lack of dramatic depth is an especially sad comment on mr martins who was schooled in the extraordinary storytelling traditions of the royal danish ballet his alma mater during his own dancing days with nycb his mimetic ability far surpassed that of most of his colleagues his sly frantz in "coppelia" and his cameo as a cigarette chewing jack tar in "union jack" are among nycbs most memorable portrayals here in lieu of human behavior and dramatic gesture arranged to set off individual dance passages we have dancers nearly none of whom have the background in dramatic ballet that mr martins does left by him to their own misguided devices if the play acting of the surrounding characters is hollow and colorless the more prominent figures fare even worse as lord and lady capulet retired dancer jock soto and senior ballerina darci kistler are almost comically full of bluster ms kistler flounces around and swats the air when shes upset all thats missing from mr sotos silent movie acting moments of fury over his disobedient daughter are a bull whip and twirling mustache mr martinss lack of inspired dance making should come as no surprise to anyone who has seen his ineffectual efforts over the past years with both narrative and non narrative choreography the often dry and angular maneuvers hes devised for romeo and juliets crucial duets have a stiffness and a sameness he gives his hapless dancers lifts or supported poses that register more for their awkwardness than for their aesthetic singularity the point of these moments seems not to show the viewer anything arresting about young rapturous love but mainly to get through one musical passage and onto another the famed "balcony scene" ends with the squeaking of the sets casters so the scene can move into its next mode a physical high point of mr martinss direction here and the audience gasps at it is a ringing slap ostensibly smacked across juliets face by lord capulet when his daughter refuses to accept the suit of marriage from paris another is having romeo stab juliets cousin tybalt in the back as the coup de grace of their sword fight as for the featured dancers only the friar laurence of nikolaj hubbe also a royal danish ballet alumnus revealed any pantomimic breadth and individuality of the four couples dancing the title roles the least seasoned of these seemed to offer the most depth not because of their youth but because of their own inherent distinction the juliet of corps de ballet dancer kathryn morgan opposite the confident romeo of seth orza recently promoted to soloist rank had a luminous quality that at times burnished the tinny aspects of mr martinss choreography to precious metal sheen apprentice dancer erica pereira and a most dignified and elegant if not physically secure allen peiffer still in the corps de ballet likewise brought personal resonance to their one dimensional roles with its plus sign linking the names of the lovers "romeo + juliet" has been trendily branded at nycb too bad it hasnt been as memorably staged mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
