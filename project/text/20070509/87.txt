line test phone giants labor woes deutsche telekom ceo encounters high hurdle in showdown with union frankfurt a looming showdown between management and labor at deutsche telekom ag could turn into a make or break moment for new chief executive rene obermann who is under pressure to get the stumbling german telecommunications giant back on track mr obermann faces his first major test at the wheel of europes largest carrier by revenue when about workers vote this week whether to authorize a strike protesting plans to shift nearly a third of the companys employees in germany to lower paying jobs the threatened strike would be the biggest at deutsche telekom since it was privatized in and comes a bit less than six months after mr obermann years old took the top post an extended walkout could further alienate customers already sore about poor service at the former monopoly mr obermann a nine year company veteran appears to have little choice but to push ahead with the cost cutting plan as shareholders grow increasingly impatient with the pace of change at the telecom titan which has holdings ranging from traditional phone lines to broadband internet to cellphone operator t mobile in europe and the u s the company has issued two profit warnings since last summer including one on mr obermanns watch amid rising competition from smaller more efficient rivals a wild card is the german government which still controls about a third of deutsche telekoms shares although berlin is backing management efforts to cut costs and boost the companys share price it is unclear whether politicians have the stomach for a drawn out battle against well organized workers with strong job protection rights "its not the easiest situation " chief financial officer karl gerhard eick said in an interview referring to the conflicting forces bearing down on management stefan olbermann a finance ministry spokesman in berlin said the government supports the restructuring efforts but only to a point "if you dont take people along with you then all that restructuring is pure theory and doesnt work in practice " he said the ver di union plans to announce the results of the strike authorization vote tomorrow the same day deutsche telekom is expected to release another uninspiring quarterly earnings report many big european telecoms have moved aggressively in recent years to restructure operations and slash payrolls deutsche telekom saddled with about civil servants who enjoy more employment protection than typical employees as a holdover from its days as an arm of the government has been slower to adjust than many of its peers that cost kai uwe ricke mr obermanns predecessor his job late last year analysts said mr obermann doesnt appear to be in immediate danger of losing his job but they added that the showdown with labor is a pivotal moment for the chief executive who needs to start showing investors signs of progress without putting ties with workers beyond repair deutsche telekoms share price has slipped since mr obermann became chief executive in mid november even as germanys main stock index has shot higher investors could turn on mr obermann if the company issues another profit warning analysts said a spokesman said mr obermann wasnt available for comment mr obermann who has described the companys high cost labor structure as a "corset " is taking a hard line he hopes to deliver more than billion euros or about &# billion in annual cost savings across the company by at the annual shareholder meeting last week where he was booed by workers and cheered by investors he threatened to sell deutsche telekoms service units if union representatives refused to make concessions the chief executive is trying to transfer about workers from the companys struggling land line business to a new unit t service he wants to cut those workers salaries by while increasing their weekly hours to from revenue at the land line unit in germany which had million narrowband lines and million broadband lines at the end of sank last year to billion euros operating profit fell amid falling prices and rising customer defections workers have dug in their heels after breaking off several weeks of tense negotiations in late april "an ice age has broken out " said wolfgang borkenstein a labor leader in bonn at the affected land line unit t com only about of the affected workers are participating in the strike vote by the union but their decision to walk could cause wider ripples another affected workers civil servants prohibited from striking could lend solidarity by refusing to cover for striking colleagues or paring back their own productivity about three quarters of deutsche telekoms german workers are represented by ver di which could tighten the screws in wage talks later this year involving other units labor clout isnt confined to strikes under german law worker representatives control of the supervisory board seats at big companies such as deutsche telekom in corporate germanys two tiered board structure the nonexecutive supervisory board vets major decisions of the management board including personnel moves mr obermann has enjoyed enough support from the supervisory board thus far to stick to his guns he has been helped by the backing of board chairman klaus zumwinkel a nonlabor representative who holds the boards deciding vote in the case of a tie but public sector representatives also hold two seats on the supervisory board and could tilt power back toward labor if relations with workers deteriorate further and the government gets more involved at some point politicians might "speak out and push the dynamic in one direction or the other " said thomas friedrich a telecom analyst in munich at the german bank hvb deutsche telekom had overall sales of billion euros in with of revenue from germany from the rest of europe and from north america
