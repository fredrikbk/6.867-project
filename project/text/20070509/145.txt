will grasso get his pay after all former new york stock exchange chief executive dick grasso won a significant legal victory in his fight to keep his &# million pay package raising the likelihood of a settlement in the contentious three year legal fight in a decision the appellate division for new yorks state supreme court ruled the states attorney general "does not have the authority" to bring key parts of the case against mr grasso over the pay package he was awarded during his time as a big board executive the lawsuit sought to force mr grasso to return some of the money arguing that he was simply paid too much and also that he knew he was doing something wrong and violated his fiduciary duty the court decision is significant because it throws out four of the six elements of the case those that argued that his pay was unreasonably high under the states rules governing not for profit companies the nyse was a not for profit then but has since become a public company nyse euronext to succeed with the remaining two elements of the case the state must convince a judge or jury not only that the pay was unreasonable but that mr grasso knew he was doing something wrong or violated his fiduciary duty but the attorney general who would have to win that case isnt the attorney general who fought the pitched battle against mr grasso former attorney general eliot spitzer is now new yorks governor and his successor andrew cuomo doesnt have the same incentive to fight the case still a spokesman for mr cuomo said the state expected to appeal the latest ruling a spokesman for gov spitzer said an appeal makes sense because it "speaks to the core jurisdiction" of the attorney generals office both sides could hunker down and wait for the appellate court to rule on other key issues still outstanding before discussing any settlement the ruling gives fresh momentum to mr grasso who has been fighting the case since shortly after he left the exchange in amid an uproar over the size of the pay package mr grasso has received a number of setbacks in the case most notably a decision in october by new york state justice charles ramos that he would have to give back part of his compensation because he breached his fiduciary duty in that element of the case which wasnt part of the current appellate ruling the state had argued mr grasso should give back &# million or more the former big board chief has appealed justice ramoss october decision now with the october decision awaiting an appellate court ruling the year old mr grasso could continue to defy critics who have questioned whether he should continue fighting the case a nearly full time pursuit the case filed in by mr spitzer became a lightning rod for outsize executive pay the nyse board awarded mr grasso millions in pay and benefits then voted him out when the pay was made public allegations ensued that mr grasso helped to stack the board with his allies and didnt do enough to let board members know about the details of his compensation package mr grasso has denied this yesterday the former executive couldnt be reached to comment "its certainly not over " said david m siesko a consultant specializing in corporate compensation "theres still some significant counts against mr grasso but the case is no longer as strong against him " the ruling didnt address other issues central to the dispute including whether mr grasso will have to be ordered to pay back the disputed money without any trial as justice ramos ordered another issue is whether the lower court judge should recuse himself mr grasso contends among other things that justice ramos should be removed in part because he tried years ago to become an nyse board member yesterdays appellate ruling "amounts to a real threat" to the broad enforcement powers of attorneys general says michael w peregrine a partner at law firm mcdermott will &amp emery llp it "may hamstring much of their oversight activity in the nonprofit sector " mr grasso joined the nyse in as a clerk and worked his way up to the executive in charge of listings and then to chairman in he has sent signals in recent months that he would be open to settling the case in one recent tv interview he said he would be open to a settlement with honor which he has defined as one that clearly indicates to the public that he did nothing wrong regarding his pay
