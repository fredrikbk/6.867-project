common sense navigating the merger road sell firms courted with big premium dont be arbitrager smartmoney talk about merger mania last week brought a dizzying rush of big deals unexpected deals deals still in the making and merely rumored deals they all helped propel the dow jones industrial average into a streak of gains with virtually every kind of deal now on display its time to review the basics of the common sense m&amp a playbook my strategy for takeovers begins with the observation that in most instances shares of target companies rise while those of acquiring companies fall while there have been prominent exceptions mondays offer by alcoa to acquire alcan is the most recent this is true across industries and whether deals are real or rumored if you already own shares in a target company and if they rise significantly on the news count your good fortune and sell like many aspects of investing this simple proposition is easier to state than follow ordinary investors suddenly enjoying big gains on their shares suddenly decide to turn themselves into arbitragers professional takeover speculators the problem is that further gains in the target shares may be modest while the risk of decline if the proposed deal falls through is significant arbitragers devote their time to the arcane aspects of deals from antitrust implications and terms of rival bids to potential shareholder suits and proxy fights many enhance what would otherwise be small returns through leverage i say leave this high risk low return strategy to the professionals news corp s &# billion &# a share bid for dow jones is a good illustration at a premium to the price where dow jones shares were trading its a windfall to dow jones shareholders but with a majority of the voting shares controlled by bancroft family members who oppose the merger theres a significant risk this deal wont go through no other bidders have surfaced with dow jones trading at around &# you could hold out for another &# or so and risk the stocks abrupt return to the mid s if news corp is spurned again i say sell and leave this to the arbitragers of course if like at least some of the family members youre holding dow jones shares for nonfinancial reasons such as preserving its independence and editorial integrity thats another matter i dont own any shares dow jones is the publisher of the wall street journal if a deal is rumored such as the potential megamerger of yahoo and microsoft thats even more reason to sell yahoo shares jumped immediately but many investors apparently followed that strategy yahoo promptly gave back much of the gain i own yahoo but the gain hasnt tempted me to sell in the meantime no deal has materialized while i think yahoo and microsoft might want to merge their search engines to better compete with google im not sure a full scale merger makes sense i own google shares and microsoft options i followed this strategy to sell last year after caremark rx got its takeover bid from cvs as a longtime caremark shareholder i was initially disappointed that cvs offered almost no premium to caremarks share price at the time so i held on indeed its almost always worth waiting at least a few days or weeks to see if a higher bid emerges but even if it does id sell after express scripts surfaced with a higher offer and a bidding war ensued i donated most of my caremark shares to charity on the theory that shares werent likely to gain much further they did continue to rise but not so much that i regretted my decision shareholders of abn amro holding the large dutch bank now the subject of a fierce takeover battle between suitors barclays and a group led by royal bank of scotland group may feel the same the share price could well go higher especially with a dutch court that seems bent on helping shareholders get the best price but im no expert on dutch or european takeover law which would make me even more inclined to leave this deal to the arbitragers i do make an exception in some noncash takeover bids when the acquiring company offers shares this doesnt happen all that often since so many mergers turn out to be failures in those cases id rather have the cash but if i really like the proposed merger ill wait for a deal to close and hold the shares of the merged companies since i like the cvs caremark combination i still own the cvs shares i got for my remaining caremark shares when the deal closed theyve gained nicely with cvs shares recently hitting a new high of just over &# james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
