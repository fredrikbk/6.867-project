teaching young women to brag new york in a second floor auditorium at madison square garden the air is filled with the low hum of conversation punctuated by the occasional giggle some th graders from the young womens leadership school of east harlem and an equal number of female hedge fund executives sit in rows looking expectantly at the empty stage the executives members of a new york philanthropic group called high water women are here to be paired up with disadvantaged teens to teach them how to network and promote themselves skills essential in the business world it is the fourth year for this event called brag day women in finance including hedge fund executives investment bankers and financial advisers are often in particular demand by charities because their success in fields dominated by men can teach disadvantaged women and girls valuable lessons in turn women of wall street are joining groups like hww out of a desire to go beyond checkbook philanthropy financial advisers and brokers both male and female have personal and professional interests in pursuing philanthropy besides being an outlet for a personal passion philanthropy is also often a keen interest of clients who need direction on charitable giving in a sign of the importance of philanthropy lpl financial services the nations largest independent broker dealer has just made a video that documents the charitable efforts of six of its plus advisers in an effort to encourage other employees and inspire clients to action on this spring day at madison square garden the executives in pearls and tailored suits and the students in plaid skirts white shirts and navy blazers will need a bit of a push to begin interacting for susan de maio a senior vice president in the treasury finance department at pequot capital management inc an investment adviser managing about &# billion in assets it is her first brag day "im looking to connect with these women in a meaningful way " she says melinda gonzalez is "hoping its going to help me get into college " ms gonzalez years old worries her shyness will be an obstacle when she applies for college and competes with students who have similar grades but also have the self assurance a more privileged background often brings shes taking two hours on this day to get coaching she says because "its really important to take every opportunity " her school the young womens leadership school of east harlem serves girls in grades two thirds of whom are latina and one third african american while of the girls live below the poverty line of its graduates are accepted into college the brainchild of ann rubenstein tisch its founding in as the first single sex public school to open in new york in years generated complaints that it discriminated against boys but sister schools have since opened in the bronx and in astoria and jamaica queens in the auditorium peggy klaus takes the stage a communication and leadership coach she has spent more than a decade advising fortune companies despite her slight build and foot inch height ms klaus can project her voice to the back of the room she has advanced degrees in speech drama and theater from the london based royal academy of music and the drama studio "women are uncomfortable promoting their accomplishments at school on the sports field and in the workplace " says ms klaus thats why she believes such events are important as a warm up she asks executives and volunteers to pair up and allots them each seconds to tell about themselves and their achievements afterwards she plucks a student and a volunteer to repeat their performance in front of the crowd the executive gives a so so performance and the student stumbles over her words staring at the floor and speaking in a monotone now begins the transformation of students and volunteers one that isnt for the fainthearted ms klaus explains the importance of framing accomplishments in an engaging way this means telling a story that highlights accomplishments passions and interests without descending into a boring laundry list of achievements blighted by overuse of the word "i " to help the group focus she asks them to answer a series of written questions that will form the basis of their "bragologue " now it is time to work on delivery and here is where ms klaus shares her own secret a couple of hours before a public speech she psyches herself up by racing around and shrieking at the top of her lungs about how excited she is to be there she shows this and encourages the group to do the same after a few false starts they take to it with gusto a prada clad volunteer jumps on a chair and effuses to a student about her job a student gesticulates wildly about her passion for poetry pulses are racing in the room and despite all natural impulses to the contrary it is inspiring the trick ms klaus says is to internalize all of this positive energy and slowly draw on it when you speak the students are exhilarated the workshop makes jessica rivera "feel more confident " she says "i feel like i can let my personality shine " ms rivera will be the first in her family to graduate from high school "i definitely want to go to college " she says "i want to build a career in finance one day i want to have my own accounting firm " before she started at the leadership school ms rivera felt intimated to show her intelligence in co ed classes despite her reluctance to attend an all girls school she refused to speak at her entrance interview and deliberately flunked the test her mothers advocacy got her in "i loved it from the first day " she says "i could raise my hand in class its cool to be smart " high water women works by posting a range of volunteer opportunities each month members often volunteer more than times a year and are spurred to help in other ways ms de maio for instance would eventually like to serve on the board of a nonprofit but she is also hooked on the personal interaction she had on this day she was surprised by "the openness and willingness to share" of the students kathleen kelley of kingdon capital management llc co founded hww with leslie rahl of capital market risk advisors inc in early "volunteering " ms kelley says "ignites their passion " the volunteers and students intermingle as they leave madison square garden patting each other on the back and looking as tired as if they had just played a game of basketball
