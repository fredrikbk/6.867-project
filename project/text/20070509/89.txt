new clout a labor unions power blocking takeover bids steel company buyers learn they must get usw on their side pittsburgh as brazilian steel giant csn maneuvered last year to merge with wheeling pittsburgh corp the two companies paid little heed to opposition from the united steelworkers union that was a mistake the usw wanted what it considered a more union friendly bidder than csn and found one in chicago upstart esmark inc executives of esmark promised that if they got hold of wheeling pitt there would be no union layoffs there the union threw its weight behind esmark which then mounted a fierce proxy fight to oust the wheeling pitt board in november it won handily "we turned the entire board over in one day little old steelworkers and little old esmark " says ron bloom the steel unions point man in the battle at a time when organized labor at times seems a feeble anachronism the usw is exercising plenty of power by playing for keeps with the capitalists its strategy rather than simply to pound the table for higher pay or threaten strikes is to block takeovers take sides in bidding wars and fight for board seats the union also muscles its way to the negotiating table in bankruptcies billing itself as a "creditor" whose claims are workers lost wages and benefits in its most sophisticated tactic it cuts deals with private equity players and other financiers "if youre not in the game youre really going to get really screwed " says leo gerard president of the member union which represents workers in chemicals paper aluminum and several other industries in addition to steel many labor chiefs remain hostile to wall street types sailing in to buy struggling companies "we see them simply as a group of wealthy people that control a group of other wealthy peoples money and buy low throw a lot of people out of work and sell high " says buzz hargrove president of the canadian auto workers union another reason other unions havent adopted the usw strategy some say is that their industries didnt face the kind of crippling damage that pushed the steel union to try a new approach but the usws tactics may become more common as unions recognize they must deal with the wall street crowd which as a result of investments now indirectly controls thousands of union jobs from his office in usws pittsburgh office tower mr bloom straddles the worlds of new york private money corporate executive suites and midwest union halls in the wheeling pitt case he dealt with entrepreneurs who run esmark as well as with franklin mutual advisers llc a big mutual fund firm that owns of esmarks shares in return for esmarks no layoff promise the union agreed not to oppose its wish to import steel slabs to wheeling pitt mills if esmark manages to acquire the company as it hopes to do this summer the union customarily opposes such imports both inside and outside the usw mr bloom is known as a financially savvy negotiator a year old with a tendency like his boss to spout profanities mr bloom attended harvard business school where he gravitated to populist business cases and was keenly interested in employee buyouts after years at investment banks among them lazard he became special assistant to the usw president in some usw members think messrs bloom and gerard are too cozy with the moneymen lee siskie a year old retiree who worked at an ohio mill now operated by republic engineered products inc says a deal between the usw and financiers kept the mill open but his benefits were slashed during the bankruptcy proceedings mr siskie figures the union "should be working with people that know more about the steel business than the investment business " not people who "want to make a quick hit and get the hell out " mr bloom says that dealing with financial buyers of steel assets people like new yorks wilbur ross "is just business " indeed he says in contrast to traditional steel executives who sometimes want unions "in their place " talking to private equity types is refreshing "they dont take cultural offense to anything they just deal with power " usw leaders first began to change their approach in the s when american steel was decimated by foreign competition overcapacity and high costs the many resulting bankruptcies cost tens of thousands of jobs instead of confronting management with traditional demands the steel union decided its best hope for preserving jobs and benefits was to back good companies that could make money it began trying to pick winners and losers often diving into restructuring battles the reason the usw can sway such battles traces largely to contract provisions called successorship clauses in the case of most unions such clauses merely require the acquirer of a plant covered by a collective bargaining agreement to adhere to it usw agreements often go further many state that a successor company and the union must agree on a new labor contract before a plant is sold this provision which the steelworkers negotiated in most of their steel industry contracts beginning in the mid s effectively gives the union an approval right on the sale of a steel plant for the usw a watershed event came in mr ross was poking around ltv steel during its second trip to bankruptcy court with its mills closed mr ross recalls telling the union there was value in ltv but it would need wholesale restructuring including a labor overhaul he discovered that messrs bloom and gerard were open to radical change the union was willing to embrace a leaner operating structure altered work rules and new rules on incentive bonuses if it got what it wanted from a new owner of ltv mr ross agreed that if he acquired ltv and it became profitable as part of his international steel group a portion of the profit would go into a trust for retired steelworkers benefits the usw has worked with a number of companies to set up such trusts designed to restore part of the retiree benefits that bankruptcies sometimes wipe out the usw says it agreed with mr ross that if he reopened the mills they could operate with fewer union jobs it says management ranks were reduced by at least twice as much mr ross then obtained control of ltv and reopened the operations and the work force ratified a new labor agreement "it was a pretty radical change in the way steel was made without those changes i would never have bought ltv " mr ross says referring to the usws messrs bloom and gerard mr ross says "these guys are very straight shooters " also in bethlehem steel filed for bankruptcy reorganization again drawing mr rosss attention mr bloom began negotiations with him a second time "so now we say to wilbur ok well support you well shield you from all other bidders so you can get it real cheap " in return he asked that "real money" be put into the retiree benefit trust he says he told mr ross "you get to put ltv and bethlehem together youve now just created by the stroke of a pen the largest steel company in america " mr ross acquired several more steel companies eventually selling them for &# billion and a &# million personal profit to mittal steel co the giant london company founded by indian born billionaire lakshmi mittal remaining usw members benefited and so did retirees as hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the benefits trust meanwhile the american steel industry caught another break as the global commodities boom has improved its fortunes in recent years the usw has sometimes given up its right to approve the sale of a steel company in exchange for benefits for its membership the union struck such a deal with aluminum company ormet corp last year after a rocky negotiation with a private equity firm that controls ormet the deal brought the union members supplemental unemployment benefits and left the private equity group matlinpatterson global advisors llc free to sell ormet when it chooses to "private equity guys buy companies and sell them five to seven years later and they need exit" strategies says mr bloom "we get that " of the usws dozens of negotiations in recent years few show its power better than the struggle over wheeling pittsburgh that company was long considered a weak player and candidate for a merger in its board retained an investment bank and weighed possible partners esmark among them it selected brazils csn formally companhia siderurgica nacional sa striking a partnership deal that left wheeling pitt management in place a former director of wheeling pitt clark ogle says "we felt it was prudent to have a partner csn seemed to be the most logical end " the union didnt agree mr bloom says there was nothing "inherently wrong" with csn a strong low cost producer but as he and mr gerard analyzed the planned deal they concluded that too much of its benefit would flow to csn and not enough to american workers mr bloom was rebuffed when he took his objections to wheeling pitt management in the middle of last year the usw played its trump card it invoked a successorship clause it had earlier negotiated with wheeling pitt an especially potent clause that covered the entire company and would be triggered in the event of any change of control the union announced it would oppose wheeling pitts merger plan with csn "what were best at is stopping things " says mr bloom the usw informed wheeling pitt that it was throwing its support behind esmark a company wheeling pitt had rebuffed esmark was founded in by james and craig bouchard brothers whose parents both worked in the industry the brothers built esmark by acquiring steel distribution businesses they named it after a former chicago consumer products conglomerate they admired with the approval of the executive who had built that business a merger with wheeling pitt would create a company that combined steelmaking with distribution "we liked the vision " says mr bloom who adds that esmark had a reputation for good labor relations the usw leaders also were familiar with esmarks financial backers principally franklin mutual advisers because franklin had backed mr rosss steel deals franklin was prepared to finance a merger of esmark and wheeling pitt by putting up as much as &# million michael embler chief investment officer at franklins mutual series funds says "instead of us versus them the steelworkers think how do we make this industry competitive " the usw and the bouchards bargained over terms of the unions support for an esmark run at wheeling pitt the esmark executives agreed not to lay off union members but pressed in return for the right to import steel slabs from ukraine to esmark and its financial backers this was a way to keep the mill running full tilt and thus more productively the sides eventually struck that deal although the union was able to block csn an alternative deal for wheeling pitt could be mounted only by a steel company such as esmark with the money and energy to try to wrest control in july esmark decided to wage a proxy battle to oust the wheeling pitt board that had rejected it lobbying shareholders esmark ceo james bouchard told a wire service interviewer that support for the existing wheeling pitt board "is a vote to keep the failed management team in place and guarantees continued conflict with the usw " mr ogle the former wheeling pitt board member says wheeling pitts operations were improving and there was a "breath of fresh air and hope" at the company in the november shareholder vote the esmark side won about backing for its slate of directors that included the support of a retiree benefits trust that held of wheeling pitt shares the usw says that while it didnt control those votes it had made its views widely known the bouchards at esmark then replaced wheeling pitts board with their own slate including two usw representatives this laid the groundwork for a proposed merger between esmark and wheeling pitt this summer esmark was well aware that when the usw is opposed to a steel companys actions it can make its views known through moves that get the attention of institutional investors such as vitriolic news releases or hints of future strikes "it is suicide to try to buy a steel company without the union support " says mr bouchard its a lesson csn learned too late "we didnt get in on the side of the union at the start so they became our enemies " says a csn executive luiz ernesto migliora who was not involved in csns wheeling pitt bid he says the brazilian company remains interested in buying american steel assets but next time "i would never try anything without going to the union first " the union may soon play matchmaker again mittal intends to sell a big mill in sparrows point md that could fetch &# billion at least five bidders are expected among them both csn and esmark once again the union says it has veto power over the sale because of a successorship clause in its labor contract "is it fair to say that we open the game oriented toward esmark yes of course it is " says the usws mr bloom but he adds "the door is not shut it cant be shut we have an obligation to these members "
