survival of the fittest finding an etf with staying power i may be going out on a limb here but im not convinced the world needs exchange traded index funds devoted to health care stocks these are heady days for etfs those index funds that trade on the stock market just like any other share fund sponsors are launching new etfs by the fistful hoping to snag a slice of this fast growing market this of course means more choice for investors but youve got to wonder could the abundance of fund choices drive out the weaker players and could investors end up getting hurt rushing to market there are now some etfs with more than additional funds in registration "its a huge land grab " says jim wiandt publisher of indexuniverse com "companies are turning out all these thinly sliced sector funds in the hope of hitting something that really resonates " according to morningstar there are etfs focused on technology investing in natural resources and devoted to the financial sector to be sure each fund typically has a slightly different mandate take those health care funds the list includes funds devoted to ophthalmology shares cardiology device companies and european drug stocks as well as a fund that uses complicated investment techniques so that it climbs when health care stocks fall is there enough investor support for all of these narrowly focused funds mr wiandt figures a funds long term existence isnt secure until it reaches &# million in assets because the fees collected by the fund may not be enough to cover fund management costs legal expenses listing fees shareholder reports and so on today more than of etfs fall below that threshold in fact average fund assets have shrunk in recent years as new fund launches have outstripped the growth in fund assets because etfs are so new we havent seen many closings but it has happened deutsche bank pulled the plug on its country baskets in the late s barclays global investors closed three ishares funds in and etf advisors bond funds disappeared in meanwhile state street has changed the strategy on one fund and closed three others searching for survivors none of this much matters if you are a trader if one health care fund disappears you can always swap into another but what if youre a long term investor looking to profit from etfs legendary tax efficiency and low annual expenses frankly i am not sure why you would be interested in many of the newer funds with their narrow investment focus but suppose you want to make a long term bet on technology if your tech fund closes and you have to jump to another fund you will face trading costs and possibly a steep tax bill even if your tech fund soldiers on you could still suffer a fund with few assets is unlikely to trim its annual expenses something thats desperately needed with many of the newer etfs some of the funds launched since year end levy annual expenses of a year or more thats steep for an index fund my advice before you buy an etf make sure it has a decent amount of assets preferably above &# million i would also favor etfs from firms that have established themselves as leading etf sponsors such as barclays state street and vanguard group presumably these firms dont want to sully their reputation by closing a truckload of funds most important favor the lowest cost funds in each category because these will likely prove most popular over the long run to find low cost funds try morningstar com "you need to recognize that there are a lot of these crazy niche funds and you want to avoid them like the plague " says russel kinnel morningstars director of fund research "you want to look for low cost well diversified funds if you start by screening for the lowest cost funds you should end up with funds that will be around for a good long while "
