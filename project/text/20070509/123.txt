the daily fix suns respond to nashs challenge end their skid against the spurs online edition the phoenix suns broke a five game playoff losing streak against the san antonio spurs last night with a bandaged steve nash and co topping tim duncans troops to even up their western conference semifinals series at a game apiece the critical player for the suns amare stoudemire who scored of his points in the second half freed up by the suns decision to start kurt thomas against mr duncan or maybe it was mr nash who called out his teammates after their game loss questioning their effort and toughness "how nice to see the suns rebound both literally and figuratively " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic "how encouraging to see the unnamed players called out by steve nash responding with great ferocity think shawn marion and the suddenly scowling boris diaw and how mood altering maybe even series altering to see the reluctant experiment kurt thomas in the starting lineup pay such handsome dividends best of all not an ounce of blood was shed in the process and all things considered the first leg of the western conference semifinals could have been much worse while the suns lost home court advantage they have gained their bearings and a great deal of confidence " in the san antonio express news buck harvey looks at the suns finances the teams payroll will go up to &# million next year and owner robert sarver has said he doesnt want to pay the luxury tax that payroll level would entail mr nash he writes is "smart enough to understand his teams payroll and to hear the rumors and to wonder what will happen to this franchise if it loses another series to the spurs the bottom line this time was a financial one win and keep winning and nash will have a chance to run with this group for a few more years thats what nash was playing for " game lived up to the promise si coms jack mccallum saw in this series after game "welcome to the nba finals the league has thoughtfully fast tracked its premier event to end the drama a month earlier than usual " mr mccallum writes that "it is still on the suns as it was two years ago when they lost to the spurs in five games in the western final to prove that they have the toughness and moxie to compete with a team that has won three titles in the last eight seasons three more than phoenix has won in its year history but what makes this series so fascinating san antonios championship pedigree notwithstanding are the similarities between two teams that seem so different " the idea that the spurs and suns are playing for the nba title wont sit well with the utah jazz or the golden state warriors playing in the other western conference semis in the washington post mike wise offers an entertaining profile of golden states don nelson now riding high in the nba after years of being dismissed as out of touch or addicted to gimmickry mr wise manages the neat trick of calling out the revisionist history while taking part in it himself "nelsons craggy faced haggard appearance the iowa folksiness and his bud light fueled follies make him as familiar as your grandmothers ottoman " he writes "nellie is musty he comes from the attic even the nickname invokes a dilapidated stripped down chevy running more on memories than fumes hes an aged han solo forever trying to fix the millennium falcon but its hard to completely square the lovable carouser everybody is gloating over now with the nba survivalist the man who has done everything imaginable to stay employed in this league for almost a half century beneath the uncle nellie veneer there is an old aloof celtic who believes you cannot possibly know more about the game than him " oh and dont miss the john starks story the detroit pistons chicago bulls new jersey nets and cleveland cavaliers might also want to challenge mr mccallums analysis well maybe the pistons and cavs will the bulls and nets have looked overmatched in falling into holes in the eastern conference semis the bulls at least had the night off the nets were beaten as clevelands lebron james scored points in the fourth quarter "james knew this was not a night for faint fadeaway jumpers " terry pluto writes in the akron beacon journal "he knew that his team needed him to lead that if he kept bulling his way to the basket time after time after time no one could stop him not without fouling him not without creating open shots for teammates not without frustrating anyone trying to defend him the cavs star took hits to the head bangs to the knees shoves in the back and one slam to an unmentionable area that had him fall to the floor as if someone had dropped an anvil on him give james a sweat stained black and blue points he was of from the field of at the foul line and handed out assists it was a jordan like performance against a team that prides itself on defense and often used at least two men to try to stop him " cue the barry bonds watch last night the san francisco giants surly slugger cracked home run no off the new york mets tom glavine leaving him from tying hank aarons career mark victory went to the mets who prepared for the game with a mass head shaving that was career win no for mr glavine approaching his own milestone in the san francisco chronicle ray ratto says its time to begin the weirdness the campaign really kicked off when curt schilling of the boston red sox who face the giants next month a potentially significant date called bonds a cheater during a radio interview "you might have thought it wouldnt really get heated until he got his homer total to which given the number of times he is likely to be walked in the next few weeks might take him to the start of june " mr ratto writes "but no the summer of weird is upon us already courtesy of the damned red sox now we enjoy americans making a spectacle of themselves as much as the next eight or folks and few subjects have made people pull off their own heads in exasperation quite like our b lamar b lord knows many a good broken bottle fight has been started in our local em pour iums over bonds in the last few years and as he closes in on the aaron number the brawls will resume in earnest " meanwhile espn coms jemele hill has a request for god "can you smite barry bonds before he breaks major league baseballs all time home run record ok maybe smiting is a little extreme could you conjure up some locusts every time he bats give him a few boils crack a stone tablet over his head " continuing to address the demiurge ms hill writes that "hank aaron deserves better than to see his record broken by an unlikable arrogant cheater who has done nothing but heighten stereotypes of black athletes he is unquestionably a hall of famer and the best player of this generation but he is not nearly the man aaron is and should not surpass him in any way you gave aaron incredible poise under such unimaginable duress aaron received letters a day the year he pursued babe ruths record and was called the n word and myriad other racial epithets so much its a wonder he remembered his name aarons life was threatened many times the racism bonds alludes to is nothing compared to what aaron faced and the general lack of support directed at bonds is self created " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us
