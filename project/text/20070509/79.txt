factiva news and information database service wsj com the marketwatch web site and a chain of community newspapers mr zannino through an intermediary encouraged mr murdoch to put his offer in writing and present it to the dow jones board later that week mr zannino informed then dow jones chairman peter kann and general counsel joseph stern about the overture mr kann set up an april telephonic board meeting to inform directors of the offer then on april mr murdoch sent a letter to the board saying he was willing to pay &# a share for dow jones a huge premium to the stock which at the time was trading at about &# a share the sec said that prior to their dow jones stock purchases the wongs owned mostly fixed income securities as well as equities valued at &# they started buying dow jones stock on april before mr murdoch sent his letter to the companys board through two accounts held at merrill lynch in hong kong the wongs only previous u s stock holding was shares of intel corp valued at about &# the sec said the shares of dow jones the sec says increased the value of the stock in the wongs accounts by times to buy the dow jones stock the wongs needed more money than they currently had in their merrill lynch accounts which held &# in cash or equivalents available to buy securities the wongs bought shares of dow jones on april and april the sec said it said those purchases were funded by ms wongs father who transferred &# million into the wongs merrill lynch accounts on april that transfer funded "dollar for dollar" the dow jones stock purchases the sec said on april the day the murdoch letter was sent to the dow jones board the wongs bought additional shares which were funded nearly "dollar for dollar" by a &# million money transfer made on april by an unidentified person using a j p morgan chase &amp co account in brussels the sec said in the days leading up to april the wongs bought additional shares of dow jones stock for &# million the wongs used two margin loans to pay for &# million of the dow jones stock with the rest coming from another money transfer from the j p morgan account in brussels on may mr wong placed an order with his broker to sell the shares and asked the broker how long it would take for the trade to settle the sec said that same day merrill lynch referred the unusual trade to the sec according to people familiar with the matter the sec which has increased its focus on insider trading cases in recent months is also investigating unusual trading in dow jones options in the days leading up to the disclosure of the news corp offer in april more than call options were traded compared with just during the entire first quarter call options give investors the right but not the obligation to buy shares of a company at a specified price on a certain date many of the dow jones options were traded after news corp made its bid for dow jones but before it was publicly announced the investigation into the stock and option trading is continuing a person who discloses inside information in violation of a duty even if he didnt trade on the information can be held liable for insider trading if the person he tipped traded securities the sec has filed charges against tippers who didnt trade and has sought permanent injunctions and penalties regulators would have to show that the tipper knew that the person given the information would trade or that he was reckless in not knowing that the person would trade if the person who trades has no idea that the information was provided in breach of a duty then he may not be liable for insider trading the further removed that person is from an initial source of information the harder it can be to make the case in the sec filed cases involving insider trading representing about of its enforcement actions in the sec filed insider trading cases accounting for of all enforcement actions brought that year if the sec were to succeed in proving the wongs violated insider trading laws it should be relatively easy for the agency to collect the &# million because the judge froze the merrill account which essentially falls under u s regulatory jurisdiction in a written statement merrill lynch which is based in new york said "insider trading is a violation of both the law and merrill lynch policy and we cooperate fully with the authorities investigating suspected cases " kate linebaugh in hong kong contributed to this article
