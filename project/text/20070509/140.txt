whats behind cheaper printer cartridges h p kodak others slash prices but also volume of ink a higher cost per page printer makers such as hewlett packard co and eastman kodak co have recently introduced cheaper printer ink cartridges priced at around &# but consumers may find that paying less at the cash register ends up costing them more in the long run thats because there is less ink in some of the new cartridges so the cost of each page printed is actually higher also some of the printers that accept the new lower priced cartridges cost more than other printers companies are rolling out lower priced cartridges as they increasingly compete with the growing market of "remanufactured" or "refilled" ink cartridges printer makers such as h p have long sold printers for little or no profit making up the loss from ink sales but that business model has recently come under pressure from discount players such as cartridge world a chain store that refills empty ink cartridges and large office supply stores such as staples inc and office depot inc that sell their own brands of remanufactured cartridges many refillers offer cartridges at prices up to less than those of big printer makers by refilled and remanufactured ink cartridges are projected to account for of the world wide ink cartridge market up from in according to lyra research inc h p the largest u s printer company late last month unveiled new black ink and color ink cartridges for &# and &# respectively or and less than previous comparable cartridges costing &# and &# respectively in february kodak rolled out a &# black ink cartridge and a &# color ink cartridge that same month canon inc released a new black ink cartridge for &# and a new color cartridge for &# down from &# and &# respectively but a closer look at some of the new cartridges reveals that consumers may be paying higher prices for their printer ink over the long run in one comparison an older h p standard black ink cartridge contained milliliters of ink while the new standard cartridge has just milliliters of ink as a result the cost of printing with the new h p black ink cartridge rises to cents a page from cents a page for the older cartridge according to lyra canons new ink cartridges also come with less ink than their predecessors canons new black ink cartridge contains milliliters of ink down from milliliters in the old version that bumps up the cost of printing per page to cents from cents previously canons new color ink cartridge contains nine milliliters of ink for a printing cost of cents a page versus milliliters previously for a cost of cents a page meanwhile kodaks &# and &# ink cartridges are tied to the launch of several new kodak printers which are priced higher than other printers kodaks printers cost &# to &# or around &# more than some comparable models by rivals many printer makers now want to appear to match the refillers prices in order to better compete analysts say charlie brewer a lyra analyst says printer companies started introducing ink cartridges in the &# range in following the launch of cheaper refilled cartridges from office superstores such as staples and office depot "companies understand that consumers are getting miffed at the amount they have to pay for cartridges " says mr brewer some printer executives acknowledge the new &# cartridges wont lower consumers costs "there will be cases where the cost of printing per page goes up" with the new h p cartridges says pradeep jotwani who heads the supplies business for the palo alto calif company but he argues that offering the lower priced cartridges gives choices to consumers who dont print much and who simply want to save money on the upfront purchase h p has also introduced some "higher yield" cartridges for people who print more and for whom cost per print is more important mr jotwani notes he says there are some cases where the cost of printing per page ends up decreasing in one example h ps new color cartridge with milliliters of ink can be measured against an older cartridge that contained five milliliters of ink in that instance the cost per page drops to cents from cents previously says an h p spokeswoman michael duffett a canon director of inkjet printer marketing also says customers who dont print much will benefit "with the small amount of prints being made by this audience initial ink purchasing cost becomes a stronger motivation over cost per print " mr duffett says the new cartridges are forcing at least one seller of remanufactured ink cartridges to cut back in february staples decided to stop selling its lower priced staples branded ink cartridges that work with h p printers which were manufactured by inkcycle inc an ink and toner manufacturer based in lenexa kan scott rankin a staples vice president says h ps new cartridges made it too difficult for the retailer to continue stocking its own remanufactured cartridges since the retailer couldnt match h ps technology in each of the new offerings "it introduced a new level of complexity into the system " he says he adds that staples will consider whether it makes sense to discontinue its staples branded cartridges for other vendors apart from h p still printer makers have a way to go in persuading consumers to buy their ink talal itani who owns an electronics design business in plano texas
