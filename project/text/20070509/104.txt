praise for americas arab language tv on a recent trip to the middle east i met with israeli and arab leaders inside and outside of government i was pleased to hear their praise for al hurra americas arabic language television network i was told consistently that al hurra is filling a void in the middle east by providing accurate information about america and by addressing issues absent on other arab news stations including free speech human rights women empowerment and government accountability all building blocks for freedom and democracy i am struck that the views expressed to me could be so different from those presented by joel mowbray on your editorial page "mad tv " may although we acknowledge that our coverage on the second day of the tehran holocaust conference in december should not have aired it was an error and not indicative of an editorial position when one examines the totality of al hurras coverage over the past five months one would find that in the days following the holocaust conference al hurra presented the condemnation of the conference by countries such as israel britain italy germany and the united states al hurra also carried a unique report on members of the washington d c muslim community visiting the holocaust museum and expressing solidarity with the victims as well as an in depth interview with sara bloomfield the museum director also al hurra provided live coverage of president bushs remarks on holocaust remembrance day as well as prime minster olmerts comments from israel one of the more poignant stories that al hurra has recently covered is the ceremony on april at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles honoring tunisian arab khaled abdel wahab credited with saving the lives of jews who lived in tunisia during the holocaust his daughter faiza accepted the award by saying "i have the honor to celebrate my father he saved several members from the violence of the nazis by hiding them in his farm " she was joined by nadia bijaoui whose family was saved from the nazis by faizas father the story of khaled abdel wahab is documented in the book "among the righteous" by al hurra host and washington institute executive director robert satloff al hurra remains committed to covering corruption and human rights abuses recently we covered the sentencing of well known syrian human rights activist anwar al bunni and the torture of egyptian prisoners as well as the humanitarian crisis in darfur in addition al hurra provided live coverage of the state departments release of its annual report on human rights and democracy as well as hearings before the house committee on foreign affairs on the promotion of human rights in u s foreign policy we have learned from our errors and have instituted improved editorial controls for example an assignment desk was established in early march that monitors and flags material as it is received from the field al hurra continues to recruit hire and train language qualified journalists to improve and strengthen the overall quality of our editorial product joaquin blaya chairman middle east committee broadcasting board of governors washington
