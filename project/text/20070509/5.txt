america in iraq the brave soldiers of demon company fight on i am the wife of a first cavalry soldier who is in iraq your article "at lonely iraq outpost gis stay as hope fades" page one may conjured up emotions where all other war reports and articles have sadly failed i have long felt that newspapers and television stations are using form articles and news clips for events in iraq though i try to divert my eyes from the news the pieces i do catch all seem to say the same annoying thing over and over depending on the people involved and the type of attack the media plug in name rank location and specifics of the event it grows frustrating for me to see many americans becoming immune to that type of reporting who can blame them though it becomes easy to disengage ourselves from the war the souls fighting for us their families at home and the reasons we are in iraq we are becoming desensitized to the loss of u s lives your article was graphic and detailed indeed it may make some angry to read such specific details of how and when our soldiers were injured or perished i think it was a much needed belated wake up call for america i hope that your article is read by patriots and non patriots nationwide so that they may remember our loved ones are giving it all in iraq so that we can have it all here in america god bless our troops and god bless america katy ruesink montrose n y your article is a chilling and heartbreaking account of courageous american soldiers stationed without hope being picked off one by one by invisible and implacable foes one asks why did we send them there congratulations to the journal for having the intellectual courage to print this story on the front page paul c randau m d manhattan beach calif our history is filled with stories of small units that suffered grievously as the larger tide of war swept over them think bataan wake island and st vith to name a few the folly of holding out those small incidents as an example of how the greater effort was lost is obvious to do so in the instance of demon company is no less so the brave soldiers of demon company deserve our undying gratitude and respect for not only enduring their unenviable predicament with such grace and courage but also doing their duty in helping america defend her interests and the liberty of people around the world t j marta scotch plains n j
