journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources science why astronauts need down time in space some of the most interesting scientific discoveries made by astronauts occur during the all too rare free moments on space missions science writer james oberg says astronauts spend much of their time on maintenance equipment handling exercise and working their way down a list of tightly scripted research what time remains is generally used to catch up on sleep that gives astronauts little opportunity to tinker with scientific instruments or simply look at what is around them thats a shame mr oberg says because when astronauts have been off the script it has led to some significant scientific findings during a mission to the international space station astronaut michael fincke didnt have the scientific instruments he needed to carry out his planned experiments giving him some unexpected time to play around with other lab gear while doing so he discovered a strange spectacle in which the speed of a molten metal ball spun around a wire was affected by heat the phenomenon isnt detectable in earths gravity similarly american astronaut andy thomas provided some rigor to the understanding of how moisture behaves in space thanks to some experiments on water and metal he conducted in to fill time on the mir space station where he wasnt certified to use most of the russian equipment many other scientific discoveries have come from astronauts puzzling over strange sights around them most of what is known about so called noctilucent clouds thin beautiful wisps that hover at the edge of the earths atmosphere comes from years of astronauts sketching and trying to photograph them in their spare time the strength of a certain type of cosmic ray was first recognized in when buzz aldrin asked fellow astronauts if they like him were seeing occasional streaks of light when their eyes were closed such discoveries off the beaten path of the national aeronautic and space administrations research agenda prompt the question attributed to an apollo program geologist "if human beings can do much better science than robots why does nasa make its astronauts do science like robots " seed june literature comedy gets less respect and novels are poorer for it western culture has emphasized tragedy over comedy since the middle ages a form of snobbery that has left serious readers with little alternative to a long line of whiny and anxious novels says writer julian gough this wasnt always the case for the ancient greeks tragedy and comedy carried equal weight with tragedy representing the human perspective while comedy reflected the gods point of view but in the religiously authoritarian societies that dominated the middle ages the greek tragedies lamenting the woes suffered by rulers were preserved in greater numbers than comedies that mocked their flaws comedy returned to the western cultural tradition around the early th century says mr gough thanks to the novel which gave writers like cervantes a way to mock the sacred science meanwhile began to offer a "nonjudgmental perspective" on humanity all of this should have allowed comedy to flourish but comic novelists have been unable to shake the stigma they carried long ago while their more tragically oriented peers have thrived mr gough notes how john kennedy tooles satirical classic "a confederacy of dunces " was rejected during the authors lifetime by publishers it appeared in print a year after mr tooles death similarly it took years for the talents of comic writers such as evelyn waugh and p g wodehouse to be acknowledged british novelist martin amiss best funniest works were passed over for the prestigious man booker prize the work of the young americans recently selected by the magazine granta as the best of the decade is "infused by loss " pushed to "generate suffering in order to be proper writers these writers force themselves to frown rather than smile " prospect magazine may fitness dropping cardio isnt path to healthy heart slimming does cardiovascular exercise actually hamper a persons efforts to lose weight those hours spent sweating on the treadmill in an effort to slim down would have been better spent on a simpler routine of lifting weights says author and personal trainer jim karas that is because cardio workouts make people hungry prompting them to overeat mr karas contends in his book "cardio free diet" that strength training provides equal benefit to the heart without the wear and tear on joints not so fast several fitness experts say even if the cardio cult overemphasizes the benefits of aerobics it isnt wise to give up cardio entirely joann manson chief of preventive medicine at brigham and womens hospital in boston says many people actually report fewer hunger pangs after a workout cedric bryant chief science officer of the not for profit american council on exercise says that while strength training is important even fast weight lifting cant provide the same benefits to the heart as cardiovascular exercise u s news and world report may see more on our blog at wsj com informedreader send
