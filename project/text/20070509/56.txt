extending streak while tending to loyal clients questions for rich silverstein company goodby silverstein &amp partners title co chairman san francisco ad agency goodby silverstein &amp partners went to unusual lengths to win the commonwealth bank of australias ad business last month two employees of the agency spent a day camped out at the san francisco airport terminal of australias national airline qantas airways equipped with sleeping bags and video cameras the duo emailed home made movies of their adventure to bank executives insisting they wouldnt leave the airport unless they won the business the stunt worked extending an extraordinary hot streak for the agency known for its clever "got milk" ads goodby has landed about &# billion of new business in less than two months from marketers that include sprint and hyundai motor america what makes the hot streak particularly welcome for the omnicom group owned shop is that it comes after the sting of losing longtime client general motorss saturn earlier this year agency co chairman rich silverstein talks below about how the shop is trying to balance the need of new clients while not neglecting long time clients and why the shop embraced the web earlier than many of its rivals wsj many times ad firms that enjoy new business hot streaks tend to eventually experience a slew of losses because longtime clients feel theyre being neglected how will you prevent that from happening mr silverstein we have four major creative directors and so we can spend time on different accounts the clients get it they get the attention i think the first thing is bring them good work we do say things to them but its still about wowing the clients with work but some do ask the commonwealth bank of australia sent an email during the pitch saying "now that you got sprint do we even exist " and we made it clear that they existed we paid so much attention to them wsj how did you reassure them mr silverstein we had a creative team that doesnt work on sprint or hyundai camp out at san francisco international airport in front of qantas airways they had sleeping bags and pillows and we said to the bank in a video email "they are not leaving until you call us and tell us to get on a plane and start working for you " in one video we sent to them i personally complained "please hire them because its too expensive for me to feed them airport food " it was a way to show we care and to show them that the people that would be working on that account would not be people working on sprint and hyundai there are two things agencies have to do respect their long term relationships and they have to go after new business no client wants an agency that is a dinosaur and you have to be relevant to stay relevant you have to do new work for different types of clients wsj nike recently pulled work from wieden &amp kennedy in part because of its lack of digital know how goodby over the past few years really immersed itself in digital mindset how difficult was it and what were the challenges mr silverstein i am truly amazed that agencies are just waking up to the web its kind of like people saying there is no global warming or its kind of like car companies saying you think we should make something besides gas guzzling automobiles its just crazy the easiest part for us was hiring people who loved working in the web they are a young and energetic people the real challenge was changing the existing people in the agency the traditional art directors writers and account people they were asking where do we fit in here the challenge was "oh that is just internet and i dont want to write banner ads " so we had to really immerse our traditional folk into the web it was like art school meets a world economy i remember complaining one day and saying "oh my god are we relevant anymore because no one cares about tv anymore " we are the agency that brought tivo out the media world has just exploded there are just so many choices it was a brushfire that turned into a firestorm so it was fear and i remember saying "we have to do something " it was easier for us because we have always had a respect here for design the web is just great design that moves and we had hired an animator and created an animation department so with design and animation already here our transition to the web was a bit easier i think i had been training for this my whole life i love graphic design and i love emotion so how do you put graphic design to emotion simple its the web wsj many of the major telecom companies are struggling to differentiate their offerings in a saturated marketplace sprint is an ailing brand can new ads really help mr silverstein its always both problems great advertising can kill a bad product and a great product with ok advertising can go a long way but you have to have a great product there are some hidden gems in sprint so its exciting but it is a great marketing challenge wsj it seems ad firms are trying to figure out what role they play nowadays with marketers some want to be consultants some want to be investors in the companies they are working with and some want to be content creators for marketers what business do you think you are in these days and what is the most threatening to people in ad land mr silverstein i want to be better partners with my client a deeper partner that affects their bottom line so get involved with everything the client is doing that means designing products coming up with names for products and advertising its having a stronger relationship i really hope in the future we are helping design cars and designing products for sprint doing content for them that would be cool agencies are great resources for clients and clients that draw a line in the sand and say "you are only going to do ads for us" are wrong i dont want to just do ads i want to touch and affect the companys bottom line i dont want to be a supplier wsj after years of being in the dumps the san francisco ad market seems to be suddenly thriving why mr silverstein there is a little renaissance going on in san francisco the market has had its ups and downs but its really blossoming now if you look we have four different car accounts in san francisco butler shine stern &amp partners landed mini and there is chuck mcbride who just opened cutwater they just got jeep wsj you currently have to go on a major hiring binge how will you be able to find that much talent in san francisco an area where most of the marketing talent left following the dot com bust mr silverstein we have people that we need to hire and it takes at least nine interviews before we hire one person we have always had a great reel of tv ads and we have always been good at hiring people so we moved beyond making tv ads but we still are very good at hiring and training people that is why other shops steal our people which i get pissed at people want to work at our company but getting them to san francisco isnt easy i think its hard the week we got the sprint account five of our creative people said "we have to leave for different reasons " one staffers wife had to go to new york another had a girlfriend wife that had to go to los angeles and another wanted to go to amsterdam i was like "no way " so to hire we look to the outside world in the last two weeks we have hired six people one from brazil a jamaican and some from amsterdam new york and chicago
