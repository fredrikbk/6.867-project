the countrys roman catholic bishops opposed the notion the pontiffs visit the year olds first trip to latin america since he became pope two years ago comes at a critical moment for the church here although brazil has more catholics than any other country in the world around million catholicism here is in a quickening decline about of people said they were catholic in a census down from in the losses are coming mostly at the hands of evangelical protestant congregations primarily pentecostal churches despite catholics efforts to compete in the s the church became politically active resisting brazils military dictatorship and reaching out to the poor more recently it has encouraged "charismatic catholicism " whose practitioners hold evangelical inspired revivals speak in tongues and even carry out exorcisms it has also given its blessing to marcelo rossi a singing priest who does aerobics during mass and has sold millions of albums as the popes visit will no doubt show the church is also greatly aided by the popularity of saints and representations of the virgin mary among brazilian catholics thats the kind of catholicism practiced by ms silva who rarely attends mass but has several statuettes of friar galvao in her sparsely furnished home each year hundreds of thousands turn out to celebrate st george and the virgin mary in recent years the vatican has overseen a huge expansion of the number of saints after lowering the requirement for sainthood from four miracles to two and phasing out the "devils advocate " the legal team tapped to challenge the case for sainthood pope john paul ii canonized people including more than in asia born in latin america a handful from poland as well as numerous spaniards and italians according to the vaticans web site that was more than all the popes before him combined according to some tallies the vatican sought to streamline the process of canonization because it was sometimes taking centuries john paul ii also believed that people identify best with saints from their own area and thought saints were "an underused evangelical tool " says kenneth p woodward who interviewed the pope in preparing his book "making saints " the vatican only recognized the first indigenous american saint mexicos juan diego in says andrew chesnut a historian at the university of texas pope watchers say the new pontiffs decision to hold a major bishops meeting at our lady of aparecida a shrine to the virgin mary thats a hotbed of popular catholicism and saintly worship shows the churchs reliance on the popular appeal of saints in the shrines basement sits the "room of promises " where thousands of brazilians have left items including letters they have written and wax body parts to thank the virgin for miracles among the highlights a cellphone that stopped a bullet and the jersey of a brazilian soccer star who left it there after a knee injury had cleared up evangelical protestants dont believe in praying to statues of saints or the virgin mary they consider it a form of idolatry forbidden in the bible in a leading evangelical minister made the point by kicking and punching a statue of our lady of aparecida on live tv causing national outrage among catholics in brazil and other countries in latin america pope benedict says he is counting on the "fervent devotion" of local catholics and that often revolves around favorite saints ms silva says it was a devout aunt jandira francisco rainho who prayed most vigorously for her when she fell ill with hepatitis at the age of during the days the girl was in intensive care ms rainho would sneak in holy water from a convent founded by friar galvao and spread it on the girls lips when ms silva recovered "without explanation " she says her aunt took her to the convent and laid her on the friars tomb to thank him she also wrote the convent a letter describing the miracle it was spotted by sister celia cadorin a nun who had recently been appointed by a local bishop to pursue friar galvaos case for sainthood "i could see right away it was a good miracle " she says sister cadorin had to work years for the vatican to recognize friar galvaos miracles she looked through purported miracles to identify a second case involving a difficult pregnancy by a woman living in brasilia the nun says she had to obtain expert medical opinions hire theologians and prepare fancy presentations to send to officials in rome "the first miracle cost &# and the second cost me between euros and euros about &# to &# " she says the money was raised through donations the sao paulo nunnery founded by friar galvao has been drawing crowds and demand for his pills has soared they are swallowed but they dont actually contain medicine rather prayers
