jc flowers other deal sets buyout precedent u s banks have been largely off limits to the buyout firms that have been snapping up companies in just about every other industry around the world but a recent transaction involving private equity firm jc flowers &amp co may help open the gates it isnt last months &# billion deal to buy sallie mae parent slm corp widely seen as a groundbreaking deal in the broader financial services industry instead another recent flowers deal with a far smaller price tag could be just as important in setting the stage for more private equity buyouts of u s banks in october a flowers led group agreed to buy a roughly stake in germanys hsh nordbank ag for about billion euros &# billion the transaction wouldnt have attracted much notice except that the lender has a branch in new york city that means nordbank is subject to regulation by the federal reserve which generally bars firms that arent registered as bank holding companies from acquiring controlling positions in banks most private equity firms have been reluctant to register as holding companies which subjects them to rigorous oversight and restrictions on their use of borrowed money so new york based flowers got creative instead of buying the stake itself it set up five trusts controlled by limited partners in flowers funds each trust acquired less than of nordbanks shares keeping them below the threshold that would trigger increased fed scrutiny the transactions structure hasnt been publicly disclosed but its basic contours are apparent from heavily redacted documents the fed has released to law firms that filed freedom of information act requests the fed blessed the deal in november and bankers lawyers and private equity firms are buzzing that it is likely to become a model for future transactions "there are probably a lot of financial services firms out there that could be acquired" using similar structures said isaac lustgarten a partner at new york law firm mcdermott will &amp emery "because it doesnt push the boundaries of the banking laws its clearly something that private equity firms could do in other deals for banking firms " the same concept could apply to deals in other heavily regulated industries such as airlines he said the setup meant an unusual role for flowers which was founded by former goldman sachs group inc banker christopher flowers and generally buys direct stakes in financial institutions such as japans shinsei bank instead of investing in nordbank flowers recruited investors to put money into the trusts according to people familiar with the matter while the trusts cant act as a group which would provoke fed concerns about a single unregulated entity controlling a bank they are all being advised by flowers which is collecting fees from the investors the people said representative of flowers didnt respond to requests for comment a fed spokeswoman declined to comment the transaction was devised with the help of renowned banking lawyer h rodgin cohen of sullivan &amp cromwell llp who thinks more such deals are likely "there are a variety of structures which have the potential for enabling private equity to take controlling positions in depository institutions " mr cohen said indeed some top wall street law firms already are pitching the structure to private equity clients as a way to buy big stakes in banks according to lawyers and investment bankers private equity firms including kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co are said to be on the prowl for bank deals "we expect to see an acquisition of a bank or thrift by a financial sponsor by the end of this year " said brian sterling co head of investment banking at sandler oneill &amp partners which represents many small and midsize banks he pointed to the nordbank deal as a landmark structure of course nordbank has just one u s branch which may have made it easier for the fed to stomach the deal lawyers say that while finessing fed concerns about ownership structures the nordbank structure didnt involve adding debt to the banks balance sheet a defining feature of leveraged buyouts and something that might have caused the fed to block the deal experts also say regulators are unlikely to approve a buyout of a top u s bank even if the stakes are split among a handful of ostensibly independent trusts the nordbank deal "is a very different situation than coming into a control position in a real u s bank " said alison davis a managing partner at belvedere capital a san francisco private equity firm that is registered as a bank holding company she said similar structures could be used to cobble together deals for nonmajority stakes in banks but are unlikely to work for outright acquisitions but cornelius hurley the director of boston universitys banking law program and a former fed official said it isnt important that nordbank is a foreign bank with a tiny u s presence for buyouts of small and midsize banks the fed probably will be consistent about approving this type of structure "its a precedent " he said jed horowitz and damian paletta contributed to this article
