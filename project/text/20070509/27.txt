china mobiles ceo trolls asia for acquisitions beijing china mobile communications corp parent of the worlds biggest cellphone carrier is looking for acquisitions elsewhere in asia but the soaring valuations for telecommunications assets make this a difficult time to buy the companys top executive said "it is a bad time for buyers because the price is so high " said wang jianzhou chief executive of china mobile communications in an interview "so today we dont have an exact target for our further acquisition but it doesnt reduce our strategy and we continue to look for new opportunities " china mobile communications listed unit china mobile ltd has a market value of about &# billion bigger than any other wireless company and second only to at&amp t inc in the broader telecommunications industry with million subscribers at the end of march china mobile ltd is also by far the worlds biggest wireless carrier by number of customers the company is still growing quickly at home though it is facing declines in the average amount that customers spend as it targets increasingly rural populations for new subscribers despite the enormous home market the parent company has begun expanding overseas consistent with a broader push by chinese businesses to raise their international profile in january following the failure of previous acquisition attempts china mobile communications announced its first purchase outside china paying &# million for an stake in pakistans paktel ltd that acquisition was done by the parent as investors in the listed unit were wary of the risk however china mobile ltd might acquire the pakistan operation from its parent in the future said mr wang who also is chairman and ceo of the listed company mr wang said that for any further acquisitions "priority is for neighboring countries in asia " but he stressed that the company will move judiciously and said it has no timeline for further deals "for me there are always two voices " he said "one says china mobile is so large you have a lot of cash you need to do international expansion thats your responsibility the other voice says be careful very few acquisitions have been successful in telecommunications " the telecom executive said his company has advantages operating in emerging markets because of its own experience with rapid growth and because of the savings it can garner on equipment as a result of its massive purchasing power he said the goal of any acquisition is to increase profitability china mobile ltd is continuing to expand rapidly at home in the first three months of this year it added an average of million subscribers a month mr wang expects to continue adding four million to five million subscribers every month by focusing on rural areas where much untapped demand remains "we still have a lot of room to grow " he said however china mobile ltd s average revenue per user is being pulled down as more of its new subscribers come from poorer rural areas and as it faces competition from internet based phone services forcing it to reduce rates mr wang said the company is seeking to limit the decline by pushing pricier data services for its urban customers he said china mobile ltd s monthly revenue averages about &# a user mr wang said he acknowledged this number will decline in coming months but "not so much " he wouldnt elaborate last year the companys average revenue per user was basically the same as in at yuan or about &# a month mr wang declined to talk in detail about another topic of great importance to chinas telecom industry plans for advanced third generation wireless networks that will allow high speed services like video streaming over cellphones the parent of china mobile ltd is spearheading tests of a locally pioneered g technology called td scdma in eight chinese cities unlike the two other g technology standards in use elsewhere in the world td scdma is unproven commercially but chinas government is pushing the domestic standard as a way to support domestic manufacturers of network equipment many analysts expect that the governments decision to have china mobile communications build the main td scdma trial networks means that the listed company will be forced to use the technology when authorities finally issue long awaited g licenses that would leave other smaller state owned carriers to use the established international standards but mr wang said that china mobile ltd isnt necessarily locked in to td scdma "the message from the authorities is that the trial system is the trial system not the g license and we think that after we test the technology we will make the decision on what technology to use " he said he reiterated a commitment to ensure that visitors to beijing during the olympics in august will be provided with g services but said he wouldnt be able to elaborate on how until after the trial networks construction is completed probably this october "i will answer all the questions about g and the olympics after october when we finish the trial system then i will tell you the details about that " mr wang said
