grasso rolls spitzer yet another of former new york attorney general eliot spitzers legal cases flamed out yesterday as a state appellate court dismissed the heart of his suit against former new york stock exchange chief dick grasso we sympathize with current ag andrew cuomo who now gets to pick up the pieces thats about all thats left after the appellate judges tossed out four of the six counts that mr spitzer brought against mr grasso in over a &# million pay package mr spitzer who is now governor had claimed authority to sue mr grasso under new yorks "not for profit law " arguing that the pay was "unreasonable " but as the court ruled yesterday mr spitzer had also done an end run around the law claiming authority not found in any statute as a result the court ruled "the attorney general does not have the authority" to proceed with most of the case mr spitzer had to invent entirely new powers because he knew hed have difficulty winning a case under the regular not for profit law that statute requires the ag to prove that the pay was "unreasonable" and that the defendant had acted in bad faith while the grasso affair has no heroes especially not the nyses dysfunctional former board of directors there is little if any evidence that mr grasso engineered his compensation without board knowledge the remaining two counts against mr grasso are rooted in the not for profit law but should those counts go to trial mr grasso will be allowed to mount a good faith defense as well as to have his case heard in front of a jury something denied him on the other four novel counts both enhance his chances of prevailing mr spitzer yesterday called the appeals court ruling a mere "technical issue " though we cant help but wonder if mr cuomo is as cheerful we suggest he drop the whole thing and let mr spitzer take responsibility for his own legal abuses
