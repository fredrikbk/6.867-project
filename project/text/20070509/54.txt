it will take steps this year to push beijing and possibly tokyo into allowing their currencies to rise against the dollar at least four currency bills are pending in congress and another major piece of bipartisan legislation is expected next month as michael m phillips reports one bill would require the administration to determine if china has manipulated its currency and impose tariffs on chinese products to counter the currency advantage others would apply u s countervailing duty laws written to deal with foreign government export subsidies to products coming from nonmarket economies like china the bills would allow duties to be imposed counter currency misalignment an easier threshold to reach than intentional manipulation next months measure might make it easier for the
