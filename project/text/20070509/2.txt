a long love affair with bach brings passion to pennsylvania bethlehem bach festival the bach choir friday and saturday go to www bach org for a listing of remaining performances and lectures scherer bethlehem pa to many people this second largest city in pennsylvanias beautiful lehigh valley is forever linked to the lurid glow of bessemer converters belching flame and white hot rivers of molten steel an image consigned to memory since the closing of the bethlehem steel mill in established by moravian pioneers in and formally named that christmas eve bethlehem is also a quintessential american college town and the youthful energy that flows from its two major campuses lehigh university and moravian college creates a stimulating dialectic with the towns profile as an intelligent example of historic preservation the handsome city center boasting a remarkable stock of th th and early th century architecture set against a backdrop of truly lovely landscape to many lovers of choral music however bethlehem means the annual bethlehem bach festival performed by the bach choir the choir was formed in by a tenacious bach devotee an american organist and conductor named j fred wolle and after hearing the choir in its th annual bach festival i can say that wolles legacy is an american musical treasure just to clarify the arithmetic this is the th bach festival since wolle had first created a bethlehem choral union which gave the first american performance of bachs "st john passion" in after reorganizing his volunteer choristers into the bach choir years later he led them in the american premiere of the mass in b minor in something that made history books even at that time after disbanding the bach choir when he took a professorship at the university of california wolle reconstituted the group upon returning to bethlehem in and the festivals were resumed in now under the baton of greg funfgeld the choirs artistic director since the bach choir represents a musical culture that was once a vital part of american life post civil war america shared with victorian england a love of choral music and oddly enough choral societies and major choral festivals often sprang up in industrial areas like leeds huddersfield and birmingham in englands sooty midlands american mill towns like worcester mass and places with large german immigrant populations like cincinnati and milwaukee why this link between choral music and heavy industry at that time most industrial towns offered few pastimes for their working class populace beside taverns and blood sports hence the founding of amateur choruses with their regularly scheduled rehearsals offered men and women an opportunity for respectable social interaction combined with the positive aspect of learning and performing music bethlehem with its moravian heritage was a particular hotbed of choral activity german speaking followers of the protestant leader count nikolaus von zinzendorf moravians had brought their own musical heritage from central europe to the lehigh valley especially a particularly beautiful brand of sacred choral music moreover among the musical relics preserved from bethlehems early days are a set of early th century performance parts to bachs cantata no "ein feste burg " which suggests that the town heard the first performance of a bach choral work in north america two decades before young felix mendelssohns epochal berlin revival of the "st matthew passion" in which helped ignite renewed interest in bachs music following the long period of general neglect it suffered after bachs death in certainly fridays "matthew passion" and saturdays mass were well worth the pilgrimage from new york these bach singers come from all walks of life here but together they sing with a fervor and a level of musicianship that carries one away from bass to soprano the supple strength and solidly integrated tone of this amateur choir reflects the most admirable qualities of the european american tradition of choral song mr funfgelds long relationship with the choir and musicians was apparent in the fine choral and instrumental balances he achieved the clarity of the contrapuntal textures throughout and his thoughtful tempos there was some notable solo singing especially the expressive silvery alto of daniel taylor baritone william sharps very fine jesus sympathetic without being maudlin tenor frederick urreys insightful evangelist and soprano rosa lamoreauxs sweetly emotive tone in her solitary mass aria "laudamus te " which made me wish she had been given more opportunity to be heard there was also some wonderful solo instrumental work especially the pliant obligato solos and duets of oboists mary watt and nobu kitagawa in both the passion and the mass over the past two decades mr funfgeld has expanded the bach choirs activities beyond the annual bach festival to include christmas concerts and an admirable program of youth outreach events throughout the lehigh valley region most notably he has widened the offerings of the venerable festival itself this year saturday mornings ifor jones memorial chamber music concerts featured two programs that placed bach in the context of his own musical contemporaries and predecessors i regretted having to miss the baltimore consorts program "bach and the italian connection " featuring music that ranged from josquin willaert and giulio caccini to locatelli barbara strozzi and bach himself but i didnt regret attending instead the program by paul taylors taylor dance company featuring two taylor classics "airs " to music by handel and "esplanade " to music by bach it provided a refreshing visual intermezzo between the weekends two choral masterpieces as rewarding as the musical offerings are themselves its the chance to experience them in this wonderful setting that makes the bethlehem bach festival distinctive the quietude of this well preserved corner of america is a tonic for urban weary souls situated against a backdrop of rolling wooded hills and valleys lehigh universitys late victorian packer memorial church makes a handsome venue for bach even the great rusting hulk of the abandoned steel mill in the valley below the campus lends a certain stark majesty to the scene mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal
