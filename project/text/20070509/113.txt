short stories hard covers new partners in crime fiction the first detective stories most scholars agree were short stories edgar allan poes s "tales of ratiocination " and when english author arthur conan doyle years later adapted poes patterns to chronicle the exploits of sherlock holmes he did it largely through brief adventures written for magazines bought by railway commuters it took about the length of a train journey from london to the suburbs it seems to read one of doyles colorful tightly constructed puzzles doyles many descendants wrote mystery short stories throughout much of the th century and in america dozens of periodicals thrived on them from mainstream magazines such as colliers and the saturday evening post to hard boiled pulp publications including black mask to pocket sized digests such as ellery queens mystery magazine and alfred hitchcocks mystery magazine while the last two monthlies are still on newsstands most other mystery digests have vanished victims of changing habits and tastes even as crime novels of all subgenres from spy thrillers to stalker sagas became well established on best seller lists crime related short stories came to seem almost as scarce as classic schwinn bicycles but the short crime story is making a comeback in the st century not through magazines but in books anthologies of original tales pegged to a common theme be it sports male female entanglements or the city of baltimore poes deathplace "the anthologies were a natural outgrowth i think to fulfill the desire for some people to read short fiction and others to write it " suggests otto penzler the new york publishing figure and crime fiction scholar who has edited several such volumes in the past few years including "murder at the racetrack " "dangerous women" and "murder at the foul line" "i really love the challenge of short stories " maryland author laura lippman told me recently from texas where she was touring in support of her best selling novel "what the dead know " ms lippman who has contributed to among other all original anthologies several volumes of akashic books"noir series" including "dublin noir " "new orleans noir " "d c noir " as well as "baltimore noir " which she edited admitted she will write a short story whenever shes asked to "its tricky because theyre not cost effective in the time it takes to write a short story i can write about a th of a novel i mean a short story takes a month they have to be so finely tuned and you cant really get away with anything i think people want to be somewhat surprised the story has to take a turn that they didnt see coming doesnt necessarily have to be a big o henry gasp kind of moment but they are looking for a very tight well told story " her personal payoff she said comes in the way short story writing allows her to be creative in ways she hadnt expected to be "its such good cross training for novel writing in that its allowed me to have a very different voice ive been able to write very dark yet funny short stories which is something thats different than my novel length work " as an example she cites her story "easy as a b c " from "baltimore noir " which is at once a cautionary tale of neighborhood gentrification and an homage to edgar allan poes "the cask of amontillado " such carefully crafted tales have retained a particular appeal in the century and a half between poe and ms lippman thinks mr penzler "theres great joy in short mysteries i think for many people there is for me i love the short story form you know golden age detective fiction master john dickson carr said its the natural form of the mystery especially real classic mystery stories " few writers these days though adhere to those strict old templates the editor acknowledged "having to be so succinct being able to hide a clue in only pages trying to write a pure detective story these days is very very hard weve become much more sophisticated than readers were between the world wars so in that sense short stories are not what they used to be what carr agatha christie ellery queen those people were able to do in the golden age having said that i think the serious writers of today the james crumleys and dennis lehanes and elmore leonards and michael connellys george pelecanos when they write a short story i think on balance it tends frequently to be a much better written story they tend more to be about why somebody did it as opposed to how somebody did it or who did it " ms lippman for one has a knowledge and appreciation of the mystery short story tradition but the tradition is changing she notes "i think short crime fiction today is going through the same phase that novels are going through which is that more and more theyre stories that happen to have crime in them and i dont think people feel bound by any formula or convention so as the definition expands what can be considered a mystery or crime short story becomes broader and broader and broader " but if the form is now expansive enough to include all manner of ultrarealist socially aware psychologically suspenseful neonoir writers it is also inclusive enough to support at least one traditionalist who still plays by golden age rules "ive been publishing now for years " says new york author edward d hoch who in addition to being included in countless anthologies including the recent "the mammoth book of perfect crimes and impossible mysteries" has had a piece in every issue of ellery queens mystery magazine since may "back then the whodunit the detective story in the manner of christie and queen and john dickson carr and other writers of that ilk was important in fact im one of the few writers around that still mainly writes actual whodunits with clues and everything " yet mr hoch with his "fairly clued" tales shares with his younger colleagues the same timeless short story demands and constraints "with a novel you have more room for characterization and if the characters are good and interesting and lively they can sometimes carry a mediocre plot i think with a short story the plot becomes more important you dont have the space for great characterization in a short story you have to sort of grab the reader " it takes him two to three weeks to write a to word tale says mr hoch who averages about such stories a year "once im given the theme i can usually turn out a story quite easily usually i sort of go at it from a backward direction i try to come up with a theme in an unusual manner that probably somebody else isnt going to think of right away " on infrequent occasion he has difficulty finding a starting point he says but this veteran professional cant afford to stay stumped for long "happily i never suffer from writers block more than a few hours at a time " so approximately how many mystery short stories has ed hoch written in years "i know exactly " the year old writer answers with a chuckle and like a true short story master hooks us in three sentences "im up to that ive published im trying my darnedest to get up to a thousand i dont know if ill make it or not " mr nolan is editor of "the archer files the complete short stories of lew archer private investigator including newly discovered case notes " by ross macdonald forthcoming from crippen &amp landru
