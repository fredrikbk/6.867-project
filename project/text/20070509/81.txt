lennar tries web auction to battle housing slump indio calif last november allen harper says he made an offer of &# for a brand new three bedroom house in a development sprouting here in the desert east of palm springs home builder lennar corp s response no thanks six months later lennar jumped at the opportunity to sell the home for that very price to mr harper a year old golf course construction engineer so he scooped it up monday in a rare online auction that attests to the lengths a major builder will go to jump start sales of vacant homes the event also signaled there will be no quick exit for home builders from their current doldrums last year as the housing market weakened lennar was among the first u s home builders to aggressively discount homes in order to move inventory now the miami based company is placing another potentially trend setting bet by testing ebay style internet sales in the housing market online auctions for homes are on the rise nationwide but they are typically held by desperate homeowners or banks unloading foreclosed properties not by major builders pushing blocks of brand new dwellings the experiment in indio is proving that changing home buyers habits isnt easy during the set auction period the lennar homes garnered bids but not one that met undisclosed reserve prices the minimum price lennar deemed acceptable mr harpers &# tender was the highest received for houses with list prices of up to &# lennar agreed to sell after coaxing mr harper who was still competing with one other bidder up to &# minutes after it revealed the reserve prices at the end of the auction monday lennar sealed two other deals that day for about the same price the sales depend on buyers obtaining financing "there are a lot of home builders watching this auction " says tony isbell chief executive of realtybid com the online auction site that conducted lennars day event from his point of view the sale is a big success drawing more than web site hits and about nine bidders per property as opposed to realtybid coms average of about four sales picked up yesterday in a postauction phase as lennar lowered its reserve prices and mr isbell expects that most of the homes will be sold lennar reacted cautiously to the outcome "we are happy with traffic levels " chief financial officer bruce gross says "we will evaluate it and see if we want to use an internet auction somewhere else in the country " mr gross says the auction is meant as a marketing tool to create buzz and entice buyers to palm springs and the coachella valley where pockets of the market are oversupplied this vacation and retirement area was a magnet for speculators and second home buyers during the housing boom and builders also bet on growth among middle class buyers who were priced out of los angeles suburbs but when the market turned many buyers canceled their contracts and left lennar and others with a glut of vacant homes to be sure prices havent dropped in all segments of the greater palm springs market particularly for many high end custom built homes but for more modest homes it has become difficult to find buyers as lenders have tightened financing lennars online sale says mr gross is part of a strategy to "try different things in a challenging time to find out how we can convert inventory to cash at a faster pace " in the quarter ended feb lennars net profit fell to &# million from a year earlier its orders for new homes dropped and its average selling price fell to &# the california slump is especially painful because it has been the most profitable of states where lennar operates the internet auction gambit is perhaps the most creative example of lennars moves to cut prices to sell homes an approach that may help the company weather the downturn better than many of its competitors "they are much better strategically positioned by moving through assets and getting returns today as opposed to waiting for a sunny day " says credit suisse analyst ivy zelman a housing market bear but the flip side is that an auction smacks of desperation and may deter already skittish buyers who are worried that the market could further soften for its inaugural online sale lennar put up residences in three locations a small but representative sample of the companys extensive holdings in the coachella valley in addition to the indio community where mr harper bid lennar offered two million dollar plus homes in upscale rancho mirage which was also a closeout sale and eight condominiums to launch a new development in la quinta

participants could be notified by email when a certain property received a new offer often bids were surpassed by others within seconds when the official auction ended below the reserve price lennar contacted bidders with that price and realtybid com took fresh offers online successful bidders must pay realtybid com a fee of of the sales price lennar took pains to avoid the appearance of a fire sale even instructing salespeople not to refer to it as an "auction " buyers must sign an antispeculation agreement pledging to hold the homes for at least a year by setting reserve prices lennar has given itself cover for refusing to sell though the benchmarks are flexible auction participants say the pressure is evident lennar has stipulated that auction homes must close escrow this month so it can book the sales this fiscal quarter the indio development at the center of lennars online auction bears witness to the housing slump built around an artificial acre lake and near a golf course that
