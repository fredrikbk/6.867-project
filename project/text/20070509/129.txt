tax report a business or just a hobby tricky issue spurs tax court ruling and irs warning the internal revenue service is stepping up efforts to prevent taxpayers from deducting losses on activities that arent genuine businesses run to make a profit the problem its not so easy to tell a budding business from a hobby officials say new research shows taxpayer errors in this area are costing the government billions of dollars a year in unpaid taxes thus auditors are "on the lookout" for people trying to deduct losses from hobbies an irs spokesman says to underscore the agencys concern the irs recently issued a fact sheet the spokesman says is aimed at "making sure that taxpayers know and abide by the rules " the fact sheet summarizes the law which allows taxpayers to deduct "ordinary and necessary" expenses involved in a trade or business generally an activity qualifies as a business if it is carried on "with the reasonable expectation of earning a profit " the irs says what makes this rule so important is that if an activity isnt truly designed to make a profit you cant use losses from it to offset other income this rule applies to individuals partnerships estates trusts and s corporations however the irss interpretation doesnt always prevail as a recent court case illustrates in a decision that is attracting close attention among lawyers and accountants the u s tax court recently ruled in favor of tracey l topping a florida woman who deducted net losses from her equestrian activities which she said were part of her plan to develop a profitable interior design business the decision is especially important because many people run more than one business and there can be important connections between each of those businesses as in ms toppings case moreover the case underscores the importance of keeping good records and putting together "a compelling business strategy " says david aughtry an atlanta lawyer at chamberlain hrdlicka white williams &amp martin who represented ms topping but how are you supposed to figure out whether your activity qualifies as a genuine for profit business that can be exceptionally tricky the irs says you should consider several factors such as does the time and effort put into the activity indicate you intend to make a profit do you and your advisers have the knowledge needed to carry on the activity as a successful business another factor is whether you have made a profit in the past the irs says it "presumes" an activity is indeed carried on for profit if you have made a profit during at least three of the past five tax years including the current year the rule is different at least two of the past seven years for activities that consist primarily of breeding showing training or racing horses it is easy to misunderstand this profit test says frank degen an enrolled agent in setauket n y some activities that have lost money for many years still have qualified as a business intended to make a profit mr degen says to be sure if an activity doesnt qualify as a for profit business you still may be able to deduct certain items but you can deduct them only if you itemize and then only in "a certain sequence " and up to certain limits says george jones of cch a wolters kluwer unit that publishes tax and other business information the topping case is especially interesting because ms toppings lawyers persuaded the tax court that her equestrian and related activities were part of her strategy to build a design business and that the combination was conducted for profit judge joseph goeke agreed with ms toppings assertion that her plan was to use her prominence in the equestrian world to build an interior design business involving homes and high end horse barns he also concluded that the expenses associated with her equestrian activities were "ordinary necessary and reasonable in amount " the judge sided with ms topping even though the irs cited a few other cases in which the tax court had ruled that a taxpayers multiple activities couldnt be lumped together for example the court refused to combine a taxpayers farming polo activity and his real estate law practice despite the taxpayers argument that one reason he began playing polo was to meet clients for his law firm judge goeke said those cases werent analogous to the topping situation the judge agreed there was a "close organizational and economic relationship" between the equestrian and design ventures the irs declined to comment on whether it plans to appeal the decision the irs fact sheet can be found on the irs web site www irs gov type "fs " in the search box whatever the case pay close attention to record keeping "the taxpayer should not commit a foot fault by failing to engage in the dull and time consuming task of keeping business books and records " warns donald alexander a former irs commissioner and now a washington lawyer at akin gump "many fail this basic and elementary requirement "
