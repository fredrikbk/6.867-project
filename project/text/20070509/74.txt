investors fret venture sector may be too big some investors still think the venture capital industry is raising too much money for its own good fueled by returns that overstate its performance a few investors took the opportunity to deliver that message last month at the annual meeting of the national venture capital association in washington which was open to the media for the first time the bluntness of their verdict created a stir among the audience of some members and guests despite the fact that most veteran venture capitalists wouldnt dispute it investors said the industry is riding on the successes of the late s and few funds since have returned committed capital "you have to go back to or to find a fund that has returned capital to investors " said eric doppstadt director of private equity at the ford foundation "were coming up on almost a decade without having distributed back what people gave to their investors " investors also said the industrys historical returns have been driven to an extraordinary degree by the performance of a handful of funds and the tendency to look at average returns means that too much capital flows into the industry as a result since firms have accounted for of the venture capital raised but produced of the total returns said diana frazier a managing director of fund of funds manager flag capital management llc she said her calculations based on confidential data collected by flag understate the discrepancy because they exclude greylock partners sigma partners and sutter hill ventures mr doppstadt said of the some funds that ford has invested in since produced about of its returns "and if you look at the portfolios of those funds theres a small handful of companies that produced the overwhelming majority of our returns " he said "unfortunately that lesson is lost on a lot of investors " unless more of the funds launched in start returning significant amounts of capital overall venture returns at some point will look bad enough to discourage the most clueless investors but until then expect the flow of money to continue "for every limited partner thats wised up there are several more sitting on the sidelines " said david skok a general partner at matrix partners a firm that has been a critic of the oversupply of venture capital battery ventures general partner rick frisbie said it will take another five years for most investors limited partners or lps in industry parlance to get the message "it will only be through the process of actually investing and trying it that lps will cut back " he said some other highlights of the national venture capital association annual meeting venture capitalists are determined to distance themselves from the rest of the private equity world hoping to escape any potential government backlash against the activities of hedge funds and buyout shops ted schlein a partner at kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers and the incoming chairman of the venture association compared the industry to the colonists in williamsburg va and said the private equity industry like england is trying to profit from them "were really not in the financial services industry " he said "venture helpers would be much more applicable " "globalization of innovation" was the theme of the meeting jim swartz founder of accel partners said while accepting a lifetime achievement award from the association that the biggest change in the venture industry in the last decade has been the move from an intensely local business to an international one "we are becoming the pilot light of the global economy " he said investors were unanimous in saying that now is a lousy time to be a first time venture fund explanations varied from the belief that such funds dont generate good returns to the idea that the managers of these funds even if they have investment expertise cant handle the compliance issues involved in handling money
