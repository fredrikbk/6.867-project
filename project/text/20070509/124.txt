the evening wrap ready steady fed online edition the federal reserve appears to be driving the monetary policy bus with two feet one foot is trying to keep the expansion cruising down the highway at a safe and comfortable speed while the other is hovering on the inflation brake the federal open market committee once again left the key federal funds rate unchanged at where it has now been parked for nearly a year the panel also made very few changes to its closely watched post meeting statement in a message to the markets that economic growth and inflation are behaving pretty much as policy makers expected and that the central bank is unlikely to tinker with rates in the near future the changes that were made to the statement were minor policy makers acknowledged that "growth slowed in the first part of this year " where previously they had said that recent indicators had been mixed the fed again tipped its cap in the direction of the still weakening housing sector but also clung to its assessment that core inflation is "somewhat elevated" and that under those economic circumstances the feds "predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected " the fed meeting is always important to wall street but even though almost nobody expected major changes from the central bank this time most commentators felt like they were watching paint dry the meeting "was as close to a monetary non event as the fed is ever likely to provide " said joseph brusuelas the chief u s economist at ideaglobal but theres plenty to parse in the central banks inertia drew matus of lehman brothers wrote in a note that the fed is focusing "on the clouds rather than the silver lining" when it comes to inflation and that by repeating its statement on that issue verbatim from its march statement it appeared to be seeking to avoid any possible confusion the fed kicked up some controversy in march when it made some changes to the bias portion of the statement in an effort to carve out additional flexibility when it comes to the future direction of rates stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital thinks the fed will now only make such changes when they really really have a need to "and clearly they did not have to today " the outcome of the meeting would seem to suggest rates will be left in neutral for some time david greenlaw of morgan stanley wrote that risks of a sharper slowdown are currently balanced off by risks that uncomfortably high core inflation will climb higher "in this sort of environment the best option for the fed seems to be to do nothing until the risks become more clearly tilted in one direction or the other " he wrote for a few minutes after the statement plonked onto the wires financial

recognize its in their interests as well as ours to make progress on the political front " mr cheney said adding that iraqs leaders "believe we are making progress but we have a long way to go " an

singled out for criticism in a draft report that was prepared by a world bank board committee probing whether mr wolfowitz improperly used his influence to secure a generous pay package for his companion shaha riza a bank staffer mr kellems was quoted in a newspaper article as stating that "all arrangements" concerning ms riza "were made at the direction of the banks board of directors " but
