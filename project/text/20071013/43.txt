career that led to years at the companys top posts it was "like somebody died in the boardroom when i finished " he recalled later but phelps dodge chairman george b munroe pronounced mr yearleys report "awfully good " and it became the basis of a radical restructuring the company shed virtually everything not related to copper extraction including its decades old telephone wire and piping
