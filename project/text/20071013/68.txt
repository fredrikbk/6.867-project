weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece masaccios deep drama his trinity fresco unites symbolism and perspective realism anatomy of a classic art can often mark important shifts in the way a society views the world consider literatures sturm und drang "storm and stress" movement whose turbulent emotions signaled a swing away from the sober "age of reason" or the dadaist stance that life and art are nonsense a nihilist impulse triggered by the outbreak of world war i yet its difficult to find a more dramatic case than in th century florence where new ways of seeing radically changed the compass of western culture one of the most profound works of that period masaccios "the trinity" can still be viewed by visitors to the city in the setting for which it was created the interior of an unassuming medieval church named santa maria novella plain even austere despite the treasures it holds and notwithstanding an intricate facade designed by the renaissance architectural master leone battista alberti santa maria novella is perhaps the least dazzling of all the major florentine churches and is often overlooked by passersby eager to visit the majestic duomo but for those who pause incredible rewards lie within as you walk through what remains of a cemetery and enter the doorway along the east wall the magnificent "trinity" is the first thing you see it rests directly across on the west wall a rare jewel among other exquisite creations by such legendary artists of the renaissance as giotto and filippo brunelleschi the artists name is a slightly undignified version of "tommaso " it means "clumsy" or "messy" tom some have speculated that this was the result of a sloppy lifestyle or even of poor personal hygiene giotto whose remarkable lifelike paintings astonished viewers a century earlier was similarly disparaged boccaccio called him the ugliest man in italy nevertheless leonardo da vinci declared of giotto "after him art declined " on that score masaccio seemed to resurrect a lost glory masaccios colleague brunelleschi had been the first to formulate the solution to a problem that had interested artists since ancient times how to represent the depth of a three dimensional world on a flat surface around he produced a small box in which he had painted a portrait of the florence baptistery at one end at the other end he placed a bean sized hole when people held the device up to their eye they saw a three dimensional likeness so real it was easy to believe that the box was a kind of telescope focused on the actual building brunelleschis secret was to skew the pictures proportions in such a way that all the elements corresponded to common visual experience in which far away objects seem smaller than those that are near other artists had tried to accomplish this intuitively but brunelleschi turned the procedure into a mathematical science before long alberti presented brunelleschis technique in a treatise with precise mechanical instructions on how to calculate the "vanishing point" the imaginary spot in a painting where receding parallel lines beginning at the front appear to converge in the distance masaccios "trinity" was the first true masterpiece to harness the new procedure the result was so powerful that contemporaries believed there was an actual hole in the wall extending behind the figure of the crucified jesus it is possible that brunelleschi helped masaccio prepare "the trinity " among the factors in th century florence that made this painting revolution possible was a dramatic philosophical shift throughout the culture an acceptance of the idea that individual experience was just as valid as theoretical doctrine the trick of bringing a two dimensional image to three dimensional life required the legitimization of a mechanism long considered inimical to right knowledge and even to morality human sense perception alberti described the process as similar to viewing an image as if through a particular window that is from a specific subjective point of view yet subjectivity had long been considered dangerous a quality antithetical to eternal truth indeed from the time of the ancient greeks philosophers and theologians had warned against the perils of illusion suddenly renaissance painters were embracing it masaccio walked a fine line between older traditional approaches to religious painting the use of narrative symbols and the new style perspective realism to convey the spiritual message of his work most dramatic of course is the perspective in "the trinity " what strikes ones attention from the start is the barrel vaulted chapel which is divided into squares with rosettes that are diminished and foreshortened along with its triumphal arch the fictive "space" within its boundaries is almost palpable never before in western art had an imaginary structure assumed this powerful a role but the painting contains symbols laden with meaning as well at the bottom of the fresco lies a skeleton with a message "i was what you are and what i am you shall be " above it two donors kneel and above them mary and john standing within the arch are found just below jesus and god the father the centric point of the painting falls between the donors and the sarcophagus at the eye level of what alberti considered the best height of a "well proportioned man" expressing the "perfect beauty distributed by nature" that is at the presumed height of jesus about feet inches the skeleton may represent adam or perhaps everyman god on his throne of mercy rises behind the crucified christ but his location is imprecise suggesting his indescribable nature a dove representing the holy spirit descends and turns its neck toward the crucified son but where earlier religious paintings were content to rest on symbol alone for their meaning masaccio provides much more the depth sensation of the chapel is breathtaking shadows cast by the sacred beings convince us of their actual presence on a visit last fall i walked from one side of the painting to the other and was startled to find that gods haunting gaze is scarily inescapable somehow he seems to be watching you no matter where you stand put all these elements together and the works impact is stunning nearly three centuries of florentines missed out on this visual feast however in giorgio vasari who as a chronicler of the great artists had named one of the three periods of florentine art after masaccio covered up "the trinity" with a panel of his own work the "madonna of the rosary " under orders from the medici family it remained hidden until when it was accidentally rediscovered but in covering the painting vasari actually preserved it an act of generosity toward future generations masaccio never knew of the changing fate of his fresco following the completion of the work he left florence for rome and died there soon after at the age of he had been considered a master artist for a mere six years mr isacoff is editor of "piano today" magazine and author of "temperament how music became a battleground for the great minds of western civilization "
