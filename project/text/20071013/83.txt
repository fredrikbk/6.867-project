word to poachers from deputy ted gather no moss olympic national forest is hotbed of greenery theft leaving no stone unturned mason county wash deputy sheriff ted drogmund was patrolling remote logging roads in the damp foothills of the olympic national forest in june when he came upon two men and a pit bull in a pickup truck the men said they were camping on a timber companys land mr drogmund gave them a trespassing ticket he found out later what they had really been doing stripping the forest floor of moss they left behind dozens of pound bags of wet stringy green moss "it was just regular moss " says mr drogmund who is the law enforcement official charged with nabbing poachers across square miles of mountainous county land "to these guys its just money growing in the woods " moss poachers have been plying the olympic range in recent years combing the soggy ground and trees for the squishy stuff that lines flower baskets provides greenery for nativity scenes at christmas and cushions hollands tulip bulbs for shipping long unpopular with gardeners and careful tenders of grassy lawns moss has new cachet as a trendy ground and outdoor wall cover its also used in small desktop rock gardens and as a base in japanese bonsai tree kits gardening web sites and tv shows advocate its low maintenance growing potential the cushiony feel of walking barefoot on it and even the plants supposedly stress reducing green color last year alone mr drogmund who calls himself "the woods deputy " estimates he arrested more than greenery thieves on private property and national forest land in the pacific northwest dried moss stripped from tree trunks and branches goes for about cents a pound locally wet or dirty moss or moss from the forest floor littered with pine needles and leaves fetches a bit less hiawatha corp in shelton wash touts its moss as "clean light and feathery " moss can be harvested legally with permits on land set aside for the purpose by timber companies and forest officials but even legal gatherers face criticism from conservationists who say that taking moss ruins wildlife habitats mixed emotions about moss harvesting go way back a s poem by theodore roethke who gathered moss for his familys greenhouses likened harvesting to "pulling off flesh from the living planet as if i had committed against the whole scheme of life a desecration " moss is a simple plant that lacks conventional roots stems and leaves the anchor like structures on the underside of moss initially cling to a surface but eventually release their grip and form a mat like structure it can take or years for moss to develop into a thick green blanket that can stay intact when it is pulled in sheets from a tree or rock because it is difficult to grow commercially theres a lot of demand for moss harvested from nature the damp climate of the olympic forest provides soggy conditions perfect for green moss and thus for poachers mr drogmund years old wearing a dark green jumpsuit carefully drives his silver pickup equipped with night vision goggles shovels and axes down gravel covered narrow roads that have dramatic drop offs to the north fork of the skokomish river mr drogmund has wrecked four vehicles in his seven years as the woods deputy once he crashed into a tree that fell in his path another of his vehicles was swallowed by what he thought was a mud puddle "i cant be a fraidy cat " says mr drogmund "sometimes ill drive around the corner and something will be right there and ive got to deal with it " washington law enforcement officials have documented elaborate secretive moss poaching rings in the western part of the state poaching ringleaders often drop off workers in the woods just before dawn and pick them up after sundown the harvesters spend the day in the damp cold using their hands to peel the green and sometimes light brown moss wearing long rubber boots to help stay dry they stuff it into plastic sacks and hide it in the brush until their ride arrives to take them out of the forest the moss is taken to a garage a sort of moss chop shop where it is dried and baled then it is sold to someone who has a legal permit to harvest it on approved land poachers and their days stash crowd into vans that have trouble navigating the bumpy logging roads resulting in several fatal crashes in recent years one van sailed off a cliff after its occupants bailed out with the vehicle in gear when they came upon mr drogmund waiting for them in the middle of the road poachers face &# fines for taking moss and often are cited for trespassing these days many of the harvesters are illegal immigrants and when apprehended they sometimes are deported on a recent woods patrol mr drogmund spotted something amiss "there are tracks ahead of us " he said "somebody is in here " he put on his hat hopped out of his truck stood at the edge of a steep ravine and whistled he chomped on a stick of gum and waited no answer he tore off into the woods searching for the suspects after a few minutes of zigzagging all he found were two grazing deer and a pile of garbage mr drogmund a former logger likes being alone in the rain soaked forest and his only companions on patrol are a silver thermos of coffee and his police radio which crackles every few minutes with emergency calls from around the county he carries a glock mm semiautomatic weapon and pepper spray he says he has drawn the gun but has never had to fire it mr drogmund gets tips from timber company workers or legal harvesters that poachers are at work he follows tracks to what he assumes are drop off points and slowly creeps through the woods in search of his moss thieving targets he tiptoes behind the poachers and grabs them sometimes tackling them to the ground "its like trying to sneak up on a deer " says mr drogmund "youve got to be as quiet as possible " mr drogmund is well known to the poachers in the area some of whom he has arrested more than once he recalls that when he busted one poacher who didnt speak much english the man muttered to him "are you ted "
