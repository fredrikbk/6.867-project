the weekend interview with khaled hosseini an afghan tale washington in khaled hosseinis best selling novel "the kite runner " a hindi kid boasts that in his hometown the popular regional pastime of kite fighting has strict rules and regulations this is not a wise thing to say to two afghan boys in kabul "hassan and i looked at each other cracked up the hindi kid would soon learn what the british learned earlier in the century and what the russians would eventually learn by the late s that afghans are an independent people afghans cherish customs but abhor rules and so it was with kite fighting the rules were simple no rules fly your kite cut the opponents good luck " i read these words aloud to mr hosseini "this is what the afghans are known for their very independent spirit they are known for embracing custom but not necessarily laws " he says this may shed some light on some of the current challenges of rebuilding the country "part of whats going on in afghanistan is that " he says "we are trying to build a country in afghanistan with a central government with a constitution with a at least on paper a well defined set of laws and were taking that and were trying to implement that in a country that lives largely by custom and i think its a challenge to modernize a country that in many ways lives in a very very traditional way " mr hosseini who recently returned from a trip to afghanistan is quick to add that this challenge is not foolhardy or misguided since the december bonn agreement which led to an interim power sharing arrangement mr hosseini says that there have been "limited but tangible improvements " "its not insignificant that we have held elections " he says "its not insignificant that we have a constitution whether its implemented correctly or not but the mere presence of it and the things that it says is not insignificant there have been some improvements in the areas of health and education just going back to kabul its a dramatically different city neighborhoods that were destroyed during the civil war are back roads have been paved there should be electricity uninterrupted in kabul by next year " still theres a long way to go "i think we can and should build on positive developments in afghanistan " mr hosseini says "but you have to be realistic you have to realize that this is a country that is essentially recovering from years of disaster and you have to be patient you have to make a long term commitment a genuine true and long term commitment " i meet mr hosseini in an office building in washington d c he is dressed elegantly in a dark pinstriped suit and seems almost apologetic about his attire mr hosseini is likely aware that he does not look the part of your typical novelist but then again that is not his only role mr hosseini also serves as an envoy for the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr and last month he took a day trip to afghanistan to assess the situation of the millions of refugees who have returned from iran and pakistan he then came to washington with an urgent message we must not give up on afghanistan mr hosseini was born in kabul in at the age of shortly after the communist seizure of power and soviet invasion he and his family sought political asylum in the u s he now lives in california and was practicing medicine until a few years ago he published his first novel "the kite runner " in the book has been a stunning success to put it mildly it spent over weeks on the new york times best seller list and publisher riverhead books has shipped million paperback copies today still you might easily spot "the kite runner" in a high school classroom on the subway or at the beach you can even buy a copy at starbucks "i feel like i no longer have ownership of that book " mr hosseini says laughing "its like the kid that goes to college and you hear from them once in a while and you wish them well and other people give you news about how theyre doing its got its own legs " after the "the kite runner" juggernaut mr hosseini did not rest on his laurels his much anticipated second novel "a thousand splendid suns " was published in may of this year and has since spent weeks on the times best seller list the book tells the story of a friendship between two women married to the same violent man but more broadly paints a devastating picture of the mistreatment of women in afghanistan in the novel mr hosseini describes the older of the two wives "but after four years of marriage mariam saw how much a woman could tolerate when she was afraid " four years after its publication "the kite runner" is making a splash again this time because of the film version that was supposed to hit theaters next month the film showcases the ethnic tensions between afghanistans pashtun and hazara peoples and features the rape of a young hazara boy this is so inflammatory that the families of the young afghan actors feared that the boys might be in danger and paramount has delayed the release of the film so that they can get out of the country when i spoke to mr hosseini by phone this week he seemed understandably upset by all this "if i or anybody in this production thought that there would ever be a risk of threat to these children i dont think anybody in their right mind would have gone forward " he told me he stressed the importance of taking the families concerns seriously and putting safety first "to me the movie the production the book everything is really secondary if the children and their families feel there is a reasonable risk of physical harm to them " he said but he also explained why the film which features afghan actors and dialogue in the dari language is so important "afghanistan has been in the news for a long time but there has been so little said about the afghan people themselves and this movie its a significant moment this film is going to bring in a way afghanistan into the living rooms of people around the world in a positive light in a human light this is a story about these afghan muslim characters that does not begin with terrorism does not begin with fanaticism its a story about ordinary human beings " when i saw a screening in new york i understood why mr hosseini is so happy with the adaptation the film tells a moving story with quiet dignity in his role as unhcr envoy mr hosseini is working toward a brighter future for his native country but to some extent his novels serve a similar function this is more obviously true for his second book "a thousand splendid suns " which zooms in on the oppression of afghan women "i have to admit that there was a bit more of a sense of mission " he says of that novel "in that look this is an important story it really hasnt been told in mainstream fiction form " why fiction "i just felt there were a lot of people speaking about afghan women and they were doing it in eloquent ways and they were raising awareness about afghan women but in my mind fiction always has a very unique ability to do that " he says mr hosseini describes the power of the novel "i think people connect a lot with things that are radically different from their own lives through fiction you can read a lot about a certain country a certain culture but fiction lifts you out of your chair and gives you an immediate access immediate pass into that world " he adds "i learned more about the great depression by reading steinbeck than i ever did reading all my social studies and history books in high school frankly " if you look hard enough you can often find similar themes running through an authors works and mr hosseinis novels are no exception amir in "the kite runner" and jalil in "a thousand splendid suns" both struggle with feelings of deep regret for standing idly by while someone less fortunate was in need when i ask mr hosseini about this common theme he seems momentarily reluctant to put himself on the psychoanalysts couch but then he says "this is something that i do remember from growing up i always felt privileged growing up because of my background " he corrects himself "privileged is the wrong word certainly comfortable and i guess at some level i always questioned whether i was deserving of it you always feel like whether this is something you earned " he continues "my life has been a series of truly fortunate events i got out of afghanistan in the nick of time my family left i had my whole family at least immediate family with me " mr hosseini made it to america got a good education had a successful livelihood and then of course came "the kite runner " now he tells me he feels a sense of duty to "pay back " is he doing that with his novels "i am but i would be doing them regardless id be writing regardless because its what i love doing theres got to be a little effort its got to put you out a little bit " this brings our conversation back to mr hosseinis work with unhcr and afghanistans current predicament mr hosseini lists some of the countrys woes the insurgency in the south the plight of the refugees opium production abject poverty and suicide bombing to name just a few there is also a less obvious but still potent danger that the west will lose interest in afghanistan mr hosseini would argue that this is already happening "essentially afghanistan has become a very unsexy country " he says "yes what is going on in iraq is enormous but the global focus seems to have shifted quite a bit from afghanistan and i think thats dangerous i really think thats dangerous the most important countries in the world if you put it that simply afghanistan is one of them and we cant we meaning the international community i think we cant afford to let this country slide back and lose what weve achieved there " for one thing letting afghanistan descend into chaos could make it vulnerable to extremism "the only thing the taliban brought was stability they brought security " mr hosseini says "thats not a small thing " in "a thousand splendid suns " laila the younger of an abusive husbands two wives listens to a taxi driver describe how his two sisters were killed in a soviet attack "im sorry laila says marveling at how every afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief laila thinks of her own life and all that has happened to her and she is astonished that she too has survived that she is alive and sitting in this taxi listening to this mans story " every afghan has a story even if many dont have the opportunity or resources to share it with the world this is where mr hosseini comes in in his work some afghans may see slices of their own lives other readers just lose themselves in the tale "i am convinced that people love to be told stories " mr hosseini says "and i have not been blessed with the linguistic gifts of other writers i acknowledge that but theres something to be said for you know a good story " he laughs "as old fashioned as that may sound " ms
