new way to get their fix it is scrabulous an online game that uses rules nearly identical to traditional scrabble in fact there are enough similarities that some lawyers say that the creators of scrabulous a programming team of two brothers in kolkata india may face possible copyright issues scrabulous is spreading through an unusual route for a board game facebook the social networking site that started off connecting college kids and now has more than million members of all ages since its facebook debut in july scrabulous has grown to about players according to facebooks data of those players about people are "daily active users " or people who have logged in every day over the last days thats compared with an average of for the sites top tools and games according to socialmedia a social advertising company that tracks facebook activity those numbers reflect a critical decision by jayant and rajat agarwalla the brothers behind the game having drawn only a few thousand users to a web site devoted to scrabulous they converted it to a facebook "application" in june an application is a module facebooks users can add to their pages and then invite their facebook friends to join scrabulous is not the first web based way for scrabble fanatics to play online but its popularity underscores the growing power of social networking sites to offer businesses new sources of revenue and customers facebook says some applications have been launched since may some developers are selling ads directly on their applications while other are using the tools to promote their products and services other applications let members rate favorite beers leave hand drawn messages for friends and donate to charitable causes the approach has drawn interest from big companies including microsoft and amazon com which have already developed their own facebook applications meanwhile venture capitalists are pouring in bay partners based in menlo park calif plans to make investments of &# to &# in about different facebook applications over the next three years scrabulous works very much like scrabble with users getting seven tiles at random and dragging letters onto a board to form words once a word is played new tiles are automatically generated and opponents are notified that its their turn players can challenge opponents words there are crucial differences though for example players can get away with looking up words before putting them down a definite no no in real scrabble and send trash talking messages to opponents the fact that a player can be engaged in a limitless number of games at once means scrabulous can become a distraction at the office players say these features are part of what makes the game so addictive its much easier to wow an opponent and score a lot of points by looking up a fancy word like "azoth " for example than simply putting down "zoo " competition is further fueled by a page of "global stats " where top scorers and busy players are ranked click on the link and youll see for example that user "lissa sue" holds the record for the most games played more than jey cho wasnt a big scrabble player but scrabulous has become a favorite pastime for the los angeles investment manager he plays about four games simultaneously and checks his progress every few hours while at work when hes at meetings he often writes down random sets of letters to practice creating words and he often disputes two letter words over the phone with his favorite competitor his girlfriend in boston jayant agarwalla says the idea for scrabulous started out of desperation for years he played a free version of scrabble with his father but when the site began charging his obsession became too expensive so he did what any tech savvy scrabble addict would do he built his own site the agarwalla brothers already had a software company to develop web sites for clients in britain and the u s in august they launched bingobinge com which they say attracted about members acting on a users suggestion they changed the name to scrabulous after facebook announced a call for applications the agarwallas moved the game there within a month its user base swelled to more than a surge that shut down scrabulous for two days rajat says that as of mid september the sites revenue from advertisements displayed near the game board was sufficient to cover operating expenses now the game brings in around &# a month from selling advertising says jayant legal experts say there are risks to scrabulous however copyright laws allow someone to freely use an idea "but not copy the expression of the idea " says anthony falzone head of the fair use project at stanford university he says the scrabulous board looks strikingly similar to the scrabble board with light blue and pink squares in the same spots denoting double and triple word scores the names might also be too much alike says john palfrey a harvard law professor hasbro inc which owns the u s rights for scrabble says it doesnt comment on legal matters rajat agarwalla says he emailed hasbro several weeks ago to notify the company about scrabulous hasbro has not responded he says the brothers say they consider scrabulous to be essentially an online version of scrabble "its not really different " jayant says for nick george the bigger issue is players getting outside help the year old tokyo based multimedia producer is one of the games top players with more than wins and fewer than losses he says he plays better online than off because there are no personalities involved "its not like playing a bad tempered girlfriend " recently mr george says hes noticed a lot of the telltale signs of what by scrabble standards would be considered cheating among them long obscure words that few people know currently the highest scoring word listed in the global statistics page on scrabulous is worth points the word "oxyphenbutazone " well known among scrabble aficonados as the ultimate point getter was played by sam chenoweth but the year old physics grad student in melbourne australia says he didnt do it while competing in a real game instead he collaborated in a series of moves with a fellow masters student who was technically his opponent ben charlton runs an online feature where people can input a list of letters and find out possible word combinations he says page views have increased
