beauty lures new beholders after success of botox venture firms invest in cosmetic medicine consider it another beauty myth shattered venture capitalists have tended to shy away from investing in the vanity niche wrinkle erasing or flab zapping concoctions and devices a field better known for hype than scientific innovation but with people spending more of their disposable income on beautifying themselves investors are starting to express more interest in products like these the success of the antiwrinkle drug botox which hit &# billion in sales last year has fueled much of this interest at the same time cosmetic lasers and other skin treatment devices are gaining popularity in doctors offices shopping malls and holiday resorts as a result the so called cosmetic medicine market though still small is starting to attract traditional technology and life sciences investors an array of venture capital firms ranging from giant kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers to influential firms such as polaris venture partners poured a total of about &# million into cosmetic medicine last year up from about &# million in according to the national venture capital association though that figure is rough because the business is relatively new and still fragmented body contouring skin tightening and facial rejuvenation are among the most promising fields other ideas include laser hair removal devices for home use and tattoo inks that can be removed with a single treatment wrinkle erasing facial fillers such as medicis pharmaceutical corp s restylane and allergan inc s juvederm are already a hot market but one that is crowded with many new competitors one reason that investors are intrigued by cosmetic medicine is that products and devices must pass a regulatory process at the food and drug administration this hurdle makes it tougher for rivals to sell knockoffs its also costly one reason companies need venture capital funding the fda process for products like these is typically more rigorous and time consuming than for skin creams makeup and other cosmetics sold by retailers in drug and department stores another lure for investors consumers are willing to shell out big bucks for treatments wrinkle erasing shots and skin regimens must be regularly repeated to maintain the effect generating recurring payments for doctors and product sellers the aesthetics business is at the forefront of a sweeping health care trend that investors are striving to figure out "we fundamentally believe that health care is going to be increasingly shaped by the consumer patient and theres no better way to learn about that than in the aesthetics industry " says jim glasheen of technology partners a venture capital firm in palo alto calif that was one of the early players in the field trolling for investment ideas he schmoozes with skin doctors and plastic surgeons at meetings such as the cosmetic bootcamp a gathering of about doctors and manufacturers of everything from laser skin treatment devices to basic doctor office furniture that was held in june in aspen colo one of the biggest events this year a brainstorming session between doctors and venture capital investors one of the risks in this business mr glasheen says is "pop and flop " thats when a product creates a buzz that quickly passes when it doesnt live up to its billing a couple of years ago contour threads a type of surgical thread generally used to sew up wounds was touted on "oprah" and other television shows as a "lunchtime face lift " the threads had minuscule hooks on them that when placed beneath the skin could be used to tug at sagging areas of the face but patients complained that the facelift effect didnt last or that the threads were embarrassingly visible under the skin the product is no longer used for purely cosmetic purposes like these "the decision wasnt based on efficacy we felt the real opportunity is in the wound closure market " said an official at angiotech pharmaceuticals inc of vancouver british columbia which acquired the company that made the threads last year nevertheless the search for quick and painless beautification procedures marches on many people who would never have plastic surgery will spend thousands of dollars for cellulite treatments or fat busting shots thats whats driving interest in companies like liposonix inc in seattle and ultrashape ltd of yokneam israel both of which are developing a kind of ultrasound technology for smoothing buttocks and other bulges polaris based in waltham mass invested about &# million in ultrashape in march after one of its partners spotted the technology in israel the ultrashape instrument uses "focused" ultrasound energy to destroy fat below the skin "what intrigued us is that the procedure unlike traditional liposuction doesnt require anesthesia " says brian chee a polaris partner and ultrashape director the company is selling machines in europe and is talking to the fda about u s marketing approval he says kythera biopharmaceuticals inc is testing a compound that is injected under the skin to dissolve fatty deposits particularly under the chin a few years ago the four founders pooled about &# of their own money and obtained funds from versant ventures to acquire rights to the compound from the university of california at los angeles patients are enrolling now for human tests in australia and the united kingdom "weve had no trouble raising money " says keith leonard a former amgen inc executive and now chief executive of kythera based in woodland hills calif the kleiner perkins firm an early venture capital backer of genentech inc and amazon com inc jumped into the business about months ago with an investment in aesthera corp a pleasanton calif seller of a light based treatment for acne and other skin conditions the companys device uses a vacuum suctioning technology to bring a patients oil glands closer to the skins surface for exposure to light therapy
