weekend journal sports golf journal tearing up the green why a longtime golf accessory and collectible is coming under siege about a decade ago a small company called softspikes launched a campaign to ban metal spiked shoes on u s golf courses initially ignored by elite golfers and sneered at by anyone who did notice softspikes have since become the norm now a new revolution is brewing around another staple of golf the tool players use to repair dents and skids made when a ball lands hard on the green in the past couple of years more than courses including prestigious places like bulle rock medinah country club and southern hills have outlawed the tools they say the small fork shaped contraptions may be wreaking havoc with their greens the ball mark repair tool often incorrectly called a divot repair tool has been around for decades and is iconic for many golfers almost all players have at least a few in their bags and some like me collect them as keepsakes whenever they tee off somewhere memorable i still have one from the royal hong kong golf club before the territorys handover to china that comes with two clear plastic reusable tees attached to it in all millions of these tools are sold or given away in the u s each year if the ban spreads dozens of manufacturers of ball mark repair tools could be affected the man behind the shake up is danny edwards who has single handedly persuaded almost all of those courses to get rid of the standard ball mark repair tool mr edwards a five time pga tour winner is the founder of greenfix a company that makes a competing product he travels the country meeting with everyone from golf pros to state golf association executive directors and handing out free samples of his invention also called greenfix at each stop he preaches that traditional repair tools not only often fail to fix ball marks but that they ravage the underlying root systems of greens that can leave putting surfaces full of brown spots and bumps that are tough to putt on he says "greens full of ball marks always puzzled me especially when so many players told me they fixed three or four marks per green " says mr edwards who now plays on the champions tour "hours of observation and discussion with superintendents and golf professionals pointed the finger at the difficulty players were having fixing ball marks " while the standard ball mark tool has tines that are a couple of inches long those on greenfix are less than half an inch long enough mr edwards says to push the "wounded" turf back together without tearing the root structure he says greenfix which also has a thumb rest encourages "a simple push method" that is gentler on the turf while the longer tool invites "lifting twisting and jabbing " but for all his success convincing golf courses of this mr edwards has yet to win over the usga golfs governing body in the u s doesnt set policy on the usage of ball mark tools thats up to each course but it is highly influential with course superintendents through its green section the usga agrees with mr edwards that ball marks are a problem but says there is no such thing as a one size fits all tool to fix them ball marks come in all shapes and sizes from those where the ball skids off hard greens leaving a slight dent to those where there is more of a "splash" and the balls force goes deeper into the ground deeper marks require a tool that can go farther into the ground says jim snow director of the usgas green section complicating matters there are at least three different common types of grass on greens bent bermuda and poa annua and each reacts differently to the insult of a ball falling from the sky "you can take anything out there a screwdriver or an ice pick" if you use it correctly says mr snow another tip from the usga if a piece of the green becomes detached roots and all dont replace it it wont reattach and grow but only slow down the healing golfers though should still replace fairway divots that fit that description it isnt clear exactly when the ball mark tool came into being patents on some variations were granted early last century but the usga pga and golf retailers agree that the problem of ball marks on greens grew more acute in the s when augusta national became the envy of the world and country club members began demanding faster greens of their own cutting greens shorter meant that the grass put down shallower roots making it more likely that a landing ball would tear the grass interlachen country club in edina minn host of next years u s womens open recently banned traditional repair tools and requires members to use greenfix george carroll the general manager says the new tool works well for golfers who are well intentioned but dont have a surgeons touch on fixing a ball mark it is less effective on wet greens he adds but is the design of the tool really the only reason so many greens are full of ball marks lets talk about the laziness of the "toolee " etiquette calls for golfers to fix their ball marks but every time i play its obvious that people fail to do so mr carroll says hes noticed that some people at high end clubs believe that for their six figure initiation fees someone else should repair the marks for them ball marks one of the few things that golfers are allowed to fix on the green can be controversial for other reasons too a senior usga rules official recently told me a story from the masters a few years ago during one day of play every player fixed at least one ball mark within feet of the fourth hole but only three players actually struck the green within feet of the hole were they all fixing old ball marks or were they trying to correct other blemishes that theyre not supposed to be messing with like scuff marks from a shoe or indentations left by a player leaning on his putter "who knows " he says john paul newport will return next week email golfjournal wsj com
