is a &# billion star a good thing growth fund of america grapples with success why its staying open welcome to the era of the &# billion mutual fund in the past few days american funds growth fund of america or gfa became the first mutual fund to pass that milestone its rapid growth just three years ago the fund was less than half the size raises a host of questions for investors the funds managers are feeling pressure to close it to new money at the same time performance has recently been average after years of outperformance this month morningstar downgraded the fund to four stars from five a quantitative ranking based on risk adjusted returns passing the &# billion mark is a big deal in the fund industry which obsessively watches asset size big mutual funds are often cash cows for investment firms because the costs to run them tend not to increase so significantly after they reach a certain size this isnt the first time a goliath fund wrestled with growing pains in fidelity investments magellan fund hit a peak of &# billion only to stumble after its star stock picking manager made some bad choices and is now around &# billion american funds executives say gfa will avoid the kinds of problems that magellan had because the fund is structured differently basically its broken up among analysts and portfolio "counselors" that can make investment decisions independently of one another still complaints about size have ramped up recently jim rothenberg president of capital research &amp management co which runs american funds addressed the funds ballooning size and complexity in a rare speech this summer "size for us is an issue" and "we have spent a lot of energy focused on the challenges" it entails he said at the time in recent years the firm significantly restructured itself to deal with its fat funds four of the firms mutual funds have more than &# billion in assets according to some estimates the firms staff has been divided into two groups dubbed capital research global investors and capital world investors the goal cut down on big group meetings and continue to foster creative thinking at first the changes "gave us pause" because of concern the musical chairs would distract from investment performance says katherine gallagher a portfolio officer at standard &amp poors corp which reviews funds for clients like retirement plans but the firm "took a lot of time planning" the reorganization she says the funds next annual report is due out in a few weeks which could offer new clues about the success of the reorganization last years annual report was subtitled "a look at how gfa handles its own growth " capital research says its fund hasnt become too unwieldy it has resisted closing gfa for a variety of reasons for one thing much of the funds growth has come from stock price appreciation amid the booming market of the past few years rather than from investor inflows according to the company in addition research suggests some funds tend to underperform after closing which gives fund managers a disincentive to close to new money shutting the fund and starting a clone also isnt an option since the fund could then "lose economies of scale" that keep its expense ratio low says american funds spokesman chuck freadhoff the fund charges a net expense ratio for its biggest share class and has reduced it in recent years the average expense ratio for u s diversified stock funds is american funds executives have said they would consider closing gfa if performance became an issue and they dont think theyre at that point still the fund has lagged some others more recently its "looking merely average for once " according to a recent morningstar report the fund returned last year which was behind the standard &amp poors stock index so far this year its up which is well ahead of the s&amp p but in the th percentile compared with other funds that focus on large fast growing companies american funds executives say they arent concerned with such comparisons to other funds since they seek to stick to their objective of finding stocks that offer the best growth of capital the fund has also posted strong long term results returning over the past year average period or more than five percentage points over the s&amp p in that time gfa might not always "lead the pack " but its investing approach "reduces volatility and helps produce good returns over the long term" says mr freadhoff some observers have said gfas focus in recent years on cheaper "value" areas like energy and industrial stocks could be holding it back slightly but the funds breadth makes it tough to generalize such trends earlier this year american funds became the first fund firm to cross &# trillion in stock and bond mutual fund assets and according to financial research corp which means it is now bigger than vanguard group and fidelity by that measure
