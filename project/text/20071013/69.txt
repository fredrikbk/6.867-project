weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings the jets just keep on coming west side story at you cant write a rave review without a good opening line and one of the best ones in the history of dramatic criticism was penned by walter kerr of the new york herald tribune years ago "the radioactive fallout from west side story must still be descending on broadway this morning " as it happens kerr had mixed feelings about the show he found it "almost never emotionally affecting " an opinion that borders on the perverse but even so he knew hed just seen something important though "west side story" wasnt the first "serious" musical it was the first one to speak the edgy electric language of modernism and no sooner did it open than a generation of composers choreographers lyricists and authors knew that their world had changed forever a half century later "west side story" continues to sell tickets though not on broadway where it hasnt been seen since arthur laurents who wrote the book recently told the new york post that he plans to direct an anniversary revival but so far no specifics have been forthcoming still you rarely have to go very far or wait very long to see a production ive reviewed two in the past year alone one in new hampshire the other in oregon both of which were absolutely worth the price of admission should you need an instant "west side story" fix you can always rent the larger than life film version or listen to one of the half dozen recordings of the complete score including the original cast album of and the all star remake conducted by leonard bernstein in you can even own a brand new version for tweens in which hayley westenra sings maria though id steer clear of that one if i were you so many golden anniversary tributes to "west side story" have appeared in recent weeks that i feel obliged to even the score by throwing a little acid if only a spoonful i too love the timeless tale of the jets and the sharks but i dont think its perfect not by a long shot neither does stephen sondheim who once remarked that the show "trembles on the brink of self conscious pretentiousness " seeing as how he wrote the lyrics id say he has a right to his opinion and im inclined to agree mr sondheim himself admits that some of his lyrics "i feel pretty" in particular are a bit on the precious side just as bernsteins score contains its fair share of deep purple patches a more significant flaw in "west side story" is the cant we all just get along romanticism that led its starry eyed makers to idealize the street gangs they were portraying not always for mr sondheims brilliant lyric for "gee officer krupke" is a cruelly exact spoof of the very affliction from which his collaborators suffered bernstein in particular "officer krupke youve done it again this boy dont need a job he needs a year in the pen it aint just a question of misunderstood deep down inside him hes no good " elsewhere though "west side story" crosses the line into arrant sentimentality when it suggests that the only thing separating the jets from the sharks is their unfortunate inability to love one another and be loved in return "well find a new way of living well find a way of forgiving " we are not so very far here from the squashy foolishness that tom wolfe brutally satirized years later in "these radical chic evenings " his essay about bernsteins famous flirtation with the black panthers yes "somewhere" is a lovely song bernstein never wrote a shapelier more cunningly balanced melody but it lacks shall we say a certain specificity when considered as a solution to the problem of inner city violence none of this however stops me from whipping out the kleenex whenever i hear a well sung performance of "somethings coming" or "one hand one heart " despite their occasional errors of taste and sensibility the creators of "west side story" never made the mistake of failing to feel and jerome robbinss vaultingly vital street kid choreography is to my mind without flaws of any kind it is as much an integral part of "west side story" as the bernstein sondheim songs and my guess is that it was the main reason for the shows initial success quality tells and so does ambition "the aim in the mid s " robbins said "was to see if all of us lenny who wrote long hair music arthur who wrote serious plays myself who did serious ballets oliver smith who was a serious painter could bring our acts together and do a work on the popular stage the idea was to make the poetry of the piece come out of our best attempts as serious artists " it is just that fusion of popular means with serious ends that makes "west side story" so quintessentially american a work of theatrical art the goal of its makers was to write a musical that was fully worthy of comparison on its own expressive terms with the best modern operas and did they succeed i think so but even if posterity should ultimately rule that "west side story" fell short of the mark they will always be remembered for having aimed so high robert browning said it "ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for " mr teachout the journals drama
