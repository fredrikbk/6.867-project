weekend journal music life of danja when britney madonna or mariah need help they turn to producer nate danja hills how a year old pastors son is helping reshape the music industrys hit making machine in the digital age burbank calif at a recording studio here britney spears puts some last minute polish on a song for her next album as she sings a line about handling her "business " im in the next room minding mine with so much focus on the singers recent travails her representative says shes not giving interviews that doesnt mean shes not talking my interaction with perhaps the most closely watched woman in america comes during a break when she steps out of the vocal booth and politely asks me to pass her a drink from the fridge i do red bull no matter the real draw at this session is the man in the control booth he is producer nate hills aka danja pronounced "dane ja" at age mr hills is emerging as one of musics elite behind the scenes hit makers with industry sales in a slump demand for his services and those of other top producers is surging the burbank session is a case in point less than hours earlier mr hills had been working in his studio in miami an urgent call from ms spearss camp summoned him across the country with me in tow to assist her in the coming months the fruits of this session and others like it will make or break tens of millions of dollars in music sales it will also mark the biggest test yet for mr hills as a solo producer in the past year mr hills has had a direct hand in crafting albums that yielded seven no songs for singers such as justin timberlake and nelly furtado "gimme more " one of his songs with ms spears and the first single released in her comeback attempt has been no on the itunes chart for more than a week also bearing mr hillss mark this fall an album from s stars duran duran although mr hills is virtually unknown to music fans he has joined the handful of producers who are behind the bulk of todays top selling pop records grounded mostly in hip hop this elite group includes will i am pronounced as three words leader of the black eyed peas who has recently been in the studio with michael jackson another key producer is swizz beatz who has branched out from hard core rap to work with beyonce and alicia keys then theres timothy mosley aka timbaland arguably the most prominent producer in recent years mr mosley has been mr hillss mentor and collaborator for the past four years what makes these producers so influential and bankable is that they typically craft songs from scratch creating everything from the beats to the all important melodic hook if beethovens fifth were a st century pop production the hook would be "da da da dum " the music industry has become especially dependent on such hit makers as it struggles to reverse an ongoing slide from through annual overall album sales dropped by this year album sales are down compared with the same period last year according to nielsen soundscan as he navigates this landscape mr hills offers an example of how radically the role of producer has shifted and the extent to which a hit hinges on the most basic ingredients especially the beat for many rock and country tunes the song still takes shape when a songwriter picks up a guitar or sits down at a piano but for the hip hop and r&amp b songs that dominate todays pop charts the moment of creation is more likely to be when a producer fires up a drum machine mr hillss rise has been propelled by his apprenticeship with timbaland mr mosley is a production veteran who has also achieved success as a performer although the two still collaborate occasionally on high profile projects such as songs for madonnas next album mr hills is carving out his own territory demand for his aggressive sculpted beats offset by spacey melodies has packed his calendar with clients ranging from mariah carey to rapper missy elliott now his challenge is to expand his brand beyond that of a beatmaker to do that mr hills and his small team of advisers are seeking out diverse projects he is looking into scoring movies developing his own artists and working with latin and rock groups such as the pop punk band simple plan at the burbank recording studio ms spears has departed an outdoor fireplace flickers on a pathway hemmed by ferns ivy and boxwoods flat screen tvs glow in lounges outside smoked glass studios its at night and mr hills gets to work on ideas for projects in the dim glow of the control room with headphones clamped over his crisp black baseball cap and wearing a charcoal t shirt and gray nike air jordan sneakers that match his shorts he crouches over his most essential tools an electronic keyboard and a machine the size of a school desk that programs drum beats he takes sharp stabs at the drum machine punching square buttons to mimic licks on an actual drum kit kick snare high hat mr hills is quiet clients and friends call him shy with an air that matches the mood of the cocoon like recording studio a sly sense of humor surfaces when he teases his engineer and he has the confidence of someone who knows he has arrived as an industry player but he is still a young man who carries a stick of cherry chapstick and plays videogames on his xbox when he needs to unwind in the studio at the drum machine he builds a forceful but slippery beat that the machine repeats through his headphones his right hand floats over to the keyboard and he folds a riff into the loop after a few cycles he weaves in a high octave flutter bends a note using a small wheel on the keyboard then he pivots his body back to the drum machine and raps a machine gun burst with his fingertips that shudders under a larger rhythm "just doodling for the sketch book " he says pulling off his headphones the improvisation gets saved on a portable hard drive slightly larger than a credit card which holds more than a years worth of raw tracks this is how most of mr hillss songs emerge often on the spot during a recording session typically once the skeleton of the tune is intact a songwriter shapes the vocal melody and composes lyrics some artists such as mr timberlake write their own lyrics as the song develops mr hills continues to refine his parts adding percussive flairs and sparse melodies using a sound library of virtual instruments that he brings to life on his synthesizer he almost never uses samples snippets of other artists songs compared with the popular image of a band recording live with instruments this process of building a song from the beat up can seem alien "we have deconstructed music all the way down from the complexity of mozart to something thats completely primal " says prince charles alexander a hip hop studio veteran and professor of music production at berklee college of music the resulting sound might be elemental he says but that doesnt mean its easy to perfect producers like mr hills are "not only dealing with the rhythms but the sound of the rhythms how does a group of instruments come across on the radio to create a different palette " he says critics say the "superproducer" system has minimized the role of the individual artist and contributed to the sound alike quality of many of todays hits some say record labels have become overly dependent on these hired guns ability to make virtually anyone sound good in the studio the result talent often ranks second to celebrity but from a business perspective labels say music producers are more critical than ever in the downloads era the potency of an individual hit has grown in importance because online music buyers often purchase single songs rather than the complete albums todays pop producers are likely to be drafted for just one or two songs on an album this can result in albums that are a melange of different producers styles making it more difficult for the artist to establish a signature sound its a cycle that frustrates mr hills even as he benefits from it "an album should be like a book it should have one story " he says mr hills is trying to use his new leverage in the industry to lock onto more album projects for instance he helped craft all but one of the songs on the november release from duran duran "red carpet massacre " mr hills typically charges &# to &# per track up from &# to &# last year according to his lawyer david m ehrlich mr hills receives half this sum up front from the record label and the other half after the song is completed and approved that money comes as an advance after the label recoups his production fee mr hills receives production royalties that typically amount to about to of the musics retail cost prorated based on how many tracks he produced mr hills says he will vary his fees if it will broaden his impact on a project "instead of a label paying &# or &# for a track ill do multiple tracks for &# each lets just make a sound an album and we can all make money " unlike traditional producers mr hills also composes the music so he collects additional royalties from record sales and when the music is used on tv or played on the radio throughout pop musics formative years producers were typically anonymous figures with some legendary exceptions in the s sam phillips first captured elvis presleys raw energy and refined the trademark "slapback" echo of rockabilly at his sun studio in memphis tenn phil spector was celebrated for his "wall of sound" technique in the s at the same time george martin was guiding the beatles experiments with orchestral complexity for mr hills who was born around the same time as hip hop programming beats came as naturally as playing music in church he grew up in virginia beach va an area that has spawned a crop of high profile musicians including timbaland missy elliott and the hip hop production duo known as the neptunes mr hills says he started teaching himself to play the keyboard at age then picked up drums a few years later at the nondenominational advocate gift of life church where his father is a pastor mr hills led the choir on a keyboard with his brother accompanying him on drums he stretched the hymns limits "i might take a hip hop song and sneak it in there before anyone really noticed " he recalls "but the young people would catch it " in high school when he wasnt playing basketball mr hills learned how to loop beats and record layered tracks using rudimentary equipment including a casio console he bought for &# which he earned working at burger king in a community teeming with aspiring rappers mr hills had found a more subtle way to stand out "everybody was trying to rap but everybody couldnt make beats " he says he found his way into a professional studio at age after leaving one of his beats on the answering machine of a local dj two years later he says he linked up with a local impresario teddy riley a producer and singer in an r&amp b band called blackstreet on the groups final album mr hills landed his first production credit meanwhile his parents were unsuccessfully pushing him to go to college "or at least take some business classes " says his father floyd hills the biggest turning point in mr hillss short career came when he started working with mr mosley whose skittering beats and exotic samples had helped turn ms elliott into an unlikely superstar the two men met through a mutual friend at a music conference in but a partnership didnt take shape until two years later when mr hills played a cd of his work on mr mosleys tour bus six months later he says he moved into a spare room in mr mosleys miami home producer and protege worked together for the next two years looking back mr hills says it was surreal to be called up by an industry leader he had hoped to supplant "all my guns were aimed toward him so the shock of all shocks was when he said i want you on my team " mr hills says in they helped create of the songs on the album "loose" by ms furtado a canadian singer it has sold million copies in the u s according to soundscan this year they each won a grammy for their role in "sexyback " one of the songs they produced with mr timberlake on his album "futuresex lovesounds " which has sold million copies mr mosley says the collaboration has helped him too "what i got out of it is me staying competitive its me staying on my toes " he says now he says mr hills is on equal footing in the studio "its even even the stuff that we do its a great match and thats not easy to find " producers to watch in the music industrys search for hits labels rely on a relatively small group of elite producers with a track record of creating bankable songs below some of the most sought after producer timbaland real name timothy mosley artists missy elliott justin timberlake nelly furtado signature sound critical to mr hillss rise mr mosley is known for intricately layered beats exotic sound samples and with the recent success of his own album his rapping notable tracks "give it to me" by timbaland "sexyback" by justin timberlake "promiscuous" by nelly furtado producers the neptunes chad hugo and pharrell williams artists jay z gwen stefani

falsetto singing notable tracks "blue magic" by jay z "wind it up" by gwen stefani "drop it like its hot" by snoop dogg producer max martin artists kelly clarkson pink britney spears signature sound based in sweden mr martin built his reputation with bubblegum hits for ms spears and boy band n sync but he has lately developed a more rock influenced sound notable tracks "who knew" by pink "since u been gone" by kelly clarkson "baby one more time" by britney spears producer stargate tor hermansen and mikkel eriksen artists beyonce rihanna elliott yamin signature sound also from scandinavia but headquartered in new york this duo turns out sugary r&amp b melodies laced with piano and acoustic guitar notable tracks "irreplaceable" by beyonce "wait for you" by elliott yamin "hate that i love
