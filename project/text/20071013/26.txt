hot topic childrens health coverage showdown democrats ratchetted up the pressure against republicans this past week in a bid to override president bushs veto of a &# billion increase in government subsidized childrens health coverage conservatives oppose the broad expansion of a program that subsidizes health insurance for millions of people because they claim it could lead to government run health care but many republicans are worried about the political fallout from voting against a popular health insurance program that covers mostly low income children some house republicans who have opposed the expansion now face a &# million advertising blitz from liberal activists and labor unions in their home districts republicans are taking a stand however because the debate over the state childrens health insurance program foreshadows a bigger showdown expected after a new president takes office in when washington considers how to expand health care coverage losing the veto fight would also badly undermine the president who has threatened to veto nine of the annual spending bills that congress must pass heres a closer look how does schip work schip is a state federal partnership that subsidizes health insurance for children in families with incomes too high to qualify for medicaid congress created schip in and has provided a total of &# billion for the program the program enrolled around million children in the fiscal year several states have used any unspent schip funding to cover some adults including pregnant women and low income parents has the program been successful in many ways yes the number of uninsured children has fallen by two million since while the number of uninsured adults has increased by five million over that period among families with incomes of between one and two times the poverty level the rate of uninsured children had fallen by through ahead of the national average that saw the ranks of uninsured children fall by nearly two in three voters say they support the democratic proposal to expand schip along with governors and several leading republican senators why expand the program without a funding increase enrollment in schip would fall to million in from million this year president bush has proposed a funding increase about &# billion bringing total spending to &# billion over the next five years but budget analysts say an additional &# billion is needed to maintain current levels under the presidents proposal enrollment would reach million this year and then fall to million in according to the congressional budget office currently most states provide schip to families with incomes at twice the poverty level around &# for a family of four democrats want to cover more families at three times the poverty level about &# for a family of four they have proposed a &# billion funding increase bringing total funding to &# billion over the next five years by raising the cigarette tax by cents a pack that would enroll million new children over five years including million uninsured children who are already eligible for schip or medicaid who would lose their insurance in coming years and two million who are privately insured according to cbo estimates why does the president oppose a larger expansion president bush opposed the measure largely on philosophical grounds conservatives worry that the expansion moves one step closer to government run health care and have accused supporters of the bill of playing politics hiding behind a program that was created to help poor children while expanding the programs reach to include more middle class families mr bush also argues that too large a schip expansion will result in moving more people who have private coverage into the government financed program between one quarter and one half of those who would become eligible for schip already have private insurance according to cbo estimates conservatives are also opposing the measure to burnish their credentials as stewards of small government after overseeing years of high spending and large deficits will the veto stick while the senate has enough votes to override the president house democrats are about votes shy as they head to a thursday vote last weekend president bush signaled openness to compromise but democrats who say they have already buckled to republican lawmakers demands in order to pass the legislation reacted coolly even if they fail to override the veto democrats could win a big political victory by dragging out the fight and forcing republicans to vote repeatedly against the program which could make an already uphill battle even steeper for republicans seeking re election in close contests next fall nick timiraos points of view this is a government run socialized health care wolf masquerading in the sheepskin of childrens health care " rep jeb hensarling r texas "this is probably the most inexplicable veto in the history of the country " sen
