alms for the alma mater its been years since texas billionaire lee bass gave &# million to yale to start a western civilization program and years since he took it back home depot co founder bernie marcus wants to make sure that mr basss experience is never repeated between and mr bass repeatedly sought assurances that his money wouldnt be dumped into multicultural education he kept asking the universitys president richard levin when the program which was to include a one year mandatory course for freshman would materialize when it became clear that the liberal facultys objections to mr basss gift had won the day he asked for his money back and yale reluctantly complied the robertson family at princeton has not been so lucky in charles and marie robertson an heiress to the a&amp p supermarket fortune donated &# million to the woodrow wilson school at princeton university to prepare students for careers in government service the robertsons descendants now claim that the university has diverted the funds to projects completely unrelated to this mission in they sued princeton to reclaim the endowment now estimated to be nearly &# million five years later they still havent gotten a refund how can donors be sure that the money they give will go to fund the things they want mr marcus says it is time to hold administrators feet to the fire along with john m templeton jr and the john william pope foundation mr marcus has provided the seed money &# million for the center for excellence in higher education cehe the indianapolis based center launched last month aims to help donors "use philanthropy as a lever to reform higher education " says frederic fransen its executive director reform includes a greater emphasis on core curricula a free market understanding of economics a more balanced approach to politics affordable tuition tenured faculty who spend more time in the classroom greater transparency in university governance and an end to grade inflation "for a buck universities would do anything " mr marcus said in a recent interview "we are seeing more anti western anti israel and anti democracy sentiment on campus" these days he observed adding wryly "the saudis are paying an enormous amount of money for that " mr marcus would like to compete he has found unfortunately that the universities are generally hostile to the economic and political system that has allowed businessmen like him to thrive "my success in life is because of free enterprise " he says but "colleges dont teach this " and the tales of mr bass and the robertsons give mr marcus and his cohort pause university administrations have often ignored "donor intent" when spending the proceeds from a particular gift and thanks to an antiquated hiring system and a faculty that will scream "infringement on academic freedom" any time an outsider tries to exert some influence the problems in higher education have become entrenched there are donors with the money to get around these problems to create entirely new schools or departments within a university but how do you get a university to agree to say starting a separate school devoted to the study of free enterprise and make sure theyll stick to the plan once they cash your check cehe will help donors free of charge craft contracts with universities to ensure their money is used properly it will also perform due diligence on these gifts once the agreement is complete mr marcus who has given tens of millions to universities including georgia tech and emory emphasizes that the restrictions on gifts "must be reasonable " he expects that the universities will resist but that theyll quickly change their tune if a donor threatens to take his business somewhere else cehe will offer a way for philanthropists to do just that if a donor has say &# million to give for a particular purpose he can ask the center to sponsor a contest among three or four different schools each submitting a proposal detailing how the money would be spent "competition tends to have the impact of bringing out the best " says dr templeton of the templeton foundation which regularly runs such contests starting next year cehe will manage contests in the areas of military history and strategy middle east studies entrepreneurship and business history and the principles of the american founding within five years the centers leaders expect that it will be helping to control at least &# million worth of donations and within years perhaps as much as &# billion of course even that amount is only of the market share in higher education philanthropy mr fransen is aware of the centers limitations "giving to harvard doesnt do any good you cant change them no matter how big your gift " he hopes cehe can influence the top colleges and universities but he also notes that it may be second tier institutions that are "hungrier" and willing to work harder for the money indeed if the center succeeds it wont just be students who learn more about the free market ms riley who has received grants from the templeton foundation is the journals deputy taste editor see related letter
