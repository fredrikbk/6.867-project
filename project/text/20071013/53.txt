the week ahead our take on coming events banks as earnings reports hit dont expect the unexpected by ann carrns when the countrys big banks start reporting third quarter financial results next week the numbers are likely to be both dismal and unsurprising many banks large and small have already announced write downs in the value of loans held in their portfolios as well as profit shortfalls thanks to a toxic combination of slumping housing and mortgage markets and this summers credit crunch that could make next weeks release of actual numbers somewhat anticlimactic investors know the banks have laid an egg citigroup inc for example warned that it expects to report a decline in year over year profit when it releases quarterly results on monday the biggest u s bank by both assets and market value placed part of the blame on the write down of subprime mortgages meant to be repackaged as securities and sold to investors as well as a decline in the value of loans made to help finance leveraged buyouts no bank of america corp and no j p morgan chase &amp co havent issued profit warnings but are expected as well to take significant write downs in the value of leveraged loans when they report on thursday and wednesday respectively all of which means that overall quarterly profit growth is expected to be the worst in years goldman sachs group inc analyst lori appelbaum forecasts that the banks she follows will report flat earnings per share growth as a group the first time that has happened she says since others are even gloomier predicting a drop in average per share earnings among the countrys largest banks "the view is that the third quarter was dreadful " says gary townsend an analyst with friedman billings ramsey &amp co with so much bad news already aired investors will be listening to earnings reports with a keen ear for clues about what is happening so far in the fourth quarter and what that might say about the outlook for the full year and beyond especially regarding mortgages washington mutual inc for example expects to offer more insight into its fourth quarter and full year loan provisioning or funds set aside in anticipation of soured loans wamu one of the countrys biggest mortgage lenders has said quarterly profit will fall roughly in large part as a result of a boost in provisions for loan losses one query on many analysts minds is whether banks are benefiting from the federal reserves half point cut in overnight interest rates on sept the easing of rates likely occurred too late to help third quarter results but bank executives may provide insight into the anticipated impact on their fourth quarter numbers the question is whether lower rates will provide enough of a boost to banks net interest income the difference between what they make on loans and pay out on deposits to overcome the drag of delinquent mortgages and loan write downs another area of interest consumer credit as reflected for example in credit card loans credit disruptions so far have centered mainly on home loans to subprime borrowers or those with weak credit banks really havent yet begun to experience a broad cyclical downturn among more credit worthy consumer borrowers says meredith whitney an analyst with cibc world markets politics democrats may find it hard putting mukasey on the spot by evan perez in january patrick leahy of vermont the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee expressed relief that after john ashcrofts four divisive years as attorney general the nomination of alberto gonzales "appears to offer a different era " in his confirmation hearings wednesday former federal judge michael b mukasey will hear much the same sentiment as he seeks to follow what turned out to be the troubled tenure of mr gonzales democrats and some republicans pushed for mr gonzaless resignation in september after months of upheaval that began over the firings of several u s attorneys but which brewed into a larger political storm over issues ranging from alleged torture of terror suspects to government surveillance programs mr mukasey a respected judge with an independent streak could prove a more elusive target thats put sen leahy and other democrats in a bind with political rancor growing over the bush administrations intelligence surveillance and recent revelations of the justice departments legal interpretations of torture critics of the white house are looking to put mr mukasey on the spot democrats are angry at the white house for ignoring their request for documents which the administration has declared to be shielded by presidential prerogative the outstanding disputes include secret memorandums that govern the treatment of terror detainees and documents on the national security agencys warrantless wiretapping program liberal and civil liberties groups are pushing democrats to demand that mr mukasey repudiate the justice departments so called torture memos which authorized harsh interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists the questions mr leahy has submitted to mr mukasey offer a peek at the senators approach and will likely require the nominee to show he is independent of the white house the leahy questions include "do you believe that the president has authority to override legal requirements and immunize acts of torture contrary to our treaty obligations and laws " and "i want to know your view of executive privilege " but mr mukasey has relatively clean hands on many of these issues having been a judge for years until he returned to the patterson belknap webb &amp tyler llp law firm last year and even though mr mukasey is a conservative who from his writings appears to hew closely to the bush administrations view on antiterror strategy he is less controversial than other potential nominees sen leahy himself expressed relief that the white house didnt go with a more politically active candidate such as theodore olson the former solicitor general "i have publicly praised the president and do so again for not choosing to nominate individuals from that publicized list of contenders whose records of partisanship would have led to immediate difficulties " he said recently global lenders new management to set tone as world bank imf meet by bob davis economic officials from nations will descend on washington next weekend for the combined annual meeting of the world bank and international monetary fund among the issues they will discuss are the u s and european credit crunch global trade "imbalances " and government owned investment funds but the officials arent likely to decide anything concrete that highlights the biggest question at the meeting but one thats not on the official agenda does the world need either institution each has different answers enunciated by a new leader for the world bank the meeting is a coming out party for its new chief robert zoellick a former u s trade negotiator who replaced iraq war architect paul wolfowitz who resigned under fire mr zoellick will explain the "six pillars" of his strategy they include boosting lending to china india and other fast growing developing nations in hopes of retaining some influence with them fund raising for a kitty for the worlds poorest nations and persuading arab nations to open their economies the latter is an especially tough challenge for the world bank which by tradition is always headed by an american though mr zoellick didnt play a role in the iraq war his intentions will be under special scrutiny in the middle east the imf too is under new management but the transition isnt complete imf chief rodrigo de rato a former spanish economy minister has resigned without completing his five year term the spanish news media figures he is going to make a run for prime minister an assertion he denies mr de rato will be chairing the imf sessions while the imf chief in waiting dominique strauss kahn a former french finance minister waits in paris until his term begins next month mr strauss kahn says the imf is at a "crossroads" and should keep a sharp eye on exchange rates a polite way of saying hell try to persuade china to let its currency float more as european and americans have long sought he also finds "interesting" a imf proposal to get ready for the next economic crisis by pre approving countries for emergency loans if the latter sounds a bit desperate somewhat like department stores mailing customers preapproved credit cards it is with the world economy humming along the fund and the bank are at loose ends from the s to the early s they put together billion dollar bailout packages in exchange for promises by borrowers that they would "reform " by reducing government spending selling off money losing government enterprises and longer term focusing more on education and health care in some cases the advice and money helped as in korea and brazil and sometimes it flopped as in argentina and indonesia but the rescues always engendered resentment domestically now many developing nations have deep financial reserves and dont need imf or world bank money so finance officials will be happy to hear what the imf and world bank have to say about global economic issues and sometimes even take their advice but the ministers dont have to follow orders from washington any longer
