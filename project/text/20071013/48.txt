the buzz marketwatch weekend investor how can you size up high tech when one size doesnt fit all from the "something to ponder" department herd mentality drives me nuts especially when it involves "technology stocks" as if one size fits all it often is a categorization that is as arbitrary and blurry as the line can be between value and growth stocks that is simply the way wall street works especially when any sector comes into favor as tech has been in recent months but that also raises the question what really is a tech stock these days "its anyones definition " says fred hickey of the high tech strategist newsletter when technology is in vogue companies tend to get lumped together by investment banking firms mutual funds or stock indexes for no reason other than perception or guilt by association or as is the case with google inc because it comes right out in its government filings and calls itself a "technology leader " but is it really what about apple inc is it a tech stock is amazon com inc dell inc broadly defined high tech is anything having to do with telecommunications semiconductors or personal computers but that can be misleading which is why former hedge fund manager tech analyst and all around out of the box thinker andy kessler likes to take it a step further to say that to be considered bona fide tech a company must spend "some exorbitant amount on research and development" resulting in products that more than pay their own way the easiest way to figure that out is to look at gross margins and the amount spent on research and development relative to sales on both counts the higher the better but even that can lead to different interpretations of what really constitutes technology some companies such as intel corp microsoft corp and cisco systems inc are obvious in their technological roots and it shows using mr kesslers approach margin percentages range from the high s to the high s with research and development in the range of to google regardless of how the company bills itself is trickier and is really more like a hybrid between technology and media it has fat margins and spends of sales on research but "it gets of its revenue from advertisers " mr hickey says and while google has almost as many engineers as sales people he adds it really just "develops software to drive their advertising business " mr kessler adds that google will become a full fledged media company based on his view of the world as its price earnings multiple contracts "the contraction in googles p e that has already happened is a sign that the street is worried about something a transition a change or perhaps a fear that they are more of a media company growing share versus being a tech company creating a market " apple meanwhile is more of a cross among a manufacturing marketing and product development company with tech thrown in "half and half " is how mr kessler characterizes it thanks to the software part of its business it has fairly high margins a respectable in the past months but it spends a surprisingly low of sales on research and development "they do spend an inordinate amount of r&amp d on software so they have leverage on that " mr kessler says "if they sell one more ipod they keep a big chunk of that gross margin " dell by contrast bills itself as the "worlds leading computer systems company" and likes to point to the "collaborative" approach it takes with customers to develop technology like many other companies that are considered tech however it really is little more than a manufacturer it spends less than of its sales on research and has very untech like margins of "they wrap plastic around someone elses exorbitant r&amp d " mr kessler says as for amazon the first line of its annual government filing uses the words "virtual" and "world wide web " the reality however is that for better or worse it is a retailer whose gross margins of in the past months are almost identical to those of wal mart stores inc and quite a bit lower than target corp s yet in part thanks to a recent rebound in its financial performance it trades at nearly times next years expected earnings or four times that of target and wal mart the difference is that unlike its brick and mortar brethren amazon does all of its business on the internet which many people believe still screams technology even if it isnt just dont tell the herd herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
