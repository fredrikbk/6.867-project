weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink born in burma new york when paul theroux walked around rangoon in he went looking for what had once been an essential stop for globe trotting westerners the pegu club rudyard kipling had been an habitue and in those days of imperial swagger the expats at the bar were all as kipling put it on their way up or on their way down locals on the other hand considered the pegu club "tainted grounds " burma scholar john sydenham furnivall wrote in a "symbol of pre independence british exclusiveness " decades after the brits bugged out theroux found that the pegu club had become an officers mess for the burmese army which suggests that the old spot is more than ever an object of opprobrium no such unpleasant associations attach to new yorks pegu club a bastion of the handcrafted cocktail the soho club takes its name not directly from the rangoon haunt but from the pegu club cocktail the drink first appeared in print in the savoy cocktail book which declared it "the favourite cocktail of the pegu club burma and one that has traveled and is asked for round the world " the men who first popularized the pegu club cocktail were fellows with a well earned reputation for drinking and gambling as richard curle wrote in his book "into the east notes on burma and malaya " at "the pegu club in rangoon they bet out of which hole of an inverted ash tray a captured ant will issue " and back in when kipling stopped in the bar was filled with english officers recounting the details of jungle warfare the talk was so bloody that kipling declared he had heard "too much " he "went out into the steamy night my head ringing with stories of battle murder and sudden death " the conversation at the soho bar is significantly less sanguinary though no doubt the occasional trader boasts of having made a killing with much of the attention on pegu clubs well made drinks of the many excellent cocktails on their list my favorite is the bars namesake it is a drink that had long since fallen off the map but now in part because of the regard in which new yorks pegu club is held among cocktail cognoscenti and in part because the drink is refreshing bracing and tasty the pegu club cocktail is traveling once again i recently enjoyed a fine example at a nouveau indian restaurant in washington d c called rasika with any luck it will become part of bartenders standard repertoire the are several reasons the pegu club cocktail is a worthy flagship drink for the newly serious cocktail culture for starters it is one of the noble family of drinks that gary regan author of "the joy of mixology " calls "new orleans sours " such cocktails made of a base spirit an orange liqueur and tart citrus include the sidecar cognac cointreau and lemon juice and the margarita tequila triple sec and lime juice the pegu club uses gin orange curacao and lime juice but those are not its only ingredients one of the signal discoveries of the revived cocktail culture is the importance of bitters when the cocktail first emerged out of the primordial taproom it was defined as a drink of liquor flavored with sugar and bitters these bark herb and root tinctures angostura is the most famous grace a drink with depth and complexity and ensure that it wont be cloyingly sweet to make a pegu club cocktail one has to be well mustered in the bitters department not only does the drink call for angostura but it demands orange bitters as well while faithful old angostura never left us orange bitters disappeared for decades now the ingredient is back in earnest with more than one to choose from gary regans brand is well spiced fee brothers is redolent of dissolved baby aspirins audrey saunders the co owner of pegu club makes a house orange bitters by mixing regans and fee bros bitters half and half which means that the pegu club cocktail you will find in the eponymous soho bar includes three brands of bitters an emphatic statement of the role they play in the modern classics the pegu club cocktail is a very simple drink requiring neither lychee puree nor squid ink nor any of the other dubious exotics employed by ambitious bar chefs of late simple as it is the pegu club depends for its success on the quality of its ingredients a good gin a well made curacao and above all fresh citrus decades of drinks have been ruined with the pre fab processed citrus extract and corn syrup mess called "sour mix " the retro futurist cocktail culture has insisted on a return to freshly squeezed juices there would have been no sour mix at the old rangoon pegu club its a pity that the original club embodied the prejudices of its age though the pegu club did begin to lose it racial restrictiveness as the brits lost their imperial grip between the world wars when george orwell wanted to illustrate "the way this countrys going" in his novel "burmese days " he wrote "natives are getting into all the clubs nowadays even the pegu club im told " happily one doesnt have to be a member of any club at all to enjoy the virtues of the pegu club cocktail email me at eric felten wsj com pegu club cocktail  oz gin  oz orange curacao  oz fresh lime
