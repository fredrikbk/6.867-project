hot topic schip howlers after president bush vetoed congresss major expansion of the state childrens health insurance program nancy pelosi declared "president bush used his cruel veto pen to say i forbid million children from getting the health benefits they deserve " as far as political self parody goes that one ought to enter the record books its wrong on the facts for one which speaker pelosi knows the schip bill was not some all or nothing proposition a continuing resolution fully funds the program through mid november so none of the million recipients will lose coverage and even if washington cant agree by then there will be another stopgap because schip might as well already be an entitlement in truth the bush administration endorses a modest expansion a majority of congress backs a much larger expansion the controversy is over the role of government in health care the million children that ms pelosi cites are the sum of the current enrollees plus those who could join under the democratic plan which also has the support of some wayward republicans never mind that up to of these children already have private insurance which schip would displace as it moves up the income scale only by beltway reasoning could "not expanding" count as "denying" public assistance hillary clinton went further and said the president was actively "stealing" health care from needy kids despite all that after his veto mr bush repeatedly signaled a willingness to compromise and spend more than the &# billion he would prefer to pump in which is by itself a expansion his offer has been spurned flatout and an override vote is scheduled for next week despite their howls about "the children " democrats and their media partners are happy to milk them for political gain unfortunately that narrative was bolstered this week by some conservative bloggers after the schip veto democrats chose a year old boy named graeme frost to deliver a two minute rebuttal while that was a political stunt the washington habit of employing "poster children" is hardly new but the internet mob leapt to some dubious conclusions and claimed the frost kids shouldnt have been on schip in the first place as it turns out they belonged to just the sort of family that a modest schip is supposed to help one lesson from this meltdown is the limit of argument by anecdote the larger point concerns policy assumptions everyone concedes it is hard for some lower income families like the frosts to find affordable private health coverage the debate is over what the government should do about it the democratic position is clear expand a government program and all will be cured mr bushs position recognizes that a subsidy like schip is necessary is some cases because of government mandates and overregulation congress and the states consistently enact health care policies that make insurance coverage more expensive and then they wonder why people have trouble paying for it in a more rational world liberals would embrace the health care tax reforms that mr bush advocates the employer based insurance tax deduction is a wealth transfer to those who need it least the most affluent with the most gold plated plans it launders health dollars through a third party bureaucracy that encourages people to spend reducing access and raising prices for the uninsured on equity grounds alone democrats should support changing these incentives that they dont or wont suggests ulterior political motives and thats where schip comes in all democratic "universal" health care plans combine more government subsidies with more coverage mandates todays schip expansion is the down payment for when they want to extend it well into the middle class the fact that there are better and more economic policies to cover more people is less important than getting ever more americans on the government health care tab as for the gops schip fans most of them understand this but also dont want to be portrayed as voting against "children " senators orrin hatch and chuck grassley were especially slippery in their letter to us yesterday in dodging any answer to our critique of the bills &# billion funding ruse the bill includes a funding "cliff" that abruptly cuts off the higher spending in year five to conceal its true future costs under congressional budget rules its precisely such fiscal fraudulence that cost republicans their congressional majority last year overriding mr bushs veto wont help them get it back
