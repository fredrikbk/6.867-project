cross country the big not so easy baton rouge la maam where are the bullet holes " in most state capitols visitors come to see politicians walking the halls but here in louisiana what lots of people would rather see is where huey long an ex governor and some say ex dictator was gunned down in so the receptionist doesnt bat an eye though she does respond in a soft cajun accent in telling me to go down the hall to the left louisiana is one of just three states that will elect a new governor this year the others are kentucky and mississippi and its leading the pack in one surprising way louisiana is turning into a test case for what happens when voters take a stand against incompetent or worse political leadership voters head to the polls on oct and this time may finally exorcise the ghost of huey long incumbent gov kathleen blanco a democrat declined to run for a second term after seeing her approval ratings fall through the floor following hurricane katrina two years ago now it appears the man she defeated four years ago on a platform of experience over youthful optimism year old republican bobby jindal will win in a walk louisiana politics has long served up a spicy roux of rascals former gov edwin w edwards is now ensconced in a federal prison he was elected to a fourth term as governor in in a race against david duke the ex klansman and demagogue in a campaign famous for a bumper sticker that read "vote for the crook its important " more recently rep william jefferson whos under federal investigation because of some cold hard cash found in his cold hard freezer and sen david vitter whose phone number turned up in an alleged madams little black book have been in the news sadly for louisianans the list goes on and it grew longer after the political bumbling in the wake of katrina and its destruction gov blanco and ray nagin the mayor of new orleans arent so much real people anymore as walking editorial cartoons for lampooning purposes only not to be taken seriously is it any wonder then that the big issues in the coming gubernatorial election in a state reeling from the punch of hurricanes katrina rita and a third storm of incompetence are ethics corruption and leadership or that the odds on favorite is mr jindal the clean hands congressman who is running on ethics reform and controlling spending at years of age bobby jindal was secretary of louisianas department of health and hospitals then executive director of the national bipartisan commission on the future of medicare after losing his first bid for the governorship he got himself elected to congress with almost of the vote mr jindal is probably the only official with broad name id in the state to come out of katrina with his reputation intact four years ago mr nagin endorsed mr jindal but the two have had a public falling out mr jindal shrugged it off when i spoke to him recently "ray and i have always gotten along fine it shouldnt matter whos in baton rouge and whos in new orleans because so much of the next few years is going to be rebuilding areas that were devastated " when i visited mr jindal mr nagin was considering running for governor a fellow at a coffee shop in lake providence when told about a possible ray run was dumbfounded "youre kidding " he said with visible concern before offering this schizophrenic reaction "oh man well a lot of people would vote for him " mr nagin ended up not running for governor but other candidates have filed to run included among them bless her is mary smith a retired hairdresser from winnsboro whose sole political concern is to win a pardon for the convicted former governor edwards the most visible candidate not named jindal is johnny georges a new orleans businessman who made a splash last month by handing out water to protesters at a rally for several black youths the "jena " who were initially charged with attempted murder for beating a white student hes spending a lot of the &# million hes invested in this race on a nonstop media blitz its not helping all the polls say this is mr jindals race to lose typical of the campaign coverage on the cover of the baton rouge business report is a smiling mr jindal next to the headline "the chosen one " clancy dubos has followed state politics for years as editor of the influential gambit weekly in new orleans he says the jindal candidacy represents a "do over for voters who may have buyers remorse" for electing ms blanco over mr jindal four years ago the reason for the remorse is simple ms blanco hasnt even managed the task of effectively handing out federal and state money to residents hit hard by the storm in the first few months in operation her road home program set up specifically to give residents funds to rebuild approved fewer than applications out of more than filed "i dont think people realize " mr jindal says but the states reputation of corruption "is costing us opportunities its robbing us of jobs ive been in new york ive talked to the ceos and ill tell you theres a perception that you know ive gotta pay somebody off or hire somebodys brother in law it is absolutely holding us back our very first special session of the state legislature will be an up or down vote on my ethics package " consider the controversial headlines and overheated racial rhetoric emanating from little jena la where thousands bused in last month to march in support of the black teens on top of everything else louisiana has a national perception problem given that and the huge taxpayer investment to recreate new orleans the governors race down here really is no laughing matter because this time if political theatrics rule the day the joke would be on all of us mr webb is a columnist for the arkansas democrat gazette in little rock
