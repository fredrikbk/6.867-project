the anti deportationist backlash like many conservatives i have long admired former rep j d hayworth as an important articulate advocate of many causes i hold dear i am troubled that his fanaticism on the single subject of deportation has deprived the nation of his dependable votes for victory in iraq tax cuts school choice and the right to life to rep hayworths accusation that i misstated the title of his book "whatever it takes " i plead guilty "historical revisionism on immigration issue " letters to the editor oct but to his accusation that i did not read it i must protest in fact i quoted page of his tome in my study "border wars " as a superb synthesis of deportationist goals and attitudes "the wall street journal once scolded that lawmakers need to distinguish between immigrants who bus tables and those who hijack airplanes without giving any practical advice on how to make such a distinction heres the distinction i make if the busboy is illegal he should be deported the hijacker should be executed " mr hayworth reports that his opponent in the election rep harry mitchell won by successfully "paying lip service to enforcement in his television ads with the poll tested phrase we must secure the border " it is a myth perpetrated by mr hayworth and others that non deporationist candidates oppose border security mr mitchell was specific in what he advocated namely more border patrol agents more high tech surveillance more border fence and more employer accountability for documenting whom they hire but he also advocated quote "a temporary worker program that allows us to keep track of who crosses our borders " regarding illegals mr mitchell posted the following on his campaign web site "catching and deporting million illegal immigrants as some have suggested is neither realistic nor wise i believe we should give families an opportunity to gain legal status if they pay a penalty for breaking the law pay their taxes learn english and hold a job for a period of years " in the real world this is known as "comprehensive immigration reform " not "lip service " mr hayworth claims that i ignored the fact that arizona residents passed initiatives for english only no bail for illegal alien criminals and restrictions on non citizen welfare benefits but as my study repeatedly demonstrates candidates of both parties win elections in the southwest on platforms that include a variety of immigration restrictions and border security measures mr hayworth lost his election advocating not what he shared with other candidates but what distinguished him the goal of mass deportation aside from tom tancredo there has not been a single elected official more publicly associated with the deportationist point of view than j d hayworth i included an analysis of his district not because it was rich in hispanic votes it is not but because if the widely touted anti illegal backlash of non hispanic whites were to materialize anywhere scottsdale and tempe were prime candidates mr hayworth who carried arizona district against his democratic rival to in lost by to in the negative reaction of hispanics to a deportationist platform was swift and measurable the "positive" response of non hispanic whites was not neither rep hayworth nor any of my other critics have grasped the central point of my study what the gop lost where it ran deportationist candidates can be measured in actual votes cast by hispanics over a single election cycle a shift of three or four percentage points within a major voting block is considered significant the anti deportationist backlash i measured among hispanics of plus points signals a major realignment with potentially catastrophic consequences for the gop richard nadler president americas majority foundation overland park kan
