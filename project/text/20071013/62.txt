weekend journal books the shaping of a judge my grandfathers son by clarence thomas harper pages &# the black experience in america which survived the abomination of slavery and flourished despite the jim crow era is in part the story of a people guided by great leaders such as frederick douglass and martin luther king jr more significantly though it is the story of men and women whose names may never appear in a history book but who labored hard and remained faithful to the future passing on a legacy of devotion to family community and god in his compelling memoir "my grandfathers son " supreme court justice clarence thomas shows us how this tradition helped to shape his own life abandoned by his father at an early age justice thomas was reared by his maternal grandfather myers anderson whom he called "daddy " from his grandfather he learned the lessons afforded by discipline and work "what i am " justice thomas writes "is what he made me " despite the sniping from political and ideological opponents in recent days "my grandfathers son" is not a score settling polemic it is an intensely personal account of one mans remarkable journey from rural pinpoint ga where justice thomas was born in to his supreme court swearing in ceremony in at every step of the way whether describing his enrollment in at the all white saint john vianney seminary on the isle of hope near savannah or the turmoil at his senate confirmation hearing justice thomas writes with unguarded passion after a racial slight by fellow students at saint john he says he walked away wondering whether they were laughing at him "i never turned around to see i couldnt bear to know every step was agony " as he moved on from saint john after deciding against the priesthood to college at holy cross in worcester mass and then to yale law school he struggled to thrive in an almost uniformly white world but time and again justice thomas writes he was served well by the work ethic that had been instilled in him by daddy a poorly educated yet proud man who refused public assistance because he said "it takes away your manhood " his grandfathers sturdy example also impressed on justice thomas the importance of staying connected to something and someone real for him that something real has been the abiding love of his family and a solid grounding in religious faith but "my grandfathers son" is not just a tale of challenges overcome it is also a witness to the evolution of a mans political and judicial philosophy it has been fashionable to dismiss justice thomass hostility to affirmative action as "anti black " but that interpretation is much too simplistic the book underscores why justice thomas came to believe that a reliance on government doesnt break the cycle of poverty it just perpetuates the misery from his own experience and that of his family friends and neighbors his first hand encounters with the underbelly of segregation and racism poverty and hopelessness forged his sense that "preferential policies" should be based on economic status not race in justice thomass view affirmative action can lead to a dependency as diabolical as segregation many may disagree but "my grandfathers son" might help his more open minded critics better appreciate and respect why he holds such views clarence thomas has experienced the best and the worst of america he has been on the receiving end of hate and vilification but he has also experienced the power of love and family the man he called daddy gave him an extraordinary gift an appreciation for the value of perseverance and now justice thomas has passed the gift along it will be added to a long history of pride and successful struggle tempered by the reality that there is more to do mr steele a former lieutenant governor of maryland is the chairman of the political action committee gopac
