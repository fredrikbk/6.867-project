weekend journal books book review throwing a curve on iraq a reporter once enmeshed in the wmd debate on the tale of a dubious informant curveball by bob drogin random house pages &# in january the morning after david kay the chief weapons inspector in iraq told a stunned senate committee that prewar claims that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction were "all wrong " president bush invited him to lunch throughout the often tense minute session mr bush kept returning to the question that haunted him "what went wrong " he asked the embarrassed mr kay "why did we get it so wrong " in "curveball spies lies and the con man who caused a war " bob drogin a pulitzer prize winning investigative reporter for the los angeles times attempts to answer that question through the story of an iraqi engineer and defector who arrived in germany in in search of political asylum and creature comforts he dreamed mr drogin writes of owning a "gleaming mercedes sedan with buttery soft leather seats " curveball such was his american codename helped to convince germany the u s and several other countries that iraq had seven mobile vans that could make deadly bioweapons in violation of its disarmament pledges to the united nations the defector knew impressive details about the trailers and iraqs biological weapons programs his claims were at the heart of the pivotal national intelligence estimate of october the intelligence communitys "gold standard" report it concluded with "high confidence" that iraq had chemical and biological arms curveballs information also found its way into mr bushs state of the union address in january which prepared the country for war and into secretary of state colin powells february presentation to the u n which persuaded many skeptics of iraqs danger and duplicity none of it was true as mr drogin and his colleague greg miller first disclosed in the los angeles times in early curveball was a fabricator whom the germans were eager to keep to themselves providing other countries only with transcripts of their interrogations the germans were worried they said about protecting their source and thus did not allow the cia to interview curveball until a year after the invasion the "paper thin" sources who supposedly corroborated curveballs claims mr drogin concludes eventually proved to be worthless discredited too were the administrations assertions that two trailers that the u s military found in iraq soon after the invasion were mobile germ labs of the sort described by curveball after an exhaustive study the iraq survey group concluded in fall that the trailers were configured to make not germs but hydrogen gas for artillery weather balloons curveball mr drogin shows was a chain smoking mentally unstable "con man" fired from his engineering post at governments chemical engineering and design center in baghdad and a former taxi driver he lives today somewhere in germany under intelligence protection presumably without his mercedes mr drogin breathes life into this saga offering fascinating detail and creating suspense even though we now know how the story will end what is more he provides an instructive inside look at the clandestine communitys closed culture he shows for instance that an enmity between the german and american intelligence services rooted in cold war rivalries played a role in germanys unwillingness to give the cia access to its cherished if dubious source we see the defense intelligence agency acting as a conduit between the germans and the cia handling the curveball material ineptly passing along sloppy translations and making scant effort to vet curveballs veracity for itself we see the childish bickering between the cia and the dia and at times between cia officials themselves we have a seat at the conference table during a heated clash in december over curveballs reliability between "beth " the cias chief analyst whose division had endorsed curveball and "margaret " the skeptical cias operations group chief for germany who invites beth memorably to "kiss my ass in macys window " how the cia came to trust a source it couldnt interview and why it insisted on his veracity long after the agency should have walked away from him is at the heart of this page turner which has been bought for a feature film in depressing detail mr drogin portrays a u s intelligence apparatus in utter disarray burdened by poor spycraft a risk averse culture bureaucratic rivalries poor communication and at times a reluctance to deliver news that is at odds with what higher ups most want to hear but mr drogin goes further he insists that the wmd fiasco was caused by outright "lies" and by officials for whom "tawdry ambitions and spineless leadership proved more important than professional integrity " he alludes to the visits of vice president cheney to cia headquarters in langley va and to scooter libbys draft of secretary powells u n speech implying that they are evidence of soul compromising political pressure he says that curveball might have "fused fact and fiction" but that "others twisted and magnified his account in grotesque ways " but those "others" mostly go unnamed indeed mr drogins case for the lying of u s officials is weak relying mostly on speculation and innuendo mr drogins own reporting suggests that the dysfunction of post langley a place of intense bureaucratic in fighting and a willingness to go with the political flow better explains how the cia came to embrace curveballs claims for his account mr drogin relies heavily on intelligence officials allied with tyler drumheller then a veteran cia senior operations chief whose finely honed instincts about curveball turned out to be right and whose objections to the use of curveballs information infuriated the agency analysts who believed the defector but mr drumhellers version of events in which he is loudly denouncing curveball while his co workers ignore him in favor of a more convenient truth has been challenged by many other participants including george tenet the former director of central intelligence insisted in his recent memoir "at the center of the storm " that mr drumheller never raised concerns about curveball in their meetings between february and july john mclaughlin the cias no at the time whom mr drogin denigrates as a "company man" also disputes mr drumhellers characterization yes mr mclauglin told me in an interview there was plenty of internal discussion about curveball as there would be about any major intelligence source but high level concerns that curveball might have been a fabricator were never brought forward "tyler drumheller " he said "is no paul revere " who is right exactly why did the cia endorse curveballs story as a reporter who was widely criticized for having written several exclusive newspaper reports based on the flawed prewar intelligence estimates i know how hard it is discern the extent to which bias or preconceived notions shape ostensible evidence no doubt all sorts of forces were in play but none of the panels that have examined the wmd intelligence fiasco particularly the bipartisan commission on the intelligence capabilities of the u s regarding weapons of mass destruction concludes as mr drogin does that political pressure leading to outright lying was to blame "analysts universally asserted " the bipartisan wmd commission stated "that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter any of their analytical judgments " rather than giving us heroes and villains mr drogin might have given a fairer rendition of the other side of his narrative he dismisses in a paragraph or two the reasons why "beth " the cia analyst so ardently believed in curveballs information its precision and technical detail and its endorsement by an independent laboratory and perhaps her unconscious determination in a post world never to be accused of having underestimated a wmd threat such thinking surely played a major part in the cias judgments but mr drogin prefers simply to assert that those writing the pivotal national intelligence estimate on wmd were given as he quotes an anonymous document drafter saying "clear marching orders" to write a report that buttressed the nations case for going to war several of the officials whom mr drogin interviewed for his book not only mr tenet and mr mclaughlin but also bill harlow the former cia spokesman and others who decline to be named have strongly disputed the assertion even the authors hero mr drumheller who told me in an interview that he thought that mr tenet was "weak" and called mr tenets denials of prewar knowledge about the curveball dispute "sad" apparently does not believe that the agency was asked or ordered lie about the intelligence "no one ever said find something false we want to go to war " he told me nor does he think that the disinformation provided by curveball caused the war as mr drogins subtitle asserts "curveball may have been lying " mr drumheller said "but the rest were suspending their skepticism its a more complex story " ms miller a pulitzer prize winning reporter who wrote about national security for the new york times is now a fellow at the manhattan institute
