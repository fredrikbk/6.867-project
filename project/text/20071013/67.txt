weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations the gops problem fred thompson gives "a very incoherent and not very concise stump speech " peaked months ago and is the campaigns "biggest dud " mitt romney has "an authenticity problem" he is "almost too mechanical about the issues " john mccain faces "enormous hurdles " and the "irony" of his quest is that he may just be repeating mike huckabee has "the obvious problems being from hope ark and quite frankly having the last name huckabee " the craven republicans are "terrified about losing the presidency after losing congress " all this comes from terry mcauliffe longtime democratic party mover maven and moneyman whos obviously hoping for a democratic win only kidding it comes from mr mcauliffes new podium partner on the washington speech circuit longtime bush operative dan bartlett recently departed after years as white house communications director mr bartlett has taken the old place of ed gillespie the lobbyist who used to appear with mr mcauliffe and is now back at the white house in mr bartletts old job this is why the late drew pearson called his column "washington merry go round " they serve and rarely leave so often people work in government and make it more of a swamp then they leave and become mosquitoes living off the pond scum buzzing off the surface eating well issuing their little stings i am harsh but its something i often wonder why dont people in washington go home anymore im reading michael kordas serene and gracious tribute to dwight eisenhower "ike an american hero " and stopped dead at this part the day his white house successor jfk was inaugurated "in the middle of a heavy snowstorm ike and mamie left quietly and unobtrusively grateful that they were no longer the focus of attention and drove the eighty miles to gettysburg " oh for those days and that sort now you wouldnt think an adviser who helped steer a president to a sundered base a flattened party and some of the lowest approval ratings since such polling began would feel free to be so critical of others in politics profound modesty as to the depth of ones own savvy might be in order but maybe mr bartletts attitude illustrates a larger reality the bush people dont seem to spend much time on loyalty to the party per se only to their guy who after all is looking out for the republican nominees for the group of them they are the future of the party the washington gop apparatus is focused on the president on asserting the brilliance of his legacy and at this point im sure as in the clinton days on making sure he has a nice and well funded presidential library but who is looking out for his presumptive heirs why for example are they forced into debates that seem almost designed to diminish them having as moderator a preening cable jockey does nothing to enhance their stature it is a recipe for sadness why dont the republican campaigns the republican establishment try to get moderators of calm stature ted koppel for one is an old school broadcaster he makes you look classy because hes classy he lends it to you as he asks you questions what does chris matthews lend why not keith olbermann or al franken i am wondering if the washington gop establishment fails to look after these things because they dont really think theres life after bush or even care all that much they think the next president is a democrat a lot of them will do lobbying for a living better learn to get along and so the candidates swim with an anvil around their necks one of the few candidates mr bartlett had nothing bad to say about was rudy giuliani which suggests to me what i hear from those who visit the white house may be true the president has decided its rudy he also told a friend that when the primary is over hell campaign hard for the nominee here i imagine the candidates for once speaking in unison oh please dont something id call the twenty percent rule seems to exist in presidential polling no matter what a president does he gets to keep approval you could break into the watergate hotel while having sex with an intern and keep them the is made up of the immovable intractable base those who fell for you early and hard and wont quit who hate the media so much that if they hate you theyll love you who are certain the incumbent is abused by history and its recent minor players who stick because of this issue or that and that by definition highly engaged in politics always votes in the primaries every candidate needs them at the very least no one wants to inspire their enmity i asked a veteran conservative political professional what the candidates can do he said "no need to trash bush by name run as sarkozy focusing on the future those tired of bush will see the distancing those enamored will assume the candidates love bush say something nice about the bush tax cuts or supreme court appointments bushies just need to hear something nice " the gop challengers no matter how they feel about mr bush cant knock him because that would infuriate the presidents in iowa new hampshire and elsewhere the exception is ron paul who seems to have no fear of criticizing anybody and this week john mccain who in the debate had some sharp words for the current reality "the american people no longer have trust or confidence in our government our failure at katrina our failures in iraq our failures to get spending under control and weve got to restore that trust and confidence " that sounded like the beginning of a little rebellion i suspect the republican establishment knows all this but i am not sure it concerns them overmuch why should it if you are an absolute bush partisan you probably dont really want a republican to follow him and potentially in decisions if not in words rebuke him that would be the worst thing not being followed by hillary or obama if the latter happens the outgoing administration can and will blame the loss on lax candidates on a party that wasnt sufficiently inclusive on congressional scandals on immigration "if only theyd followed our lead " theyll be fine the party may be defeated the conservative coalition that raised them high sundered but theyll be all right which is important because more than the presidents legacy is involved their very personal legacy is involved no one wants to have worked for the biggest embarrassment in modern american political history you wont be burning up the public speaking trail with terry mcauliffe that way
