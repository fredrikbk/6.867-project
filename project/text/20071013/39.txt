leading candidate to succeed beleaguered chief executive charles prince one day but for now his main challenge is to keep mr prince in his job as part of a shake up in citigroups core wall street businesses mr pandit years old will oversee thousands of traders who were badly bruised by a summer rout in global credit markets his mission to boost the banks returns and push into higher return businesses at a time when many investors are fed up with citigroups lackluster performance more than a week after citigroup announced its third quarter earnings would fall from the year earlier period mr prince on thursday night overhauled the top ranks of the firms investment bank mr pandit who joined citigroup earlier this year to run its alternative investments business will oversee a new group that includes alternative investments and the firms critical markets and banking division mr prince along with top executive robert druskin and the head of citis executive committee robert rubin had been reviewing the investment banks operations for months but their efforts took on more urgency this summer when credit markets seized up cutting into profitability in many key businesses according to people familiar with the matter among other things they determined that the investment bank and alternative investments business which includes private equity hedge funds and real estate should work more closely together to provide more seamless service to key clients and help the company devise products better tailored to its customers these people said even before the tumultuous summer mr druskin who led the restructuring initiative earlier this year that resulted in a roughly reduction of citis global work force pushed to combine the investment bank and alternative investments units according to people familiar with the matter but his plan encountered resistance among other senior citi executives until the credit crunch led to big trading losses in fixed income while the overhaul has been in the planning stages for weeks significant parts of the shake up were still the subject of tense discussions hours before it was announced as a result of the shake up thomas maheras a well regarded citigroup veteran who oversaw the capital markets and trading operations is leaving the firm also leaving is randy barker one of citigroups co heads of fixed income trading who reported to mr maheras although well liked by the banks traders mr maheras was known to be somewhat less enthusiastic about new ventures preferring to rely on the banks tried and true ways of doing business as a powerhouse in the bond business according to people familiar with the matter mr maheras couldnt be reached for comment still the departure of mr maheras was widely viewed as a big disappointment for many at the firm a year citi veteran mr maheras is known for a fierce loyalty to his cadre of traders mr maheras received a standing ovation from those traders on friday morning as he walked through the banks trading floors in lower manhattan according to people familiar with the matter mr maheras didnt make any formal remarks but was seen chatting to groups of traders who lined up to shake his hand mr princes move came after months of criticism of his efforts to make citigroup more profitable despite a series of efforts to revitalize the bank its share price is flat it continues to struggle with cutting expenses and increasing revenue in many key businesses for now citigroups board appears to be firmly supporting mr prince even as a growing number of investors and analysts say it is time for a change in the executive suite that puts the pressure on mr pandit a former executive of morgan stanley who came to citigroup when the bank bought his old lane hedge fund for an estimated &# million earlier this year mr pandits name also has come up as a potential successor to mr prince though bank executives have said there is no clear path for that to happen anytime soon "we believe that if mr pandit does not succeed in producing a better combination of lower volatility and at least a peer average return on capital from the investment bank citigroups board will conclude that a more significant change at the ceo level is required " bear stearns &amp co banking analyst david hilder wrote in a report yesterday in his new position mr pandit is expected to revitalize citigroups trading businesses by pushing harder in high growth businesses such as commodities and derivatives indeed thats what mr pandit did at morgan stanley in the s when he pushed the firm into developing services that cater to hedge funds and also expanded into electronic trading meanwhile speculation swirled about mr maherass next move even as the terms of his departure including whether it includes a noncompete clause remained unclear although mr maheras is known to be well liked by former citigroup executive james dimon who now runs j p morgan chase &amp co theres not likely to be a role for him there because the two executives who run j p morgans investment bank steve black and bill winters are well regarded and close to mr dimon kate kelly and david enrich contributed to this article
