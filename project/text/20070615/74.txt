politics &amp economics sarkozy shifts foreign policy new french vision may have an impact on the u s s goals before he became president of france last month nicolas sarkozy promised a new "french vision" of the world that vision is beginning to come into focus and could have significant impact on the european union and its neighbors as well as on some of washingtons foreign policy goals from relations with russia to the eu turkey and the u s mr sarkozy has begun to set himself apart from his predecessor jacques chirac whose policies pivoted around his goal of forging a european counterweight to u s power the shift which officials and analysts describe as evolving and still in very early stages owes much to mr sarkozys hyperactive style wednesday for example mr sarkozy signaled a break with mr chiracs russia policy when he received the president of georgia mikhail saakashvili according to georgian officials mr saakashvili had been trying without success to secure a meeting with mr chirac since they met just after the leader of the former soviet republic was swept to power by a popular revolution in in mr chiracs model of a multipolar world frances relationship with russia was critical helping europe counterbalance the power of the u s georgias relations with russia however verge on hostile moscow sees mr saakashvili as a u s puppet determined to take his country into the north atlantic treaty organization a move that moscow opposes as a result france along with a handful of other european countries had resisted georgias efforts to move quickly to join the western military alliance the doors of the elysee palace had been closed to mr saakashvili mr sarkozy by contrast has said he backs the integration of georgia and ukraine with nato whether mr sarkozy follows through remains to be seen but an official present at wednesdays meeting said mr sarkozy twice said russia wouldnt be allowed to wield a veto over georgias nato membership bid mr sarkozys spokesman david martinon said the president "did not go that far " but highlighting the warm relationship mr sarkozy told his georgian counterpart that france would be willing to help georgia build up and organize its armed forces as well as support georgias ambition to launch a civilian nuclear power program mr martinon said mr sarkozy also agreed that russia should be engaged on principles rather than realpolitik alone and said he would like to visit georgia by the end of the year according to an official at the meeting who declined to be named mr sarkozy also is likely to court moscow and he visibly enjoyed his meeting with russian president vladimir putin at the summit of the group of eight leading nations in germany last week but mr saakashvili "is a democrat and a liberal " said francois heisbourg foreign policy analyst at the foundation for strategic research in paris mr sarkozy "picks and chooses people who are like him " that values based approach was decisive in mr sarkozys choice of foreign minister bernard kouchner mr kouchner founder of the medical charity medecins du monde has a strong focus on human rights issues during the presidential election campaign mr sarkozy said one of his top priorities would be to revive frances global push in favor of human rights even if that meant being tough with russia and china and to accelerate efforts to avert global warming even if that meant being tough with the u s mr sarkozy has taken a less abrasive approach with the u s than did mr chirac although what effect that will have is unclear a meeting between president bush and mr sarkozy on the margins of the g summit resulted in an invitation for mr sarkozy to visit washington in september relations between messrs bush and chirac were ice cold after their split over the u s decision to invade iraq it is likely to be within the eu that mr sarkozy has the greatest impact already he has taken a lead in trying to shape a new stripped down constitutional treaty for the eu in order to bury for good the page document that french voters rejected in a referendum that outcome dramatically weakened frances position in europe and the eu itself he also has outlined a proposal to group the eus mediterranean neighbors in a special association with the eu primarily as a means of blocking turkeys negotiations to join the eu as a member state unlike mr chirac mr sarkozy has said he will actively seek ways to block turkeys membership bid
