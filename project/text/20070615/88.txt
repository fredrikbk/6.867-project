sons are sacrificed throughout history and the grief never changes leon de winters essay "my only son" editorial page june is disturbing on several levels i am offended that he equates accidental auto deaths with the slaughter of young soldiers i am troubled by his blithe suggestion that the battlefield "sacrifice of a second or third son" is historically acceptable i cannot comprehend his assertion that an only sons life is more precious than the lives of those second and third sons finally one cannot help but infer that he trivializes the deaths of the soldiers who have fallen thus far in iraq by representing them as a miniscule fraction of our population to be fair mr de winter covers his bases by acknowledging the "immeasurable grief" parents suffer with such a loss however i cant help but think that his attempt to weigh both statistics in the same scale represents a tacit admission that the iraq war was not principally undertaken to preserve liberty or to defeat malevolent islamic terrorists but rather to occupy a country with the vast oil reserves we need to preserve our mobility and freedom mark wardlaw santa rosa calif leon de winter offers an outstanding explanation for what has been the primary driver for wars throughout history i dont believe you could find a simpler and more truthful explanation for what is going on in the media and in the minds of the u s population regarding the body count of soldiers in iraq vs the ungodly human carnage occurring daily on our highways mr de winter has managed to write in a few paragraphs what would have taken the critics a novel to explain sam moss greer s c mr de winter writes that declining family size might increase the aversion to war in western families and nations he theorizes that an "only son" might be too precious to risk even if the cause of war is just presumably this principle applies as well to non western nations such as china for support he cites the work of the german scholar gunnar heinsohn who studied the opposite situation heinsohn found that societies were more prone to violence and war when they had a surge in population especially of young men culture matters too of course as well as the availability of resources but demography matters more than we realize jonathan d kaufelt santa monica calif mr de winter a dutch novelist makes interesting observations about the confluence of explosive population growth and the lack of economic opportunities in middle eastern societies and how this confluence is contributing to the violent radicalization of many young men there by contrast western societies have fewer young males and more economic opportunity thus these societies are more peaceful he concludes what i found very disturbing about mr de winters essay however is his focus exclusively on the need for the united states to continue to sacrifice its young men to defend the freedom and ideals of the western world why does he feel entitled to assign this noble yet bloody task solely to the u s without referring at all to the obligation of his own country to do the same dont the people of the netherlands also share americas belief in freedom of conscience are they and the other nations of europe not also obligated to sacrifice their precious sons to defend western ideals in the face of the islamofascist threat rather than preach to an american audience mr de winter should be rallying his own countrymen who have suffered only two military fatalities in iraq to date compared with precious american sons and daughters per icasualties org eugene kenny fairfield conn
