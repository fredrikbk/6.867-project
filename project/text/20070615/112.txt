weekend journal sports by the numbers golf gets downsized the world of sports is full of super size athletes who seem to be getting bigger every year offensive linemen can easily top feet inches and weigh in at pounds in the nba a foot inch small forward isnt all that unusual even womens tennis has its foot inch champs the notable exception golf the top golfers at the u s open which began yesterday are not only quite modest in size by the standards of professional athletes theyre shrinking the top golfers in the world golf rankings average just a hair over feet tall and weigh an average of just under pounds in the average of the top was just about feet one third inch tall and pounds and in the average was feet one half inch tall and pounds though the players may be smaller the power they put behind the ball is on the rise this year so far the average driving distance among the top was yards in it was and in it was only the exemplar of this trend is charles howell iii currently th in the world golf rankings and fifth in the pga tour points standings in terms of height mr howell is in the middle of the pack at feet inches tall and at pounds nearly pounds below the average he is downright lanky but his less than imposing physique doesnt keep mr howell from being a terror off the tee his average driving distance of yards places him eighth in the tour well ahead of phil mickelson and tiger woods this movement of many midsize golfers to the games top ranks goes against the grain of what many predicted it was expected that tournaments would be dominated by hitters with the firepower to reach the green in two strokes on each par five turning all but the longest courses into pitch and putts and a part of that expectation was that guys who could deliver that kind of force would be physically imposing while mr woods feet inch pounds and mr mickelson feet inches pounds the top two players in the world golf rankings are a bit taller and heavier than the average they hardly represent a trend in addition to mr howell the top includes such players as luke donald feet inches pounds sergio garcia feet inches pounds zach johnson feet inches pounds rory sabbatini feet inches pounds and trevor immelman feet inches pounds two trends have kept moderate sized golfers in the game club technology is much improved with mr howell an early adopter of the square headed drivers which increase distance and accuracy and training in the gym and the use of biomechanical analysis are helping to make the swings of these players faster and more efficient the other trend is the tigerproofing of courses a result of mr woodss domination of the sport in the late s while a few courses such as augusta national have increased their length significantly others such as pennsylvanias oakmont country club where the open is taking place have tried to control scoring in other ways yes oakmonts course will play almost yards longer than it did when the u s open was last played there in and won by big hitting ernie els but those extra yards are only the beginning architect tom fazio has returned the course to a links like layout similar to the original configuration it had in mr fazio removed at least trees and replaced them with unforgiving bunkers including an expansion of the "church pew" bunkers between the third and fourth holes these features play into the hands of a player like the feet inch k j choi third on the tour in sand save percentage combine these bunkers with some of golfs fastest most undulating greens and its clear that this u s open will be more than a long driving competition at oakmont the tournament will be won or lost near the hole which is now just one more reason to call it the short game
