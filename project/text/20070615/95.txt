the numbers guy it seems to exist but how to measure class gap in reading call it the reading income gap children from low income households average just hours of shared reading time with their parents before starting school compared with to hours for their counterparts from middle income homes these oft repeated numbers originate in a book by marilyn jager adams titled "beginning to read thinking and learning about print " ms adams got the hours estimate from a study of children in low income families for the middle income figures she extrapolated from the experience of a single child her then year old son john she laid out her calculations and sources carefully over five pages trying to make clear that she was demonstrating anecdotally the dramatic difference between the two groups in the years since then at least a half dozen child advocacy groups including united way kids in common and everybody wins have boiled down those five pages into a single sentence repeated in various forms often without attribution to the original source as is typical for such numbers the child reading stats have taken on a life of their own through a game of media telephone with news articles usually attributing the numbers to one of these advocacy groups or to various researchers or foundations that themselves got the numbers from the adams book "do bear in mind that perhaps the most frequent source for public infobytes is other public infobytes " says ms adams a cognitive psychologist and chief scientist for soliloquy learning a waltham mass company that creates software to help children learn to read for her book ms adams drew on a study by william teale and colleagues of low income families in southern california using his findings about reading time per child she extrapolated to their time before entering school and averaged the total prof teale who now teaches education at the university of illinois chicago says his findings couldnt be generalized to the overall population nor did he ever make that claim "we had way too small a sample " says ms adams today "how broadly representative it is i dont know " the middle income estimate came from ms adamss own experience with her son john by the time she was writing the chapter he was just shy of his fifth birthday and he had been read to at home for about to minutes a day since the age of six weeks extrapolating to a little over six years of reading before entering school john and similar children would get between and hours of reading time numbers ms adams rounded to and these numbers have since been applied to all middle income children thats akin to predicting that all young children from middle income families will graduate college with a degree in psychology and statistics as john now has done there are two reasons numbers like these can persevere in advocacy material first no major group opposes childhood reading or argues that children from low income households have a level playing field second the stat however shaky its foundation makes sense its a hard thing to measure and therefore hard to contradict and the figures meld with related research for example in the middle class chestnut hill area of philadelphia home of children susan neuman and donna celano counted about childrens literature titles for sale in stores for a study in low income kingsessing there were just titles for sale for children chestnut hills library had six times as many childrens books per child as kingsessings prof neuman a university of michigan professor of education and former u s assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education says she has used the adams stat in presentations to research audiences "i am always cautious when using these numbers " prof neuman says "at the same time there is at least evidence that some of this might be true " prof teale cites research showing that early reading accounts for about of variance among childrens reading achievement in later grades though he doesnt think his study can be applied to all poor children he says "a varied body of research" has exposed "vast differences" between the preschool reading experience of children from low income and middle income households the potential benefits to citing the questionable numbers are clear raise awareness and rally support the downsides are more subtle boiling down research into misleading soundbites risks credibility of the larger argument advocating early reading and it obscures other indicators that have equal or greater impact on a childs intellectual development todd risley professor emeritus of psychology at the university of alaska and longtime childrens development researcher argues that the amount and quality of parents talking to their young children is more significant "in even the best of families shared reading time occupies very little of a childs time " he says and income is a weak predictor of parental child chatter he adds "so any statements about middle class and low income might be a little too glib " email me at numbersguy wsj com
