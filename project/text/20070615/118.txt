popular with buyers nearly two years into the housing slowdown builders report that their top selling high end homes feature less conventional floor plans and more specialty rooms than previous models

appear bigger game rooms sun rooms and other special use spaces and smaller formal living rooms the best selling la jolla model by drees homes in fort mitchell ky puts the front door off to the side of the house instead of at the center which creates a slanted hallway to the main rooms bensalem pa based orleans homebuilders bradford grand ii twists the center staircase so it opens to the side rather than the front opening up the sightlines throughout the house "it gives the illusion of more space " says steve schoenewald a sales manager who paid &# for a bradford grand ii in mount laurel n j a little over a year ago sales of new single family homes overall dropped to one million in from the previous year according to the national association of home builders existing home sales in the same period fell to million sales of new construction dropped more dramatically because builders amassed bloated inventories during the boom and had trouble unloading them as the market slowed when it comes to price however builders of new homes are faring marginally better than sellers of existing homes although the first four months of this year were volatile according to the nahb the average change in new home prices was essentially flat up from the same period a year ago the median new home price in april was &# meanwhile the average change in existing home prices for the same period was down to &# in a tough market builders have the wherewithal to offer sizable incentives to reluctant buyers in essence offering more house for the same price so while some private home sellers are struggling to sweeten the deal with new refrigerators or flat screen television sets big builders are offering &# to &# of incentives in the form of finished basements sunrooms and expanded master suites according to the nahb of builders have offered such incentives so far this month compared with in september the month after the housing market hit its peak and because builders buy materials in bulk they can get better prices than a private seller on things like cabinets and appliances "theyve chewed down their subcontractors who are getting less than before the boom " says peter morici a business professor at the university of maryland in college park md that means builders can put in an upgraded kitchen for example more cheaply the best selling models in upscale subdivisions around the country range from about &# to &# million according to interviews with seven of the nations biggest builders drees and orleans as well as hovnanian enterprises red bank n j the sixth largest

companies accounted for homes built last year compared with two years ago when the housing market was at the height of the boom and the mcmansion trend was in full swing one emerging theme is particularly noteworthy the square footage of the current best sellers isnt getting bigger average lot sizes shrank in the years ended in to about square feet or a little more than a fifth of an acre according to the latest u s government statistics as a result some of the current best selling luxury models are designed for the sorts of long narrow lots that are increasingly the suburban norm david weekleys cartier plan introduced in february was designed for a lot only feet wide the model which costs from about &# to &# is offered with a choice of what the companys senior design manager bruce richards calls "throwback" facades traditional styles like victorian and craftsman but with space at a premium the interior of the square foot home breaks with tradition instead of a formal living room for example it comes with a study and sunroom both with angled walls that help keep the long floor plan from feeling boxy "its built to be casual " says mr richards says other builders have created smaller spinoffs of their most popular plans designed to fit on tighter lots kimball hill homes which built homes last year recently introduced the bristol model which at square feet is a smaller less pricey version of the square foot ultima still the companys best selling model since it was introduced in the four bedroom ultima sells for around &# throughout the midwest the floor plan which the company calls its "little black dress " is relatively square and spare and has been tweaked only a little over the years by doing such things as doubling the size of the pantry and turning strip closets in secondary bedrooms into walk ins but the plan is open and versatile and can be customized with numerous options and upgrades a fifth bedroom a guest suite or a game room can be added on the second floor by lowering the first floor family rooms high ceiling banker gina lombardi and sales manager anthony galizia bought an ultima months ago for &# in elgin ill and opted for the more open design they loaded up on options like crown moldings and arched doorways but didnt close off any spaces because they liked being able to keep an eye on their blended family of four children ages to "i can see where everybody is at all times " ms lombardi says some luxury builders are still appealing to buyers who want to live large toll brothers current top seller is the same as in the hampton a behemoth with four bedrooms baths his and hers toilets and a foot closet with a cathedral ceiling but even toll brothers has given up on the space race that characterized the housing boom at square feet the hampton is the same size as it was two years ago homes may not be getting bigger for the most part but that hasnt stopped builders from packing them with pantries and decks increasingly several of each john laings new best seller a square foot called plan that sells in the &# million range at ravenna in san clemente calif has two butlers pantries two decks with an option for a third and two fireplaces also with an option for a third orleanss bradford grand ii has two walk in closets and two optional bookcases in the master suite and four optional bay windows on the

" says jeffrey turner the architect who designed the plan reports of the death of the dining room predicted by design pundits for the last decade are greatly exaggerated even some of the smallest of the best sellers at the upper end of the spectrum have retained dining rooms such as david weekleys cartier and hovnanians square foot captiva a model designed for active adult communities that sells for about &# builders say buyers are demanding the rooms even if they dont use them brian and rebecca harvell like the square foot dining room in their bradford grand ii model by orleans which they bought in mount laurel in february even though they havent used the room yet and dont expect to do much formal entertaining they think its necessary to keep up the homes resale value "its what people expect " says ms harvell a stay at home mom with a year old daughter tiny breakfast nooks off the kitchen meanwhile not much bigger than square feet a decade ago have morphed into spacious "morning rooms" where most of the family meals take place in the harvells home the room is square feet nearly as big as the dining room once marketed as a luxurious upgrade sunrooms are now a standard feature in many builders top selling models more energy efficient windows have made it easier to create walls of glass without making the house cold and drafty builders say and opening up the outdoor views makes homes look bigger dreess la jolla model has a square foot sunroom off the breakfast room hovnanians hartford model the companys best seller in the northeast has both a sunroom at the back of the house and a conservatory off to the side both can be left off the plan if lots are tight the models base price is &# to &# million depending on location but in mendham n j where lots are at least an acre in size and buyers are well heeled the square foot conservatory is included as a standard feature research in other communities showed that of buyers wanted one so the company decided to include it to keep its homes competitive in a down market "people here expect a room thats big enough to put in a baby grand " says kelly higgins a community manager for the company
