sony tv stages a heavy online push learning from missteps in cable studio pursues web video ad dollars sony pictures television has long been a big player in u s tv making s hits such as "whos the boss " and contemporary cable shows "the shield" and "rescue me " but unlike most of its rivals it never succeeded in launching any major tv networks in the u s during the s and early s when rivals such as universal studios helped launch the usa and sci fi networks and warner bros started the wb sony sat on the sidelines by the time it woke up and launched the game show network in cable systems had little capacity left for new channels that meant sony largely missed out on sharing one of the major sources of revenue in u s television advertising now however with the web opening new opportunities for video distribution sony is determined not to stage a repeat performance the company has begun a heavy online push hoping to tap the exploding demand for online video advertising emarketer projects advertisers will spend some &# billion annually on online video ads by more than double the &# billion expected to be spent this year "our content helped build a lot of cable channels " says steve mosko president of sony pictures television and the executive charged with sonys u s digital distribution for both tv and film "were not going to let the same thing happen on the web " in coming days the sony corp studio will launch a broadband channel called the minisode network on news corp s myspace the site will feature old tv shows from sonys library such as "diffrent strokes" and "the partridge family" that have been shrunk to between three and five minutes in length the site will be sponsored by a series of national advertisers says mr mosko the launch of minisode network follows sonys premiere last week of the first of two original drama series on fearnet a web mobile and video on demand provider of horror themed video sony rolled out the service last year with comcast and lions gate entertainment fearnets web site attracted unique visitors in may according to comscore media metrix sony says the horror site averages unique visitors a month and streams about one million videos per month but sonys biggest digital initiative comes next month when the studio plans to unveil a dramatically revamped version of grouper a video sharing web site it bought last year for &# million the service will get a new name and look along with a robust set of new features such as themed channels with exclusive content the studio is also working to allow users to lift clips from tv shows and mix them with their own material to produce a new video sony faces plenty of competition googles youtube has already established a commanding lead the site says it streams hundreds of millions of videos every day while sony says its soon to be renamed grouper streams about million videos in a month meanwhile major new internet video services such as joost are on their way while rivals such as time warners warner bros and general electrics nbc universal are also pushing hard to establish an online presence "there are tons of people moving into the online video space and if anything sony needs to move a little faster if it wants to be a leader " says tracey scheppach senior vice president and video innovations director for publicis groupes starcom usa a media buying agency warner bros for instance has cut innovative deals to give local stations the right to stream episodes of syndicated shows on their web sites and has an extensive partnership with aol to stream episodes of shows from its library nbc universal has claimed space on the web for comedy dotcomedy com and gay themed programming outzonetv com and is preparing to launch a large video portal later this summer in partnership with news corp s fox sonys lack of a tv network affiliate gives it an advantage says mr mosko most companies that operate a paired network and studio such as walt disneys abc and abc television studio are trying to use the web to buttress their main network business while hoping not to cannibalize it in abcs case all of its shows are streamed through abc com sony though doesnt have to take into account how any deal might affect "the network side of the house " says mr mosko because sony has no network to promote it has the luxury of being able to evaluate each show independently to determine which distribution strategy makes the most financial sense analysts say it can cut both ways for instance when "til death " a comedy that the studio supplies to fox was floundering in the ratings earlier this year sony blitzed the web with promotional episodes to try and funnel viewers to the show conversely sony has opted to keep its biggest comedy property "seinfeld " off the web at least for now local stations have paid sony about &# billion for rights to rerun the series through and the studio doesnt want internet distribution to puncture prices when the syndication deals come up for renewal corrections &amp amplifications advertisers will spend &# billion annually on online video ads by up from &# million this year according to emarketer fridays advertising column incorrectly said emarketer projected online video ad spending would increase to &# billion by from &# billion this year wsj june
