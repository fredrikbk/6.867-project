that would make the buyout shops pay significantly higher taxes if they go public just in time for blackstone groups imminent &# billion initial public offering since the private equity firms are usually structured as private partnerships they have been paying taxes equivalent to of their profits under the baucus grassley proposal a publicly listed blackstone would have to adhere to the tax rate imposed on most corporations as the financial times explains "some businesses are crossing the line between reasonably lowering their tax burden and pretending to be something theyre not to avoid most if not all corporate taxes " mr grassley said the proposal is a culmination of what the wall street journal notes is "growing alarm" in washington about the lower tax rates enjoyed by the lucrative and in the past year or so omnivorous private equity groups people involved in the blackstone ipo tell the journal the proposal probably wont derail the offering even as it makes a valuation of the firm harder to judge one person involved in underwriting the deal said it could cut blackstones &# billion valuation by as much as the "bipartisan nature of the bill moreover carried real

will actually go the recent surge in interest rates may dim the prospects for much greater buyout firm buying though that may be offset by the sea of chinese and russian cash now seeking high yield investments and the times says private equity firms lobbyists have been working with members of the senate finance committee and that support beyond the chairman and ranking minority member isnt clear moreover the times says "with the election cycle heating up and private equity and hedge funds becoming increasingly important donors congress may be reluctant to jeopardize a potential honey pot of
