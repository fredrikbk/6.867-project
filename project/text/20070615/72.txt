politics &amp economics north korea transfer raises hope release of funds may spur closure of nuclear program the release of frozen north korean funds is raising hopes pyongyang will begin dismantling its nuclear program as part of a broader rapprochement with washington the coming weeks will be crucial to seeing whether kim jong ils regime plans to honor its february pledge to shut down its nuclear reactor at yongbyon and move forward with other disarmament commitments u s officials said washingtons top negotiator with pyongyang assistant secretary of state christopher hill hopes to return to beijing as early as next week to resume six party talks that could result in north korea giving up its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic assistance from the u s and other countries in march the u s treasury department formally blacklisted banco delta asia in macau for its alleged involvement in aiding north korean illicit activities a charge the bank has denied the ruling prevented all u s banks or companies from conducting any financial transactions with bda as part of the crackdown macau authorities froze &# million deposited in north korean accounts after depositors initiated a run on bda in late the u s subsequently agreed to help facilitate the return of the funds to north korea as part of the denuclearization agreement but the transfer stalled after many international banks in asia and the u s declined to accept the money for fear of running afoul of treasurys antimoney laundering regulations yesterday bda successfully transferred &# million of the funds via the federal reserve bank of new york and russias central bank people familiar with the transaction said the money was expected to be deposited at a north korean controlled account at a small private russian bank far east commercial bank the faceoff over the bda case and frozen north korean funds is likely to spark debate within u s foreign policy circles on the wisdom of using "smart sanctions" to deter rogue regimes from trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction the treasury department has cited the bda action as a potential model for future u s actions arguing it essentially froze north korea out of the international banking system "the effect on north korea has been significant because even the most reclusive regime depends on access to the international financial system " treasury secretary henry paulson said in new york yesterday he argued that similar tools would be effective in combating iran and its alleged attempts to acquire nuclear weapons but some u s diplomats working on north korea said the lack of coordination between the state and treasury departments over the bda issue undercut the disarmament talks for months critics of the white house also argue that the bush administration relinquishes one of its most important leverages against mr kim by returning the north korean funds meanwhile china has been pushing for the u s to lift the blacklist designation from bda because of concerns that it could affect macaus role as a regional financial and gambling center if the bush administration agrees such a move could open it to more criticism to facilitate the funds transfer yesterday u s officials provided guarantees to moscow that no actions would be taken against any russian financial institutions assisting bda said officials familiar with the plan treasury officials also decided they could use the federal reserve bank of new york as it wasnt bound by the march sanctions on bda "basically all of it has been transferred for macau this incident has come to a conclusion " macaus government said macanese monetary authorities didnt specify whether the other &# million had been released to north korea through other channels or was going to remain deposited in bda some diplomats worried pyongyang could potentially cite the &# million not yet released as an excuse not to move forward on its part of the agreement u s officials said they hope north korea will acknowledge its reception of the funds through its state owned news service such official recognition could allow the six party talks to move forward on implementing the critical elements of the february denuclearization agreement besides the u s and north korea the other parties involved in the talks are china south korea japan and russia the next step in the agreement would be for north korea to formally shutter its yongbyon reactor and allow the return of inspectors from the international atomic energy agency in return the u s south korea and other parties would ship metric tons of heavy fuel oil to pyongyang in the next phase north korea is required to provide evidence on all of its other nuclear activities including an alleged uranium enrichment program in return for an additional metric tons of heavy fuel many u s diplomats hope the six party talks can serve as the basis for building a lasting peace on the korean peninsula and potentially lead to the signing of an armistice by the u s north korea and south korea formally ending the korean war "were trying this on a step by step basis " mr hill said last week in an interview on c span "weve got a long road ahead of us thats very difficult and as you can see weve been held up for a long time over &# million in macau "
