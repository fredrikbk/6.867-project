after year exile an elusive torero returns to the ring protesters fans await spains second coming what the statue faces on sunday in barcelona jose tomas will do battle with two bulls hundreds of protesters and the crushing weight of his own legend a decade ago as a year old matador mr tomas gave bullfighting a hero when the field was badly depleted crowds once again began to fill the arenas to catch a glimpse of his pure unadorned style and frequent brushes with death then in just as suddenly as he emerged he vanished going into a self imposed five year exile now his followers hope that his return dubbed by some in spain the "second coming " will again save bullfighting from a growing chorus of critics the showdown has made barcelona officially an antibullfighting town the center of the taurine universe if only for a day scalpers are asking more than &# for tickets the fans from a dozen countries who will squeeze into the plaza monumental will witness the most anticipated bullfight in a generation and the latest answer to a five century old question is bullfighting art or torture mr tomas a lithe quiet year old with curly black hair now shot through with gray and a latticework of scars is an unlikely savior for bullfighting during his brief career he fought with promoters refused to perform as frequently as his peers did and made enemies with the bullfighting establishment in the bullring however he was unparalleled he was called "the statue" for the way he drilled his feet into the sand impervious to the onrushing bull and some called him "the extraterrestrial " for his ability to endure pain and survive potentially lethal mishaps he once fought for two hours with a goring in his thigh before he asked for medical help on another occasion after he had been gored during a crucial fight in seville doctors thought he was dying because his pulse was only "courage is easy to define " said veteran bullfighter and amateur poet luis francisco espla "its where jose tomas stands in the bullring " before he turned mr tomas was compared with juan belmonte and manolete two other legendary bullfighters famous during the first and second world wars like belmonte and manolete mr tomas won followers among spains intellectuals as well as regular fans today tomasista applies equally to disciples of st thomas aquinas and mr tomas "so many other matadors belong more to sports or the circus " says albert boadella spains best known playwright and a longtime fan of mr tomas "he belongs only to the realm of art " in late at the height of his fame mr tomas quit years later in a newspaper interview he confessed that the constant fear of dying in the ring his never ending battles with bullfight promoters and his efforts to please increasingly demanding crowds had become too stressful mr tomas grew a beard ditched his cellphone and played semipro soccer for a year spains "fiesta nacional" was orphaned "he left a big empty crater in bullfighting when he quit and a lot of people still havent forgiven him for it " says paco aguado a bullfight historian the myth he had created in his five years in the bullring became much bigger in the five years he was gone he dropped out of sight people reported spotting him a la elvis as far away as mexico rumors flew that he was training every day on rural bull ranches preparing for a comeback that never came secrecy surrounded everything he did he refused to let strangers watch him practice he declined to be interviewed for this article his five year absence handed bullfightings opponents a perfect opportunity to ratchet up their fight to outlaw the spectacle in which the bull nearly always is killed without a hero of his stature to rally around bullfighting reeled from attacks by increasingly vocal critics bent on prohibiting it now his return has become as much a cause celebre for bullfightings detractors as for its aficionados barcelona is the city where mr tomas enjoyed some of his most celebrated victories but it is also the most hostile city in spain to bullfighting pro independence politicians in catalonia in northeastern spain have tried to ban it calling it inhumane even though barcelona the catalan capital hosted more bullfights in the th century than any other city on earth two of barcelonas three bullrings have already been gutted one of them is being turned into a shopping center mr tomass decision to make his comeback in barcelona is "a poke in the eye to the antibullfighting crowd " says his manager salvador boix sunday will mark the first sellout in barcelona in more than years bullfighting has been banned before by popes spanish kings and even dictators but it has always battled on its opponents feel that they may be on the verge of banning it forever after years of failed efforts the european parliament voted to cut subsidies to ranchers who raise fighting bulls in late this spring a vote to declare bullfighting animal torture narrowly failed in strasbourg the cultural arm of the united nations unesco still defines bullfighting as torture despite years of lobbying by bullfight supporters and bullfightings once secure place as the pastime of the masses has been usurped by soccer video games and other diversions every year its core fans grow older this weekend hundreds of antibullfight activists plan to mass outside the arena in barcelona a french group the alliance for the suppression of the bullfight is busing in protesters but mr tomass biggest enemy wont be the raucous protesters the two sharp horned fighting bulls waiting in the corrals beneath the plaza or the two other matadors on the ticket when he was in his prime mr tomas always trod the most dangerous ground in bullfighting on his return fans will settle for nothing less even if it kills him "to live without toreo is not to live at all " he said in a rare interview with the spanish paper el pais explaining his comeback "people are going to see not just the bullfighter but the myth he created " says mr aguado "his only true rival and by far the most dangerous is the old jose tomas " says luis abril an executive with telefonica sa who used to follow mr tomas to scores of bullfights each year when mr tomas retired mr abril retired as a fan but on sunday hell be in barcelona ready to give mr tomas and bullfighting one last chance
