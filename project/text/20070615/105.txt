weekend journal honey i wrecked the porsche fast powerful and out of control jennifer saranow on why some drivers are finding their new cars too hot to handle call it a metaphor for a prosperous risk embracing age or just call it bad driving auto makers are turning out a new breed of supremely fast sports cars that sell for upwards of &# and share many characteristics of purebred racecars but as more of them hit the road often in the hands of inexperienced drivers a growing number are ending up wrapped around trees smashed into guardrails or otherwise totaled in accidents in the past months drivers across the world have cracked up at least six rare &# million ferrari enzos only of which were built in march a california man rammed his &# lamborghini murcielago into five parked cars while in england a year old driver caused an international stir among car enthusiasts by crashing a bugatti veyron an extremely rare &# million turbocharged missile with a top speed of miles per hour its not just drunken celebrities doing the damage on the way to an m b a class near san diego one recent morning nasar aboubakare a year old private equity firm president lost control of his new horsepower ford gt and wrenched it over a lane divider "the car is like a wild animal " he says to compound matters its tough to be inconspicuous when you damage a &# automobile after mr aboubakares accident several passing motorists snapped pictures while one leaned out the window of his pickup truck and shouted "what an idiot " police in wealthy enclaves across the country say these accidents are not unusual a spokesman for the beverly hills police department says his officers "regularly" handle accidents involving exotic vehicles while sgt jeffrey kelly from boca raton fla says his department has logged two ferrari crashes in the past two years "weve had our fair share " he says according to the california highway patrol the total number of accidents involving aston martins bentleys ferraris lamborghinis lotuses and maseratis rose to last year an increase from while overall crashes declined statewide during that period porsche bmw and mercedes benz which sell a wider range of models saw a increase during that time frame these accidents are happening so regularly that a web site called wreckedexotics com which contains photos of dream cars reduced to smoking heaps added as many as new examples to its gallery last year and says it attracts about visitors a month founder gregg fidan explains the attraction this way "its like seeing a supermodel fall off the runway " one reason for the increase is that there are simply more of these so called "supercars" on the road cnw marketing research a firm that analyzes the auto market says americans bought about "ultra luxury" sports cars last year more than three times the number from while the number of supercars registered in california is up sharply the rate at which they are getting into accidents is still small just over and hasnt changed appreciably since the state began breaking data down by make in the statewide accident rate for all vehicles was stefan winkelmann president and chief executive officer of lamborghini a unit of volkswagens audi group says hes aware of "four or five" incidents involving one of the companys new horsepower murcielagos a small fraction of the nearly models the company sold last year toscan bennett a spokesman for ferrari a unit of fiat group says the company does not track the number of accidents involving its cars but adds that several high profile incidents may have contributed to a false impression that these crashes are common auto makers say the rising horsepower is being offset by safety advancements ranging from all wheel drive to ceramic brakes rear view cameras extra airbags and monocoque safety cages that direct impact forces away from passengers "the cars give themselves up for the safety of the driver " says porsche spokesman tony fouladpour many supercars come with traction and stability control systems that automatically vary the power delivered to the wheels to help prevent drivers from sliding and skidding insurance companies say that while the majority of supercar accidents do not result in serious injuries there has been an uptick in collision claims on these cars in some cases rates are rising based on the rising cost of claims state farm says the same driver would have paid more last year to buy physical damage insurance for a new lamborghini murcielago than in expensive sports cars have always been intimidatingly fast but experts say the latest models are not just more powerful theyre also lighter ferraris new gtb fiorano produces about horsepower per pound a improvement over the model it replaced the trouble begins when overconfident drivers start trying to push the cars to speeds that even experienced drivers may not be capable of handling "generally speaking the cars are well over the heads of the drivers " says glenn roberts the owner of an auto body shop in fountain hills ariz that repairs damaged exotic cars the people buying these cars are also changing unlike previous supercar collectors who often babied their machines they tend to drive about to miles per year more than double the average from a decade ago and theyre not getting any more mature the median age for ultra luxury sports car buyers dropped to last year from an average of just years ago according to cnw and you dont have to be an actuary to know that younger people are more likely to drive aggressively a spokeswoman for leland west insurance brokers says most of the supercar claims the company handles each year involve men aged to driving newer high performance cars too fast and losing control adnan k mehmood a year old fabric importer and stock trader from miami counts himself among those who dont believe a high performance car should be pampered he says he has driven his lamborghini murcielago roadster faster than mph a number of times on freeways mr mehmood says its the engineering that gives him the confidence to go that fast "when you are in the car its so stable " he says "its such a controllable speed in a normal car when you are going or it feels like you are going really really fast in the lambo you are going or and honestly it feels like its stopped on the freeway it feels like its not moving " he is awaiting delivery of lamborghinis new murcielago lp roadster which has an extra horsepower and a new suspension design that will help make it one of the fastest cars the company has ever built traveling up to mph and from to in seconds "i want to go to mph " mr mehmood says veteran sports car connoisseur michael fux says he has a pretty good idea why all these crashes are happening the year old mattress entrepreneur from miami whose collection includes a bugatti veyron a ferrari an enzo and five lamborghinis says younger drivers are constantly challenging him to race "these kids they dont use their heads " he says "they think theyre back in the old wild west " driving experts say most accidents in these cars happen when drivers take turns too fast for the road conditions or start turning prematurely and then snap off the accelerator to compensate if the cars back end starts to fishtail many inexperienced drivers will fail to steer in the direction of the sliding tail or will overcorrect by turning too severely in that direction both mistakes can cause a spin "its a symphony of inputs and adjustments to keep the car under control " says david champion senior director of consumer reports auto test division for anthony almada a year old nutritional biochemist and entrepreneur from dana point calif the catalyst was a deceivingly slick road while driving his &# porsche carrera gt on a bend near his home at miles per hour on a slightly wet road early last year he says the car snapped into a spin he followed the procedure hed been taught in driving class and "put both feet in" pressing down on the brake and the clutch at the same time and hoped for the best the car broadsided a brick wall and spun at least six times and caught fire "it wasnt something i could have corrected " says mr almada who climbed out unhurt "i was going too fast for the road conditions its that simple " another common mistake failing to warm up the tires standing inside his garage last month at classic coach repair in elizabeth n j owner onofrio triarsi points out two damaged ferraris a red that needs a new quarter panel and bumper and a blue maranello with similar damage both cars had been taken out on racetracks on cold mornings by drivers who had not given the tires enough time to heat up and thus adhere better to the asphalt when customers drive off now mr triarsi leaves them with the same advice "dont forget the tires " in some cases drivers say they got into trouble after shutting off the cars traction control system to get a more "authentic" sports car experience during a test for car and driver last spring in italy technical editor aaron robinson flicked off the electronic stability control in a horsepower ferrari gtb fiorano so he could get the vehicles rear end to flare out around a curve for a photo but after giving the car "too much throttle and not enough core steering " he says he wound up sideswiping a wall "any car with horsepower is intimidating " mr robinson says many of these accidents are of course just examples of pure recklessness the bugatti veyron owner who crashed in surrey england this year was said to be traveling at least mph on a country lane before colliding with a station wagon he was cited by police for driving "without due care and attention " the year old who crashed his lamborghini into five parked cars in santa monica calif in march was reportedly racing at mph around a mph curve he was charged with driving under the influence you dont have to buy one of these cars to trash one either new yorks gotham dream cars one of a growing number of companies that allow people to rent supercars for the day says about one in of its rentals comes back damaged speed isnt always the culprit because of their odd dimensions and miniscule ground clearance supercars have always been vulnerable to damage from curbs speed bumps or even objects in the road while driving his yellow ferrari enzo for only the third time ali haas a year old plastic surgeon from florida ran over a spool of wire on the road in most cars this would have been a nonevent but in this case the low slung ferrari was knocked airborne breaking its grip on the road and sending it skidding into a guardrail "if i ran over that spool of wire in my ford expedition probably nothing would have happened " mr haas says regardless of the cause anyone who wrecks one of these cars has a more immediate problem than finding a mechanic the possibility of public humiliation after smashing his silver ferrari into a light pole in november in palm beach fla david riggs says none of the or so onlookers who stopped to gawk asked him if he was ok instead the year old says he heard comments like "wow you are really having a bad day " "that is really a bummer " and "your toy is broke " "nobody is really concerned if you are hurt " mr riggs says car companies say they do what they can to make sure their most powerful vehicles get into the hands of experienced drivers buyers of ferrari limited production cars like the enzo "were chosen by the factory based on their history and loyalty to ferrari " says the spokesman mr bennett manufacturers are also rolling out driver education programs later this year bugatti plans to start offering buyers a "security driving course" at a test track near its factory in france ferrari has offered driver training in italy since the early s and just opened the first authorized school outside italy last year in mt tremblant canada lamborghini started offering winter and summer driving academies last year formalizing classes long offered by dealers bentley offered its first driving class in the u s last year and lotus is launching a driving school in the u s this month called the lotus performance driving experience outside las vegas that will include instruction in "the dynamics of skid control " one recent driving school graduate mr aboubakare the private equity company president who spun out his ford gt he hopes to be better equipped to drive the new lamborghini murcielago lp roadster he is getting later this summer "i think with training im a little more equipped to drive the car " he says for auto makers the horsepower binge is continuing to accelerate even in an era of high gas prices some like audi and lexus are building or testing new supercar designs the chevrolet corvette z packs horsepower and ford recently introduced a &# mustang with horsepower theres no sign people are less interested in speeding either movies like "the fast and the furious" and "redline" have glamourized the notion of driving fast on public roads while drivers have been using sites like youtube to post videos of themselves making flamboyant maneuvers mix in the growing number of supercars their soaring horsepower and the increasing number of states raising speed limits and "we have almost the perfect storm going on here " says adrian lund president of the insurance institute for highway safety standing in his garage on a sunday morning last month mr almada pulls out whats left of his beloved porsche carrera gt one severed headlight and one rear wheel tire and brake assembly finally from a shelf he built to hold surfboards he pulls down his last keepsake the cars badly scraped carbon fiber wing he stares at it for a few moments then gently lays it down "its like the memento of a family member who passed away " he says
