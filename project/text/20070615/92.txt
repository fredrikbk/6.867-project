the daily fix spurs brush aside cavs to reclaim nba title online edition in the last years only four nba teams have won four titles in a decade john havliceks boston celtics magic johnsons los angeles lakers michael jordans chicago bulls and tim duncans san antonio spurs mr duncan finals mvp tony parker and game high scorer manu ginobili led the spurs to an defeat of the cleveland cavaliers to complete a sweep bill russell also played for a couple of those celtics champions ed during their run of four titles in nine years the spurs have never repeated as champions but they have shown resilience and determination in returning to the top "the spurs know better than anybody what they must do on the floor and no team is hungrier to do it " ian thomsen writes on si com "the former quality is to be expected of the leagues most experienced contenders the latter is breathtaking down the stretch they recovered the long rebounds and loose balls to control the final five minutes instead of relaxing with a series lead they came in more determined than their opponent to conclude what theyd started " those final five minutes included a remarkable stretch of in which san antonio retained possession tired out the cavs and finished with a three point play san antonios sustained excellence can be explained by the easy integration of michael finley the erstwhile prolific scorer who became a team player in san antonio and won his first title "eventually he learned what guys such as jerome kersey kevin willis danny ferry and steve smith learned before him " mike finger writes in the san antonio express news "when youre a veteran who comes to the spurs in search of your first championship you dont have to do much more than buy into the system and blend in finley admits now he didnt realize exactly how that would work when he chose the spurs over phoenix and miami he didnt know then what it would be like to be a teams fourth or fifth offensive option he didnt know how tough it would be to learn to play defense for gregg popovich and he had no idea hed be able to shoot of over the course of the nba finals and still clutch the lawrence obrien trophy " it helps to play against clearly inferior opponents which the spurs have faced in three of their four finals appearances the knicks the nets and the cavs "one of the worst teams to qualify for the championship round " mitch lawrence writes in the new york daily news recent decades conference imbalance which once tilted east but has shifted west helps explain why there have been twice as many sweeps four as game sevens in the last nba finals san antonios superiority was most evident in the final two games of this series when the spurs couldnt score but didnt lose lebron james whose son bryce maximus james was born hours before game shot of last night and his teammates couldnt help much "james missed of shots in the middle quarters " bill livingston writes in the cleveland plain dealer "this was when the spurs were waiting to be beaten but the cavs could not oblige them the jumpers the spurs dared james to take he took reluctantly once james threw a third quarter entry pass to zydrunas ilgauskas who was double teamed by bruce bowen james principal defender z kicked it back out to james standing by his lonesome inside the point arc james then re posted the ball to z as bowen again doubled him teams double off a shooter who has no confidence someone who cannot hurt them " lebron was hampered by the lack of consistent help from his point guards a factor that helped mr parker excel as san antonio express news columnist buck harvey points out but the lack of a challenge at the point doesnt diminish mr parkers achievement john p lopez writes in the houston chronicle "parkers turnovers are down now he has leadership and toughness he didnt have before now parker is the reason the oldest most experienced team in the nba must be considered among the nba dynasties and still could have another title or two left in them " kansas city star columnist jason whitlock wont label the spurs a dynasty nor place them in the company of the aforementioned celtics lakers and bulls "why dont the spurs connect why were these finals a tv ratings disaster and a challenge to watch " mr whitlock writes "because sports fans arent stupid they can sniff an impostor even when we in the media try to convince them otherwise " he adds "its difficult to stake a dynasty claim when youve just completed the worst nba finals series in history " the series looked a lot prettier to spurs blogger matthew powell in his exultant post on pounding the rock mr powell declares "i love this team " and by the time hes repeated the word "love" times you might feel the same way many cavs fans still feel that way about their team a surprise finalist "the nba finals experience was hardly cruel to the city of cleveland " true hoop blogger henry abbott writes on espn com "these fans were not broken there were plenty of smiles even if they were a tad weary body language was positive it was an aw shucks moment not a prozac moment " but expectations will be higher next year bud shaw writes in the cleveland plain dealer "getting swept wont do the next time around not un less the every years grind continues unless the next appearance is in and the feel good story of the team is the aging bryce maximus james trying to accomplish what his dad never did there wont be an appreciation for just having arrived in the nba finals " oakmont was surprisingly kind to its guests thursday as the u s open began the course was designed tough but rain before play began helped golfers overcome the toughest challenges first round leader nick dougherty even managed to come into the clubhouse at two under par "trust us the winces cringes and groans are on their way with the threat of some keening a distinct possibility " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "oakmont was kind thursday or as kind as its ever going to be a hard rain wednesday softened the greens when the sun comes out the temperature rises and the greens get linoleum hard in the next few days there wont be much cheering
