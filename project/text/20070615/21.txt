congress loves coal the senate is debating another energy bill and the direct cost to the government is already estimated at between &# billion and &# billion over years in subsidies tax preferences and loan guarantees most of it will go to "alternative" energy but now the countrys cheapest and most abundant source of normal energy coal is also sidling up to this federal trough is this what the global warmists had in mind the new political enthusiasm for coal rests on something called coal to liquid technology or ctl which converts coal into a diesel like fuel that can be used for transportation ctl is part of president bushs " in " initiative which aims to cut gasoline consumption by over the next years the air force is also pursuing a program that would use almost a billion gallons a year of coal based jet fuel ctl enjoys significant support in congress mostly if not surprisingly from coal mining states the bipartisan lineup includes house democrats nick rahall of west virginia the no coal producing state in and rick boucher of virginia no in the senate support comes from republicans mike enzi of wyoming no and jim bunning of kentucky no plus global warming true believer barack obama of illinois no amendments to be offered on the senate floor include &# billion in construction loans for building ctl plants guaranteed price floors for the new fuel if oil drops below &# a barrel and a tax credit of cents per gallon coal fired utilities currently produce some of electricity in the u s and mostly because of the animus against nuclear power we use about three times as much coal as we did in the early s given coals usefulness and the lack of workable large scale alternatives nuclear aside any difficulties facing the industry are artificial which is to say political pressure for increased regulation including moratoriums on new plants environmentalists deride coal as "filthy" for its various pollutants though these are controlled by modern technology and for the co emissions that are said to contribute to climate change therein lies a not so small irony on alternative fuels the global warmists usually make common cause with those who believe the u s must become "energy independent " thus the heap of money being shoveled into corn ethanol and other more fantastic schemes like "biofuels " but the goals of the two coalitions are often in tension if not outright contradiction ctl by itself will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at worst doubles the carbon emissions volume over petroleum proponents point to carbon sequestration systems which capture the gas produced by combustion and then bury it in aquifers or spent oil fields but even this would only keep the carbon status quo its also extremely expensive the best sequestration programs could remove up to of co but add about to the costs according to an authoritative mit study the capital costs for a new plant are estimated at between &# billion and &# billion and perhaps higher because sequestration projects are years away from a working pilot phase so making ctl viable requires a great deal of taxpayer that is your money dont get us wrong in theory this coal technology has much to recommend it it could conceivably replace oil or gasoline without sweeping changes to the countrys pipeline and transportation infrastructure it has been in use since the early th century and actually works unlike many energy "alternatives" though not yet on a commercial scale theres no shortage of capital for such ventures but in another irony private investment has been hindered by uncertainty over the carbon control measures that might be coming from congress supporters of subsidies claim the private sector will never finance "transformational" research into "clean" energy because of the risks high upfront costs and long delays for a return on investments but the private sector has also produced many incremental energy improvements such an approach beats sinking untold taxpayer dollars into unproven technologies on that note the federal government has for over years supported r&amp d on advanced coal technologies ctl was a major component of jimmy carters synthetic fuels corporation albatross which wasted billions of dollars before it was shut down in the bush administration established a &# billion sequestration research program called "futuregen" some call it "nevergen" because of its glacial progress the coal to liquid subsidy rush is one more sign that taxpayers will be the biggest losers in our current energy panic our politicians will even subsidize carbon emitting coal in the name of reducing dependence on carbon emitting but unsubsidized oil the "alternative" fuels campaign is on its way to becoming the biggest corporate welfare scheme in u s history see related letter "letters to the editor coal to liquid fuels clean and affordable" wsj june
