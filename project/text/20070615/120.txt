weekend journal the wealth report getting them all saying goodbye collector of rolls royces completes set plans sale with proceeds to charity richard j solove spent years and millions of dollars on a singular obsession owning a model of every rolls royce silver ghost produced from to now just months after completing the collection mr solove is reaching for his next dream selling all the cars at auction "ill have to bring along a big box of tissues to the auction " the year old real estate developer from columbus ohio says "but people who know me understand why im selling them " the answer lies in mr soloves commitment to a local charity and in the peculiar psychology of conspicuous collecting the collection of rolls royces believed to be unique is scheduled to be sold in august at gooding &amp co s annual concours delegance auto auction in pebble beach calif auto fans prize silver ghosts among the first rolls royces ever built mr soloves cars "are in incredible shape " says bob austin spokesman for rolls royce motorcars north america a unit of bmw group "you can eat off of them and they all run " the collection will almost certainly be broken up because different collectors are interested in different cars in all the nine cars plus five more antiques hes selling are expected to fetch between &# million and &# million but with the auto collecting market on a tear antique cars are favored by the ever growing set of new millionaires and billionaires the lot could fetch far more last year the auction racked up sales of &# million up from &# million in this years auction is expected to fetch at least &# million the auction included the sale of a duesenberg for &# million and a bugatti type c grand prix car for &# million "were seeing all the old collectors remain active and new collectors coming onto the market " says david gooding president and founder of the santa monica calif firm running the auction but mr solove isnt in it for the profit hes selling to raise money for his favorite charity the arthur g james cancer hospital and richard j solove research institute at the ohio state university medical center the collector whose father died of thyroid cancer in the s has already given &# million to the institute mr solove says he planned to leave the cars to the hospital in his will but he realized it wouldnt have his expertise in the cars and therefore might not raise as much from their sale he decided that giving away the cars to a worthy cause was more important than owning them "no ones going to remember me for having real estate or a collection of cars " he says "the true legacy will be what ive done to help eradicate cancer " a factory workers son mr solove grew up in depression era ohio and worshipped the packards and rolls royces he would occasionally see gliding down the streets he launched a chain of pharmacies sold the business and bought his first rolls royce in a model which he found in a garage in newark n j the paint was peeling and the springs poked out of the seats but mr solove agreed to buy the car for &# and spent two years and &# to restore it "thats when i got the bug " he says he then launched his pursuit for the holy grail of rolls collecting owning a model of each of the first rolls royce branded cars ever produced the silver ghosts from to in the company replaced the silver ghost with the phantom mr soloves journey took him to a farm pasture in indias punjab state where he found a silver ghost four door convertible once owned by a maharaja since the car was more than years old and therefore couldnt be directly shipped out of india because of antiquities laws mr solove had it driven to pakistan and then shipped by boat to england where it was restored before its voyage to the u s the total cost was "hundreds of thousands of dollars " he says another prize was the model a limousine called the "corgi " rolls built only one even the toy model of the car has become a hot collectors item among rolls enthusiasts in the s mr solove learned that a wealthy briton terry kahn kept one of the cars at his country estate mr solove recalls "when he opened the garage door and i saw the car i said oh my god " mr solove pried it loose for &# million and spent another &# to have it restored the model proved especially elusive mr solove finally found one silver colored with a green leather interior at a scottish car museum but it refused to sell for years in the late s the museum experienced financial difficulties and mr solove bought the car at auction for &# million various owners modified their silver ghosts for their needs a model also owned by a maharaja has an umbrella attached to the back to shade his bodyguards and the silver ghost balloon roadster has a container in the back where its first owner rolls royce co founder charles rolls stored his hot air balloon the last piece of the puzzle was the model only four exist and mr solove tried for years to find one for sale finally he made a plea in a rolls royce collectors magazine and heard back from a reader an irish carpet salesman had a model that he had just driven across australia and might be willing to sell mr solove bought the car in february for more than &# million he garages most of the cars at his winter home in naples fla "theyre like my second set of children " the collector says and while mr solove says he will shed plenty of tears during the auction collection experts say his decision to sell isnt unusual "for these people building a collection is like climbing mount everest
