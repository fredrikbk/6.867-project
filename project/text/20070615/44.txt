itcs need to protect intellectual property your june editorial "chips ahoy" does a disservice to the u s international trade commission by portraying it as a bureaucracy that "covets vast new leverage over american industry " in the case involving broadcom and qualcomm the itc found that qualcomms baseband processor chips infringe several of broadcoms patents surely the journal can understand the need to protect this u s intellectual property the issue with which the itc is struggling mightily is the form of relief to give to broadcom in instances involving downstream products that use infringing chips the itc seeks principally to balance its statutory mandate to provide full relief to the patent holder against the potential disruption to third parties affected by an order covering the downstream product in this case cell phones having spent years in various capacities at the itc before leaving for private practice and knowing several itc commissioners i have no doubt that their decision has little to do with expanding their turf and everything to do with reaching a fair and equitable resolution that strikes a balance between protecting the rights of a u s patent owner while minimizing the harm to u s commerce i have every confidence that the decision will be based upon hours of analysis by the itc staff and the commissioners and will be backed by a genuine desire to serve well the public and the u s economy jay reiziss bryan cave llp washington
