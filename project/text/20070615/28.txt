danones china strategy is set back dispute with venture partner highlights the risks of not going it alone more than most companies frances groupe danone sa has trusted homegrown entrepreneurs to spread its food and beverages around the world but that strategy is being called into question amid a public battle between the maker of yogurt beverages and cookies and one of its key partners in china danone says its joint venture partner for the past decade the multimillionaire entrepreneur zong qinghou has cut it out of more than &# million of revenue mr zong did so danone says through a network of bottling plants and wholesalers that makes many of the same soft drinks the two sides have produced together since under the name wahaha one of chinas best known brands mr zong who founded wahaha and has always run the operations though legally he controls only doesnt deny he also owns a separate business that in many ways mirrors the operations set up with danone but he says the issues are more complex than brand piracy in fact mr zong is casting doubt on his french partners continued use of the wahaha name one of just four brand names the maker of danone yogurt and evian water says generate of its global sales he held a news conference earlier this week and suggested he is ready to compete with danone speaking under a banner that read "firmly resist the hostile takeover by danone the final triumph must belong to wahaha " for the time being the two partners are stuck in an uncomfortable relationship as both sides say protecting the wahaha brand is paramount and selling is out of the question but the case is a blow to danones strategy of piggybacking into new markets partnering with a local business promises a foreign entrant like danone a quicker and cheaper way to penetrate a market with wahaha danone claimed of chinas bottled water market last year and was the biggest beverage maker by volume overall in the country beating out competitors like coca cola co rival consumer product companies have traditionally employed the slower more expensive go it alone route these days nearly five times as much foreign direct investment comes into china in the form of stand alone efforts as comes in for joint ventures last year the amount for wholly owned ventures totaled about &# billion compared with &# billion for joint ventures according to chinese numbers several big brand companies including procter &amp gamble co and starbucks corp have bought their way out of some joint venture partnerships in china unilever which once had joint ventures in china has gradually bought them out since several years ago the owner of the dove soap lipton tea and ben &amp jerrys ice cream brands took full control over its chinese operations yet for paris based danone which is smaller than rivals like p&amp g nestle sa or kraft foods inc joint ventures have let it move faster and further afield in the past two years danone has agreed to enter seven new ventures around the world including a deal last year that gives it of a milk venture with china mengniu dairy co laurent sacchi danone spokesman said it needed to use joint ventures because it lacked the management depth and size to grow quickly particularly in fast growing emerging markets "if we now have of our sales in emerging markets and we built this in only years its thanks to this specific tactic " he says "we have problems with wahaha but we prefer to have problems with wahaha now to not having had wahaha at all for the last years " he says wahaha is the only joint venture in which danone management isnt heavily involved danones stake in the joint ventures that make and sell wahaha products in china suggests it has power but danone concedes it traditionally let mr zong call the shots the dispute pits a chain smoking mr zong years old who built one of chinas true national brands against a rising star at danone its year old asia president emmanuel faber the men have known each other for years but bridging gaps is difficult partly because they need interpreters to negotiate each has dug in his heels in claiming rightful ownership of the wahaha brand communist party member mr zong cloaks his claims in nationalistic tones while mr faber has emphasized contractual obligations the case is emerging as a big test for mr faber an executive who has had a direct hand in pushing danones expansion through joint ventures first as global head of strategy and then chief financial officer for six years he was dispatched to shanghai in months after danone picked up hints of a problem in the relationship with mr zong mr faber concedes that danone did "take a risk" by giving mr zong a "unique" degree of autonomy he said it was out of deference to mr zongs record "he operates in a very entrepreneurial way making a lot of decisions on his own " mr faber says mr zong spent much of the cultural revolution in the s and s on a tea plantation later working in a factory making boxes he acted on his entrepreneurial instincts when the communist party began releasing its grip on business in the s in mr zong started selling soft drinks and flavored ice as a bicycle vendor he later branded the products wahaha a name that sounds as funny in mandarin as it does in english it loosely translates as "laughing baby " reflecting his efforts from the beginning to focus on the youth market often by explaining to parents how his drinks are full of nutrients by his company was generating revenue topping &# million in mr zong forged a deal that gave danone and a hong kong investment bank of the business "we tied up with danone to boost our business in order to speed up our development " mr zong says "we also had to accept some conditions " he adds including minority control mr zong now says that danone resisted investing more into wahaha and he got little support in efforts to push into new regions of china plus he faced a nagging source of competition danone has joint ventures with other drink makers in china danones mr faber says his company never wavered in its support he says that starting around danone acceded to requests from mr zong to seed expansion with his own money danone agreed he could become a minority partner in businesses that make wahaha products outside their joint venture structure reasoning that local governments were often more comfortable if mr zong was personally invested mr faber says by danone says it realized mr zong actually controlled as many as businesses making drinks about a quarter of wahaha products were made outside the joint ventures between danone and mr zong last year danone says in december after negotiating through much of messrs faber and zong signed a deal that paved the way for danone to buy out mr zongs side operations and put the entire wahaha empire back under one roof mr zong says however that he had second thoughts about the deal and in any case says he didnt have the support of his co investors to go through with it ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article
