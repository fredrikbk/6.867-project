price index surged in may the fattest spurt since september another month when consumers were getting squeezed by higher prices at the pump after hurricanes katrina and rita smashed up gulf of mexico drilling platforms and refineries energy costs were up overall driven by a climb in gasoline prices but with investors angling for information that might reveal the future course of interest rates that oil soaked headline reading was of only vague interest policy makers are more focused on core price trends that is sans troublesomely volatile elements like food and fuel and on that front the data were benign the core cpi advanced just and was up from the same time a year ago to be certain thats still above the upper limit of the federal reserves comfort zone but thats also far below the peak seen in september and ian shepherdson of high frequency economics said that it raises "the question of just how long the fed can credibly continue to argue that there is upside inflation risk " there is always the prospect that resurgent fuel prices could leak into core inflation and policy makers may express wariness in that regard after their next meeting on june but even if companies can shift some of their climbing energy expenses onto the shoulders of consumers the weakening housing market could produce an offsetting drag on inflation the report today showed that housing prices which account for around of the overall cpi rose just for the third straight month and the owners equivalent rent component climbed just economists say the boom in housing prices over the last few years helped keep core inflation to the high side but with values in many markets on the wane home prices now could have the opposite effect with builders struggling to contain inventories and foreclosures seen on the rise as millions of adjustable rate mortgages reset to tougher terms any pressure on home prices likely will be downward for some time to come other data also appeared prices
