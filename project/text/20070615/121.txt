in u s tickets more than any other r rated comedy since twentieth century foxs "borat " in recent years deleted and outtakes scenes have become an important weapon in movie studios arsenal encouraging consumers to shell out extra cash for deluxe dvd editions but as online video reshapes the entertainment landscape studios are trying something new throwing deleted scenes online earlier hoping that they will build buzz for their new releases and quietly letting fans trade them on video sharing sites the new marketing approach has been used only for a handful of comedies many surplus scenes from "borat" appeared online before it came out last fall but now the practice is spreading new line cinema says it will post outtakes from augusts martial arts comedy "rush hour " online to promote the release and columbia pictures says its considering posting deleted scenes from its r rated coming of age comedy "superbad " also in august "its a little something subversive for the web audience "
