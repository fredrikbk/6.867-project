weekend journal review books bookmarks kept a victorian mystery by d j taylor harpercollins pages &# i tucked into d j taylors "kept a victorian mystery" hoping that it would get my summer reading off to a good start its not so easy to find fiction that goes with margaritas but doesnt turn your brain to seven layer bean dip and indeed mr taylor keeps both the pages and the brain turning over pleasantly but how is his book victorian mr taylor has written a classic multiplot novel set smack in the middle of victorias reign he begins with the accidental death of mr henry ireland or is it and what has happened to his wife and her money can these respectable people possibly be connected with loan sharks in london country servants and osprey egg hunters in scotland capt mcturk of the metropolitan force is not the only one who would like to know history buffs will be entertained by plot strands that mr taylor has borrowed from real victorian sensations like the great train robbery of his themes are authentically victorian too although some of them have gathered strange echoes and long shadows in our day commercial malfeasance political maneuvering the hazards of poverty the emanicipation of women and the dark fascination of the natural world the events in "kept" unfold over several years but in far fewer pages you might be relieved to know than in real victorian novels mr taylor honors the tradition of the grand finale wrap up chapter and of the classic victorian interrupting narrator in "kept " the narrator owes a bit to george eliots philosophes but much more to william thackerays social commentators especially the slightly rueful onlooker of "the newcomes" mr taylor an englishman has written a fine biography of thackeray so its no wonder that his ventriloquism here is so skilled the early history of mrs henry ireland owes a lot to thackerays wife a madwoman in a cottage rather than an attic "kept" is indebted to its high victorian progenitors for other things as well charles dickens for atmosphere wilkie collins for suspense elizabeth gaskell for domestic comedy but you dont have to play this game unless you want to is this book more than a jeu desprit not really it betrays a modern sensibility rather than a victorian one in its lack of interest in making the reader feel with either sympathy or hatred for the characters for a summer read of real ripsnorting no holds barred "madness greed love obsession machiavellian plotting " as this bookjacket promises pick up instead a copy of wilkie collinss "woman in white "
