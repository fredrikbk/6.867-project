politics &amp economics super duper tuesday may be too big to matter sheer number of states timing will reinforce impact of opening trio an unprecedented number of states have scheduled early presidential primaries to grab some influence from the traditional first kingmakers iowa new hampshire and south carolina but as the law of unintended consequences would have it the front loaded calendar could instead make that opening trio of states and roughly a half million voters in each party more decisive than ever on feb widely called "super duper tuesday" nearly two dozen states from new york to california may hold what approaches a national primary in just nine states had voted by then the crush in will mean that no contender has the time and money to stump in all the feb states with anything near the intensity candidates do in states with january contests that is why florida has defied both parties rules aimed at minimizing front loading and moved up its primaries to jan from march michigans democrats might follow so januarys top finishers will have the momentum to carry them into february and also rans will likely have too little time to catch up strategists say wonder what keeps the dark horses running it is the potential for upsets in the early states where meeting voters is relatively easy and tv ads less expensive one caveat about momentum because many states notably california allow voting for weeks before their primary day some ballots could be cast before the results from iowa or new hampshire are known even so says david plouffe campaign manager for democrat barack obama "you cant expect to finish poorly in january and resuscitate in february " republican consultant mike murphy of california who is uncommitted says he is often asked what a candidates california strategy should be "i say win new hampshire and florida " heres a brief guide to s start iowa iowa republicans straw poll in august was expected as usual to confirm a front runner and winnow the man field well before the states jan caucuses but last weeks decisions by leading candidates rudy giuliani and sen john mccain not to participate in the august poll stripped this years beauty contest of much meaning mitt romney now leading in some state polls after running tv ads had hoped to win the straw poll then the january caucuses and ride the momentum to victory in new hampshire former new york city mayor giuliani whose campaign said it didnt want to spend an estimated &# million to mobilize supporters for a straw poll with no delegates at stake is at a disadvantage in iowa given christian conservatives influence in republican caucuses unlike mr romney mr giuliani hasnt disavowed his past support for abortion rights arizonas mr john mccain hopes to do well though he skipped iowa in because of his opposition to ethanol subsidies a sacred cash cow in corn country he has since changed his mind about ethanol citing high oil prices and advisers say his absence makes him a fresh face now former tennessee sen fred thompsons late start could be a problem given the massive organization needed to recruit supporters to attend local caucuses on a cold january night on the democrats side antiwar partisans hold sway a strain of peace activism has run deep in iowas history while new york sen hillary clinton leads in national polls she struggles in iowa given her vote to authorize force in iraq former north carolina sen john edwards has apologized for the same vote and antiwar rhetoric now supplements his original antipoverty theme he has to win here democrats say having campaigned in iowa virtually since his presidential bid but mr obama the senator from nearby illinois is running as a new voice for change and opposed the iraq war from the start strategists expect the iowa results to pare each field to two candidates maybe three as the also rans support and money dry up new hampshire its primary is tentatively jan it may be set earlier even december to protect the states influence new hampshire law requires its primaries to be at least seven days before any "similar" state contest if new hampshire moves up iowa and south carolina might follow among democrats mrs clinton has an early lead in the state if she fell short in iowa new hampshire could make her the "comeback kid" as it did a struggling bill clinton in stakes are high for republican mr mccain because expectations are he beat george w bush in by points here nearly derailing the texan and has retained support but significantly both parties primaries are open so independents and people unhappy with their own party can vote in either in many such voters went for mr mccain then the fresh faced maverick promising reform now mr obama has that role and hopes independents will vote for him republican mr romney could benefit from familiarity as the former governor from neighboring massachusetts and is already running tv ads he has taken a lead in polls of new hampshire republicans republican activist david carney who is uncommitted says he hasnt detected any activity for mr giuliani and theres "zero buzz" about mr thompson both have potential he adds but only with the face to face campaigning new hampshire voters expect nevada because next years jan caucuses will be a first for nevada unlike iowa where the arcane process is an institution party strategists are at pains to know who will turn out and what the impact will be in the nominating process mr mccain must do well in his neighboring state republican polls suggest a close race and still dont account for candidate to be thompson mr giuliani has raised a lot of money here but his pro gun control record is a drawback among westerners for democrats organized labor is influential here and mr edwards has worked hardest and longest for union support new mexico gov bill richardsons western state strategy has him doing well here and parlaying that into victories on feb but nevada polls have mrs clinton significantly ahead and rory reid son of senate majority leader harry reid of nevada runs her state operation arizona gov janet napolitano after a recent visit with unionists here said "the ones i talked to seem to be all in hillary land " south carolina democrats primary is jan republicans feb north carolinian edwards was born here and won the democrats contest he has to do well but about half of the states democrats are black and mrs clinton is popular with many black voters mr obama considered the first black candidate with a serious shot at the nomination is competitive as well sens chris dodd and joe biden are campaigning hard but uphill given the top three democrats advantages conservative christian and pro military voters dominate the republican primary that gives mr mccain hope in the state that was his doom in his impassioned iraq war support is a plus here and much of the republican establishment pro bush in now backs him mr romneys mormonism and mr giulianis social liberalism are disqualifiers for many conservative christians but mr thompson as a southern conservative could test mr mccains support florida not only has this big state elbowed to the front by scheduling jan primaries but its early voting law could mean some floridians would vote before new hampshires results are in unless new hampshire moves up its vote mr giuliani facing obstacles in the earlier states aims to do well here among moderate republicans particularly northern transplants but mr murphy a past political adviser to former republican gov jeb bush says there are fewer transplants in the electorate than floridas stereotype suggests moreover since its primaries arent open only registered partisans vote that means social conservatives will be a force in the republican primary floridas hispanic population also makes it more sympathetic to mr mccains support of controversial legislation to give illegal immigrants a way to citizenship and create a guest worker program other republicans have lambasted that plan putting them at odds with two men whose endorsements they all want jeb bush and current gov charlie crist feb several states have yet to cement their plans but the numerous contests spanning every region will test the breadth of the appeal of the front runners that emerge from january mr giulianis strategy calls for translating a win in florida into a big state harvest this tuesday including home state new york and new jersey as well as california but california is arizonan mccains neighbor and social conservatives dominate the state party among democrats sens clinton and obama are competing hard in california besides mr giuliani and mrs clinton other candidates have home state advantages feb including mr obama in illinois winning the home state doesnt get a candidate much credit though losing is deadly but these states come rich with delegates unlike mr dodds connecticut and mr bidens delaware mr mccains arizona had been expected to hold a primary this day but gov napolitano who sets the date is considering a week later rather than have arizona get lost in the feb pack shed be gambling that if either or both parties nominees still arent evident after super duper tuesday then "we could be a tie breaker "
