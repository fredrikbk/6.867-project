the evening wrap what next for gaza the fracturing of the hamas fatah government after a week of pitched fighting appears likely to further forestall the formation of a palestinian state and also worsen the desperate circumstances of an impoverished population with hamas in control of the gaza strip following five days of bloodshed the islamist party and rival fatah embarked on what could become an even more tumultuous fight for political advantage palestinian president mahmoud abbas dissolved the coalition government yesterday as his group was flushed out of the coastal enclave and today he began stitching together a new government naming salam fayyad to be the new prime minister but it was far from certain how much authority mr abbas held hamas indicated any government formed by fatah from its west bank stronghold wouldnt hold sway over gaza ismail haniyeh of hamas said he remained the prime minister and that the dissolution of the unity government had been illegitimate mr haniyeh put up a statesman like front vowing to secure the release of a bbc journalist kidnapped in gaza three months ago and urging followers to cease looting former fatah outposts "i demand that all our people show calm and self restraint " mr haniyeh said khaled mashaal the hamas leader now exiled to syria promised that his party would work with mr abbas in the "national interest" of palestinians despite the conciliatory words of hamas other countries were throwing their support behind mr abbas israeli prime minister ehud olmert who will travel to washington in the coming days to discuss the crisis with president bush promised "israel will do all it can to help moderates in the palestinian authority after the radical hamas took gaza by force " what sort of assistance israel might extend to fatah wasnt specified though israel had earlier indicated that it had no plans to intervene militarily mr olmert may consider releasing millions of dollars in palestinian funds to mr abbas money locked up after hamas cruised to power in last years palestinian parliamentary elections the quartet of middle east peace mediators which includes the u s u n russia and eu also came down on the side of mr abbas secretary of state condoleezza rice russian foreign minister sergei lavrov u n secretary general ban ki moon and eu officials held an emergency teleconference in which there was "a clear message of support to president abbas " an eu spokeswoman said egypt abandoned its diplomatic mission in gaza even iran signaled it was troubled by the fighting for those regular citizens in gaza caught in the middle matters may get worse should hamas maintain its grasp on gaza the west could choke off what little assistance is finding its way into the territory that could be disastrous for an already desperate population one resident said that "everybody is with hamas because hamas won the battle if fatah had won the battle theyd be with fatah we are a hungry people we are with whoever gives us a bag of flour and a food coupon " another said "everybody here is worried about his interests or his business people are poor they dont have work " the quartet signaled its worry over the humanitarian crisis mr ban said that he "is deeply concerned for the welfare of ordinary palestinians " and an aide said that the u n is worried about the implications for assistance programs in gaza the u n is "determined to ensure the safety and security" of its employees and to ensure they can continue to "assist a large section of the palestinian population in gaza many of whom are dependent on emergency aid for daily sustenance " core consumer prices contained soaring fuel prices once again kicked the governments most closely watched inflation gauge into overdrive the

to an "accelerator" that amplifies effects of economic shocks that might otherwise be short lived "if the financial accelerator hypothesis is correct changes in home values may affect household borrowing and spending by somewhat more than suggested by the conventional wealth effect because changes in homeowners net worth also affect their external finance premiums and thus their costs of
