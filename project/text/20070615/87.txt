short sellers may owe etfs some thanks dropping of uptick rule by sec comes as growth of stock baskets is soaring the explosion in exchange traded funds may have helped to spur this weeks historic change in the stock markets "short selling" rules the securities and exchange commission this week unanimously approved eliminating the "uptick" rule that restricted short sales or bets against stocks a rule instituted after the great crash of the rule banning short selling when a stock was falling was intended to prevent the relentless selling known as bear raids the sec also strengthened another rule against abusive shorting the advent of exchange traded funds as well as active options markets and single stock futures was making the uptick rule more of an annoyance than a hindrance to both "long" or bullish and short traders in short selling traders borrow shares and sell them hoping to profit by a price decline in the stock before the shares have to be replaced the practice is perfectly legal but investors have often complained about abuses in the strategy etfs which are baskets of stocks that are similar to mutual funds except that they trade on exchanges continuously like a stock have been used increasingly by some investors to make short selling bets on stock sectors free from the short selling rule even as other investors were having to follow the rule on individual stocks thus the rule appeared to be throwing sands into the gears of the market without achieving its original purpose a study by three finance professors of a month pilot program that lifted restrictions on certain stocks backs up the secs assertion that the rule could be safely changed the study suggested that the uptick rules usefulness has disappeared as electronic trading has been introduced and stocks have traded with tighter "spreads" between buying and selling prices it remains to be seen if the rules will be replaced with others that create yet another drag on stock and options trading so far the sec seems to be taking a cautious "do no harm" approach "our findings suggested that they had very little consequence for trading " said ingrid werner a finance professor at ohio state university and one of the studys authors "anything that makes markets have fewer frictions is good " meanwhile a second change also approved unanimously tightens a rule called regulation sho that forces brokers to deliver hard to find shares being borrowed for shorting purposes previously shares shorted before the stock had hit a threshold list of heavily shorted stocks were grandfathered in and exempted from the rule once the rule takes effect these shares must be delivered within days sec chairman christopher cox said in a hearing that the new rule is aimed at abusive short selling practices erik sirri director of the secs market regulation division said in a release that the new rule would "tighten short selling provisions so that markets and investors are better served " the rule which is an attempt to snuff out what is known as "naked shorting " delves into an area that has been frequently misunderstood and has been emotionally charged executives of some companies have raised the issue in political circles and many lawsuits have been filed against hedge funds prime brokers and depository trust &amp clearing corp the main u s stock custodian and trade clearing agent but prof werner explains that whatever the merits of these cases most of which have been dismissed one cant point the finger at short sellers "its really a misnomer that investors are failing to deliver" stock she said "its not the individual investor or hedge funds responsibility "
