weekend journal review television doctors dilemma if you grow numb at the prospect of yet another television series set in a hospital a whole new set of characters in scrubs racing around icu units while suffering through doomed romances marriages and other relationship disasters theres good cause why all those hospital couples end up being so bad for one another is a mystery only the scriptwriters can answer and its not one were awaiting with any kind of urgency that said and aside from its drearily intrusive musical accompaniment theres surprisingly little thats off putting about "heartland " a brand new series set in a hospital that begins airing on tnt monday p m edt much of the shows appeal can be laid at the feet of its star treat williams and also possibly other parts of him hes come a long way since his "prince of the city" days those wary hurt eyes have evolved by now into a far more complex suggestive instrument its one that makes itself felt powerfully in his role here as nathaniel grant chief surgeon at a transplant center in pittsburgh whether the doctor is trying to cope with leftover feelings of love and longing for his former wife he is needless to say divorced or deciding if he should allow a devoted son to donate part of his liver to his father the latter an alcoholic had already been given one transplant of a perfectly matched liver he then proceeded to destroy by drinking and abusing his antirejection drugs which brings us to the second significant source of the seriess strength its focus on the theme of organ transplantation with all its attendant drama leading with the desperate condition of those who will die if they dont quickly receive a new liver or heart or kidney or lungs this is suspense that goes well beyond that of most medical shows where all depends on the skill of the surgeons and diagnosticians here life depends quite as much on strangers namely the organ donors they or more to the point their surviving kin are now central to the drama it is the bereaved who have to be persuaded quickly even in the first hours of their grief and loss to permit the deceaseds organs to be removed for transplantation that job in this series goes to kate armstrong portrayed by an impressive kate matchett who has the job of organ donor coordinator thats in addition to her role as chief surgeon grants former wife none of this is to suggest any in depth treatment here of the medical and social implications of the subject or of the battle over which patients get priority and who decides all thorny questions in the conflict ridden real world of organ assignment but "heartland" created by david hollander is nonetheless an affecting and smart treatment of a complex theme which is saying a lot for a television series especially one freighted as usual with sexual rivalries not to mention rampant failed relationship sickness for which there is apparently no cure among tv doctors "simon schamas power of art " an eight part series beginning monday p m edt on pbs check local listings presents the lives and works of eight artists each portrayed in mr schamas idiosyncratic fashion namely a steady flow of bombast interrupted by passages of calm relatively speaking direct and incisive commentary on particular works of art in these portraits mr schama is very much a scholar for our times which is to say a showman delivering to his television audience personal tidbits about the artists with the kind of emphasis worthy of our celebrity reporters who hold forth on the latest about paris or britney as part of that showmanship mr schama is partial often to a strange zippy prose heaven forfend that anyone should find his scholarship lacking in youthful verve central to this performance above all is mr schamas relentless showy irony these hour long portraits in short of van gogh picasso caravaggio bernini rembrandt david turner and rothko in that order come burdened with plenty of baggage which doesnt mean they dont have their appeal and much to recommend them when mr schama focuses laser like on the details of a work in the picasso segment the second shown on monday he does just that with "guernica" after a zestful biographical romp through picassos personal and political career "guernica " mr schama observes rescued modern art from the curse of its own cleverness with luck someone will do the same for mr schama here comes and hes a welcome sight inspector christopher foyle back on pbss "mystery " with four new episodes of "foyles war series iv " beginning sunday p m check local listings the inspector michael kitchen has by this point learned to live with his police job far from the front lines of the war in good part because the war is always at his doorstep mainly in form of american soldiers now seen everywhere in the neighorhood as they prepare for the battle ahead presumably d day in the first episode in which a young local woman is murdered foyle has to contend with the prejudices of villagers disposed to dark suspicions when it comes to the yanks who were in fact famously described by those british not overly fond of these wartime visitors as "overpaid oversexed and over here " certainties grow ever stronger that only the americans could have killed the barmaid everything is now up to foyle though he too may harbor a few faint prejudices of his own along the same lines thats evident only in the briefest glimmer of dismay that passes over his face few living actors are as good at glimmers of this sort as mr kitchen is as he watches the g i s uninhibited pursuit of the local girls all soon comes right as you might expect and the inspector soon has his killer though "foyles war" is as ever so packed with the color and the atmosphere of the times that the murderer and possibly even the murder hardly seem to matter much
