weekend journal review books menace in the metro stalins ghost by martin cruz smith simon &amp schuster pages &# so a vision of stalin haunts the moscow subway late at night for anyone with a sense of history he is there all the time the cavernous marble clad halls and endless tunnels of that extraordinary engineering project were the workplace and deathplace of countless forced laborers the human fuel of the stalinist command economy but the vision of stalin that arkady renko the pariah of the moscow prosecutors office is assigned to investigate is not an echo of the past but a present day stunt that promises a sinister future martin cruz smiths "stalins ghost" is the sixth outing for the somber reflective renko his first in "gorky park" was a rare appearance in western cold war fiction of a "real" soviet russian mr smith still manages to mix a convincingly humdrum backdrop of gritty daily life in moscow with a lively perhaps too lively plot renko his personal and professional lives troubled and tangled is up against russias most up to date demons kremlin sponsored extremists in cahoots with foreign consultants and brutalized veterans of the chechen wars the author clearly prizes authenticity his command of physical detail is fastidious anyone who has not examined the corpses in a russian morgue suffered brain damage or excavated a battlefield all in fairly quick succession will finish this book with a good idea of what to expect more important mr smith also expertly captures russias repellent contrasts between wealth and poverty humanity and hatred the characters are a bit less realistic but richly drawn renkos horrible soviet era childhood when he was tortured by his father is mirrored by the patricidal feelings of his half adopted son zhenya a young troubled chess genius who lives on the streets stalin the most perverse father figure imaginable looms over the whole story and the whole country the terse witty dialogue is a treat though it may jar readers who know russia the people there usually address each other by first name and patronymic so president vladimir putin son of another vladimir would be called "vladimir vladimirovich " close friends use diminutive versions of their first names mr putin is "volodya" or "vova" admittedly both forms of address can look a bit odd in english neither appears in the book instead the characters sounding quite anglo saxon frequently call each other by their surnames other weaknesses are more serious russian policemen and prosecutors do not as a rule pay much attention to practical jokes and that is what the subway ghost appearances too obviously are a ragbag of passengers reporting late night sightings of stalin would be more likely to attract a curt rebuke than a dogged investigation this improbability undermines the elaborate plot which is further weakened by rather too frequent lucky escapes and convenient coincidences the most puzzling question though is whether someone as honest determined and loving as renko could ever have started work in a place as corrupt and brutal as the moscow prosecutors office much less survive there for years the story begins on an entirely credible note with a woman who wants the agents of law and order to murder her errant husband thereafter corruption and political pressure are central themes in "stalins ghost " but somehow they never ultimately define as they ought to renkos everyday life at the office the russian prosecution service perhaps the least reformed sector of the countrys whole criminal justice system is itself a stalinist ghost a fact that goes unremarked by the author a gruesome scene in which the excavations for a new basement coffee shop in the supreme court building uncovers a mass grave victims of instant stalinist justice is all too horribly believable as is its hurried coverup renko passing by chance is told by a pompous police colonel "i can assure everyone that there will be an investigation of the dead to see whether criminal charges will be brought " renko puts his arm around the officers shoulders and says "congratulations thats the best joke i have heard all day " why renko is not fired or even murdered for scoffing at the coverup of the mass grave or for subverting his offices other sleazy doings is barely less puzzling than why a brainy diligent english speaking workaholic does not look for work elsewhere modern russia offers plenty of jobs for such people some such paths in life even allow you to preserve an honest reputation renkos lingering professional pride in what russian justice and vague distaste for carrying a briefcase hardly seem reason enough for him to keep going at his ill paid and dangerous work the only plausible answer is that fate or rather mr smith keeps giving him fascinating cases and lucky breaks saving your country from fascism winning back your beloved girlfriend from your maniac adversary and rescuing a tormented waif not bad going for a few weeks work but its not quite enough for mr smith to join the first rank in his field he needs to create characters like john le carres george smiley so convincing that the reader can imagine them leading their lives independent of the authors guiding hand though arkady renkos grit guts and laconic humor are certainly appealing they do not outweigh the basic flaws in the story of his life and work setting his detective novels in russia has served mr smith well but the exotic backdrop constrains credibility just a little too much mr lucas is the central and eastern europe correspondent of the economist
