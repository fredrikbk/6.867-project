an ex wifes battle set mr garcia free contesting a lone murder witness became ms ortegas year odyssey by summer jose garcia had married ana ortega in their native dominican republic left her there to sneak into the u s illegally cheated on her and repeatedly broken up with her after an attempted reconciliation back home he had abandoned her and their three children to return to his girlfriend in new york city and ms ortega never thought she would see him again in the fall he was accused of the murder that july of a fellow drug dealer in the bronx and ms ortega did something unexpected she turned her life upside down trying to exonerate him while he worked on appeals from prison she moved her sons into an apartment down the street from the bronx courthouse where he was convicted learned english became a u s citizen earned a masters degree and taught math in public schools over the course of years she marshaled witnesses and documents that were never presented to the trial jury to support her ex husbands alibi that he was stuck with her in her dominican village the night of the bronx murder after getting caught using a fake passport to try to return to the u s "im only going to help you because youre innocent " ms ortega now years old recalls telling mr garcia she expected him to be cleared quickly and then go back to his girlfriend then she says "little by little i realized this is going to take a while and i need to adapt so i changed my entire life " her efforts finally paid off when the case attracted the attention of a federal judge he appointed a top law firm to look into it and mr garcias luck started to change today the case offers a stark example of how difficult it can be to appeal a verdict without dna evidence which is rarely available even in cases involving flawed practices by police prosecutors and defense lawyers mr garcia and a co defendant were convicted via testimony from a lone witness and sentenced to years to life mistaken eyewitnesses were a factor in of the cases in which genetic material has been used to exonerate a convict says the innocence project which works on dna based cases without dna exonerations "only happen because of a fluke " says gary wells an iowa state university psychology professor who co chaired a justice department panel on flawed witness identifications mr wells the innocence project and others long have advocated revamping police lineup procedures to prevent false identifications by witnesses new jersey north carolina and wisconsin and some localities have taken steps backed by these advocates such as having witnesses look at photos or people one after the other instead of all together so they dont just pick out the one who looks most like their memory of the perpetrator other jurisdictions argue the revamped procedures make it harder to convict real culprits the new york police department has found studies of their effectiveness "inconclusive" so far says assistant chief michael collins mr garcia now met ms ortega while visiting her rural village of matanzas in when both were teenagers they married in and moved in with ms ortegas mother on her grandparents coffee farm ms ortegas mother clashed frequently with mr garcia whom she deemed low class ms ortega says tired of fighting mr garcia illegally immigrated to the bronx in after the birth of their first child he got a job at a fabric factory in new jersey he says but a brother in the bronx told him he was "wasting his time" because he could make more money selling drugs "i regret i ever paid attention to my brother " he says in he was convicted of possession a misdemeanor mr garcia also began an affair with gabriella pena after ms ortega learned of the relationship she flew to new york in august and confronted ms pena both were pregnant by mr garcia they say ms ortega divorced mr garcia though she continued saying they were "ecclesiastically married" and named their second son after him after a short marriage to an american ms ortega reunited with mr garcia and they had a third son but he continued seeing ms pena in ms ortega says she returned to the dominican republic and gave mr garcia an ultimatum join her by their fourth wedding anniversary on june or never see her or the sons again mr garcia says he grafted his picture to a puerto rican mans passport and used it to fly to the dominican republic on june to reconcile with ms ortega but after she told him she was pregnant with their fourth child he decided to return to ms pena and the bronx on july ms ortega drove him to la union international airport in puerto plata and told him this would be "the absolute end the final goodbye " she later testified documents later contested by prosecutors show that mr garcia was arrested there for using a doctored passport and held until ms ortega bailed him out the next day friends said they saw the pair that evening at a neighbors memorial service in matanzas that night cesar vasquez an underling in mr garcias drug business was murdered in the bronx shortly before midnight three men got out of a double parked car on bailey avenue near th street and followed mr vasquez into the courtyard of his apartment building according to several witness statements to police moments later the year old was dead felled by multiple gunshots police found little physical evidence beyond four shells from an unknown mm handgun "nor could anyone give a description of the perpetrators " who witnesses said wore hooded shirts according to a police report but penny denor a nurse who lived in the building offered to try to identify them as did her year old son the report said solving the crime fell to anthony pezzullo then a year veteran of the new york police department the detectives first lead came from a prosecutor who passed on a tip from ms pena mr garcias girlfriend she implicated a rival puerto rican dealer who had sworn revenge on mr garcias crew because he believed mr garcia had ordered his brother killed mr pezzullo wrote in a report mr pezzullo contacted ms denor to show her photos of the puerto rican dealers crew she no longer wanted to cooperate but then relented he kept no record of her reaction to the photos though new york city police guidelines required him to do so the detective soon dropped that path of investigation later testifying "i was lost i didnt know which way i was going " he turned to narcotics investigators for help and they gave him the names of several suspected drug dealers operating nearby including mr garcia and an acquaintance named carlos morillo the detective testified they also gave him a picture of mr morillo he said mr pezzullo drove ms denor to a bronx police station to view mug shots in the parking lot ms denor testified the detective flipped through papers and photos and she spotted a photo of one of the assailants the driver "i stopped him and said thats the guy " she testified inside the station ms denor testified she looked through a hundred or so mug shots and picked out a photo of the same man mr morillo in testimony mr pezzullo denied showing her mr morillos photo beforehand in new york and elsewhere witnesses arent supposed to see a suspects photo before trying to pick the culprit out of mug shots ms denor said she looked through another hundred or so photos before identifying mr garcia as the assailant in the front passenger seat the detective was convinced he had the killers he later testified now retired mr pezzullo today says he remembers no details of the matter "once you have an eyewitness pick the men out what else is there " he says after the case was described to him "its an open and closed case " when mr pezzullo told ms pena of the identifications "she appeared stunned and began to cry " the detective wrote she also told him that mr garcia had gone to the dominican republic months earlier and was in federal custody in los angeles for trying to re enter the country there with phony papers he wrote mr pezzullo confirmed that on aug days after the vasquez murder mr garcia was arrested in los angeles after arriving from panama federal records show he admitted using a doctored passport and said he was returning from the dominican republic on oct with mr pezzullo in the room ms denor picked mr morillo out of a side by side lineup of five men some jurisdictions with revamped lineup procedures discourage the presence of officials who know the real suspect so they cant influence witnesses mr morillos lawyer later complained that his client was the only one in the lineup who looked hispanic or had shoulder length hair lineups in new york and elsewhere are supposed to include all similar looking people so none stand out five days later messrs morillo and garcia were indicted for murder mr garcia was transferred from los angeles to new york and put in a side by side lineup on dec ms denor testified that she vacillated between mr garcia no and a similar looking no a transcript shows she then identified no as the culprit but after leaving the viewing room she told detective pezzullo she deliberately fingered the wrong man out of fear both testified "its no its no its no " she recalled screaming jurisdictions with revamped lineup procedures display participants or photos one at a time sequentially not simultaneously critics of side by side lineups point to studies showing that they prompt witnesses to pick the person most like the culprit rather than judging each independently in december ms ortega learned mr garcia been charged with murder still pregnant she flew to new york visiting mr garcia in jail she identified herself as a cousin because ms pena already was signing in as his girlfriend ms ortega brought &# with her some borrowed to pay a lawyer jorge guttlein she says she later paid him another &# she gave him names of friends and relatives who had seen mr garcia in the dominican republic she says and documents related to his july bogus passport arrest when prosecutors learned of mr garcias alibi defense they asked the state department to check with dominican authorities the u s embassy there responded in a fax that a jose garcia was arrested on a fake passport charge on july the bogus passport and related papers were lost by dominican police the fax said prosecutors were unmoved there was no proof the defendant was the same jose garcia detained in the dominican republic they said and if he was he could have rushed back to new york to kill mr vasquez mr guttlein had ms pena meet with assistant district attorney william zelenka the cases lead prosecutor hoping to persuade him to accept the alibi and drop the charges to no avail the defense lawyers tried to have ms denors testimony barred arguing in a nine day hearing that the lineups were tainted and that she took valium the night of the shooting and was being treated for depression during the trial the judge fred w eggert disagreed at the trial mr zelenka the prosecutor told the jury "this whole case will turn on" ms denors testimony mr guttlein intended to use documents he got from ms ortega to place his client in the dominican republic on the day of the murder but prosecutors urged the judge to bar them for not being properly authenticated the judge told mr guttlein to counter that objection in a written brief he never did later testifying that he figured the judges mind was made up instead mr guttlein noted contradictions in ms denors account she told police she saw the shooting as she was leaving her building but at the trial said she only saw the gunmen exit the car from her fourth story window she first said they all wore hooded sweatshirts then described a flowered shirt on two different men she said in the courtroom that the driver looked "vicious cold hearted" and had "mean eyes " but she couldnt identify mr morillo until the prosecutor showed her his lineup photo over defense objections ms ortega asked mr guttlein about calling alibi witnesses he told her the jury wouldnt believe friends and relatives she testified later the only alibi evidence came from the victims sister griselda vasquez she said she informed mr garcia of the murder by phoning him in the dominican republic that night but prosecutors got her to acknowledge that a friend dialed the phone casting doubt on whether she could be sure where mr garcia was the jury deliberated for one day and convicted both men at the sentencing both insisted they werent guilty "the judge has condemned me an innocent man " mr garcia said justice eggert called the crime a drug related execution and handed them maximum sentences both initially used court appointed lawyers to appeal and lost mr garcia says he watched other families abandon inmates as time passed but ms ortega visited most weekends and plotted legal strategy she says she was very upset with how mr garcia had treated her and it took her three years before she could trust him but over time he apologized and told her she was the only woman he wanted to be with she says "i recognize that hes not a perfect guy but i am sure he has learned his lesson " she says "i dont want any other father for my children " inmates helped mr garcia who speaks little english draft appeals to bolster them ms ortega crafted affidavits for four witnesses who said they saw mr garcia in the dominican republic around the time of the murder her mother two relatives and a friend the friend swore she had taken the call from ms vasquez to inform mr garcia of the murder rejected in state courts mr garcia turned to the federal court in manhattan first he asked for more time because hed waited too long to seek federal relief u s district judge lewis kaplan turned down the request at that point mr garcia says "i lost hope " ms ortega recalls him saying "god knows maybe i have to pay something for what i did for misbehaving" at other times but they kept trying in mr garcia filed a freedom of information request for case documents and received the u s embassy fax about the fake passport arrest which he used to argue that exculpatory evidence had been improperly withheld his filings lacked polish and contained mistakes but consistently hammered two themes that mr guttlein was ineffective and that new evidence proved his innocence "your petitioner was immorally convicted " he wrote in a federal appeals court sent the matter back to judge kaplan who referred it to a federal magistrate for a recommendation prosecutors urged dismissal of mr garcias appeal because he missed the deadline and in the magistrate agreed but judge kaplan was troubled by mr garcias filings moreover he recently had seen mr guttleins work on an unrelated case which he later declared "grossly deficient " on sept judge kaplan ruled that mr garcias appeal was "exceedingly rare" because it made a "credible claim of actual innocence " he ordered a magistrate hearing despite the missed deadline the judge asked a former colleague martin klotz a partner at the high powered new york firm of willkie farr &amp gallagher to take mr garcias case mr klotz was leery he says he once defended a law student on drug charges for months before discovering that his alibi witness was lying but he and associates stephen vogel and matthew bosher spent about hours over three years on the case without charge their fees would have been about &# plus &# in expenses the firm says the associates flew to the dominican republic and found original documents related to the false passport arrest they got a copy of mr garcias dominican republic national identity card its identification number also appeared on the arrest documents rebutting doubts about which jose garcia had been detained they interviewed witnesses who recalled seeing mr garcia at the deceased matanzas neighbors prayer service on the same night as the bronx murder one neighbor produced a prayer card for the deceased to confirm the date of death a private investigator hired by mr klotz interviewed ms denor in february in past testimony she had said police didnt pressure her but she now said mr pezzullo threatened to "make it bad" for her son who had seen the culprits and who had "issues" with the police if she didnt cooperate the investigator wrote in a report which was reviewed by the wall street journal but not admitted in court in court mr pezzullo denied pressuring ms denor but acknowledged telling her he wouldnt need her son as a witness if she viewed photos ms denor could not be reached for comment in may the magistrate presided over a six day hearing multiple witnesses said they saw mr garcia in the dominican republic before after or on the night of the murder the magistrate refused to accept a photocopy of the airline ticket mr garcia said he used so mr vogel searched the basement of the bronx travel agency that issued it and found the original receipt mr guttlein testified he believed investigators "made up" ms denors identification "i tried tried the best i could " mr guttlein said of his work for mr garcia the lawyer didnt return calls on aug the magistrate recommended that judge kaplan free mr garcia prosecutors continued arguing that mr garcia was properly convicted they suggested a motive weeks before the murder mr vasquez had been arrested costing mr garcia vials of crack and &# seized by police at a hearing assistant district attorney nancy killian attacked the alibi witnesses credibility judge kaplan shot back "so anybody who testifies to something which the district attorneys office disagrees is a perjurer is that about it " he called prosecutors probe of mr garcias alibi a "joke " ms killian told him the prosecutors did their best robert t johnson the bronx district attorney during the original trial and now declined to comment on the case as did mr zelenka judge kaplan also had harsh words for mr guttlein saying that getting the border arrest documents admitted as evidence should have been "about as hard as it would be to fall down a manhole cover with the lid off " on dec he ruled that the lawyers incompetence likely "resulted in a conviction that otherwise would not have occurred " the judge ordered mr garcia retried or the charges dropped spurred by that decision mr morillos legal aid society lawyers persuaded a private law firm shearman &amp sterling to take his case without charge and consider his first new appeal since two months later prosecutors abandoned the garcia case without admitting any mistakes each day for the next week ms ortega drove miles to mr garcias prison in napanoch n y hoping for his release but there was another problem an october order to deport mr garcia on feb immigration authorities transferred him to a new jersey jail the case was reopened to take into account the vacated murder conviction but an immigration judge ordered him deported for his previous drug conviction and border arrest his attorneys asked the government to reconsider his family all american citizens pleaded on his behalf in letters to the authorities "i wanted my father to be there to watch me play football and yell from the bleachers i wanted to play catch and ask him about girls " wrote his eldest son randy who went to prestigious phillips academy in andover mass and now studies at trinity college in hartford conn he had been ashamed to tell friends about the jailed father who sent him birthday cards each year he said "most importantly i wanted my father to be there to teach me how to be a man " his three brothers ages to also wrote as did ms ortega who said the family has "established our lives in this country and we deserve the opportunity to spend our lives together in this country " on may the request was denied mr garcia was deported on tuesday and is now in matanzas ms ortega and their sons plan to visit him mr garcia says he doesnt know exactly what hell do now "i hope to become the man she originally met " he says
