weekend journal tastings boxed wines face the six week challenge boxes battle bottles for young drinkers letting the air out we were surprised to see an ad for wine "casks" during this years oscars boxed wines and the academy awards dont seem like a natural match even in a year in which "borat" was nominated it turned out that the ads were just the beginning of an aggressive &# million television campaign by the makers of fisheye wine among their claims that the wine stays fresh in its bag in box for six weeks to us that sounded like a challenge having slowly filled our refrigerator with partially emptied boxes of wines over the past month and a half were happy to say we survived the experiment and were back with a full report boxed wines have been around for some time now and are far more common in some countries than the u s australians for instance drink about half their domestic wine from boxes according to australian statistics the big player in the field is the wine group based in san francisco which is the worlds third biggest wine company by volume because of its ubiquitous franzia boxed wines people ask us all the time if weve found a boxed wine we like and the answer is that even though weve conducted broad blind tastings and theres certainly nothing inherently wrong with a boxed wine weve found the wine inside the boxes generally to be unpleasant over the years weve written positively about two boxed wines targets australian chardonnay wine cube and carmenet winery "vintners collection" cabernet sauvignon which is no longer produced both were packaged in three liter boxes the most common size of wine in a box is five liters thats almost seven regular bottles of wine and wed guess the demographic those wines attract are our parents but with americas increasing interest in wine and more of a willingness among wine drinkers to experiment consider the rise of screwcaps for instance the people at the wine group clearly figured the time was right for something new so they introduced fisheye in three liter boxes with heavy promotion we first ran across fisheye in regular bottles as part of a tasting of the house brands of big chain stores last year back then it was an exclusive offering at harris teeter grocery stores and we wrote that it was "consistently disappointing " others must have disagreed however because the wine group says the brand sold so well that the company decided to put it in a box and roll it out nationally it is also still available in bottles why a three liter size instead of five "the smaller size is a signal that its different consumers need a signal that something has changed " laurie jones a wine group spokeswoman told us clearly the companys eye is on a younger more affluent demographic too just look at where the ads are placed "desperate housewives " "lost " "brothers and sisters " "boston legal" and "greys anatomy " although really we just cant imagine dr mcdreamy offering meredith a glass of wine from the box in his refrigerator we can however see the chief still missing his wife tapping the cask a glass at a time over a couple of weeks in any case the target consumer the wine group says is "influential year old wine drinkers " and ms jones says sales are strong wine group is expecting to sell about a million nine liter cases of fisheye this year including both boxes and bottles "everyday wine drinkers are using this as their house wine " she said "it used to be a big magnum of mondavi in the refrigerator door " indeed according to acnielsen sales of premium three liter box wines including brands such as hardys fisheye and black box rose by volume for the week period ending april fisheye claims and other boxed wines make similar claims that its wines will keep well for six weeks after opening because the plastic bag inside the box collapses and therefore keeps out air we decided to test the claim we bought seven boxes of fisheye chardonnay vintage "best when consumed before nov " they cost &# each or about &# per regular bottle our idea was that we would open one every week for six weeks and empty about a sixth of the contents then wed taste the six boxes against a newly opened box six weeks later we opened the first box found the pour spout and tapped the bag then we tasted the chardonnay and it was ok but harsh we decided that we couldnt very well perform our test with this wine because it didnt taste that good to us to begin with so then we tried fisheyes pinot grigio which was fairly pleasant and not too sweet though it smelled and tasted more like sauvignon blanc and its shiraz which was tasty "soft and pleasant with integrated acidity and nice fruit " the shiraz seemed perfect for our experiment all of the boxes cost &# while fisheye doesnt say the boxes need to be refrigerated we did this because these simple wines even the shiraz are better with a chill over the next six weeks we opened one box of shiraz every friday and poured out about one sixth of all of them that were open the shiraz was vintage "best when consumed before dec " because we had the chardonnay anyway we went ahead and conducted the experiment with those boxes too soon our refrigerators were groaning under the weight of boxed wines at the end of the experiment first we tasted the box of pinot grigio wed tried weeks earlier it was still pleasant with some lemon peach and kiwi it tasted somewhat watery but not at all oxidized it didnt taste like it had been open for six weeks then we put all of the boxes of chardonnay and shiraz on a table we had noted on the bottom of the box when each was opened we asked a friend to serve them so we wouldnt be able to tell which boxes were lightest and which were heaviest and therefore we were able to taste the seven wines blind from one open for six weeks to one just opened fresh the chardonnays on the whole continued to taste pleasant enough but a bit harsh three smelled and tasted notably sulfuric all tasted of pineapple sometimes sweet pineapple and sometimes watery pineapple one was clearly the best it tasted riper fresher and cleaner than the rest this turned out to be the newest box the one we had just opened but our second favorite was the wine wed opened the third week of the experiment and our third favorite was the very first wed opened all those weeks before overall the boxes we opened first and last were the best the boxes opened in the middle weeks were the ones that tasted and smelled less fresh but none of the boxes tasted oxidized or obviously off weve tried some wines by the glass at tony wine bars that tasted far more over the hill we sampled the shirazes next once again none of them was obviously oxidized the difference among them was that a couple tasted vibrant and alive these were wines we would take to a picnic ourselves while others had the same basic tastes but theyd lost life and seemed somewhat dull and flat in any event none of them tasted as sweet alcoholic and heavy as many jug wines on the market and even many under &# wines in bottles when we checked the bottom of the boxes it turned out that our favorite shiraz had been opened in week no and our second favorite had been the very first cask we opened our third favorite was the freshest box once again it appeared that the boxes from the fifth and sixth weeks those open for one week and two weeks were the most problematic call it a dumb period so the bottom line its true the wine really does keep for six weeks it has its ups and downs in your refrigerator but it will keep fine would we keep a box of wine in our refrigerator for six weeks well no today there are so many interesting affordable wines on the shelves that wed rather taste several wines than one wine in a big box that said the fisheye shiraz at the equivalent of &# a bottle is a perfectly nice wine for a party this summer and yes if you have any left over you can keep it around until the dog days of summer without it turning hairy you can contact us at wine wsj com
