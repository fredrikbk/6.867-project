tax boost sought for buyout firms planning ipos senate measure inspired by blackstone offering a shot across the bow federal lawmakers launched a bipartisan broadside against the booming private equity industry on the eve of the hotly anticipated public offering of blackstone group there has been growing alarm in washington at the prospect of hedge funds and buyout firms historically structured as highly lucrative private partnerships becoming publicly traded companies but continuing to pay taxes at the lower rates of partnerships yesterday the two top lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced a bill to change that arrangement by raising the tax rate on private equity firms that go public a move inspired they said by blackstones offering "right now some businesses are crossing the line between reasonably lowering their tax burden and pretending to be something theyre not to avoid most if not all corporate taxes " said sen charles grassley an iowa republican who is the ranking minority member on the senate finance committee "its unfair to allow a publicly traded company to act like a corporation but not pay corporate tax contrary to the intent of the tax code " people involved in blackstones initial public offering scheduled to occur in the coming weeks said the move likely wouldnt derail the offering but it has made the valuation much murkier one person involved in the underwriting said the senate move could hit blackstones &# billion valuation by as much as but a fuller view will take time to develop as investors weigh the prospects of the bill turning into law and watch how it develops more broadly the bipartisan nature of the bill moreover carried real weight in washington and on wall street since it could lift the odds it could clear an evenly divided senate amid a growing debate about income inequality democratic leaders have become increasingly open about their desire to find new tax revenues to offset spending increases while democratic presidential contenders have taken a harsher tone against corporate tax breaks and what they call excessive executive pay at the same time president bush has maintained his staunch opposition to tax increases which could hurt the measures chances late yesterday a spokesman said only that the white house was reviewing the legislation the effort comes amid a historic buyout boom driven in good part by increasingly wealthy and assertive private equity firms like blackstone and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co which have amassed enormous stashes of cash from wealthy investors pension funds and endowments seeking outsized returns some of their deals have sparked a budding outcry over the enormous wealth being generated by buyout firms as their targets face cutbacks "its definitely a shot across the bow to blackstone kkr and everyone looking at the public markets and it is a big big negative" for firms examining going public said jon brorson president of agrashares llc a chicago based money management firm blackstone has been among the most prominent and active buyout firms with audacious deals such as its &# billion takeover of equity office properties the nations largest owner of office buildings and a range of purchases from freescale semiconductor a maker of embedded semiconductors to the company that owns madame tussauds wax museums its chief executive and co founder stephen schwarzman a pioneer in the buyout world has become a public symbol of the new wall street with his aggressive deal making lucrative pay and lavish lifestyle such as his recent th birthday held at new yorks park avenue armory and emceed by comedian martin short the public offering of blackstones limited partnership coming after years of operating beyond the scrutiny of public markets is just the latest example blackstone has raised eyebrows with its plan which would forgo some traditional measures such as having a majority of independent directors mr schwarzman stands to gain as much as &# million while retaining a stake in blackstone that could be worth more than &# billion that has inspired both admiration and jealousy among his competitors blackstone plans to sell million common units of its limited partnership for between &# and &# each in the biggest u s public offering in five years that is valued at about &# billion and can be increased by an additional &# million the planned sale of a stake of almost to the chinese government will bring the overall total to about &# billion at the new york stock exchange yesterday afternoon mr schwarzman was accepting an award from the yale school of management asked whether the bill would affect the ipo mr schwarzman said "i have no idea " he said he was told "theyve got some transition rules in this" that would give blackstone five years before the tax kicked in mr schwarzman was referring to a provision in the legislation that would exempt for five years those firms such as blackstone and fortress investment group a hedge fund and buyout firm that is already publicly traded that filed public offering documents with the securities and exchange commission before yesterday indeed blackstone appears to have engaged in some intense lobbying that gives it a head start against other rival firms hoping to go public since the new tax regime if approved in its current form could chill other public offerings if the bill is passed in its present form blackstone would receive more favorable treatment from investors than any firms that decide to go public further down the road "this gives blackstone a gigantic boost " said the chief of a rival buyout firm in essence the bill would treat publicly traded partnerships that derive income from investment advice or asset management services like any other corporation subject to the u s tax code blackstone currently plans to list as a publicly traded partnership expecting to be taxed at a rate compared with the corporate rate of up to the senators in explaining their focus on ipos said the issue was one of consistency and fairness they said congress in the s decided to tax most publicly traded partnerships as corporations a response to concerns that the corporate tax base was being eroded sen max baucus the montana democrat who chairs the senate finance committee and is a co sponsor of the bill said in a statement that there is no reason that private equity firms and hedge funds that go public should be treated differently under the tax code than other partnerships "if a publicly traded partnership makes its money by providing financial services that active business should be taxed as a corporation " he said opponents are expected to argue the measure would chill the overall capital markets and potentially create even less tax revenue for the treasury thats because income in private partnerships flows through to individuals who pay their taxes as private citizens a publicly traded partnership meanwhile does pay some taxes at a company level besides whatever taxes may flow through to individuals private equity has long braced for just such an attack from washington for years firms spent relatively little on lobbying or political contributions but last year anticipating growing scrutiny from lawmakers they created a new trade group aimed at heading off new regulation and taxes private equity firms have also ramped up political contributions in recent months in the first quarter of this year private equity firms along with hedge funds ranked among the top donors to presidential candidates from both parties yesterdays proposal came after months of intense closed door discussions in the senate about whether major tax changes are needed to keep up with booming industries that are generating billions of dollars in profits senators indicated they dont think the blackstone and fortress ipos fit with current tax law and asked the treasury department to weigh in however legislation would most likely be needed to settle the hazy issue and it would have to be passed by both the senate and house the proposal sends a clear signal that lawmakers are deeply concerned that companies such as blackstone are structuring themselves to avoid corporate taxes when they go public people familiar with deliberations between blackstone and legislators said staff from the firm first met with staff on the finance committee in april and that the legislative aides followed up with a set of written questions last month the firm and the aides had four long conference calls after that the last earlier thursday before the legislation was announced the chief tax writer in the house ways and means chairman charles rangel a new york democrat said his committee would undertake an examination of the issues "we should not permit one segment of the financial services industry to enjoy a competitive advantage over others " mr rangel said in a statement "together our actions should put everyone on notice that congress may act to address these outstanding issues " while the bill introduced yesterday covers only publicly traded partnerships it comes as senate tax aides have spent months reviewing the tax issues raised by the private equity and hedge fund industries and have considered whether to raise taxes on a broader cross section of the industry including firms that remain private a separate issue still under discussion in washington is whether its appropriate for fund managers to pay the capital gains tax rate of on the future profits that they take when they buy and sell companies known as "carried interest " carried interest is typically viewed as part of the compensation for a private equity firms managers but not so for tax purposes some tax experts contend some or all of this income should be taxed at regular income tax rates as high as and the senate finance committee is exploring whether to do so on wall street and beyond meanwhile blackstones ipo has become something of a milestone calling attention to the culture shift in the private equity industry typically private equity firms have viewed themselves as acting beyond the reach of both government and the staid world of the old line corporation that was clear in blackstones public filings which originally used an aggressive form of accounting that would have allowed it to book profits on deals before they were actually consummated that accounting treatment was eventually struck down by the sec for his part mr schwarzman himself has started to be seen more as a mover in washington at the end of april at a fancy dinner at the mandarin oriental hotel in washington he received the atlantic councils distinguished business leadership award he was introduced by former secretary of state colin powell who described him as a good friend and shared the stage and the nights honors with former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and retired gen james jones
