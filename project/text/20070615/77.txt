prime seattle land for sale could reshape city skyline seattle the clise family began buying prime real estate here in just after much of downtown was destroyed by fire now after patiently accumulating contiguous acres downtown and shunning investors who wanted well placed pieces of it the family is putting the land on the market in play are about seven city blocks now mostly occupied by parking lots that bump against a vibrant urban center the fate of this property could not only alter the seattle skyline but perhaps the architectural and economic reputation of a city with international aspirations the area the family is putting up for sale has the potential for million square feet of development which would rival the size of londons canary wharf or the entire world trade center complex in new york before the terrorist attacks but seattle with a population of about is much smaller than london or new york so the potential impact of such construction on the city around it is much greater "its unbelievable the scope of whats being put on the market " says pat callahan chief executive of urban renaissance group a seattle based commercial real estate company "it will send a sonic boom through this market " the decision by alfred m clise the fourth generation chief executive of clise properties inc to sell the land comes a year after the city changed its height restrictions to allow office towers to rise from about feet to feet or about stories higher with the change seattle is following the lead of such cities as san francisco and vancouver which have discovered height restrictions and other measures intended to slow growth often encourage sprawl and traffic gridlock mr clise says he is looking for a comprehensive cohesive plan with world class design "i envision something akin to rockefeller center " he says combined with another mammoth development in the works by microsoft corp billionaire paul allens vulcan inc seattle could be reinvented in the coming decades like some other major cities it could develop a greater number of walkable neighborhoods in which people live near big employers and can spill out from those offices to boutique retail shops or trendy restaurants and bars when the workday is done right now seattle battles sprawl with many commuters coming into the city for work "seattle could have the kind of urban environment that san francisco and chicago and new york have but it is a much smaller city " says kate joncas president of the downtown seattle association a nonprofit organization mr clise is convinced now is the ideal time to sell the job market outlook is robust for seattle and the office market with a low vacancy rate for top quality "class a" buildings is hungry for more space says michel seifer managing director of capital markets for jones lang lasalle the real estate services firm handling the sale yet there is a possibility that mr clise age may have missed his window increases in the cost of borrowing with the yield on the benchmark year treasury note rising to nearly last week could keep some previously active real estate investors on the sidelines for this blockbuster but inherently risky transaction mr clise says if he doesnt get the price he is seeking for the land well into the hundreds of millions of dollars he could still take it off the market for years the land sat virtually idle save for some parking lots a couple of low rise hotels and bars because of a citizens initiative that set limits on downtown growth including the density and height of buildings but growth came anyway by last year the prevailing sentiment had turned and seattle followed a number of other cities in encouraging more residents to live and work in tall buildings downtown in the hopes of cutting down traffic snarling commutes and protecting single family residential neighborhoods by reducing the need for apartment complexes in april the seattle city council approved new height guidelines that generally allowed office buildings to rise in return developers who build above a certain base height must pay the city for every square foot of space beyond that base that money goes into a city fund to build affordable housing downtown potentially millions of dollars for any sizable tower "we didnt want a downtown of just luxury condos " says tim ceis seattles deputy mayor the clise land up for grabs is in the denny triangle an area that stretches north from downtown to seattle center which features the famous space needle in the early part of the th century the city of seattle leveled denny hill named for one of the earliest anglo settlers and dumped the dirt into elliott bay thus making block after block of hard packed soil ideal for skyscrapers clise properties intends to keep the seattle properties they have developed already including seventh avenue which is the headquarters for retailer nordstrom inc mr clises great grandfather james arrived in seattle on june the day after a great fire burned nearly city blocks already wealthy from timber production in denver and smelling opportunity among the acrid embers he began buying seattle land jamess son charles bought land even more aggressively throughout the city over time the family began connecting their contiguous denny triangle pieces sometimes by buying the land sometimes by trading for it for other parcels the clises owned charless son alfred h preached the importance of maintaining the denny triangle holdings "my father talked to me about this time after time he said you dont want to sell this off piecemeal " says mr clise known to friends as al "the value is in the assemblage as a whole " that is why mr clises abrupt decision is such a surprise it was long presumed that the clise family would at some point develop the land themselves one building at time but mr clise says the family firm with about employees isnt large enough to pull off a mammoth project so he is asking jones lang lasalle to bring investors who have a vision for the property mr clise says the family has no specific requirements and the investor with the proposal that impresses them the most will likely get the land office condominium and hotel towers are probably a given but he is open to additional features such as green space museums or performing arts facilities proposals could range from institutional investors who ask the family to take the lead in construction to developers who write a check and ask for no involvement from the family the clise land is already zoned for commercial and residential use a developer could start digging within weeks of closing on the deal and the entire complex could be finished within years says richard stevenson president of clise properties
