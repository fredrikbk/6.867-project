reneging on their commitments but i have seen approval for new loans slowing and its generally becoming more difficult for real estate funds and other investors to get financing for their projects "

price of real estate down " says gary mozer principal with george smith partners a los angeles based commercial real estate finance firm the "meltdown" in the cmbs market as mr mozer calls it has caused a "sea change" in the amount that real estate investors can borrow "people cant pay as much for property because they cant get as much positive leverage " he says mr mozer estimates borrowers can get to less than they could have eight weeks ago "ive had lenders walk away from the table " he says "i have an institutional client one of the largest reits that was at the table with a lender for a &# million deal the lender walked away and gave back the deposit saying if they closed they would lose &# million keep in mind this client borrows &# billion a year overall so that says a lot the whole market is in upheaval " he says william hughes a managing director at marcus &amp millichap real estate investment services in encino calif says "a lot of cmbs issuers are running for their lives investors are rejecting transactions from cmbs pools that have significant interest only components or little to no cash flow " loan terms are becoming more stringent despite the promise of

two years out for the basis of a loan but were now down to one year " even before yesterdays filing with the securities and exchange commission investors had reacted coolly to the &# a share price for
