controversies have thrown mr clement a curve as the highest ranking justice official not involved in the firings he is charged with overseeing the departments investigations into the matter the solicitor generals regular job is pondering the great questions of law and dressed in a traditional morning coat arguing on the governments behalf before the supreme court it is only on rare occasions the solicitor general is dragged directly into the political fray becoming acting attorney general when his superiors are disqualified from exercising their authority mr gonzales remains under fire and the deputy attorney general has tendered his resignation this could be a defining moment for mr clement who may be torn between capitol hill demands for disclosure of internal deliberations and the white house claim that executive privilege shields its actions from congressional review how mr clement navigates those shoals could determine whether he emerges as a replacement should mr gonzales depart and how far his judicial ambitions will take him mr clements supporters say partisanship wont cloud his judgment as solicitor general he sometimes has had to defend laws unpopular with republicans such as the mccain feingold campaign finance act the laws co sponsor sen russell feingold d wis called mr clements performance "superb " "hes a just the facts just the law kind of guy " says former deputy attorney general james comey a republican who in recent congressional testimony raised questions about mr gonzaless judgment "if he found himself as acting attorney general he would do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may " mr gonzales has been buffeted by allegations that his department improperly used political criteria in hirings and firings including the dismissals of at least eight u s attorneys last year the attorney general backed by president bush has brushed off calls to resign but democrat led investigations continue in congress wednesday the house and senate judiciary committees issued new subpoenas including one for former white house counsel harriet miers like other lawyers who gained prominence in the bush administration mr clement belonged to the right leaning federalist society and held clerkships under two pugnacious conservatives u s circuit judge laurence silberman and supreme court justice antonin scalia in he joined the phalanx of conservative lawyers who fought in the legal dispute that made george w bush president after the election solicitor general theodore olson selected mr clement as his deputy "i wanted a deputy solicitor general made from the mold of john roberts " mr olson says chief justice roberts held that job in the first bush administration and parlayed a sharp legal mind and engaging manner way all the way to the supreme court mr clement succeeded mr olson when the latter left government in mr clement comes across as easygoing and unpretentious he is doubtless the first solicitor general to frequent washingtons alternative rock outpost the club although he likes the scottish group franz ferdinand he says his all time favorite band remains the grunge pioneer nirvana after the attacks the administration resolved to deal harshly with alleged terrorists it has denied treaty protections to foreign prisoners held at guantanamo bay and detained u s citizens as enemy combatants mr olson assigned mr clement to defend the governments positions in such cases "i thought domestic law controversies were going to be the bread and butter of the office " mr clement said in an interview "you werent thinking youd have to master a bunch of world war ii cases that nobody ever heard of " in one painful episode u s district judge michael mukasey in manhattan accused mr clement of stalling compliance with an order to allow jose padilla a detained u s citizen to meet with lawyers former officials say messrs olson and clement advised a more moderate position in private correctly predicting that the supreme court would reject much of mr bushs claim of executive power "unfortunately very often the chest thumpers ignored them " said mark corallo a college classmate of mr clement who headed justice department public affairs under mr gonzaless predecessor john ashcroft at the high court mr clement has sometimes ceded ground that conservatives would prefer to hold "you ask yourself how do you get to five " he says referring to the number of justices needed to win a majority "sometimes to defend of a policy you have to give up " after california legalized the medicinal use of marijuana mr clement seized on new deal era precedents to argue that the justice department could still use federal law to prosecute patients and providers although conservative purists have reviled those cases which expanded federal authority at the expense of state governments mr clement knew they held the support of most justices and pulled out a victory "we werent going back to pre " doctrines he says mr clement calls himself a "law geek" who enjoys examining issues from "a foot perspective " the troubles surrounding mr gonzales may force him into the trenches as the department works its way through investigations that could strain the "great working relationship" mr clement says he has with mr gonzales already the solicitor general has decided to release the results of the investigation in response to a request from democratic senators democrats say their future support for mr clement may depend on how he handles the even tougher questions likely to follow "the next attorney general must be a professional who puts the rule of law first and foremost " says sen charles schumer d n y one of mr gonzaless lead antagonists "if mr clement fits that bill as he well may wed seriously consider him "
