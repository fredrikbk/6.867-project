weekend journal how the mondavis lost an empire clan gives up control as fathers donations add financial strain after robert mondavi punched his younger brother peter during an argument over a mink coat in he was banished from the family winery he started over with virtually nothing but eventually became the biggest name in the california wine industry taking his empire public in during the stock market boom of the late s he overextended himself as a philanthropist and by early faced the threat of becoming insolvent that gave the robert mondavi corp s outside directors a source of leverage with the family in this adaptation from her new book "the house of mondavi the rise and fall of an american wine dynasty " julia flynn siler chronicles how the mondavis lost control of the company in january wall streets demands were about to collide with the mondavi familys dynastic dreams michael mondavi who had succeeded his famous father as chairman of the publicly traded robert mondavi corp got a morning phone call from his younger brother timothy "heads up " his sibling warned him "youre about to get your a handed to you in a sling " michael was scheduled to have lunch with two of the companys outside directors whom he planned to lobby to rein in mondavis nonfamily chief executive his bravado faded as he walked through the oakville calif winerys famous arch after some small talk the directors told him that they thought it best if hed step down michael asked what the terms of his new job would be in his new role as vice chairman "well figure it out " they said then michael picked at his chicken breast hed spent decades working under his fathers shadow the small winery his father and he had founded in was now the heart of americas pre eminent wine empire spanning four continents robert mondavi corp which was controlled by the mondavi family through a dual class share structure would sell more than million cases of wine that year including some of the worlds most recognizable brands robert mondavi woodbridge and opus one a joint venture with frances rothschild family over the two hour lunch michael was fired as chairman of the only company where hed ever worked his sister marcia who lived in new york and served as a director backed his ouster when michael learned this from the directors waves of anguish and disbelief washed over him sporting a short ponytail in the early s and known for roaring through the napa valley on a harley davidson with other winery owners michael had long struggled to make his mark in an industry shaped by his father for more than half a century robert mondavi had praised the benefits of fine wine to a nation that preferred coca cola and cocktails he had tirelessly sermonized that in an age of fast food wine was a healthy and civilizing force and that napa valley wines belonged in the company of the worlds best his passion had paid off in time napa wines took their place alongside those from bordeaux as the worlds finest and a new wine and food culture leapfrogged from americas coastal cities to the heartland along the way this son of an italian peasant became the patriarch of americas fine wine trade and he and his children had become fabulously wealthy by selling stock in the family business but by early robert mondavi corp s reputation for high quality wines had eroded and the house of mondavi was rent by conflict his hand picked successor son michael had been removed as chairman and the mondavi family was on the brink of losing control of the company indeed behind michaels ouster was a closely guarded secret robert faced a personal financial crisis that threatened to embarrass him and destroy his legacy the roots of the problem lay in the late s when mondavi stock was trading near the top of its range during those halcyon days as michael ran the company as ceo roberts focus shifted to philanthropy he promised to give the university of california at davis &# million the largest single private gift received by the school at that time the gift would help build an institute for wine and food science as well as a new cultural center both named after robert the final paperwork was completed just after sept and the gift itself was backed by roberts stock in the family company but his generosity began causing him and his advisers anxiety as the share price plummeted as the market for premium wine began to sour and competition from such brands as australias yellow tail and trader joes charles shaw nicknamed "two buck chuck " hurt mondavis sales when the stock dropped below &# a share robert was underwater the value of his shares couldnt cover his many philanthropic pledges which by then had swelled to include his most pressing financial commitments to the new wine and food center in napa called copia u c davis and stanford universitys cantor arts center which named a gallery after him if the stock continued to fall he faced insolvency his lawyer tried to renegotiate the terms of the gift to u c davis but the university had already set aside the site drawn up the building design and included roberts contribution in its financial plans which had wound their way through the state legislature the university also made it clear that it would be forced to drop the mondavi name from the institute if robert reneged on his pledge well aware that robert faced a potentially dire financial situation the companys outside directors seized the chairmanship from michael a move that neither his father nor his sister opposed because they hoped a change in leadership might boost the stock price and help robert save face yet the backdrop to the move was concern by some outside directors that the company under michaels watch had made a quarter of a billion dollars or so of virtually unproductive capital investments during the late s and early s including failed joint ventures with disney and chiles chadwick family and a thwarted push into the south of france several of these independent directors felt the solution was to oust roberts successor paving the way to ultimately force americas most powerful wine family to sell out the board coup that began in january with michaels firing reached its climax eight months later at st helenas harvest inn the new nonexecutive chairman a former mckinsey &amp co partner named ted hall presided mr hall entered the meeting leaning heavily on crutches he had been walking at his acre ranch when he slipped on a cow patty and fractured his shin mr hall wasnt the only one in pain the stress of the past few months was apparent in timothy mondavis tottering frame roberts fair haired son arrived leaning on a cane he had been suffering from muscle spasms for several weeks as the family sat around a u shaped table the outside directors presented a plan to end mondavis dual class structure which gave the family control over about of the votes the family would get a premium for converting their b shares into a shares worth a total of about &# million at the time to them as a group besides dramatically easing roberts financial crisis the plan would preserve the possibility they could bid for their beloved oakville winery in return theyd have to sign a voting agreement that would lower the familys combined votes to about which meant theyd relinquish control allowing the independent directors to explore selling all or parts of the company timothy and his older sister marcia balked "how did you come up with these numbers " marcia angrily asked she and timothy were figuratively in one corner of the ring while michael was in the other one or another of the siblings stomped out of the room several times then the outside directors wielded their most powerful weapon they told them they would quit en masse unless the mondavis agreed to get rid of their supervoting shares if the outside directors resigned the news almost certainly would have sent mondavis shares falling further increasing the chance that robert would face insolvency still seething over his dismissal as chairman michael had by then channeled his sense of betrayal into a focused desire to sell his shares for as much as he could he had already negotiated his severance package and was well into making plans for his new company to keep up his energy and reduce stress michael exercised and ate voraciously pumping an elliptical trainer at his home gym his siblings on the other hand initially opposed the plan for what were at root emotional reasons it threatened to wipe out their birthright their responses were layered with feelings that stretched back to childhood where discussions of wine and the family business dominated every meal by stripping their control mr hall and the outside directors threatened not only their identity as americas first family of wine but also threatened to fracture what had long held them together they also clung to the hope that they might be able to start again either by buying the robert mondavi winery in oakville or at least some of its historic to kalon vineyards which surrounded it but nonetheless fearing lawsuits from other shareholders and hoping to save their father from further financial strain they concluded they had no choice but to sign the papers that would mean they relinquished voting control "we felt the directors were holding a gun to our fathers head and asked us to pull the trigger " says timothy "i could not run the risk of his bankruptcy even if he would have " on tuesday aug roberts three children signed the agreement which effectively put an end to their reign at the robert mondavi corp robert had been in italy when mr hall explained the plan at harvest inn so four days after his children had signed it he rode in the back of a chauffeur driven car up the narrow winding road to mr halls longmeadow ranch where mr hall and roberts long time legal adviser frank farella would further describe it to him the three men met at the thick wood conference table in mr halls office above the winery on mr halls bookshelf was "blood and wine " a saga of the gallo familys problems over the course of their conversation that saturday morning mr hall was struck by roberts practical acceptance of the situation as well as his admission that his own sons werent capable of running the business mr hall believed that going along with the plan was roberts best hope of escaping the embarrassing possibility of defaulting on his pledges "i never thought id have to be making these kinds of decisions at age " robert said mr farella who had known robert for decades was glad he was having one of his more lucid days robert had struggled with mental confusion over the past year although robert flew to the mayo clinic for a full workup he didnt return home with a clear diagnosis of his problem a neurologist at university of california at san francisco eventually put him on namendo a drug prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia associated with alzheimers disease robert was convinced that day that somehow the situation would work out and perhaps his offspring would find a way to buy back the oakville winery twenty seven hundred miles away from napa valley as the leaves on the grapevines began to redden the upheaval at mondavi had caught the attention of another pair of brothers who were on the prowl for acquisitions richard and robert sands who were respectively chairman and president of constellation brands inc sitting behind his modern green desk in fairport n y richard sands monitored the mondavi news as it arrived on his flat panel screen that fall most intriguing to the sandses and their advisers was that michael unlike his siblings seemed to be signaling the market that he for one hoped to cash out michael had his investment banker at perseus group reach out to the sandses and other potential buyers through back channels to drum up interest in a sale true to the mondavi history of palace intrigues michaels action came at a time when his brother and sister were desperately hoping to buy back the oakville winery where it had all begun and particularly a portion of the to kalon vineyards where their mothers ashes had been scattered in coming months the sandses orchestrated a billion dollar purchase of americas most famous wine brand the deal meant an enormous payday for the family michaels take was worth more than &# million while timothys was somewhat less than &# million and marcias was the highest at about &# million robert himself would net around &# million most of which would be needed to get him out of his bind with his philanthropies yet timothy and marcia along with many mondavi employees were in tears as the legacy of americas first family of wine was sold off to the highest bidder adapted from "the house of mondavi the rise and fall of an american wine dynasty" by julia flynn siler copyright julia flynn siler published by gotham books
