this country he is widely regarded as the english neil simon an ultrareliable purveyor of well made comedies for suburbanites and only a handful of his odd plays have been produced on or near broadway but those who were lucky enough to see "private fears in public places" at the brits off broadway festival or the film that alain resnais made out of it last year know that mr ayckbourns "comedies" of middle class life are deadly serious and more often than not darkly melancholy would that more of them were produced in new york fortunately brits off broadway is now bringing us the american premiere of "intimate exchanges " a cycle of eight head bangingly funny plays that leaves no possible doubt of mr ayckbourns seriousness or his ingenuity all eight plays draw on the same cast of characters all of whom are played by two actors bill champion and claudia elmhirst all of the plays start the same way with a woman strolling into her garden on a sunny june day and trying to decide whether to smoke a cigarette the best possible explanation of what happens next is mr ayckbourns own supplied in a letter he wrote to his agent in "mathematically it works that after about five seconds after curtain up we go into a choice of first scenes these two first scenes lead in turn to a choice of four second scenes these again lead to the interval and a choice of eight third scenes which start the second act finally these eight scenes themselves divide for a series of minute last scenes of which there are in all " what sounds impossibly complicated on paper turns out to be perfectly transparent on stage the six main characters are a trio of suburban couples two married one not who have reached turning points in their increasingly unsatisfying lives mr ayckbourn sends them down a series of divergent plot paths that lead to different endings some happy and others not along the way they become entangled in the farce like situations that are his specialty and you laugh yourself silly as the hijinks grow more frenzied sooner or later though the laughter dies away and you see that "intimate exchanges" is really about what happens as we grow older and are forced to live with the consequences of the casual choices we make every day "i thought as you got older you needed less loving but in fact you need more " one of mr ayckbourns characters plaintively confesses alas few of them get very much at all and thats what makes "intimate exchanges" so powerful rarely have i seen so honest a portrayal of the inexorably shrinking sense of possibility that is an inevitable concomitant of middle age this too is one of mr ayckbourns specialties he writes comedies with unhappy endings you cant get much truer to life than that it isnt necessary to see all eight plays in order to enjoy "intimate exchanges " each version stands on its own and can be understood without reference to the others but the more of them you see the more fully youll appreciate mr ayckbourns brilliant conceit and the more impressed youll be by the wonderfully varied performances of mr champion and ms elmhirst both of whom are members of the playwrights own stephen joseph theatre the yorkshire company where this production originated to see them switch from character to character without dropping a stitch or blowing a line is a joy in and of itself how long do you get to be promising neil labute has been writing a play a year since and "in a dark dark house " the latest of his dramatic studies of men behaving badly is no better or worse than most of its predecessors with which it shares a now familiar catalog of virtues and vices this time around we get two brothers one of whom is a self hating security guard frederick weller and the other a successful businessman ron livingston who is locked up in a high priced sanitarium as the curtain rises what follows is the usual parade of anger manipulation and insufficiently surprising plot twists complicated by the presence of a year old girl louisa krause who knows too much about the facts of life the acting is impeccable the staging by carolyn cantor smart and sharp but deja vu sets in well before the end of the first scene and never goes away yes mr labute is talented too much so to keep on playing the same hand over and over again why doesnt he try something completely different mr teachout the journals
