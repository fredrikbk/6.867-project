a terror catch in jakarta chalk one up for the good guys this weeks arrest of an alleged leader of jemaah islamiyah ji is the most notable victory yet for indonesias four year old crack counterterrorism squad its also a sign of what committed antiterror governments can accomplish even in countries with majority muslim populations abu dujana is a major catch by any measure a long time terrorist he started his training in explosives small arms and guerrilla tactics as early as while fighting with the mujahadeen in afghanistan he befriended other future leaders of ji including hambali mastermind of the bali bombings zulkarnaen jis military operations leader and abu rusdan who helped shelter at least one of the bali bombers before serving as jis no dujana is believed to have been critical to jis ability to function as a broad based terror network stretching from indonesia to the southern philippines his loss could prove a major disruption to jis training logistics and weapons procurement efforts especially if he rats out his fellow terrorists more broadly dujana was one of the few leaders who bridged operational factions within ji his arrest doesnt necessarily presage jis dissolution but it will complicate life for any successor the heroes here are members of detachment indonesias elite counterterrorism security squad organized with u s and australian support in the wake of the bali bombing the force has steadily gained expertise and morale over its brief life as each new raid has yielded more information about jis terrorist network arrests have been growing in number and frequency the unit can claim ji kills or captures the raid that snared dujana and seven alleged accomplices followed a similar round up in march detachment s strengths are offset by the weaknesses of an indonesian court system that is still woefully inadequate to tackling complex terrorism cases as the muddled prosecution of bali mastermind abu bakar bashir showed and indonesian prisons are becoming hotbeds of radicalization not least because many jails dont separate terror suspects cum proselytizers from potential recruits looming in the background is jakartas failure to ban jemaah islamiyah largely for domestic political reasons nonetheless indonesia has come a long way in a short time and detachment shows what a small but elite squad can accomplish indonesians have been especially successful at collecting human intelligence and combining it with more high tech intelligence programs dujanas arrest is another sign that the u s is not alone in resisting radical islams terror methods
