golden years as boomers retire insurers aim to cash in axa sees opportunity in savings worries global annuities race when baby boomers were in midcareer and eager to build nest eggs the mutual fund banking and brokerage industries swooped in and took advantage now the insurance industry is eyeing that huge pile of money hoping to build a global business soothing anxiety over whether those nest eggs will last as boomers retire and live long the result is a world wide race to sell variable annuities a product with risks for insurers and a checkered past for u s consumers thanks to unscrupulous sales practices by some brokers and third party agents they typically offer regular payments for life no matter how long a customer lives "insurance companies have historically been kind of sleepy " says christopher "kip" condron the u s chief of the giant french insurer axa sa "but banks and mutual funds cant offer these kinds of guarantees so we looked at the situation and said this is our era " axa is making one of the biggest pushes around the globe into variable annuities highlighting the promises and pitfalls of the market it has "risk labs" in new york and paris trying to predict what the future holds for longevity and financial markets could a surprise medical breakthrough a cure for cancer for instance wreak havoc on the companys longevity models average life spans have been rising for years in the u s and europe in japan more than people are now older than "longevity is a difficult risk to price " says simon harris who heads a group of european insurance analysts for moodys investors service in london "unlike pricing a motor insurance policy where the risks are pretty well understood and you can reprice each year with longevity you have to put a price today on risks that will emerge many years into the future " the pool of potential assets and customers is enormous in the u s alone more than &# trillion sits in investment and insurance accounts earmarked for retirement according to swiss reinsurance co in other countries there are trillions of dollars more axa is pushing harder with variable annuities into more markets outside the u s than are most of its peers but other insurers are also chasing the global market including american companies such as hartford financial services group inc metropolitan life insurance co and american international group inc and foreign ones including dutch companies aegon nv and ing groep nv and germanys allianz se "life expectancy seems to be going up everywhere " says henri de castries axas chief executive and management board chairman "that has huge long term implications and should be a huge opportunity for us " insurers see annuities as their chance to capture "the customers who fueled the mutual fund boom " says thomas godlasky chief executive and president of life insurer aviva usa "the numbers are pretty staggering " in the u s consumers have more than &# trillion invested in variable annuity accounts up more than from five years ago according to the national association of variable annuities a trade group in foreign markets where the product is new the growth is more rapid in japan for example variable annuity assets have topped &# billion in just a few years at the end of march axa had about &# billion in variable annuity accounts in the u s in other countries where its variable annuity offerings are new axa has gathered less than &# million of assets so far in a simple annuity contract the customer pays upfront and the insurance company makes regular income payments usually for life a variable annuity gives the customer a bunch of additional choices in the u s his upfront payments go into a tax deferred investment account earmarked for retirement in retirement the customer can stick with the account drawing out money to live on and eventually get a death benefit for his heirs or he can swap the account for guaranteed retirement income for life although that typically means losing the death benefits for insurers the risk is twofold if financial markets go into a long funk lots of variable annuity customers might opt for guaranteed income and insurers could find themselves making payments that exceed customers account assets and fees likewise if the customers opting for guaranteed income live far longer than expected insurers might have to pay out more than anticipated for consumers the risk lies in the complexity of figuring out when the costs exceed the benefits in the u s the national association of securities dealers has brought more than disciplinary actions since alleging improper annuity sales tactics by advisers brokers or agents among the most common complaints the sale of variable annuities to customers who are too old to benefit from income guarantees or who will need to tap their accounts early triggering "surrender" fees another frequent complaint is the shifting of customers from one annuity to another which boosts adviser commissions fees have also been criticized customers usually pay commissions plus separate charges to withdraw money early annual fees average nearly according to morningstar inc about one percentage point higher than the average u s stock mutual fund although the latter offers no guaranteed income or death benefit options elisse walter who oversees regulatory policy and programs for the nasd says the unique "bells and whistles" of annuities make them tough for both customers and their advisers to understand the nasd has proposed a new rule that would require advisers to receive training on annuities and for managers of advisory firms to review all variable annuity sales the securities and exchange commission is reviewing the proposal ms walter says axa is one of the insurers trying to curb sales problems by better training outside financial advisers mr de castries says the problem doesnt lie in the products themselves but in selling them to people who either dont understand them or who buy products that dont fit their needs a car salesman he says might be wrong to sell a ferrari to a year old but that doesnt mean the ferrari isnt a good car stock market declines earlier this decade he says shocked baby boomers who had come to count on double digit annual returns from stocks setting the table for the variable annuity pitch "the big wake up call was the simultaneous decline of interest rates and the stock market between and " he says which left boomers worried about their retirement planning "people were forced to rethink the whole issue " axa based in paris grew from a regional mutual insurer into a global giant through more than two decades of deals and expansion into new markets mr de castries years old was appointed to the top job in last year it reported billion euros or &# billion of net income on billion euros or &# billion of revenue in march about top axa executives gathered in paris to brainstorm about global opportunities mr condron its u s chief suggested going after the global market of people reaching retirement age the company later decided to focus on variable annuities which it has sold in the u s since the downturn in stocks "made these kinds of guarantees far more attractive than they were in " says mr condron in western europe there was another factor it was becoming clear that government and corporate pension plans would have a hard time delivering promised benefits nevertheless taking variable annuities global hasnt been easy for axa each country in western europe has distinct tax code quirks and insurance regulations "the devil is in the details with these things because regulation is local " says mr de castries in the u s axa sells a variable annuity called the accumulator last year it launched locally tailored versions in germany japan and the united kingdom so far this year it has introduced them in spain italy and france and it plans to roll them out by year end in belgium australia and hong kong "you have to make it appealing for local customers says mr de castries "customer behavior can be very different from one country to another " in germany for example axa discovered that most buyers of variable annuities opt to make periodic upfront payments rather than to invest one lump sum across the border in belgium where a local version is being prepared for market axa believes past consumer behavior suggests that people might do the opposite for axa and its competitors people like michael davenport of birmingham england are prime prospects a year old retired electrician mr davenport has a pension from his former employer auto maker jaguar he and his wife decided to convert extra savings into an annuity that would supplement that income mr davenport says because his and his wifes own mothers were alive and well at ages and respectively "were all living longer and we hope to live a lot longer " mr davenport says "so having income that lasts as long as we do is a significant concern " earlier this year with help from british financial adviser hargreaves lansdown he chose an annuity from one of axas competitors canada life it offers lifetime income pegged to inflation not to the financial markets he paid about &# upfront he and his wife will receive about &# a year for as long as one of them is alive a payment that will rise with inflation when they both die their heirs will receive annual payments for another decade selling annuities and other life insurance products tends to be labor intensive customers typically dont go out shopping for them they get interested after theyre pitched by financial advisers axas marketing strategy in the u s focuses partly on education it helped set up an outside training program on retirement issues for advisers and has sponsored more than free seminars on longevity and lifetime income for more than customers and advisers in the u s the seminars dont include product pitches mr condron says "our advisers offer to meet with people after the seminar " he says axa is testing similar approaches overseas behind the scenes axa has devoted considerable effort to controlling the long term financial risks associated with its variable annuity push some other insurers that set variable annuity income guarantees too high during the s were hurt when the stock market declined in analysts and industry experts say aegon retooled its variable annuity guarantees in and honed its risk management efforts for instance according to its annual report in new york and paris axa has put together teams of accountants investment managers and actuaries experts at using longevity data to project future life spans mr de castries calls the groups "risk labs " they feed mortality and markets data into complex models to try to figure out how much axa would have to pay to fulfill various annuity contracts under different scenarios and how much it should charge for them today every day they calculate axas exposure to market declines and they look for ways to hedge against it axa uses futures and options for example to protect against deep declines in stocks and interest rates at axas variable annuity hedge unit in new york actuaries and an investment group of eight staffers model stress tests some based on doomsday scenarios it would be especially bad for example if average life spans rose sharply at the same time a lengthy financial crisis hit the u s economy perhaps sparked by a terrorist attack or a stock market crash the units goal is to charge enough for variable annuities for the company to profit in normal years and to stay comfortably afloat in the event of a perfect storm of unfavorable events
