can a virtual fence help seal u s border new camera towers system in arizona is set for a test eyes on immigration reform the bush administrations push for immigration reform will face a serious test in a distant corner of arizona this weekend as the government begins evaluating the first mile section of an electronic "virtual fence" intended to seal the nations borders the government is expected to take possession soon of the first set of camera towers that boeing co has built along the border with mexico the foot tall structures are supposed to give the homeland security department an unblinking eye on anyone or anything attempting to cross into the u s illegally the systems ability to deliver as promised could determine the fate of the immigration reform measures now being debated in washington passage of those measures depends in large part on persuading skeptical republicans to accept the administrations assurances that it will be able to effectively police u s borders by the end of next year yesterday president bush sought to salvage a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill that stalled in the senate last week amid opposition from republicans who wanted the legislation beefed up with border security and law enforcement provisions mr bush endorsed a proposal to divert &# billion collected from fees and penalties toward improving border security and increasing workplace enforcement of immigration laws some of that money would be likely to support initiatives like boeings virtual fence for the first section of the fence the chicago aerospace company outfitted nine towers spaced out along a particularly active section of border just southwest of tucson with video cameras and radar that can zoom in on people up to five miles away and detect automobiles as far away as miles the information will be beamed to a command center and to a fleet of specially equipped customs and border patrol vehicles alerting federal agents to attempts by drug smugglers human traffickers or would be immigrants to sneak across the border the plan has its doubters "fences virtual or otherwise dont stop immigrants law enforcement agents do " says t j bonner president of the union representing working border patrol agents some agents also are concerned that deep pocketed drug cartels will be able to develop or buy technology to defeat the system asa hutchinson who was border security czar under former homeland security secretary tom ridge views barriers as doomed to fail unless accompanied by an immigration overhaul that takes pressure off the borders without a legal option for people to enter the country they will find ways to get in illegally he argues boeing received an initial &# million contract last year to begin developing the system if it works the government envisions erecting hundreds of camera towers along the borders with mexico and canada they are being touted as a cost effective way of monitoring borders between the u s mexico and canada without stringing thousands of miles of conventional fence nobody has more riding on the success of the project than homeland security secretary michael chertoff who backed it in as the centerpiece of the administrations efforts to gain control of the nations borders the plan also includes more arrests of illegal immigrants working inside the country and faster deportations the homeland security department currently estimates that the virtual fence called sbinet will cost about &# billion through although the agencys inspector general wrote last november that the cost could balloon to &# billion "our main concern about sbinet is that dhs is embarking on this multibillion dollar acquisition project without having laid the foundation to effectively oversee and assess contractor performance and effectively control cost and schedule " inspector general richard skinner told the house oversight and government reform committee "we are looking for the right balance between staffing technology and tactical infrastructure to keep adequate track of the activity along the border " says greg giddens the governments executive director for the program he said that one underlying requirement for all of the governments activities is the need for surveillance "as soon as somebody crosses over we want to be able to see them on camera or radar and then continue to track them " to help protect the towers against vandals officials have set up a system of sensors that will sound an alarm if somebody gets too close to one of the structures each tower is also equipped with a "hailer horn " which can broadcast warnings at a volume equivalent to that of a jetliner taking off the horns will enable agents in the main operations center to pick up a microphone and shout warnings to anybody who looks suspicious officials say border patrol chief david aguilar recently assured lawmakers that there was no question that that sbinet would be successful "sbinet will utilize the latest innovative technology cameras biometrics sensors air assets improved communications systems to provide the force multiplier that the cbp agents and officers need to execute the agencys mission in the safest and most effective manner " he said officials say information from the radar motion sensors and long range cameras will be beamed directly to agents patrol vehicles giving them the ability to respond quickly to illegal crossings in urban areas before immigrants can disappear into the local population in remote areas officials say they hope to be able to detect immigrants early enough to be able to intercept them when convenient whether the system will work as advertised though remains to be seen and congress will be watching carefully to determine if it is worth its pricetag some lawmakers like rep mark souder r ind the ranking republican on the house homeland security border subcommittee question whether the departments estimate that the project will cost about &# billion by is accurate and whether it has a plan for maintaining equipment and technology beyond that date paul a schneider homeland security undersecretary for management recently told lawmakers that the sbinet was managed by "one of the most experienced program managers in government" and that program included several checks and balances for example he said the contract that was awarded to boeing in september of has a base period of three years with three one year option periods based on performance although most of the towers are miles from civilization the government and boeing have already raised hackles among the residents of the tiny desert town of arivaca ariz miles north of the border residents say that on short notice and with little opportunity for them to object boeing built a tower on a hillside within sight of where most of the towns residents live "when i look out my window at night i can see the red light on top of the tower and i know that theres a camera right beneath it that could be looking back at me " says roger beal co owner of the towns only store the arivaca mercantile government officials say that boeing put the camera outside arivaca because it was the first relatively flat terrain north of the border nearer to the border the land is rife with gullies washes and outcroppings that would allow illegal visitors to pass unnoticed mr giddens sbis executive director said that enough safeguards are in place to prevent agents from abusing the cameras "but we realize that we will have to show them by our actions " he said
