global infrastructure boom lifts terex machinery companies see soaring demand in developing nations terex corp has long been known as the bargain basement of heavy equipment makers selling its mining trucks and rock crushers for low prices compared to better known producers like caterpillar inc but a global infrastructure boom has transformed the companys prospects over the past four years demand for terex machines has soared along with other machinery brands as the worlds fastest growing economies pour money into new ports power plants and pavement while surging commodity prices have kept mining exploration in overdrive all that earthmoving requires hordes of big machines to dig lift and flatten "people around the world have realized that infrastructure leads to economic development says ronald m defeo terexs chairman and chief executive officer "thats whats driving our business " indeed the infrastructure boom isnt just benefiting heavy equipment producers general electric co ceo jeffrey immelt recently quipped that "infrastructure" has replaced "plastics" as a catchword for economic opportunity in the first quarter revenue in ges infrastructure group rose to &# billion while operating profit climbed to &# billion similarly spx corp a charlotte n c manufacturer of thermal equipment and industrial products has taken to emphasizing to investors that of its revenue now come from the i word most notably the sale of cooling towers for new power plants going up in places like china and south africa "theres no question that infrastructure is the new buzzword for industrial companies " says christopher kearney spxs ceo infrastructure spending can be tough to quantify in part because its a vast category that encompasses both public and private investments but the world bank and australias macquarie bank ltd estimate the worlds infrastructure spending needs on everything from roads and rails to telephone lines water and electricity generation will total &# billion from to much of that growth will come from the developing world particularly asia last month an indian planning official said infrastructure investment there is expected to rise to of gross domestic product by and from about of gdp today at about of indias approximate &# trillion economy total infrastructure investment would come to about &# billion a year all this has helped push terex into its current economic sweet spot the company based in westport conn had net income of &# million in the first quarter on &# billion in sales up from a year ago while its order backlog ballooned to &# billion up sales last year were &# billion up from &# billion in aided in part by two large acquisitions but also representing strong organic growth the company is vowing to keep it up mr defeo has set a goal of hitting &# billion in sales by shares of terex which stood at &# at the start of now fetch over &# factoring in an intervening stock split ronald muhlenkamp president of investment adviser muhlenkamp &amp co in wexford pa a terex investor says the companys prospects are closely tied to global spending on infrastructure and mining "two years from now people will use more oil more steel and more copper and to do that they need what terex has to offer " he says "their businesses today are all booming in mining material processing and cranes " says robert mccarthy an analyst at robert w baird &amp co inc in chicago adding that those sectors always shine late in the business cycle not everything is rosy terexs construction equipment business has struggled with high costs and softer sales of a line of material handling machines the business faces the challenge of having its production base centered in high cost europe the strong euro makes it difficult for europe made machinery to compete in the north american market says mr mccarthy "they have to work to get themselves better balanced like their larger competitors have done over the last decade " he adds by balanced he means having factories spread across the globe that provides built in protection against unpredictable currency shifts terex currently draws more than of its sales outside north america if the companys genie aerial work platform business which is concentrated in the u s is removed from the mix mr defeo says he continues to look for opportunities to expand production in low cost countries including china and other fast growing markets "a longer term challenge for us is getting a big enough footprint in the brics " he says using the acronym for brazil russia india and china terex was long run as a loose holding company with a minimalist central office in connecticut but mr defeo has expanded the companys headquarters recently moving into new offices and spurred greater integration among its businesses in order to compete more effectively he notes for instance that the companys far flung operations buy almost as much steel as car maker bmw ag but only recently began amalgamating its purchasing to squeeze better prices from steel suppliers another challenge for terex and all equipment producers is simply getting suppliers to expand output to meet their needs large tires in particular are in short supply and have acted as a bottleneck on terexs output mr defeo says terexs focus on infrastructure has minimized the impact of the u s housing slump terex makes some equipment used in residential construction but the vast bulk is used in larger commercial and government projects "nonresidential demand in the u s is phenomenal " says mr defeo adding that many cities are forced to invest in decaying infrastructure simply to maintain the status quo a more subtle challenge facing mr defeo is changing the way his company and its products are perceived in the marketplace until about six years ago terexs sales slogan was "simple available and cost effective " an open acknowledgement that their machines were generally cheaper and lacked the sophistication of machines made by many other producers mr mccarthy the analyst says terexs acquisitions are one reason its no longer possible to make such blanket statements among other things in the company bought demag mobile cranes a producer renowned for top quality that charges premium prices "i dont think it would be appropriate today to characterize value priced products as the standard terex business model " he says "its definitely the ongoing model in some of their businesses but not in others " corrections &amp amplifications terex corp s shares traded at &# at the start of adjusting for a for
