international group inc in march at age mr greenberg stepped down as chief executive of aig during a probe by then new york attorney general eliot spitzer he soon dropped his chairman title too leaving the insurance powerhouse he built now mr greenberg heads two firms once affiliated with aig and named after its founder cornelius vander starr the firms hold &# billion in aig stock under mr greenbergs control they have been raising cash by selling aig shares he wants starr international co to be a player in the world of private money and he is expanding the reach of the other firm insurance brokerage c v starr &amp co two years after the divorce acrimony persists aig and mr greenberg disagree on how starr internationals holdings in aig shares can be used mr greenberg is fighting the remaining charges from his years at aig after mr spitzer dropped a number of them shortly before being elected governor this week mr greenberg filed court papers seeking the testimony of current aig executives in that case meanwhile aig is suing mr greenberg and another former executive for &# billion mr greenberg dismisses the latest suit as based on "old allegations" and adds "i have done nothing wrong and intend to hold accountable those responsible for false and reckless allegations and actions " here are excerpts of a recent interview which took place before the latest legal developments the wall street journal was there any point at which you thought about just stopping day to day business altogether mr greenberg never crossed my mind wsj why not mr greenberg why yes im good at what i do and i like doing it wsj have your workdays changed substantially in any way from when you were at aig mr greenberg longer im serious its exciting to be doing things that are building to me that makes my adrenaline flow wsj can you describe a typical set of workdays mr greenberg it starts on the phone in the early morning youve got international calls about oclock i get here to and work until about or i usually have a dinner or something after that cause im still involved in a lot of nonprofit things new york hospital cornell medical school the council on foreign relations nixon center in washington and then i take a briefcase home every night two of them on weekends i do a lot of catch up reading on weekends wsj when you started out two years ago trying to build these businesses post aig what was your vision for each of them and to what extent has that vision changed mr greenberg it hasnt changed c v starr &amp co had four insurance agencies we obviously had to find new companies to represent which we did didnt take very long to do that weve now started another new general agency in the health field then we have a lloyds syndicate that we started and that syndicate also is represented in china were in the midst of forming a life and general insurance company in bermuda in starr international we have an office in hong kong an office in shanghai and in beijing and were opening an office in russia russia today is a different country than it was five years ago the oil and gas revenues have changed the economics in russia theres more than a trickle down effect to a middle class moscows probably the most expensive city in the world every time i go there its more expensive i may pitch a tent next time we started a commercial real estate business were looking at a consumer finance business and were looking at a residential mortgage business when you start something youre like a magnet you attract other opportunities wsj why do you like working in foreign markets mr greenberg thats where the opportunities are russia is a very fast growing economy i grew up in the insurance business which is a risk business thats what its all about if you dont take risks get out of the business wsj do you see any other opportunities there for diversification in the economy that interest you particularly mr greenberg almost everything is going to be an opportunity health care for example were exploring an opportunity to create a private health care facility it looks very attractive the main event on the investment side right now is in china were exploring health care they have a broken system and it creates an opportunity for a private health care structure ive spoken to the ministry of health im working with several hospitals here and medical schools here about setting up facilities that are the highest grade of quality and im pretty pleased with some of the progress almost everything is growing in china ive never been as busy quite frankly as i am now wsj there are lots of sources of private money with various names like hedge funds and private equity whats your vision for starr international mr greenberg most of those have to raise capital we do not although ive been offered capital tons of capital from all over the world and one day we may do that its a possibility but weve had no need for it which is a very attractive way to be the vision i have is that were going to be partly merchant bank and partly still in insurance what is a merchant bank a merchant bank in my definition is that you dont always invest to create profit like a private equity firm and liquidate in five or six years you may keep it in perpetuity or you may sell it at some time down the road five years there are very few merchant banks left most have a quick trigger i think we can have a longer term horizon wsj the entities that you control have a stake in aig does that change the way you view the company now that youre on the outside mr greenberg look i think aig has a great franchise which i think i helped build it depends how the franchise is used that will determine the future i hope it does well and if it doesnt ill be just another investor and decide as an investor should wsj how do you decide when and how to sell shares and does that have an effect on the share price mr greenberg aig trades between five and seven million shares a day normally the amount of stock we sell is insignificant compared to that wsj so you dont think it has any impact on the share price mr greenberg i think very little the value of aig shares will be determined on how well it does or doesnt do they had a good year in if you didnt have a good year in the property casualty field in you should get out of the insurance business wsj how do you feel about the company going forward mr greenberg i cant tell you have to wait and see wsj youre still fighting the remaining charges related to your time at aig is there any part of that experience that motivates you in what youre doing now mr greenberg most of the charges were dropped whats left had very minimal influence on the financials of aig minimal im determined to fight even those which i feel that well be very successful in doing because i know i did nothing improper wsj how do you think that you are perceived by the public at large at this point mr greenberg i really dont know i dont take a poll
