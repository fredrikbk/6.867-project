politics &amp economics industries show uncertainty over rulings impact some favor regulation from congress others from federal agencies yesterdays supreme court decision over global warming emissions is the latest sign that greenhouse gases are about to affect u s industry and the economy in a big way even before yesterdays ruling many big businesses concluded it was only a matter of time before they were hit with a rule that will limit how much fossil fuel they can burn how such regulation will affect particular industries and companies remains unclear because the rules have yet to be written and will be the subject of an intensifying fight in washington limits on auto emissions would add further urgency to the efforts of detroits big three auto makers to wean themselves from their dependence on gas guzzling large vehicles amid massive losses limits on emissions from utilities could pressure those that rely heavily on coal which supplies roughly half of u s electricity but is a major source of greenhouse gases oil producers steelmakers building materials suppliers airlines and other industries could be affected as well on the other hand limits could also add greater impetus to growing investments in a new generation of fuel efficient technology including improved gasoline hybrid engines and electric cars clean coal technology and greater investment in nuclear power the response from different industries was mixed underscoring the uncertainty over future policy the ruling may have the result of businesses pushing congress for regulation industry traditionally has opposed legislative efforts to regulate global warming emissions but some industries particularly utilities may conclude they are likely to get a more flexible less onerous policy one that spreads the effect over a number of industries instead of concentrating on a few from congress than a federal agency "it throws more uncertainty up into the air for industry " said phil sharp president of resources for the future a washington energy policy research organization the auto industry has taken the opposite approach and has argued that the administration and not congress should set future gas mileage standards the supreme court decision concerns regulation only of those global warming emissions from cars and trucks but its effect is likely to be far broader it ruled that carbon dioxide the chief global warming culprit falls under the legal definition of pollutants that the federal government has authority to regulate that decision is likely to boost pressure on the government to limit carbon dioxide emissions from a variety of sources industry groups generally said in response that any federal constraint should affect all sectors of the economy to spread the pain the edison electric institute which represents utilities said any regulation should be a "consistent national program that sets reasonable emissions reduction requirements for all sectors of the u s economy " yet officials hastened to add that they "neither endorse nor oppose mandatory greenhouse gas regulations " that reflects a split among utilities over a federal regulation the auto industry is similarly jittery several domestic and foreign auto makers referred inquiries to the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group that group issued a brief statement calling for a "national federal economy wide approach to addressing greenhouse gases " the statement reflects the auto industrys increasing concern that a proliferation of differing state policies on global warming from california to the northeast could prove costlier to the industry than a single federal policy would already the auto industry has seen its control over the fuel economy fight slip congress is pushing to mandate annual increases in federal fuel economy rules over the next decade general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group have said such changes to the rules known as corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards would be prohibitively expensive and technologically unfeasible a recent assessment by the white house puts the cost of such an overhaul over the next decade at more than &# billion the brunt of that would be borne by domestic auto makers heads of the big three and japans toyota motor corp told a congressional panel two weeks ago that that they would support increased mileage standards but only if rule making power remained with the transportation department that arrangement is favored by the bush administration
