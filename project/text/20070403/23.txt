corporate focus business is zell just joining ranks of poor newspaper fans last weekends "billionaires bid for tribune" headlines were enough to warm the hearts of us dickensian scribes who still seek to make a living from impressions on wood pulp savvy chicagoan sam zell sold much of his u s real estate empire at the top of the market could his deal to buy tribune co the big media company based in chicago be a signal that newspapers have hit bottom and are ready to rise maybe but its also possible that mr zell is just joining the ranks of rich men who having made their fortune elsewhere are now ready to lose some of it in publishing take michael steinhardt for example an early hedge fund pioneer whose reputation as a canny investor has been belied by his stake in the new york sun a small conservative daily launched in mr steinhardt acknowledges his initial interest in the newspaper went beyond its value as an investment still he had hoped to make some money for a contrarian investor like mr zell he says newspapers fit in that category of businesses "whose prospects in the eyes of the broad universe reflect dimly " he adds "from my limited experience they fit that category with ample justification " or take david bradley who made a fortune in the consulting business before buying another niche publication the atlantic monthly from another u s real estate mogul turned newspaperman mort zuckerman in a interview with the new york observer mr bradley confessed that while the magazine racked up losses of &# million a year under mr zuckerman "in its worst year under me it lost &# million " ever the optimist mr bradley now says the news business still has promise "but there is such a sobering valley to walk through before you break into the highlands " and then theres mr zuckerman who owns the daily news in new york and u s news &amp world report magazine ask him if the news business has hit bottom and he responds "its going to get a lot tougher " most daily newspapers still make money they tend to have steady cash flow and nice double digit profit margins but the trend lines are relentlessly negative circulation is falling advertising is falling and the classified ad business which for some regional papers once accounted for nearly a third of revenues is migrating to more efficient online services like craigslist in response newspapers have scrambled to move their offerings to the internet which ultimately could save them the daunting costs of newsprint printing plants and early morning delivery systems what remains in doubt however is whether online readers will ever devote the kind of time and attention to a news web site that tv sitcom dad ward cleaver used to devote to his morning paper at the breakfast table if readers dont give it the attention advertisers wont give it the money and the ability to support a serious news organization will break down "the economic potential of a newspaper internet site given the many alternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away is at best a small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition " writes investor warren buffett in his latest berkshire hathaway inc annual report "we are likely therefore to see noneconomic individual buyers of newspapers emerge just as we have seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises " mr zell insists hes buying the tribune for economic reasons and he has this going in his favor he managed to get effective control of a very large company valued by this deal at &# billion with relatively little of his own money &# million think of it as buying an &# house with just &# down moreover hes left much of the downside risk with tribune employees who will own the companys stock through their employee stock ownership plan if things go well he can get in on the upside by exercising his option to buy of the stock at a bargain price in the meantime he can experience the joys of running the hometown paper which mr zuckerman says are substantial "i just love it " he says and who knows maybe in the end mr zell will be the one who figures out how to take newspapers profitably into the future alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
