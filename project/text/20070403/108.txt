politics &amp economics money talks what does it mean romneys strong showing muddies republican field washington the first peek at republican presidential candidates early fund raising totals confirms that the party has a reshuffled and unsettled race for the presidential nomination former massachusetts gov mitt romney earned a second and deeper look at his candidacy by reporting yesterday that he raised nearly &# million this year to lead his partys pack in first quarter fund raising in contrast arizona sen john mccain who had already lost his front runner status in polls reported an admittedly disappointing &# million for a third place finish second place went instead to rudy giuliani who collected nearly &# million despite his late start which along with his strong poll showings confirms the former new york mayors status as republicans current hot property "our contest is pretty wide open and very fluid " says former republican national committee chairman ed gillespie the candidates first quarter fund raising performance he adds "cements the perception that there is a top tier of these three candidates " though "im not sure the field is fully formed " indeed absent from the january through march money chase was former senator and "law and order" actor fred thompson who immediately registered in double digits in national polls of republicans last month after confirming he is considering running for president the same goes for several others who have put off decisions until later this year to see how the current field fares those prospective candidates include former house speaker newt gingrich and sen chuck hagel of nebraska several republicans who are in the race remain far back in the pack in fund raising as well as the polls including former arkansas gov mike huckabee kansas sen sam brownback and rep tom tancredo of colorado the fund raising figures are the candidates bottom line previews of more detailed financial disclosure reports due at the federal election commission april covering the years first quarter that ended at midnight saturday those reports are a much anticipated window into candidates relative strength and support they constitute a "money primary" that has taken on added importance given the campaigns early start pending the details later this month democratic new york sen hillary clinton on sunday led off the candidates self selected statements with her announcement that she raised &# million in the first three months of the year a first quarter record but for the first time in a presidential race that total includes not just contributions for the primary campaign but for a general election campaign that can only be tapped if and when a candidate becomes the party nominee by law individuals can give a maximum &# to a candidate for the primary contest and another &# for the general election following mrs clintons lead many candidates have begun asking contributors for &# agreeing to return half if they arent nominated it isnt clear how much of mrs clintons money is for the primary and how much for the general election her campaign didnt disclose the breakdown by contrast the romney campaign said all of the money he has raised this year is for the primary season only suggesting he has raised more than mrs clinton for the first phase of the campaign nonetheless mrs clintons total is nearly as much as the sums collected by all four democratic rivals who divulged their bottom lines sunday former north carolina sen john edwards new mexico gov bill richardson and sens christopher dodd of connecticut and joe biden of delaware still to be heard from is her closest rival illinois sen barack obama he is widely expected to have raised more than &# million since january one fund raiser working for the first term senator said mr obama may have out raised mrs clinton once the general election donations are subtracted a spokesman said the campaign probably wont tip its hand for several days because it is tallying money from more than "house parties" held nationwide on saturday the news yesterday then centered on the republican candidates mr mccain had lowered expectations in the past couple of weeks telling reporters he hadnt met his targets even so his &# million stunned republicans as well as democrats a mccain spokesman emphasized that the senator had received contributions from nearly individuals far more than mr romney in a measure of grass roots support though the amounts were generally small averaging &# but campaign manager terry nelson conceded disappointment "although we are pleased with the organization weve built and polls show us strongly positioned in key primary states we had hoped to do better in first quarter fund raising " he said adding "fund raising in the first quarter is no more important than fund raising throughout the entire primary election campaign " he promised unspecified steps to boost donations and a spokesman said those would include changes encouraging competition among mccain fund raisers nationwide to raise the most money mr mccains prominence as a supporter of the war in iraq has hurt him in national polls but his stance remains a popular one among most republican voters and activists at the same time many big donors perceive that his pro war image could make mr mccain unelectable so they have been reluctant to support him and his record as a party maverick has made him suspect among many rank and file conservatives mr romney playing for those conservatives support has been tarred for months by an image of inconsistency after repeated reports of his previous support for abortion and gay rights in polls of republican voters he remains stalled in single digits what isnt clear from his fund raising total is whether his nearly &# million reflects a steady stream of contributions or whether donations have tapered off since january when a drumbeat of negative media reports began former rep vin weber of minnesota a top romney adviser but not one who is responsible for fund raising says mr romneys fund raising over past months has "been pretty consistent romney actually likes doing it and in my experience thats about half the battle and of course he has a huge network " the wealthy mr romney also loaned his campaign &# million for a &# million total "i think hes surprised people " says mr gillespie the former party chairman "the fact that he had a big quarter reminds me a little of edwards in when his big quarter got him a fresh look " of course mr edwards didnt win the nomination in nor have many others who won early attention for fund raising prowess in past campaigns among them republicans john connally and phil gramm and democrat howard dean
