court rulings could hit utilities auto makers white house strategy toward co emissions is faulted by justices washington in a decision that could mark a turning point in the national debate over climate change a divided supreme court ruled that carbon dioxide and other so called greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the clean air act and that the bush administration broke the law in its refusal to limit emissions of those gases the decision was a victory for environmental groups which had pushed for such a ruling and a blow to the nations auto and utility industries among others as well as the white house the bush administration has steadfastly opposed mandatory curbs on the emission of greenhouse gases which most scientists believe contribute to global warming environmentalists won a second victory yesterday as the high court voted unanimously to reverse a lower court ruling in a separate case involving duke energy corp a big electric power producer based in charlotte n c the lower court ruling had allowed operators of coal fired power plants to make major modifications to their old plants without making them obtain a new permit that would require them to install state of the art antipollution equipment the high courts decision turned on the technical issue of how to measure a power plants compliance with the clean air act it didnt resolve a larger longstanding debate among the utilities industry the environmental protection agency and environmentalists about the circumstance under which utilities can be required to upgrade power plants it was the greenhouse gases case that could have the broadest impact on both the nations environment and its economy the courts decision sets the stage for aggressive new regulation of auto emissions a primary source of carbon dioxide any new regulations which could be years away would be likely to tackle the emissions issue by requiring auto makers to increase the fuel economy of their vehicles while that would ultimately be good news for consumers it could mean further distress for detroit where the struggling u s auto industry remains largely dependent on selling gas guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles individual auto makers declined to comment on the ruling referring questions to their trade group the alliance of automobile manufacturers "the alliance looks forward to working constructively with both congress and the administration including epa and the national highway traffic safety administration in developing a national approach" to greenhouse emissions the group said in a statement in a separate statement epa spokeswoman jennifer wood said the agency was reviewing the decision "to determine the appropriate course of action " she said the bush administration has an "unparalleled financial international and domestic commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions " she added that the "national and international voluntary programs" the administration prefers to regulation "are helping achieve reductions now while saving millions of dollars as well as providing clean affordable energy " white house spokeswoman dana perino said the administration takes climate change seriously "we do regulate emissions coming out of the tailpipe " she said noting mr bush is seeking the authority to raise fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars by an anticipated a year other bush administration officials however reaffirmed their belief that broad economy wide caps on greenhouse gas emissions arent needed and would do more harm than good by choking off economic growth one senior official argued that yesterdays ruling to some extent has been "overtaken by events" since the case began and further action isnt needed he cited recent government moves to promote the use of alternative fuels new fuel efficiency standards for suvs and light trucks and tighter efficiency standards for appliances but martha coakley attorney general of massachusetts one of the states that brought the case said the ruling means just the opposite it means she said that the epa "cannot refuse to use its existing authority to regulate dangerous substances simply because it disagrees that such regulation would be a good idea " in any case the slow pace of the nations regulatory machinery the potential for congressional or legal challenges to future regulations and the lead time industry would need to comply with them effectively ensure that no significant changes in regulating emissions will take effect during the remainder of mr bushs time in office that doesnt mean that congress now controlled by democrats wont press the issue the house is already gearing up for action on climate change through a special committee set up by speaker nancy pelosi to focus and coordinate work by the different panels with oversight of energy and the environment the senate also has taken up the cause "this decision puts the wind at our back " sen barbara boxer d calif chairwoman of the environment and public works committee said in a statement she promised to call the epa before her committee to explain how it intends to comply with the ruling while also pushing for additional legislation in their ruling the justices didnt order the epa to regulate tailpipe emissions or say the agency couldnt take "policy concerns" into account when deciding what to do but the opinion made clear that the court saw the clean air act as a broad congressional mandate to protect the environment suggesting it would have little patience with any future epa finding that the laws goals were furthered by declining to regulate those emissions "epa can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do " the court said in effect the court found that the debate over the nations response to climate change had been settled by congress nearly years ago when it adopted the clean air act the law directs the epa to adopt emission standards for "any air pollutant" from any type of motor vehicle that "could reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare " including effects on "weather" and "climate " considered alongside scientific evidence and longstanding government policies recognizing the danger of climate change the administrations failure to act was "arbitrary capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law " the high court said the administration had contended that greenhouse gases which rise high in the atmosphere to form a barrier that holds in heat produced by the suns rays didnt qualify as the type of pollutant envisioned by the law if such gases did qualify the administration argued that the epa retained discretion over how to address them and that its approach of voluntary standards international negotiations and further research was preferable to regulation finally the government maintained that regardless of those issues the case should be thrown out because the plaintiffs a dozen state governments led by massachusetts had no standing to sue over the issue of global warming the courts majority opinion which was written by justice john paul stevens and joined by justices anthony kennedy david souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer rejected all three claims the court cited decades of research to establish that global warming is the type of threat to public health congress had in mind when it adopted the clean air act as early as federal scientists were noting an increase in planetary carbon dioxide levels by the national research council advised regulation of the gas scientific evidence has continued to accumulate along with the deleterious effects of climate change the court found "rising seas have already begun to swallow massachusetts coastal land " justice stevens wrote in the late s the clinton administration concluded that carbon dioxide fell under the epas regulatory authority the bush administration reversed that position however and in rejected proposals to regulate the gas among other reasons it noted that the national research council had acknowledged that the link between carbon dioxide and global warming "cannot be unequivocally established " massachusetts joined by environmental groups and other states and cities sued contending than the administration had flouted the clean air acts requirements in a ruling a federal appeals court in washington d c sided with the administration but splintered over the reasoning when massachusetts appealed to the supreme court alaska michigan and eight other states largely those where oil production and auto manufacturing are major economic forces backed the administration president bushs two supreme court appointees chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito dissented from yesterdays ruling joined by justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas chief justice roberts wrote that while "global warming may be a crisis even the most pressing environmental problem of our time " as massachusetts put it the courts had no role in solving it he argued that massachusetts had no standing to bring the case because among other reasons global warming presents a broad threat to "humanity at large " not the narrow particularized harm that plaintiffs must demonstrate to get into court justice scalia in a separate opinion joined by the other three dissenters took issue with the substance of massachusetts complaint "regulating the buildup of co and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere which is alleged to be causing global climate change is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is polluting the air " he wrote dean treftz john fialka and john d mckinnon contributed to this article
