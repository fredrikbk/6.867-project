lawyer for its largest shareholder stormed out of the companys boardroom and slammed the door according to two people who were there the companys share price was sluggish the newspaper industrys prospects were dim and the chandler family his client wanted action but the companys management and its board rebuffed the familys recommendations mr stinehart began to agitate for change writing a public letter demanding something more than the stock buyback that had been proposed what he got was one of the most wrenching auctions in the history of newspapers a seemingly endless process that featured tepid buyers unhappy employees and angry investors as the process dragged on the landscape shifted constantly and the entire industry lurched into decline as fears of internet pressure on advertising and circulation mounted in the end the chandlers had to settle for less than they had hoped to receive yesterday the chicago tribune los angeles times several other newspapers and television stations fell into the hands of an unlikely newspaper baron iconoclastic real estate magnate sam zell whose bid had come at the eleventh hour mr zells plan suggests that he has some degree of confidence in the beleaguered newspaper business he has told people he sees promise in the companys internet assets but the deal leaves many unanswered questions about the future of tribune "its generally not wise to sell your house when the market is going to hell in a handbasket " says barry l lucas an analyst with gabelli &amp co whose parent company gamco investors inc owns shares in tribune co "i certainly hope no one else is thinking of doing what tribune has done its a mess " early yesterday following a weekend of negotiations the companys board accepted a revised &# dollar a share proposal from mr zell to take the company private the complex deal is structured around an employee stock ownership plan or esop when it is completed most of the companys shares will be held by tribune employees although he has no background in journalism mr zell will become chairman of a media company that will be carrying a heavy debt load which will force its new owners to face tough questions the company said yesterday morning that mr zell will invest &# million in the deal in a two step process in the first step tribune will stage a tender offer at &# a share for a bit more than half of the companys shares to fund the offer the company will use &# million of the &# million pledged by mr zell plus additional borrowed money it will return &# billion to shareholders if the deal is approved by regulators a second step will follow the esop will buy the rest of the shares at &# a share and zell will put in &# million the rest of his pledge the esop then will hold all of tribunes remaining stock outstanding and mr zell will hold a subordinated note and a warrant entitling him to acquire of the common stock for a price initially set at &# million the deal values the company at roughly &# billion mr zell will get a seat on the companys board and will be able to appoint one other member if the deal is approved he will become chairman the board will have five independent directors a majority dennis fitzsimons the companys current chairman and chief executive will remain on the board and continue as ceo although mr zell will not control a majority of the stock he is expected to exert considerable influence over decision making the deal will spell the end to the chandler familys involvement in tribune ending a period of open warfare between the family and the company yesterday mr fitzsimons referred to the letter in which the chandlers originally attacked the companys board which was filed with the securities and exchange commission as "the most bogus filing of all time " a spokesman for the chandler family trust said "we are pleased with the outcome" of the auction process tribune kept open the possibility that a rival bidder might jump in with a higher bid the company set a relatively low "breakup fee" of &# million which it would have to pay mr zell if it abandoned yesterdays deal among those who could try to extend the auction are los angeles billionaires ron burkle and eli broad who tried to outbid mr zell late in the auction how mr zell will be received remains to be seen he has said he doesnt intend to break up the company but tribune said yesterday it will sell off the chicago cubs after the completion of the current baseball season one person who has spoken to mr zell about his plans says he is likely to seek further budget cuts a move that will likely be unpopular with staff particularly at the los angeles times where the editor and publisher both stepped down last year to protest budget cuts ordered by tribunes headquarters see related articles on pages b and b billionaire entertainment executive david geffen who had earlier made an offer for the l a times said yesterday he was still interested in the paper "i hope to meet with sam zell sometime in the future " he said mr fitzsimons told tribune employees yesterday in a town hall meeting at the companys headquarters that mr zell "has identified assets that he views as undervalued and thats his track record as a contrarian investor he sees things hes been successful in identifying assets that others think are out of favor " the newspaper industry certainly fits into that category last summer a dramatic decline in newspaper advertising revenue forced many newspaper executives to re evaluate their businesses a drop off in print ad revenue has plagued tribunes biggest markets chicago los angeles and new york undermining the rationale for its merger with times mirror co that merger was designed to bring newspapers and tv stations together in large markets to amplify ad revenue the strategy has proved disastrous for tribune and the merger has turned into a huge disappointment for the company and its investors mr zell years old made a quiet offer for tribune last october when the company was having trouble scaring up bids private equity firms had been looking and walking away potential buyers including los angeles billionaires intrigued by the l a times only expressed interest in parts of the company or were making lowball offers the company was cobbling together a "self help" deal to recapitalize the company and to spin off its tv stations which would have paid a dividend to the chandlers and other shareholders mr zell got sidetracked on another deal in november he announced he would sell equity office properties trust a public real estate investment trust he headed a bidding war broke out and blackstone group eventually agreed to pay about &# billion excluding debt by some measures it was the largest leveraged buyout in u s history mr zell chairman of equity office properties and its largest individual shareholder walked away with &# million on feb the day shareholders approved that deal he discussed his interest in the tribune he provided no details saying only that he felt the business was undervalued and had prospects for recovery civic pride may have played a part mr zell is a longtime chicagoan whose office features a bronze cast of michael jordans hands he is a part owner of the chicago white sox one reason why tribune is selling the crosstown cubs mr zell wouldnt be permitted to have stakes in both in some ways mr zell is cut from different cloth than the buttoned down culture of tribune which is closely aligned with the chicago establishment he prefers blue jeans to suits and is a longtime motorcycle rider the son of a jewish grain trader who escaped poland as the nazis were preparing to invade mr zell broke into the real estate business investing in apartments with his fraternity brother from the university of michigan he has called himself the grave dancer in reference to his affinity for buying distressed properties on the cheap over the years he has also invested in a

the schwinn bicycle co in the mid s and in american classic voyages co sought chapter bankruptcy protection in the wake of a deep dip in tourism after the sept terrorist attacks equity office properties the enormous real estate company he assembled and ran suffered from some operational problems although it dwarfed other publicly traded office companies in scale it often lagged behind them in performance with one analyst calling it a "perennial disappointment " after the equity office sale was complete mr zell turned back to tribune conditions in the newspaper industry were deteriorating fast and the auction wasnt going well the companys revenue numbers came in lower than anticipated forcing management to downgrade its internal estimates for the full year messrs broad and burkle already had submitted a bid valued at &# a share after the companys internal revenue estimates were lowered an adviser to the two investors informed a representative of the tribunes board that they were dropping the value of their proposal to &# a share if the company was interested in that new offer the adviser said the broad burkle team would put it in writing that never happened this person said mr zell came in with his own offer at that time the tribunes board was working on a restructuring it could do on its own it would borrow money and pay shareholders a big dividend then a company related charity the mccormick tribune foundation which owns roughly of tribune would buy out roughly half of the chandler familys stake and the three chandler board members mr stinehart jeffrey chandler and roger goodan would step down according to a person familiar with the matter "the idea was to have peace in the valley " says one person familiar with the negotiations but the economics of that idea were problematic in early march the company began re evaluating that plan the declining performance of some of tribunes properties made the special committee overseeing the auction uncomfortable with the proposed debt load according to people familiar with the matter the plans proposed dividend had been shaved from more than &# a share to roughly &# these people say the companys management and the special committees advisers were uncomfortable with the level of debt in mr zells proposal as well by march negotiations with mr zell were at a standstill according to one

the last minute messrs burkle and broad resurfaced complaining that they hadnt been given adequate information to make a sufficient bid they said they would be happy to make an offer for tribune at &#
