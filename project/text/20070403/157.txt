when a tech start ups dreams turn prosaic near the end of year old evan williams sought to live the dream of countless internet entrepreneurs teaming with a former neighbor he kicked in &# and started a web company called odeo designed to be a one stop site to find make and distribute podcasts the buzzy tech trend of that moment "im super excited to see where this goes " mr williams wrote in his blog in february but soon mr williamss excitement super or otherwise began to wane as it became apparent odeo wouldnt meet the high expectations since then he has had to grapple with a dilemma thats becoming a familiar one for tech entrepreneurs what to do when a start up isnt the dreamed of home run but merely a decent workaday business "if the expectations had been different i think one could have looked at this as a success " says mr williams "thats probably not the case now " when he started odeo mr williams had reason to believe in the dream because hed lived it once before hed sold a blogging service hed built to google inc for millions of dollars worth of pre ipo shares things went well at first for odeo it got prominent press coverage and quickly pulled in &# million from investors soon reality set in a podcasting service from apple launched first usage of odeos site was underwhelming at each monthly board meeting mr williams sold the investors on a new strategy in late he had his staffers take two weeks off to brainstorm new business directions mr williams unsuccessfully tried to sell odeo to yahoo inc and realnetworks inc not that things were going badly at least not by the standards in any other u s small business arena by may the company still had about &# million in cash it had a service whose audience was growing and today is close to break even thanks to advertising revenue but it wasnt the kind of success a top silicon valley entrepreneur shoots for that led mr williams to question his interest in the podcasting business to begin with ultimately "we werent that excited about what we were doing " he says the twists and turns at odeo are a story thats lost in the middle ground between tales of youtube like jackpots and those of the dramatic pets com style flameouts of the dot com bust in some limited ways they show how silicon valley resembles u s industry at large more than the ipo fed boomtown of the past years at first glance it might seem that the nations tech capital is headed for dot com deja vu a number of internet start ups funded two or three years ago are already in the process of closing down but a class of privately held tech companies that plod along such as odeo is showing signs of being able to endure more than the previous dot com generation the falling cost of running an internet company thanks to open source software outsourcing and cheap hardware means they can more easily weather market vagaries "the boom and bust is going to be a lot different " says silicon valley investor brett bullington "these things are going to trickle along because theyre a lot less expensive to run " the absence of many tech ipos in recent years also means the financial fallout and public awareness of start up disappointments will be more limited findory com inc shows just how quiet and contained the disappointments can be former amazon com executive greg linden launched the web personalization start up in january user traffic to the site which recommended content to users based on the web sites they visited doubled each quarter for the first two years until it began to plateau in early increasing only about quarterly mr linden couldnt persuade venture capitalists to fund the company so it could make a major marketing push to reach more consumers while he could have continued to finance the site himself with the help of ad revenue he wasnt excited about the business opportunities such as licensing the findory technology to other firms "when you start a company around this google size vision its hard to be really passionate about switching to that " says mr linden in january he announced he would stop working on findory and let the site run on autopilot for awhile before shutting it down but repercussions are limited mr linden was the only findory employee and he ran the company from his seattle home "this is kind of creative destruction on a small scale " he says in odeos case taking venture capitalists money increased the stakes early on mr williams says that raised expectations for the start up making it more difficult to change tacks as required something he did with blogger the service he sold to google some involved say there was a disconnect between the investors desire to move forward at full speed and mr williamss continued searching for the right strategy for the company "once you raise a lot of money and you have a lot of fuel you just want to step on the pedal and go fast and execute " says ariel poler a san francisco tech executive who was an odeo investor and board member "and thats not consistent with the situation of not knowing exactly what you want to do " after odeos sale talks foundered last year its backers and staff assumed the company would be liquidated but last august mr williams and his investors agreed the entrepreneur would dip into his google fortune to personally refund of their money then he would take control of odeo to create a new company called obvious corp with obvious he hoped to create a portfolio of different products including a service inherited from odeo called twitter that recently has gotten a lot of buzz among the technorati using twitter consumers can blast out short messages to friends about what theyre doing at a given moment the number of users and the volume of messages they send has doubled four months in a row "we think this is going to be huge " mr williams says of twitter theres still no guarantee this venture ultimately will be anything more than a solid small business but mr williams decided to try to step away from odeo announcing in february that obvious was looking to sell the podcasting service "if it were much more of a flop we could probably kill it and move on and it wouldnt be a big deal " he says mr williams now says he is in the process of conducting due diligence with a buyer for odeo and cant disclose any more details but is happy with the expected outcome "theres this world where you dont sell for &# million to some big company or go flat bust " says biz stone an obvious executive "theres a whole economy of these types of businesses "
