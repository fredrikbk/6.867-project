the curious problem of having more than you need consumed by benjamin r barber norton pages &# denouncing the vulgar banality of consumer capitalism is a time honored ritual at the end of the th century thorstein veblen offered his withering assessment of "conspicuous consumption " since then various denunciations have come from john kenneth galbraith herbert marcuse jean baudrillard and more recently naomi klein "no logo" and thomas frank "one market under god" the gist never changes material plenty is a mask for spiritual poverty the proliferation of marketplace choices a subtle form of tyranny benjamin barbers variation on the theme in "consumed " is to decry consumerisms "infantilization" of the culture sounding like the grumpiest of social conservatives mr barber a proud progressive blasts the youth obsessed self indulgence of an "infantilist ethos" that values "easy over hard simple over complex and fast over slow " he even contrasts todays childishness with the good old days of the protestant ethic according to which "work was truly a calling and investment a mark of prudent altruism and democratic nation building rather than mere selfishness " what an exceedingly strange sentiment for a man of the left nostalgia for the bourgeoisie mr barber blames the slide into decadence on rising productivity long ago he argues "a productivist capitalism prospered by meeting the real needs of real people " today though "consumerist capitalism" nurtures "a culture of impetuous consumption necessary to selling puerile goods in a developed world that has few genuine needs " thus are we afflicted with britney spears reality television sports stadiums named after corporations blockbuster movies based on comic books and a host of other things that get mr barbers goat putting aside his normative judgments one easily recognizes the dynamic he describes in our present condition of mass affluence most people can meet their basic needs for food shelter and clothing with a paltry fraction of their income most spending is discretionary which means that producers must engage in elaborate attempts at persuasion known as advertising and since human beings with their irrepressible imaginations like to invest inanimate objects with meaning advertising often strives to associate goods with appealing flights of fancy as to the broader celebration of youth that so irks mr barber it too is a result of prosperity as the economy becomes more complex and requires more highly trained workers we have extended adolescence by staying longer and longer in school with ready birth control and no need any longer for extra hands on the farm we are taking longer to assume the adult responsibilities of getting married and having children better medicine cheaper food and more leisure time have allowed us to focus increased attention on keeping our bodies youthful and wealth buffers us from the downsides of impulsiveness and playfulness consequently weve shed much sometimes too much of the old obsession with repressing desires and deferring gratification to be sure capitalism has both fed and profited from this increasing youth centeredness what mr barber neglects to mention however is that hostility to capitalism and materialistic motivations has also played a major role in instigating the cultural shift he condemns has mr barber forgotten the counterculture "dont trust anybody over " "if it feels good do it " "question authority" the romantic rebels of the s who mouthed these slogans had no use for either profits or protestantism what mr barber now condemns as puerility they prized as spontaneity and authenticity such attitudes put an unmistakable stamp on the world that for better and worse we inhabit today here is where mr barbers brief against consumerism completely falls apart he sees the explosion of consumer choices today and assumes that americans are growing ever more materialistic the more gadgets gizmos and fripperies the marketplace serves up the more deeply we fall under commerces evil spell in fact the opposite is true political scientist ronald inglehart has exhaustively documented a world wide shift toward "postmaterialist" values in which as he puts it the "emphasis on economic achievement as the top priority is now giving way to an increasing emphasis on the quality of life " the more stuff we have the less interested we become in simply accumulating more and the more we seek out instead the intangible satisfactions of memorable experiences meaningful work and self realization the existence of books like mr barbers proves the point in an amusing irony the progress of capitalist development creates a continuing demand for fulminations against the evils of materialism thus do anti market intellectuals like benjamin barber find their niche in the consumerist cornucopia they so revile mr lindsey vice president for research at the cato institute is the author of "the age of abundance how prosperity transformed americas politics and culture " forthcoming from harpercollins
