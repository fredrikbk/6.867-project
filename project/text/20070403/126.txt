up from the year before and in according to fund tracker lipper inc growth fund is "of a size we havent seen before " says morningstar inc analyst paul herbert who for months has been waving a caution flag about the funds "ability to continue to put up topnotch returns " for its part capital research &amp management co which runs american funds says it sees no performance issues with the funds size so what exactly does size have to do with performance arent there economies of scale that work in investors interest here are answers to that and other questions about the role size has in a funds performance q how is american funds dealing with growth funds increased girth a american funds uses a multiple manager system under which individual "portfolio counselors" run a certain percentage of assets independently it says no one runs more than of growth fund q that sounds reassuring so what is the issue a mr herbert says that american funds doesnt spell out the amounts run by growth funds individual managers some of whom also work on other of american funds funds so "we dont really know how much different people are running " he says capital research says it doesnt provide such detail as part of a general policy of not publicizing the work of individual stock pickers it wants investors to buy based on a funds overall investment style q how has the funds performance held up a its three year annualized return of racked up as money was pouring in puts it in the top of its peers while the fund is in the top fifth of its peer group for the past months its total return lags four percentage points behind the standard &amp poors stock index q what specifically are the reasons some financial advisers think smaller is more beautiful a running more money can "force a fund to tweak its approach in ways that can lead to moderate performance " mr herbert says in his book "common sense on mutual funds new imperatives for the intelligent investor " vanguard group founder john bogle puts it this way when funds get big "portfolio management becomes increasingly structured group oriented and less reliant on savvy individuals " big size can affect diversification strategies to ensure broad diversification many managers dont want to hold positions in excess of or so of their fund mr bogle says at the same time they generally want to hold well under of the shares of any given company the thinking is this the bigger a position the harder to trade in and out of it the bigger a fund the bigger in dollar terms a maximum position becomes based on holdings data from late last year growth fund had stakes topping of shares outstanding in about two dozen stocks including positions representing more than apiece in semiconductor stocks xilinx inc altera corp and linear technology corp according to factset research systems inc each of those stakes from about &# million to &# million at current prices represented less than half of of the fund the funds biggest single common stock position at just over of the fund was a &# billion investment in google inc representing about of the internet search engines shares outstanding paul haaga a capital research senior vice president notes that growth fund historically has been a long term investor in its turnover ratio was up from the year before "given our long holding period the portfolio counselors and analysts dont generally need to or want to exit rapidly " he says q cant managers avoid some problems of size by owning larger numbers of shares in smaller concentrations a yes but as mr bogle notes the performance of each holding "would have a smaller impact on the performance of the portfolio " as of dec growth fund held stocks up from stocks in and at the end of according to morningstar q nonetheless there are a lot of big u s stocks to choose from and a lot of big funds buy overseas stocks too right a "if you can put a portion of the portfolio outside of the u s that helps with capacity " morningstars mr herbert says still as of early last month only about of the companies in the dow jones wilshire global total market index had market capitalizations above &# billion which was the size of the average stock in growth funds portfolio as of dec growth funds big holdings include index heavyweights like microsoft corp general electric co and american international group inc as well as swiss drug maker roche holding ag and south korean powerhouse samsung electronics co q dont mega funds enjoy economies of scale that benefit small investors a yes growth funds of assets expense ratio is "very low " in morningstars words less than half the average of diversified u s stock funds the funds are sold through securities brokers which add sales commissions to the investment cost morningstar says that in general as fund assets increase above &# billion expense ratios tend to decrease q are there some rules of thumb for determining when a fund is too big a the answer depends on the stock fund category in recent years the best performing small stock funds which generally invest in stocks with market values of &# billion or less have been those managing smaller pools of money according to morningstar q is closing funds to new investors the best alternative for most mega funds a it isnt so simple some companies close a fund then open a clone some while rejecting new accounts continue to accept new money from existing investors mr herbert says closing funds "is overrated because the typical closing doesnt slow asset growth by very much " at american funds any portfolio manager can say "no" to new money if they dont see a good way to put it to use the money is directed to fellow team managers who see uses for it at least one growth fund manager has turned down money but the company declines to elaborate a spokesman says managers are rewarded based on their returns not on how much money they manage
