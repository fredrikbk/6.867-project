item pricing redux paul rubin bolsters his argument against it in commenting on my op ed "a penny not saved " opinion march edgar dworsky "item pricing and overcharging in groceries " march indicates that he was the author of massachusetts item pricing law ipl it is understandable that mr dworsky would want to defend his handiwork from his letter it is also possible to understand how these fundamentally anticonsumer laws can be written by well meaning but misguided critics of the open marketplace he indicates that "a savvy shopper knows that prices vary " but we did not merely look at a few prices as might a savvy shopper we examined prices in stores in three states we also performed several regression analyses adjusting for factors such as population density number of households and median family income in the stores zip code we looked at suburban stores in new york new jersey and connecticut mr dworsky ignores our examination of connecticut but this is fundamental to our argument mr dworskys numbers are simply wrong in our full paper we cite several studies that indicate the annual cost of ipls is about &# per store not the &# he cites he also indicates that the average cost of overpricing per overpriced item in the ftc study is &# but this figure is for overpricing in all stores including for example department stores not just grocery stores for grocery stores the average cost of overpricing when it occurs is cents moreover the cent overcharge occurs only for those items where there is an actual overcharge which is why we say that the average cost over all items sold was less than one cent the cost of marking each item under an ipl applies to all items in the store not merely to those where an overcharge occurs he misuses the numbers he has he indicates that the cost per item of the ipl is only three tenths of a cent this is based on his faulty use of &# even by his numbers the cost is three cents since the cost of ipls is &# per store per year not &# but this includes only some of the costs for example stores might charge higher prices since it is more difficult to change them after items are first marked he indicates that the same number of items were on sale in one week in new york and new jersey stop &amp shops but this is not useful data in our study we find that prices of non ipl items are three times as likely to be changed as prices of ipl items connecticut has an ipl but stores can avoid it by installing electronic shelf pricing in our analysis connecticut stores with electronic pricing had prices higher than non ipl stores but lower than ipl stores so the connecticut evidence exactly made our point finally mr dworsky seems to misunderstand markets he indicates that if there were any savings from repealing ipls these savings would be likely to "go directly to the supermarkets bottom line " a highly unlikely result in an extremely competitive market moreover even though he believes that supermarkets are eager to make money he also believes that they leave lots of money on the table according to his survey of massachusetts consumers "three of four shoppers said they would be willing to pay two or three cents extra per item to have the price marked on it " according to his faulty calculations ipls cost three tenths of one cent per item this means that by his analysis massachusetts grocers who could have marked individual items even without the ipl were passing up a chance to charge three cents for something that only cost three tenths of a cent how does he explain this failure on the part of shrewd business persons to make additional money paul h rubin samuel candler dobbs professor of economics and law emory university atlanta
