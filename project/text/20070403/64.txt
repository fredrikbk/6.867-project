just a spoonful of sugar the old remedy is among pain management techniques doctors are using for infants its the old story baby gets shots baby howls but increasingly pediatricians and researchers say it doesnt have to be that bad theres a growing body of evidence that relatively simple and inexpensive pain management techniques can ease the trauma of medical procedures including shots for infants and children and more doctors and hospitals are taking notice and implementing these techniques in their practices sugar water ingested via a dropper or on a pacifier dipped in the solution has been shown to reduce pain for infants up to six months old many neonatal units give a solution of roughly one sugar packet mixed in about a tablespoon of water prior to shots and other procedures such as catheterizations and blood draws the topical numbing cream emla which is common in hospitals for intravenous punctures is approved by the food and drug administration for injection pain reduction in children starting with newborns some research also points to the effectiveness of anesthetic sprays that temporarily cool the skin around an injection site parental behavior too can have an impact say pediatricians and psychologists what works studies show is less reassuring and apologizing more humor distracting conversation and a confident relaxed attitude nursing or holding an infant during shots has also been shown to help pain associated with shots and other medical procedures has long been considered a minor inconvenience for infants with little long term impact but research in recent years shows that babies feel pain intensely some studies including several by anna taddio of the university of toronto suggest that babies can anticipate and feel more pain after having been previously exposed to something painful for example circumcision while babies cant say whether they are feeling more or less pain researchers use a number of measures to determine pain levels such as amount and intensity of crying heart rate and facial expressions there are some limitations to the pain relief methods techniques such as sugar water can be cheaply prepared in the office or by parents but others can be costly and time consuming especially given that children will get or more immunizations before they are years old plus blood draws and any number of other procedures emla prescription numbing cream manufactured by abraxis bioscience inc for example costs about &# for two application pads at walgreens com it is covered by some insurance providers but it also takes about an hour to work and must be applied ahead of time doctors say they generally use it on select patients especially averse to shots cooling sprays such as the prescription only fluori methane from gebauer co act faster and cost only around cents per use but research as to their effectiveness is not conclusive still a handful of hospitals are adopting some of these techniques and formalizing policies to reduce procedural pain in babies "you used to hear a lot of screaming children now you really dont " says sig kharasch director of the pediatric emergency department at boston medical center who started one such program in called painfree pediatrics the program has made a number of techniques including use of sugar water or cooling sprays and letting kids blow bubbles standard practice for children getting shots or blood draws connecticut childrens medical center adopted similar measures to make procedures as pleasant as possible the shot is done with an appropriate needle says neil schechter who runs the pain relief program there one cause for pain during injections is the use of a needle thats too small for the age of the child and type of injection so the hospital has a guide for selecting the right needle and if two shots are necessary for vaccinations they are administered simultaneously by two people like a number of hospitals connecticut childrens also uses pain relieving measures for circumcisions typically infant boys are given a lidocaine penile block ahead of the procedure accompanied by sugar water to reduce the needle stick pain infants are placed in a restraining device called the circumcision chair which allows for a semi recumbent position that doctors there say is preferable to the traditional circumcision board the procedure is performed in a dimly lit quiet room describing his program dr schechter says "its a culture where pain management is thought about from the lab to the intensive care and even to the end of life " some facilities use a reusable pressure device called a shotblocker that is held against the skin around the injection site while a shot is given these small flat plastic devices shaped like horse shoes or discs with a small opening aim to diffuse the pain say pediatricians but manufacturer bionix inc of toledo ohio says the shotblockers are no longer on the market bionix says it may not resume manufacturing the devices because the fda has asked for more studies that would be costly to conduct hospitals have been the front runners on changing practice they have bigger staffs than private practices and theyve been given a nudge by their main accreditation body joint commission on accreditation of hospitals which instituted a set of pain assessment and management standards that went into effect in the standards said pain scales should be appropriate to the age of the patient among other things and helped put the issue of procedural pain on the table some private practices are also beginning to use pain relieving techniques for shots at northeast cincinnati pediatric associates a large private practice in ohio parents of infants are asked to mix their own sugar water for vaccinations "theres really no downside to it " says pierre manfroy a physician in the practice who introduced the use of sugar water there a couple of years ago "its cheap its safe parents like it and bring it and it helps the baby " overall the research on infant pain relief is sketchy doctors say more studies are needed especially for techniques like cooling sprays or pressure devices likely to help clarify the issue is a forthcoming paper in the journal pediatrics co authored by dr schechter which lays out "best practices" recommendations for reducing the pain of immunizations based on a summary of research and informed opinion of experts one simple and free option is to breastfeed an infant while the shot is administered a technique advocated by the american academy of pediatrics on a friends advice jennifer astman of santa monica calif decided to nurse her month old son while he was given three vaccinations earlier this year she told the nurse about her plan and the nurse was fine with it she says "i was so focused that i didnt get a chance to get upset " says ms astman who was very nervous going into the appointment "and as a result the baby was more calm "
