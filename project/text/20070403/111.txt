quarterly mutual funds review betting big on large stock funds individual investors often worry whether they have the right mix of investments in their mutual funds portfolio how much should a small investor put in large stock funds small stock funds u s investors put record sums into foreign stock portfolios last year how much is enough how much is wise for high yield or "junk " bond funds in this column we ask prominent financial advisers to share their model asset allocations for certain kinds of investors this month we turned to litman gregory asset management llc a unit of orinda calif based litman gregory cos the firm has managed money for wealthy individuals and provided investment and asset allocation advice to individual investors through its no load fund analyst newsletter for nearly two decades we spoke to co chief investment officer jeremy degroot focusing on recommendations for investors who can handle moderate risk with a minimum three to five year investment horizon a team of analysts at litman gregory starts with a basic asset allocation model which is tweaked depending on the analysts assessment of factors like relative valuation of asset classes and market cycles they recently increased the allocation to large company u s stock funds because they are betting that these stocks will do well over the next three to five years this is referred to as "fat pitch" investing meaning they take a swing only when a solid idea comes in "when you have a high conviction in something you can make a big bet on it " mr degroot says in addition the analysts aim to find the best fund managers who can beat benchmarks like the standard &amp poors stock index over a period of time the portfolio includes managers with different styles many of whom have been part of the portfolio for a number of years "these are really our favorite equity funds " he says the moderate risk model portfolio is designed keeping in mind a worst case scenario in which the investor could potentially lose over a month period but investors who stick with it over three to five years will get a "pretty good return " he says over the past five years investors following its moderate risk strategy would have earned an average of a year he says here is the current strategy u s stocks small company stocks have trumped large stocks for more than six years now and analysts at litman gregory believe that the run is close to over they started cutting back on small stock funds last fall and eliminated investment in them in february they expect large company stocks to become popular again given that asset classes historically have moved in and out of favor and that large stocks tend to do better when the economy slows down as is the case now they also find that shares of high quality companies are cheap relative to their earnings potential consequently they have increased the allocation to large company stocks funds to "we may be wrong for the next months on small caps but if youre patient and if you have a five year time horizon its going to pay off " mr degroot says the firm is so convinced that large stocks will do well it recommends investing with an index based fund that tracks the performance of the largest stocks in the s&amp p the analysts also compare funds based on whether they focus on bargain hunting "value" stocks or fast growing "growth" stocks they believe that growth stocks look more attractive than value stocks but not enough to load up on growth oriented funds some of their large stock fund picks such as oakmark select own growth shares international stocks the allocation to foreign funds hasnt changed for the past five years because the analysts arent convinced that adding or reducing this allocation would improve performance for the portfolio at the same level of risk the foreign holdings are in broad global funds that can invest in both developed and developing countries bonds bond funds are included for their ability to reduce overall risk for instance bonds generally perform well if there is a recession or an economic or political shock that makes investors risk averse in the analysts removed international bonds and cash from the portfolio and instead invested in pimco developing markets this fund is akin to a money market fund held in the local currencies of various developing markets in asia latin america and central and eastern europe "we have this as a diversifier or hedge for the u s dollar decline " mr degroot says he believes that the funds risk is contained because its holdings are very short term while its yield is relatively high the portfolio holds in high quality u s bonds and hasnt held any junk bonds since because the analysts feel this asset class has become too expensive other assets in february the analysts established a commodities position to increase diversification "when stocks and bonds are both going down the data is very strong that is exactly when commodity futures are generating their best performance " mr degroot says at of the recommended portfolio pimco commodity real return has an exposure to several commodities and some inflation linked u s bonds a real estate focused fund was removed in on concerns that this asset class had become expensive
