new tack mini programs in ad breaks fox to run vignettes as way to keep viewers during commercials tv networks have long driven viewers crazy by interrupting their favorite shows with bunches of commercials now to entice audiences one network will try the opposite tack interrupting its commercial breaks with tiny snippets of programming starting monday news corp s fox network will begin running short animated clips about a taxi driver known as "oleg" during ad breaks the character will offer up odd bits of wisdom and even chat with spoof versions of celebrities like tom cruise or donald trump fox hopes the clips will persuade viewers to keep watching during commercial breaks rather than as many people do changing channels or using a digital video recorder to fast forward through ads "its something that pops up that is unexpected and the viewer says what the hell is that it may keep them around for a while longer " says jon nesvig fox broadcastings president of sales fox he adds wants to discover "what can we do to make commercial breaks a more interesting experience for our viewers what can we do to get them to hang around through the commercial breaks " the clips premiere comes less than two months before nielsen media research is scheduled to release a new measure of ad viewership expected to show a noticeable drop off in audience levels between programs and accompanying commercials while the data wont surprise many people it gives marketers hard evidence they can use to push for lower prices for commercial time as a result the networks suddenly have an incentive to lure viewers not only to their shows but to the ad breaks as well most of the major broadcast networks are working on similar concepts although foxs plans appear to be the most advanced walt disneys abc is mulling ways to make it less obvious to viewers that programs are stopping for commercials one potential example says mike shaw abcs president of sales is for a cast member of abcs sitcom "ugly betty" to be shown in a scene opening a magazine where a picture from the glossy expands into an ad alternatively the last ad of a break could turn into something that cast members of another abc sitcom "according to jim " are watching on their own television mr shaw says in april general electrics nbc will conduct two experiments to see if viewers can be convinced to stick around during advertisements says michael pilot nbc universals president of ad sales one idea will involve trivia and take place during multiple episodes of the medical sitcom "scrubs " the other will involve trying to get audiences to watch an ad break during "the tonight show with jay leno " says mr pilot who declined to offer more details "we are trying to play with concepts to see what works " he says at cbs executives have been discussing creating individual concepts for specific clients "i dont think a cookie cutter approach is going to work there isnt one thing that is going to work for every single client " says jo ann ross cbss president of sales the network also wants to test things quietly and monitor viewer reaction she says "you may see us experiment in other day parts before you see us experiment in prime " when the new network cw owned jointly by cbs and time warner premiered last fall it experimented with advertiser sponsored "content wraps " mini programs that ran during ad breaks the wraps have worked so well the network is boosting to the number of wraps it is doing in the season up from the six to that were originally planned cw says its research showed the wraps helped retain audiences the network plans to use the wraps more broadly next season a spokesman says even so theres no guarantee all these ideas will work foxs oleg vignettes will only be eight seconds long and although the network will air two in the same ad break seconds is only a brief interruption in commercial breaks that can often run three minutes or more in length theres nothing to stop viewers changing the channel after watching the snippets which some could even find confusing because of their brevity still the experimentation is the latest sign of how tv networks faced with growing competition from other media are responding to longstanding complaints from marketers about commercial overload advertisers have long complained about ad "clutter" on television which they worry reduces the effectiveness of individual ads to reduce the ad crowding several networks in the past year or so have tried selling all the ad time in an episode of a program to a single advertiser later this year time warners tnt cable network will try something different it plans to run ads in the bottom portion of the screen during a telecast of a nascar race making the broadcast free from traditional commercial breaks fox began thinking about ways to make its commercial breaks more entertaining about six months ago when the network realized that nielsens commercial ratings data were going to be taken seriously by advertisers one early idea involved running a kind of game during the break says chris carlisle fox broadcastings executive vice president of marketing but fox decided against the idea he says because "you are asking the viewer to do something else " fox will look at nielsen viewership data to see how successful the oleg pieces are he says and also examine web traffic on an oleg internet site where the vignettes will direct viewers oleg is being produced by ideocracy an independent new york advertising firm ad notes procter &amp gamble seeks new
