the daily fix florida overpowers ohio state to earn repeat worth millions online edition what was the value of the florida gators climb up a stepladder to cut down a net ending a second consecutive basketball season in identical triumphant fashion "its an ordinary stepladder the kind home depot might sell for &# " miami herald columnist greg cote writes after the gators defeated ohio state last night to become their sports first repeat champions since "but on this court on this night one team would climb it to the mountaintop its an ordinary basketball net what a sporting goods store might sell for &# but on this court on this night the small pieces of nylon these players would snip from it were spun gold treasure worth the millions they had forsaken in nba riches for the chance to make this climb just one more time the flag planted on the mountaintop said florida gators again " all five florida starters returned from last years championship team even though three or four of them likely would have been picked in the first round of the nba draft no other starting five has ever defended a championship after the traditional net cutting celebration "the florida gators reassembled on the stage a place theyve become all too familiar with one last time and turned their heads to the georgia dome video board " stewart mandel writes on si com "the team that had just completed one ultimate historic shining moment joined together to watch one shining moment the players sat at the front of the stage arms around each others backs swaying and smiling to the song and the highlights " mr mandels column is accompanied by a great photo of the players watching with the caption "the gators took a peak for themselves " peak" was probably supposed to be "peek " but either one is apt mr mandel goes on "the man who made the whole scene possible stood alone near the back of the stage subdued smiling occasionally nodding at someone in the crowd it wasnt that billy donovan wasnt appreciating this final magical moment of a historic two year odyssey as is typical he was making sure his players were afforded the forefront " conventional wisdom suggests all of the florida five including four juniors will be gone next year even the coach mr donovan may depart for kentucky or the miami heat after watching an extraordinary quintet celebrate again as virginian pilot columnist tom robinson points out mr donovans gators lost to a michigan state team in the finals anchored by seniors mateen cleaves and morris peterson who also passed up nba riches for another run at a title but the gators decision to try for a repeat remains extraordinary as demonstrated by final four most outstanding player corey brewer selected for his combined points on of shooting from three point range rebounds blocks steals and shutdown defense "brewers family struggled financially as he was growing up in tennessee " paola boivin writes in the arizona republic you may remember the los angeles times bill plaschke weighing in on this from this fix but the storys good enough to tell twice "his father ellis knew nothing about basketball corey brewer said but taught him about hard work with diabetes crippling ellis health nba money could have made a big difference yet coreys parents told him to make the decision that felt right even though he risked a career ending injury what felt right was to return to play with a group of friends he really enjoyed " the elder mr brewer was too sick to travel to the game in atlanta "but pee wee is no complainer " pat forde writes on espn com "says he feels fine in fact rarely better than he felt monday night the customary gaggle of friends and family gathered at the brewers house for a cookout half the community pee wee said then they screamed and jumped and danced watching the small town local boy lead florida back to the mountaintop that just thrilled me pee wee said " mr brewers story helps explain why birmingham news columnist kevin scarbinsky is so frustrated and confused this morning despite the gators two straight basketball titles and their no ranking also earned with a defeat of ohio state to end the football season mr scarbinsky writes that he "cant hate them i cant even work up a strong dislike in their direction " how much respect can columnists work up for florida "the gators dont have more talent than the duke team that featured christian laettner grant hill bobby hurley and co " jason whitlock writes in the kansas city star "but i do think this florida team would beat the duke boys and hold its own against any previous national champions including the teams that had players such as lew alcindor bill walton michael jordan patrick ewing and kent benson " sportslines gregg doyel isnt quite as complimentary he says the duke florida match up is a toss up but the ucla teams anchored by messrs alcindor and walton are clearly the best teams ever still no of all time isnt bad and its fitting for floridas four sophomore starters who decided to come back for more two years ago in the ncaa tournament final illinois flung shots from behind the arc and hit just the illini lost to north carolina last night fellow big club ohio state made just two of its first three point shots the last two attempts went in after the outcome was no longer in doubt meanwhile florida hit of three pointers "basketballs conventional wisdom inevitably favors the team that controls the area around the basket " tom knott writes in the washington times "the buckeyes did just that and never could make a serious run on the gators because of the assault from the point line " freshman greg oden was responsible for the buckeyes dominance in the paint scoring points and gathering rebounds now hell likely take his inside game to the nba though several columnists suggest he consider following the path taken by floridas sophomores after last season or at least suggest that the buckeyes hopes of returning to the title game depend on it "poor ohio state has no choice but to hope against hope that oden loves going to class riding go carts and checking out coeds as much as he says he does " david steele writes in the baltimore sun adds sportslines dennis dodd "there is doubt about oden going to the nba but not enough to penetrate any sane persons cerebral cortex odens season left us only promise of how good he can be in the nba which wont love him half as much as the college community did the league will match up with him almost every night " before the game john feinstein argued in the washington post that domes excessive tv timeouts and extended halftimes are contributing to the decline of the final four "for years there was a saying among basketball people there is no better day in sports than semifinal saturday at the final four " mr feinstein writes "not anymore " the oakland as and los angeles dodgers lost their openers before finishing in first place the loss baltimore orioles and last place colorado rockies won theirs so with games left its obviously too soon to read anything into the victories of the seattle mariners and kansas city royals who finished last year and the pittsburgh pirates coming off a loss season with that bit of unfun out of the way let the minnows rejoice in their no starters performances the royals beat the boston red sox behind a strong pitching performance by their expensive offseason acquisition "on the biggest pitching day of his life gil meche was nervous " joe posnanski writes in the kansas city star "then he was awfully good " and the result for the red sox was "somewhat shocking " dan shaughnessy writes in the boston globe the mariners beat the as with year old pitcher felix hernandez pitching "as well as any mariners pitcher since randy johnson " steve kelley writes in the seattle times and fellow youngster zach duke matched roy oswalt with a gem before his teammates lifted the pittsburgh pirates to a inning "most unlikely" defeat of the houston astros " ron cook writes in the pittsburgh post gazette the season began in minnesota on a tragic note as longtime twins radio broadcaster herb carneal died at age on monday morning hed been scheduled to call the twins opener last night against baltimore won by minnesota "throughout the upper midwest and beyond carneals voice spilled out of cars on hot summer nights and filled thousands of living rooms " kelsie smith writes in the st paul pioneer press "he shared his knowledge and maintained his straight old school style even as baseball saturated television and marginalized the role of the once revered radioman " tip of the fix cap to reader michael j mcconnell found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj
