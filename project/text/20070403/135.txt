finalize a deal in which news corp would provide internet and tv content for telecom italia possibly in exchange for a stake in the phone company during a meal aboard mr murdochs yacht the deal fell apart over the value of telecom italia according to one participant with few options left mr tronchetti provera hatched a new plan to reorganize telecom italia into separate fixed line and mobile businesses the move would give him the option of selling the companys large mobile phone unit to finance construction of a high speed internet network the day after the plan was unveiled mr prodi italys premier said he was "disconcerted" that he hadnt been given advance notice the telecom regulator summoned telecom italia senior management to clarify the news combined with mr tronchetti proveras courtship of mr murdoch set off political alarm bells could the former monopoly fall prey to foreign buyers already three of italys four mobile phone companies were owned by foreigners telecom italia the last one to remain italian and the most notable represented a line in the sand two days later mr prodi delivered the knockout punch saying he had been misled by mr tronchetti provera he authorized the release of details from private conversations with the telecom chief over the companys strategy the note was unusual for the explicit business secrets it spilled which badly undermined mr tronchetti provera in one meeting at the prime ministers office at palazzo chigi mr prodi said he had insisted any deal with mr murdoch ensure that telecom italia stay in "italian hands " the note said at a second meeting on the shores of lake como according to the note mr tronchetti provera boasted to mr prodi that he was in a strong negotiating position with mr murdoch because he was also talking to general electric co and time warner inc these negotiations hadnt been public knowledge ge declined to comment a time warner spokesman says there could have been contacts between the companies but that he is unaware of any immediately after mr prodis disclosure the italian press got hold of a memo written by a top aide to the prime minister which put the government on the defensive the plan which had been presented to mr tronchetti provera earlier that month suggested that telecom italia float its fixed line network on the stock market with the state taking a controlling stake the news caused a storm with many seeing it as a de facto renationalization of a company that had been privatized just a few years earlier "the risk of a state interference has been felt " luca cordero di montezemolo head of italys powerful business lobby told the milan daily corriere della sera mr prodi defended himself in a speech before parliament saying he couldnt be "indifferent to the destiny of a company that like telecom is so relevant for the country " on sept mr tronchetti provera called an emergency board meeting and saying he was fed up resigned more bad news followed in late september police arrested telecom italias former security chief for allegedly running a spy ring that sold phone records and other sensitive data to private clients mr tronchetti provera says he hasnt been questioned in the probe and had no knowledge of the alleged ring after quitting as chairman mr tronchetti provera turned to his own financial problems pirelli had written down the value of its telecom italia stake by about &lt euro&gt billion or about two thirds of pirellis market capitalization according to people familiar with the matter mr tronchetti provera began talking to spains telefonica sa about buying part of pirellis stake in olimpia the holding company that still controlled telecom italia but the news leaked italian government ministers publicly expressed nervousness about telefonica buying into telecom italia and the talks failed at a pirelli board meeting in march mr tronchetti provera complained that the government was thwarting his ability to maneuver as telecom italias main shareholder "they want it back " mr tronchetti provera told the board referring to the government according to board members he announced he would sell the stake in olimpia again the government cringed afraid that foreign buyers might step up government officials urged a number of italian banks to take the olimpia stake off pirellis hands according to several bankers the talks stalled for several weeks because the banks didnt want to pay the price mr tronchetti provera was asking which was substantially higher than where the stock was then trading now mr tronchetti provera has found potential buyers in at&amp t and america movil which would end his five year money losing saga with telecom italia the offers from at&amp t and america movil would indirectly give each company control of of telecom italia enough to strongly influence its management and strategy according to a written statement released sunday the two sides have a month to finalize their talks america movil is controlled by mexican businessman carlos slim one of the worlds richest men the negotiations have set mr tronchetti provera one more time on a collision course with the government a spokesman for mr prodi says the government wouldnt try to overturn pirellis decision but luigi nicolais italys minister for innovation sent a blunt public warning saying that any sale to foreigners should proceed with "feet of lead " indeed two powerful financial institutions close to the government mediobanca spa and assicurazioni generali spa have the right to match any at&amp t america movil offer that transpires mediobanca was part of the banking group that was earlier in talks with mr tronchetti provera some bankers who deal with mr tronchetti provera say he created his own problems by refusing to acknowledge the restrictions that come with running businesses in italy especially a strategically important company only recently owned by the government says one senior bank executive "hes italian he knows what the method is here for better or for worse "
