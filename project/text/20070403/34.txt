esop fables employee control has downsides tribune co s plan to go private hinges on a little known retirement benefit that workers are likely to hear about a lot more in coming years real estate magnate sam zells winning bid to take tribune private at &# a share announced yesterday hinges on a so called employee stock ownership plan or esop although the company hasnt yet disclosed many details once the dust settles employees will own at least of tribune shares through the esop and they could have company soon the number of esops nationwide has grown about over five years according to the national center for employee ownership today they hold an estimated &# billion in assets and cover more than million workers a lot even alongside the &# trillion saved in k plans well known companies already majority owned by employees include publix and price chopper supermarkets and technology consultant science applications international corp most of todays esop owned companies are small and closely held but industry consultants and financial professionals say thats beginning to change as more big companies go private esops offer tax and financial incentives that can as in tribunes case trump alternatives for employees that can be a mixed bag owning a stake in the company you work for can be great if the company does well or a disaster if it doesnt as employees discovered at enron corp where more than half of their retirement plan savings were invested in company stock including an esop most decisions surrounding esops are out of workers hands still financial advisers say it pays to know what to expect if your company adopts one heres the rundown on esops what is an esop part retirement plan part high finance vehicle esops date back to the s well before the first k plans as in other retirement savings plans participants have individual accounts to which employers make regular contributions usually based on each participants pay in other retirement plans employers typically contribute cash in esops employees receive shares of the employers stock when employees retire they can cash out some or all of their accounts much as they might with a k how can an esop be used to take a company private transactions like the tribune deal typically use something called a leveraged esop the plan and employer take on debt to buy shares up front from other investors that debt is paid off over time as the employer contributes cash to the esop it is used to pay down the loans and an equivalent value in shares is distributed to the employees retirement accounts thanks to accompanying tax deductions the employer in effect receives tax subsidized financing for a leveraged buyout that will leave much or all of the company in employees hands will tribune employees really own the company yes but they probably wont run it esop owned companies dont have to give employees a say in everything and most dont top managers typically continue running the company and little may change internally tribune said its common stock will be entirely owned by the esop once the transaction closes but mr zell will have the right to a stake closely held firms need only give participants a vote in major decisions such as big asset sales just of closely held firms give full voting rights to participants according to the national center for employee ownership of oakland calif what will tribune employees pay for their shares nothing directly the shares are contributed much like employer contributions in other kinds of plans it amounts to part of compensation that said tribune said its workers will lose out on other retirement benefits they currently have starting next year an annual k contribution from the company equal to of pay and a variable profit sharing contribution which totaled of pay at the end of last year employees can still contribute to their k s but they wont receive help from the company matching contributions spelled out in union contracts will still be honored a company spokesman said tribune said the esop contribution will amount to about of pay the company also will establish a cash balance pension plan that provides a credit of of pay a year why is an esop risky mostly its a matter of having all your eggs in one basket "for employees their portfolio is going to be less diverse and its going to be in a highly leveraged company which means theres more risk " said norman stein a law professor specializing in retirement issues at the university of alabama "its not the kind of portfolio people would advise you to be in " worse most esops dont let employees diversify out of company stock until they are at least and have worked years by law they can then sell up to of their stake rising to at age in other words youre locked in to the employers stock even if youd rather not be there are other risks too if the deal price proves too high tribune could stumble under its high debt load driving down the companys value and employees holdings and if the company does extremely well and pays down its debt quickly thats the same as distributing more shares sooner to employees that may prove unsustainable once the initial pool of shares runs out it becomes costlier to maintain the same level of retirement benefits and as employees retire and seek to cash out their shares "all of a sudden there could be a run on the bank " says mary josephs senior vice president for esop financial services at lasalle bank a unit of abn amro holding nv that could leave the company without the cash it needs to stay competitive what are the benefits for employees esop advocates say there are many not least of which is the potential for gain if the company does well some studies also suggest that companies with esops can outperform competitors presumably because workers and management have a significant stake in the outcome but even staunch esop supporters agree that a lot depends on how the company is run "in a small company where its very closely held and youre one of a small number of employees you really feel like youre part of the family and can make an impact on growing the company " said stephen janachowski chief investment officer of brouwer &amp janachowski a tiburon calif financial adviser "when youre part of an enormous company and youre one of tens of thousands of employees i think an employee has got to feel his contribution is diluted "
