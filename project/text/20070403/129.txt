should women take aspirin to prevent heart disease should an aspirin be part of your daily health regimen the answer depends on whether you are a man or a woman for middle aged men the evidence is strong that one baby aspirin per day probably boosts heart health one analysis of five major studies of aspirin use by healthy men concluded that a daily aspirin cuts the risk of first heart attack by an average of but while many women have assumed that whats good for a mans heart is also good for their own that may not be the case for women the risks and benefits of aspirin have been far less clear and the picture is getting even more confusing last week harvard researchers reported that women in the universitys famous nurses health study who used aspirin regularly had a lower risk of heart attack and a lower risk of cancer overall among the nearly women studied women who used aspirin regularly were less likely to die during the study period than those who didnt take aspirin regularly while that sounds like good news researchers say most women shouldnt reach for the aspirin bottle just yet thats because other important studies have shown virtually no benefit of regular aspirin use a few years ago the womens health study of women found that regular aspirin use among women and older didnt make any difference in a womans heart attack risk the study did find that taking an aspirin every other day did lower a womans risk for ischemic strokes which are typically caused by blood clots by a modest but overall the study showed that women who use regular aspirin dont live any longer than those who dont the stark differences between these two major studies may be explained in part by the fact that the nurses study simply observed womens health habits over a long period of time while the womens health study randomly assigned women to aspirin treatment or a placebo it may be that the nurses who choose to use aspirin are simply more health conscious to start with because of the conflicting data many women might be tempted to just start taking aspirin anyway but its important to remember that aspirin isnt a risk free drug studies have shown regular aspirin use even in low doses can increase risk for major gastrointestinal bleeding by though the risk of hemorrhagic stroke which is caused by bleeding in the brain is very low it is nonetheless higher among aspirin users in the real world the risk of aspirin use translates to one additional hemorrhagic stroke for patients and three additional gastrointestinal bleeding events for patients over five years so the question is whether the benefits of aspirin to your personal health situation outweigh the risks men and women who have recovered from a heart attack or who know they have heart disease have the most to gain from regular aspirin use and will likely be advised by their doctors to take an aspirin daily or every other day but most experts agree healthy women under the age of probably wont benefit from regular aspirin use however the american heart association guidelines now say healthy women over can consider taking a daily baby aspirin the recent nurses study showed that low to moderate doses of aspirin one to five standard tablets a week are probably enough women who took tablets a week didnt get any benefit from the pills "no one should begin taking aspirin regularly without first discussing with a doctor " says joann manson professor at the harvard school for public health "aspirin has risks but there is increasing evidence that it has a role in preventing stroke in women and it may prevent heart disease in women and older " men over also should talk to their doctor about taking regular aspirin to prevent heart attack a mans risk for heart attack starts to rise at around to a womans risk doesnt jump until around to the u s preventive services task force an independent panel that makes recommendations about screening and disease prevention has concluded that men at the highest risk for heart problems have the most to gain from aspirin the task force says the benefits of aspirin far outweigh the negatives for those whose year risk of a heart attack is at least and are even greater for men whose risk hits men and women can calculate their year heart attack risk at a national institute of health web site http hp nhlbihin net atpiii calculator asp usertype pub email healthjournal wsj com
