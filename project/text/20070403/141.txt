the evening wrap not so fleet sales online edition detroits big three may be successfully overcoming an addiction to so called fleet sales but the auto giants still turned in some lackluster sales figures for march and a cloudy economic outlook wont make selling cars and trucks any easier both general motors and ford motor got pinched by slower light truck sales gms overall sales dropped amid an decline in demand for its pickups and sports utility vehicles even as its car sales perked up slightly gaining gm has been shunning low margin business with rental companies and other mass buyers in order to focus on more lucrative sales to customers at dealer lots however an upward spurt in gasoline prices a weak housing market and other economic forces appeared to keep a leash on demand fords sales plunged as sales of its popular f series pickups sank thanks in part to a contractual spat with engine maker navistar international the good news ford says is that it seems to have regained its footing after a long period of losing ground ford sales manager george pipas said that even with the big drop in sales in march fords share of the retail market held steady at about mr pipas noted that ford like gm has been paring back its fleet sales they dropped last month chrysler groups monthly sales fell which is likely only to increase pressure on the companys german parent to unload the business as swiftly as it reasonably can daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche has said that "all options" are on the table for chrysler but there are formidable obstacles in the way of a sale for one the auto makers labor unions have made it clear that they are opposed to any deal and any potential buyer may be wary of plunging into contentious negotiations with workers also michael raab an analyst at oppenheim research wrote in a note that the cost of severing chrysler from its german overseers could be "massive" and that daimler would have to "pay a dowry" to rid itself of the u s business whatever the case may be investors shouldnt be looking for any news on a deal out of tomorrows daimlerchrysler annual meeting in berlin mr raab said it is "relatively unlikely" that the auto maker will "release details on who the bidders are and what the bids look like " any buyers sniffing around chrysler might also be chased off by what can only be described as a challenging macroeconomic environment paul ballew gms manager of sales analysis said that the slumping housing market and climbing energy prices are injecting uncertainty into industry sales forecasts though he said that at least for now gm isnt changing its outlook if such conditions persist sales incentives may be the order of the day though restructuring auto makers would be loath to give away any more inventory than they already have some analysts are also starting to get jumpy about auto credit although subprime auto loans havent seen anything like the same kind of problems that subprime mortgages have analysts at lehman brothers wrote in a note that they are keeping an eye out for a tightening of auto credit that could lead to lower demand for both used and new cars and finally the big three still have toyota breathing down their necks the japanese auto maker which sells some hefty vehicles of its own but also has a long lineup of fuel efficient cars saw a increase in u s sales last month

he would seek to choke off funding for the war in iraq if president bush rejects a timeline for withdrawing american forces mr bush laced into congressional democrats accusing them of being more interested in fighting political battles than "providing our troops what they need " both the senate and the house have passed legislation setting dates for pulling troops out of iraq the two chambers must now reconcile the differences in the bills and send something onto the president but mr bush again promised he would veto any measure with an "artificial" timetable for leaving iraq and that democrats dont have the votes to override him "if democratic leaders in congress are bound on making a political statement then they need to send me this unacceptable bill as quickly as possible ill veto it and then congress can get down to business of funding our troops without strings and without delay " he said sen hillary clinton earlier criticized the presidents veto threat speaking from a campaign event in iowa ms clinton said a veto would amount to a rejection of the "will of the american people" and that it is time to get american troops "out of the middle of this sectarian civil war " the president also criticized a trip to syria by the speaker of the house nancy pelosi ms pelosi arrived in there today and is scheduled to meet with syrian president bashar assad in damascus tomorrow the white house argues that syria is a state sponsor of terrorism and has allowed foreign fighters to flow freely across its border into iraq helping replenish the ranks of terrorist fighters

they want to resolve this in a diplomatic way the door is open " he said but if negotiations to win the speedy release of the prisoners stalled he said britain would "take an increasingly tougher
