a cultural conversation with alfred brendel whats really worth playing now is the focus of his efforts alfred brendel is that rare thing a thinking mans pianist the masses can embrace and they do his concerts be they solo recitals or appearances with orchestra regularly sell out both in europe and america he used to fill halls in japan too but at age he no longer travels that far from london his home since tomorrow night at carnegie hall he concludes his annual north american tour playing music by haydn beethoven schubert and mozart mr brendels appeal is multifaceted among his more obvious attributes are a no nonsense stage manner coupled with intense focus at the keyboard a masters dedication to a corpus of great music and a fierce conviction that intellectual engagement with the world at large is desirable he is also the pre eminent upholder of a waning tradition epitomized by a group of th century central european pianists admired for their aesthetic rectitude these searching artists include artur schnabel walter gieseking wilhelm backhaus and edwin fischer the last was brendels most important teacher and he stands as first among equals in the pianists holy trinity along with wilhelm kempff the great german pianist and alfred cortot a keyboard sine qua non mr brendel who was born in moravia and is an austrian citizen despite living in london dislikes classifying musicians by nationality or "school " he prefers his own categories one afternoon last month at a hotel across the street from disney hall in los angeles he had this to say "there are two types of pianists the first learns a piece plays it and discards it then plays another and proceeds like this for much of his or her life the second repeats the same relatively small repertory over and over and becomes obsessed with each note and each piece " he is neither of these of course "i am somewhere in the middle " he says but though this pianist once performed a range of music from the standard repertory he has for more than a decade largely confined his playing to works by the composers featured on his carnegie hall program he attributes the limitations to injuries involving his left arm and some neck joints though mr brendel bristles at the suggestion of specialization during our conversation he handed me a handwritten list of all the music hed performed he acknowledges the centrality of the composers with whom he keeps company these days adding "i am happy at my age to concentrate on what is really worth playing " and concentrate he does he remains the only major pianist to have thrice recorded all of beethovens piano sonatas his forays into schuberts piano music have been similarly exhaustive especially if you include the live performances later released on cd in mozart he has returned to the concertos repeatedly recording all of them with neville marriner between and and recently revisiting several with charles mackerras his first recorded survey of most but not all of mozarts sonatas a later enthusiasm arrived relatively recently on the philips label where mr brendel has been an exclusive artist since "its not enough to hear a piece and play it " he says "one must live with the piece " by that the pianist does not mean performing it endlessly but rather returning to it every five to years and even then the music must be of a sufficient quality to sustain his interest in this regard he expresses a surprising affection for "islamey " a th century russian showpiece by mily balakirev yet he adds quickly that he recorded the work early in his career and did not play it publicly mr brendel has never made a name for himself as an exponent of modern scores unless one counts schoenbergs piano concerto in which he distinguished himself for many years but the pianist insists that its wrong to assume he disdains new music "i have always since a spell of composing myself been ardently interested in new music " he says "and ive recommended the inclusion of contemporary works to young pianists but of course there has been and are a number of great conductors and leading pianists who stay away from new music and certainly not without reason either because they did not feel convinced by it or because their particular gifts did not reach in this direction i greatly admire people like pierre laurent aimard who is a wizard in playing th century music and contemporary music i take all my hats off but very few people can combine both properly " he mentions the special gifts of memory and sight reading necessary for the effective communication of newer often recondite music skills not all performers have "you cannot just dictate what people will do " he says "if they are clever they will know what they can do and what is better left to those endowed to do it well for myself i had to decide whether to play an extensive older repertory or some modern works really well and i made my choice " one of the things he likes best about the scores he does play is that they were written by composers who were not exclusively or even primarily pianists he says it "enriches the writing and makes the instrument a receptacle of all kinds of musical ideas instrumental orchestral vocal the challenge is to transform the piano into all these things while you play " yet not every critic agrees that mr brendel accomplishes such sorcery consistently he has been labeled emotionally cool tonally percussive and probably most galling of all for a man whose wry humor is a defining characteristic overly sober if such criticisms faze him he hides his displeasure well unlike some celebrity soloists mr brendel did not achieve fame from competitions instead he won over critics and audiences slowly through concerts and recordings his status in america was cemented only in when he performed all of beethovens piano sonatas in seven concerts at carnegie hall the first time anyone had done so there since schnabels appearances in if the pianist has any professional regrets at this juncture they would seem to be few but one of them is the general absence of bach from his repertory "i promised that in my next life i should play more bach " he says two things account for this void the first is the overwhelming personality of fischer his teacher "he played some bach pieces incomparably beautifully " mr brendel recalls the second was the emergence of period performance practice just as he was establishing himself as an artist "there was then in the late s a very strong bias against playing bach on the piano " he says "fortunately this is not so anymore " he did make one bach record in though not labeled as such it is essentially a tribute to fischer "at that point i felt i had enough authority to try it myself " the pianist says "i had learned some things from fischer particularly in the a minor fantasy and i still like two performances on this cd very much the italian concerto and the a minor fantasy and fugue i would consider them to be among my relative best " time has not dimmed his awe of fischer indeed he has passed on his enthusiasm to his students including the promising austrian pianist till fellner "there are a few performances of fischers which i cherish and which move me more than nearly anything in piano playing " mr brendel says averting his misting eyes "i still hear in my memory his luminous piano sound a completely relaxed sound there were elements in his playing that were completely inimitable for a young player i needed a long time to incorporate some of them " lately there has been talk of mr brendels retirement though pianists like conductors can enjoy very long careers arthur rubinstein was nearly when he left the stage and mieczyslaw horszowski performed at almost two of mr brendels heroes also played on cortot into his early s and kempff beyond that "im not going to play forever " mr brendel says "there is an end in sight and what happens then i dont know " despite his age and eminence he maintains that he does not consider himself any sort of sentinel "i dont want to sound like someone who is the last exponent of something i dont feel like that at all there are some young musicians who carry on what i stand for though not always the most famous but there is no reason to think that high standards go down the drain " mr mermelstein writes about the arts for various print and online publications
