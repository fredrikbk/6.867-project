the trouble with islam not many years ago the brilliant orientalist bernard lewis published a short history of the islamic worlds decline entitled "what went wrong " astonishingly there was among many western "progressives " a vocal dislike for the title it is a false premise these critics protested they ignored mr lewiss implicit statement that things have been or could be right but indeed there is much that is clearly wrong with the islamic world women are stoned to death and undergo clitorectomies gays hang from the gallows under the approving eyes of the proponents of shariah the legal code of islam sunni and shia massacre each other daily in iraq palestinian mothers teach year old boys and girls the ideal of martyrdom one would expect the orthodox islamic establishment to evade or dismiss these complaints but less happily the non muslim priests of enlightenment in the west have come actively and passively to the islamists defense these "progressives" frequently cite the need to examine "root causes " in this they are correct terrorism is only the manifestation of a disease and not the disease itself but the root causes are quite different from what they think as a former member of jemaah islamiya a group led by al qaedas second in command ayman al zawahiri i know firsthand that the inhumane teaching in islamist ideology can transform a young benevolent mind into that of a terrorist without confronting the ideological roots of radical islam it will be impossible to combat it while there are many ideological "rootlets" of islamism the main tap root has a name salafism or salafi islam a violent ultra conservative version of the religion it is vital to grasp that traditional and even mainstream islamic teaching accepts and promotes violence shariah for example allows apostates to be killed permits beating women to discipline them seeks to subjugate non muslims to islam as dhimmis and justifies declaring war to do so it exhorts good muslims to exterminate the jews before the "end of days " the near deafening silence of the muslim majority against these barbaric practices is evidence enough that there is something fundamentally wrong the grave predicament we face in the islamic world is the virtual lack of approved theologically rigorous interpretations of islam that clearly challenge the abusive aspects of shariah unlike salafism more liberal branches of islam such as sufism typically do not provide the essential theological base to nullify the cruel proclamations of their salafist counterparts and so for more than years i have been developing and working to establish a theologically rigorous islam that teaches peace yet it is ironic and discouraging that many non muslim western intellectuals who unceasingly claim to support human rights have become obstacles to reforming islam political correctness among westerners obstructs unambiguous criticism of shariahs inhumanity they find socioeconomic or political excuses for islamist terrorism such as poverty colonialism discrimination or the existence of israel what incentive is there for muslims to demand reform when western "progressives" pave the way for islamist barbarity indeed if the problem is not one of religious beliefs it leaves one to wonder why christians who live among muslims under identical circumstances refrain from contributing to wide scale systematic campaigns of terror politicians and scholars in the west have taken up the chant that islamic extremism is caused by the arab israeli conflict this analysis cannot convince any rational person that the islamist murder of over innocent people in algeria which happened in the last few decades or their slaying of hundreds of buddhists in thailand or the brutal violence between sunni and shia in iraq could have anything to do with the arab israeli conflict western feminists duly fight in their home countries for equal pay and opportunity but seemingly ignore under a facade of cultural relativism that large numbers of women in the islamic world live under threat of beating execution and genital mutilation or cannot vote drive cars and dress as they please the tendency of many westerners to restrict themselves to self criticism further obstructs reformation in islam americans demonstrate against the war in iraq yet decline to demonstrate against the terrorists who kidnap innocent people and behead them similarly after the madrid train bombings millions of spanish citizens demonstrated against their separatist organization eta but once the demonstrators realized that muslims were behind the terror attacks they suspended the demonstrations this example sent a message to radical islamists to continue their violent methods western appeasement of their muslim communities has exacerbated the problem during the four month period after the publication of the muhammad cartoons in a danish magazine there were comparatively few violent demonstrations by muslims within a few days of the danish magazines formal apology riots erupted throughout the world the apology had been perceived by islamists as weakness and concession worst of all perhaps is the anti americanism among many westerners it is a resentment so strong so deep seated so rooted in personal identity that it has led many consciously or unconsciously to morally support americas enemies progressives need to realize that radical islam is based on an antiliberal system they need to awaken to the inhumane policies and practices of islamists around the world they need to realize that islamism spells the death of liberal values and they must not take for granted the respect for human rights and dignity that we experience in america and indeed the west today well meaning interfaith dialogues with muslims have largely been fruitless participants must demand but so far havent that muslim organizations and scholars specifically and unambiguously denounce violent salafi components in their mosques and in the media muslims who do not vocally oppose brutal shariah decrees should not be considered "moderates " all of this makes the efforts of muslim reformers more difficult when westerners make politically correct excuses for islamism it actually endangers the lives of reformers and in many cases has the effect of suppressing their voices tolerance does not mean toleration of atrocities under the umbrella of relativism it is time for all of us in the free world to face the reality of salafi islam or the reality of radical islam will continue to face us dr hamid a onetime
