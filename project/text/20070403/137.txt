the afternoon report the war over war funds online edition president bush again lashed out at congress for pursuing legislation that ties spending on the war in iraq to a timeline for withdrawal showing no signs of backing down from a pivotal battle over his administrations war policy a day after senate majority leader harry reid said that he would seek to choke off funding for the war if the president rejects a troop timetable mr bush laced into democrats at a rose garden news conference this morning accusing party leaders on capitol hill of being "more interested in fighting political battles in washington than providing our troops what they need " both the senate and the house have passed legislation setting dates for pulling troops out of iraq and the two chambers must now reconcile the differences in the bills and send them on to the president but mr bush again promised he would veto any legislation containing an "artificial" timetable for leaving iraq and that democrats dont have the votes to override "if democratic leaders in congress are bound on making a political statement then they need to send me this unacceptable bill as quickly as possible when they come back from recess ill veto it and then congress can get down to business of funding our troops without strings and without delay " he said sen hillary clinton who is seeking the democratic nomination for president in earlier criticized the presidents veto threat speaking from a campaign event in iowa ms clinton said a veto would amount to a rejection of the "will of the american people" and that it is time to get american troops "out of the middle of this sectarian civil war " but the president said the political stalemate could actually force some troops to spend even more time in battle "congresss failure to fund our troops on the frontlines will mean that some of our military families could wait longer for their loved ones to return from the frontlines and others could see their loved ones headed back to the war sooner than they need to " mr bush said he argued that if a "clean" spending measure isnt passed by mid month the army could be forced to cut back on equipment and by mid may some forces might face extension of their deployments in iraq and afghanistan the congressional research service has said in a report that the army has the bookkeeping flexibility to fund war operations until july the president also criticized a trip to syria by the speaker of the house nancy pelosi ms pelosi arrived in that country today and is scheduled to meet with syrian president bashar assad in damascus tomorrow the white house argues that syria is a state sponsor of terrorism and has allowed foreign fighters to flow freely across its border into iraq helping replenish the ranks of terrorist fighters with connections to al qaeda and other insurgent groups mr bush said sitting down for a photo opportunity with mr assad transmits the improper message that syria is part of the international mainstream "there have been a lot of people who have gone to see president assad some americans but a lot of european leaders high ranking officials and yet we havent seen action " he said "in other words he hasnt responded its one thing to send a message its another thing to have the person receiving the message actually do something " ms pelosi made no
