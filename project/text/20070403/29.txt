daimler rift may complicate plans labor management conflict could interfere with efforts to sell chrysler frankfurt daimlerchrysler ag chief executive dieter zetsche will face anxious shareholders tomorrow amid growing pressure to jettison the unprofitable chrysler division behind the scenes mr zetsche also is sparring with his companys german labor representatives a little known conflict that has begun to disrupt operations and could complicate efforts to sell chrysler last week daimlerchrysler announced it would delay publishing first quarter earnings until may from the originally planned april the reason a dispute with its german union over how much overtime the companys bookkeepers could work a month earlier labor representatives on daimlerchryslers supervisory board nearly derailed a plan to build small cars with chery automobile co of china the deal which would allow the chrysler unit to export low cost chinese built cars to north america won approval only after the boards chairman hilmar kopper broke a deadlock between the boards labor and shareholder representatives more recently daimlerchrysler labor leaders have been speaking out against selling chrysler to a private equity buyer even as management has continued to explore that option while german labor leaders have worried that chrysler is diverting needed resources from the companys mercedes division private equity groups are seen in germany as aggressive job cutters and are opposed by unions there the public skirmishes between mr zetsche and his employee representatives are unusual in a country where corporate managers have a strong incentive to work out differences with labor in private unlike the u s germany requires large corporations to set aside half the seats on their supervisory boards the equivalent of corporate boards of directors for employee representatives to win appointment or reappointment to the management board executives must typically secure the support of at least two thirds of their supervisory boards members the idea enshrined in a law is to promote consensus between management and labor and to avoid messy public confrontations at daimlerchrysler managers have seen how the companys labor leaders can block an executives career path in the boards german employee representatives helped scuttle the planned promotion of wolfgang bernhard to run the mercedes division after mr bernhard clashed with then ceo jurgen schrempp over strategy a spokesman for mr zetsche said he wasnt available to comment but that mr zetsche has "a very professional relationship" with the labor representatives the companys top german labor leader erich klemm in an interview last month declined to comment on mr zetsches performance as ceo or their relationship but allowed that the past year has been trying "we have had a lot of difficult issues to discuss and many conflicts between the representatives of the work force and the company " he said the company faces pressure on the other side of the atlantic as well the united auto workers union hasnt given chrysler cost saving measures it has extended to detroit rivals contributing to the decision to study a sale since taking over in january mr zetsche has sought to make daimlerchrysler faster leaner and less complex than it was under mr schrempp whose year reign relied increasingly on labor support as criticism from shareholders grew three weeks into the job mr zetsche announced the elimination of some white collar jobs throughout the company in areas such as human resources accounting and communications and the shrinking of the management board to nine members from but in his haste to cut costs the companys labor representatives say mr zetsche damaged morale "there is a difference in the pride of the workers " mr klemm said "we are still proud of our products but our experience was that we lost the absolute security of our jobs " mr zetsches backers say such criticisms are normal during a period of cost cutting and that morale in germany has significantly improved in recent months one factor lifting employee spirits in germany lately has been a resurgence in profits at the companys german divisions on the same day in february that daimlerchrysler announced it would cut chrysler jobs and consider "all options" for the division the company said it would award german employees bonuses of euros &# the largest amount since it introduced profit sharing in mr zetsche also has the upper hand in any boardroom debate with union leaders over what to do with chrysler under german rules a decision to sell a division would require the approval of only a simple majority of the supervisory board which can be delivered by a tiebreaking vote from mr kopper the chairman many longtime daimlerchrysler observers expect that the boards german labor representatives wouldnt stand in the way of a sale to a private equity buyer despite recent public comments opposing the idea if it appeared the only way to protect the companys traditional cash cow mercedes to resolve the dispute over the bookkeepers overtime the company had to go to a german labor court and seek help from a court appointed mediator a process that took weeks union officials say they viewed the overtime request as inconsistent with recent job cuts exacerbating the dispute union leaders also are concerned about what they say is a proposal by management to move certain accounting jobs to the czech republic from high wage germany daimlerchrysler officials declined to comment on the specifics of the proposal but said talks with the union are continuing theodor baums an expert in german corporate governance at goethe university in frankfurt said that while "limited conflicts" between labor representatives and german ceos are normal it is unusual for ceos to risk a divided vote by their supervisory boards such as the one at daimlerchrysler over doing business with chery "managers in germany have what you might say are scissors in their heads " mr baums said "every manager has to be aware that if he pushes his labor representatives in the direction of an outright conflict his career will be fragile " almut schoenfeld in berlin contributed to this article
