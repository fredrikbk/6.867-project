why did starbucks cross the road to get to the customers on the other side says a new book but maintaining growth at the coffee chain is the challenge can starbucks corp keep up its growth thats a question many investors were asking even before a recently leaked memo from chairman howard schultz raised concerns about whether the company was diluting its brand after all the stores seem to dot every block in new york city and the company still plans to open new stores world wide over the next four years bringing the total number to more than maintaining that growth will determine the companys future and whether its stock can keep its lofty premium in this adaptation from "grande expectations a year in the life of starbucks stock " author karen blumenthal details how the company sustains its expansion with close attention to real estate trends consumer habits and store design on an overcast day doug satzman stood on the corner of mission and fourth streets in san francisco and tried to explain one of the most baffling aspects of the starbucks phenomenon how its stores manage to succeed even when they are located very close to each other to his right was the metreon an entertainment mall near the citys convention center with movie theaters arcade games and a small but spiffy starbucks store mr satzmans team had just approved a kiosk store inside a marriott hotel just across mission street and to our left across fourth street was guess what another spacious starbucks store three starbucks on four corners then mr satzman a director of new store development pointed to the fourth corner where the mission campus of city college of san francisco ran for half a block or more "we actively contemplated putting another unit in there " he said the demand was sufficient he added but they werent able to work out the logistics of a student run store three starbucks on four corners wasnt enough after all "if youre over here " mr satzman said referring to the metreon "you are not likely to cross the street if youre in the hotel you might be going to the right to market street " that was where the shopping was in the opposite direction the people in the movie theater or the hotel might never bother to go outside to find the full fledged starbucks store "where a lot of our growth is is driving that incremental cup that someone may not have planned to buy " he said capturing those spur of the moment cups of coffee is crucial to starbucks and its stock price the company may seem to be everywhere selling coffee beans ice cream and bottled drinks in grocery stores and dispensing its brew in restaurants and on airlines but the vast majority of starbucks sales and profits come from selling latte after macchiato after frappuccino at its u s stores and the vast majority of starbucks growth came from successfully opening new outlets mr satzman a big outgoing fellow in his early thirties led a team that scouted locations opening about stores in his northern california and reno tahoe nevada region during to see where the company focused and how he took me on a tour of his territory "in reality demand for specialty coffee is growing faster than we and our competitors can add stores combined " he explained the push to add stores he added "is really driven by demand " the metreon store was a mere square feet elegantly squeezed into a space that would otherwise be a lobby there was no need for a ceiling the store was primarily a counter with a space age sign and enough room for three or four employees though this seemed small starbucks even had an extra small version designed to fit in about square feet the hotel store since it was installed by a licensee didnt require any company capital at all across the street the bigger store at square feet was just about the typical size for a new store on average such a store cost about &# to open in and would turn in first year sales of about &# thats a sales to investment ratio of to a more than healthy return on the funds required and since starbucks stores tend to take two to three years to reach full sales strength the sales should grow a bit faster at the new stores than at old stores for a couple of years the sales to investment ratio drove every decision to open a store but starbucks had other reasons for larding up a dense urban neighborhood or downtown with more than one outlet despite many efforts to build sales later in the day most starbucks stores rang up at least half their sales before noon a store could handle only so many customers at a time and in the morning lines often grew no matter how badly people wanted a latte if the line looked too long theyd keep walking opening another store nearby was the retail equivalent of basketballs boxing out stationing yourself under the basket to get the rebound so the other team doesnt starbucks first saw this phenomenon in vancouver in the early s when it opened a second store kitty corner to a small store on a busy corner to everyones surprise people came to the corners from different directions so both stores did well the logic was so simple that it almost sounded like a corporate version of that old chicken joke "why did starbucks cross the street " "to get to the customers on the other side " the new store might take some sales away from the original location but it could lead to far more sales overall jim donald starbucks ceo said one texas store manager complained that his stores sales of &# million a year had flattened because of a new store across the street but the new store which had a drive through was on track to bring in &# million its first year so in the same vicinity starbucks was now pulling in &# million a year from two spots rather than &# million or &# million from a single store research showed that customers would travel only a few minutes to buy coffee or maybe six to eight minutes tops so for mr satzman and his team minutiae mattered was the location on the side of the street where people head to work was it on the end or the middle of a shopping center even a slight bend in the road "can really have a demonstrable impact on your business in the short run " said launi skinner starbucks senior vice president of store development mr satzman drove to our next location explaining that starbucks liked to enter a market with a splash picking a high profile intersection that everyone knows a strategy it called main &amp main once in place it expanded to multiple locations in san francisco its first spot was at union street and laguna a popular high profile shopping area and by it grew to coffeehouses in a city of about and about in the broader bay area a store at ninth and howard had once been controversial because it was situated like a eleven just behind gasoline pumps the gas stations mini mart was next door as was a burger king it was a high traffic corner near a hospital but starbucks officials werent sure they wanted to be that close to such retail riffraff now the store is one of just a handful nationwide open around the clock mr satzman said that in the middle of the night the customers might include a taxi driver a police officer an ambulance driver and hospital staff once mr satzmans team got its eye on a site it worked with the operations folks who will have to run it and all of them would be compensated in part on how their new stores performed other starbucks nearby were reviewed as were competitors then sales for the next years were forecast based on the historical trends in the region before a decision was made however the operations and real estate managers piled into a car and toured the site and area one more time the next stop on mr satzmans tour was a big quaint oakland store trimmed in yellow and decorated with a sign shaped like a coffee cup in a transitional neighborhood a few blocks from downtown the store was part of a joint venture with former los angeles lakers star magic johnson to open stores in lower income more diverse communities in addition to trying to encourage economic development the stores also gave a nod to starbucks expanding customer base in the mid s the typical starbucks customer was an affluent white college graduate but newer customers according to a company survey were somewhat more likely to be minorities and had an average income of &# a year down from more than &# for long timers still the oakland neighborhood was rather no frills and officials had been concerned that the store would fall short of initial goals it didnt on a weekday afternoon most of the seats were filled with people reading or visiting in quiet conversation fortified by a grande cappuccino mr satzman headed out again pointing out a new push to build stores on main highways even if that meant putting a store in tiny towns like buttonwillow calif or new braunfels texas company officials have said they see the potential for more than off highway stores the company has already addressed one hitch when people left the highway for coffee a line often formed first at the bathrooms starbucks has added additional bathrooms in newer highway locations in pittsburg calif about forty five miles east of san francisco mr satzman pulled up to a new store a former wienerschnitzel hot dog restaurant with a coveted drive through for years starbucks executives balked at opening drive throughs fearing that something so fast food like would sully its brand but beginning in fiscal about half of all new company owned stores included a drive through window which required more employees but also rang up much higher sales than traditional stores to make this one work mr satzman said starbucks had to convince the landlord to tear off the huge yellow triangular roof and build a new flat one with a little angle in front inside the store looked much like any other starbucks with the brightly colored pendant lights the wooden counter design and the rounded "hand off" bar now a laminated surface that will last longer than the old wood ones an early real estate executive arthur rubinfeld helped create the starbucks look encouraging designers to focus on what customers see when they walk in particularly the items between waist and chest high so stained woods went out front plastics in the back ceilings might be painted dark colors rather than finished with drab acoustical tile floors might be nothing more than concrete sofas and soft chairs were welcoming and round tables were preferred over square ones because they were more casual and a single person sitting at one looked less alone roughly of the store design was standard issue but the rest was up to the real estate and operations teams and their budgets one store in the belltown neighborhood of seattle added curtains others had murals at this former hot dog stand the old restaurants booths a starbucks rarity were still intact on one side of the store "each store is like a snowflake " mr satzman said adapted from "grande expectations a year in the life of starbucks stock" by karen blumenthal copyright by karen blumenthal published by crown business an imprint of crown
