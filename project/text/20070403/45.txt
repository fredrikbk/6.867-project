for baseballs first pitch links for each of the teams online edition oh what an offseason the tribune co stunned long suffering fans of the chicago cubs by lifting their standing orders that budget bean counters treat the franchise like a mid sized wisconsin weekly the boston red sox spent more money than most of us will ever see in our lives just for the right to give japanese import daisuke matsuzaka more money than most of us will ever see in our lives and the new york yankees are the new york yankees but money isnt everything formerly middling teams such as the milwaukee brewers cincinnati reds colorado rockies and arizona diamondbacks think they could follow the detroit tigers to the postseason promised land and even fans of the lowly kansas city royals have ace rookie alex gordon to look forward to in fact only a handful of teams head into april without at least being able to dream of sniffing a wild card come september and even for those teams theres green grass hot dogs and the sound of balls settling into mitts and flying off bats baseball is back and alls right with the world previews written by tim annett megan ballinger jim chairusmi emily friedlander stephen grocer and aaron rutkoff need more baseball the fixers and some guests make predictions for the season on to the links the senior circuit gets to go first both because its older and because it doesnt have the dh teams are listed in order of their predicted finish along with their record and finish in nl east new york mets first lost nlcs so close led by a strong offense the amazins were a base hit away from the world series last year when carlos beltran struck out looking with the bases loaded in the ninth inning of game of the nlcs the team returns basically intact as the nl east favorite but the world series not without pitching and the graying lineup is a "huge question mark " year old starter tom glavine tells jim salisbury of the philadelphia inquirer mr glavine is just wins shy of and so far hasnt shown his age quite as much as his something teammate starter orlando hernandez whos had arthritis troubles this spring pedro martinez a relative youngster at had surgery in october and may be back by august for a late season lift at age veteran outfielder moises alou should fit right in signed to a one year deal with an option for another year mr alou has played on seven teams in his year career including the world champion marlins but never in new york new york holds painful memories for mr alou whose father in law percio melo and brother in law were shot and killed when mr melos brooklyn bodega was robbed in "for the first few years after percios death alou left tickets for him at shea stadium when his team visited the mets " writes ben shpigel in the new york times philadelphia phillies second after dealing all star right fielder bobby abreu to the yankees at last years trading deadline it looked like the phillies had given up on the season and then they made a dash for the top of the division and fell just short of the wild card spot this year expectations are high particularly for young all stars chase utley and ryan howard mr utley enjoyed a game hitting streak last year and mr howard hit with home runs and rbi in the second half earning league mvp honors meanwhile the teams biggest offseason acquisition former chisox starting pitcher freddy garcia strengthens one of the leagues best rotations writing for the new york posts sports blog mike vaccaro calls this the breakout year for a phillies mets rivalry "for consecutive seasons the mets and the phillies have generated less buzz than mitt romney " this year "they should be the two best teams in the east they have games against each other this year if were lucky therell be a few more in october and then finally finally well have a rivalry worth simmering over " atlanta braves third the braves have something to prove after getting knocked off their year perch as division leaders yet the team didnt make any big changes to their roster pitching was a big issue last year and it remains so its uncertain whether tim hudson can bounce back from a disappointing season to shore up the top of the braves rotation alongside the reliable john smoltz last year braves relievers had a league high blown saves to fix the problem the team beefed up the bullpen re signing closer bob wickman and obtaining rafael soriano from seattle and mike gonzalez from pittsburgh the small tweaks could add up to something bigger the braves "seem to be re establishing themselves as serious contenders if not favorites in the national league east " writes phil rogers in the chicago tribune florida marlins fourth with an improving young team and a starting rotation helmed by dontrelle willis the marlins have heaps of potential but arent likely to challenge for a playoff spot last season the marlins had four rookie pitchers josh johnson ricky nolasco scott olsen and anibal sanchez with at least wins each including mr sanchezs sept no hitter theyre all back this year and looking forward to better run support from an offense led by star miguel cabrera and last years nl rookie of the year hanley ramirez no marlins manager has lasted longer than three and a half seasons with the team joe girardi who won the nl manager of the year award was promptly fired new manager fredi gonzalez who was third base coach for the braves for the past four years should feel right at home in miami where he grew up after his family moved from havana in a profile associated press sports writer steven wine writes "while floridas young players responded to girardis drill sergeant approach gonzalezs more genial personality should wear well over a long season gonzalez speaks fluent spanish rides a harley to work and likes to throw batting practice all of which helps with player manager camaraderie he smiles a lot and plans to do so throughout the season win or lose " washington nationals sixth the nationals third year is shaping up to be worse than the first two new manager manny acta was promoted from third base coach after frank robinson was let go alfonso soriano who hit home runs last year is gone leaving behind a collection of young prospects led by third baseman ryan zimmerman who debuted with rbi and home runs the pitching staff dont ask its going to take years for the nats to develop their players the washington posts thomas boswell writes looking at the promise of the teams farm system while also urging the nationals to acquire at least one free agent a year "now we have to wait lord knows how long for chris marrero and colton willems both still and zechry zinicola as well as players whose names arent even known yet to work their way up from the vermont lake monsters to the hagerstown suns to the harrisburg senators each day were supposed to exhume box scores off the internet from rookie a and aa ball to see who may get called to aaa columbus for this we waited a third of a century " mr boswells answer "actually yes " nl central chicago cubs sixth can a &# million spending binge elevate one of last seasons most embarrassing teams to a playoff berth well sort of the cubbies added slugger alfonso soriano the cream of the free agent crop as well as veteran pitchers ted lilly and jason marquis to a team that was plagued by freak injuries and mired in dysfunction the return of first baseman derrek lee whose fractured wrist doomed the cubs in should serve as a solid foundation for what promises to be the most powerful offense in the division and new manager lou piniella will provide a firm hand in the clubhouse with occasional explosions on the field but the cubs will only end up at the top of the nl central heap thanks to the weakness of their opponents helping the cubs into the postseason will be self proclaimed cy young candidate and future free agent carlos zambrano who has already made it clear that hes playing for a big contract with a new york team according to the chicago tribunes paul sullivan success will also come from a level of depth at key positions not seen on the north side in many years with useful role players like utility infielder mark derosa and fourth outfielder cliff floyd added to the mix in fact the cubbies may have finally prepared for the inevitable kerry wood and mark prior yet again spending substantial time on the dl mr wood wasnt expected to contribute beyond the bullpen which should prove sturdy without him as the chicago sun timess gordon wittenmyer reports and mr prior isnt expected to do much beyond serving as a fifth starter milwaukee brewers fourth the brew crew is on the rise and this may be the year that milwaukees youth movement finally pays some real dividends the raw talent that showed flashes of competence under ned yosts direction in should coalesce into a more fully functioning whole this year thanks in large part to personnel consistency and continuing big league maturity exciting youngsters such as prince fielder bill hall corey hart and rickie weeks will be more productive with the bat in and their defensive play has nowhere to go but up j j hardy and mr weeks who made up the middle of an unskilled brewer infield last season have been working especially hard to improve their defensive coordination tom haudricourt reports in the milwaukee journal sentinel a potentially crucial acquisition is former cardinals starter jeff suppan a reliable control pitcher who has proven he can win with his mid speed fastball journal sentinel reporter rick braun finds much to like in the brewers rotation which includes rising hurlers dave bush and chris capuano and may prove to be the best in the division but the keys will be ben sheets who has struggled to return from a injury and the performance of a shaky bullpen st louis cardinals first won world series the cardinals won the championship last year but youd be hard pressed to find anyone outside of st louis who believes they were the best team in baseball and sadly for loyal fans bedecked in red is the year that general manager walt jocketty decided to rest on his organizations laurels according to st louis post dispatch columnist bernie miklasz albert pujols will remain a monstrous hitter but this is the year that creaky cardinals heroes such as scott rolen and jim edmonds really will start to show their age ace chris carpenter will continue to dominate on the mound but with rotation mates such as kip wells and the hapless braden looper his efforts wont be nearly enough the teams past successes have come from journeymen who outperform for manager tony la russa but free agency attrition has left even those in short supply messrs suppan and marquis both reliable sources of wins in the past have moved to division rivals replaced by inexperienced hurlers anthony reyes and adam wainwright reporting from spring training the post dispatchs joe strauss saw signs that the offense is off to a slow start houston astros second the astros also are going to show their age this year fan favorite craig biggios quest for his th hit which seems assured barring injury may well be the only race worth watching thanks to andy pettittes return to new york and the annual roger clemens waiting game astros ace roy oswalt will have a heavy load to carry with very little help the team acquired rockies hurler jason jennings in the offseason and his numbers should improve thanks to houstons lower elevation but the pitching staff looks like trouble to houston chronicle blogger chip bailey given the state of the staff even chronicle columnist john p lopez sees the wisdom in mr clemenss decision to stay on the sidelines on offense the team still has two of the three killer bs and third baseman morgan ensberg who struggled for much of the season should return to his productive form but it looks doubtful that outfielder carlos lee who inked a &# million contract in the offseason has enough fire power to keep this overripe offense afloat cincinnati reds third another season begins in cincinnati with important question marks hanging over a star slugger how injury prone is ken griffey jr his latest setback a broken left hand came while playing with his children during the offseason the team should count it as an achievement if mr griffey is on the field for opening day even more risky for the reds according to the cincinnati enquirers john fay is the important roles given to young hitters brandon phillips and edwin encarnacion who will bat third and fifth respectively both may develop into legitimate run producers but if either falters the big red machine will grind to a halt the pitching rotation is equally unbalanced starters aaron harang and bronson arroyo proved they can dominate opponents last season but there will be little help from the bullpen when they leave the game the rest of the rotation is a disaster waiting to happen as enquirer columnist paul daugherty all but declares "no amount of happy outcomes will keep the reds relevant unless eric milton and kyle lohse pitch the way they did when they were good " he suggests thats exactly the problem neither pitcher has been anywhere near good in years pittsburgh pirates fifth the management team in pittsburgh evidently decided that first baseman adam laroche was all that was missing from last years ineffectual pirates squad beyond trading for the services of the former brave in the offseason the team made very few moves and looks likely to fare worse in sure theres all star outfielder jason bay who will continue to crush home runs over pnc parks short porches but crime against baseball chris duffy who dissolved into total uselessness just weeks into last season will be back in center the post gazettes dejan kovacevic reports that mr duffy at least doesnt expect a similar level of dysfunction which should make pirates fans feel a lot better then theres a pitching rotation that starts with the oft brilliant young hurler zach duke and rapidly descends to tom gorzelanny hell be the no on the pirates mr kovacevic says although on most major league teams he wouldnt qualify as a starter nl west san diego padres tied for first lost nlds trevor hoffman officially became the all time saves leader late last season and over his career hes become one of those pitchers who leave many hitters wondering whether they might not do better just to turn around and walk back to the dugout instead of taking their hacks when he walks on the field to ac dcs "hells bells " stares in at home plate like a sniper and jams a pitch in on the hitters hands the game is pretty much over in other words he seems like just the sort of veteran player who would eat rookies and non roster invitees at spring training for lunch not so according to tom krasovic of the san diego union tribune mr krasovic notes that the legendary closer spends a whole lot of time rubbing elbows with the high numbered minor league guys and other non stars who more than likely wont find their way on to the roster and will some day be regaling a coworker with a story of how the games greatest closer once taught them how to grip a fastball "hoffman prefers it that way always has he said even dating to his time at the university of arizona " mr krasovic writes " its the whole idea of believing you havent arrived yet said hoffman who washed out as a minor league shortstop before the reds moved him to the mound " los angeles dodgers tied for first lost nlds fire breathing starters have an honored role in dodger lore take for example the great don drysdale who never shrank from braining a batter who hovered a little too close to the plate or maybe just looked at mr drysdale funny these days brad penny has taken up the role of sulfur exhaling intimidator but if the dodgers are to push deep into the postseason this year los angeles times columnist bill plaschke writes that mr penny must keep his inner fire to a slow burn "he has started games as a gentle giant and ended in a rage he has started seasons as a dominant fastball pitcher and ended in a puddle he started last years all star game and ended the playoffs in the bullpen " a year ago mr plaschke wanted to see mr penny and his charles bukowski on the rubber routine on the next red eye out of town a fact not lost on mr penny as he pulled up a chair and sat down for an interview at the dodgers training camp in vero beach mr penny middle aged by baseball standards at says he knows he must do a better job of keeping his emotions on a low boil "i let my emotions get the best of me i was frustrated it was horrible i felt terrible " he says "but im older now ive got to handle myself better now and i will thats my goal " san francisco giants third call them the barrys by the bay first of course theres barry bonds that most loathsome symbol of everything that is wrong with the game for a sizable portion of the baseball loving republic oh and hes also a candidate to surpass the all time career home run record held for these many years by hank aaron for some of course the spectacle of mr bonds claiming the hallowed home run crown in a confetti of shredded grand jury testimony and steroid suspicion will be all too much to bear for that reason all eyes will be on san francisco this season but theres another reason to follow the giants this year and thats the teams stellar young pitching staff headed by former oakland athletic barry zito mr zito came to the giants as a free agent after flirting with a handful of east coast teams over the winter and joins a young rotation that also boasts promising talents matt cain and noah lowry this spring mr zito has looked fully prepared and focused and his work ethic has earned him the admiration of his new teammates writes henry schulman of the san francisco chronicle they dont see the wealthiest pitcher in the game thanks to his &# million contract "but a guy who comes to work in faded jeans and changes clothes fast so he can hit the weight room " arizona diamondbacks tied for fourth randy johnson who by all rights is the greatest pitcher in the brief history of the diamondbacks franchise is back in the fold after a stint with the new york yankees but his return aside the diamondbacks are all about youth theres the ace and reigning national league cy young winner brandon webb and young infielders conor jackson and stephen drew both former first round picks with the beloved luis gonzalez gone but not easily forgotten given the enormous "tribute to gonzo" special section in the arizona republic the year old eric byrnes who has all the gravitas of jeff spicoli is the grand gray old man of the outfield with two spots in the rotation still unsettled it could be a long season for the fresh faced club but starting pitcher edgar gonzalez may turn out to be one of the diamondbacks most pleasant surprises after a searing turn in spring training "when camp opened a little more than five weeks ago right hander edgar gonzalez had a strong chance to make the diamondbacks if only because hes out of minor league options " nick piecoro writes in the republic "but the way he has pitched recently in spring training hes all but made the options situation irrelevant " colorado rockies tied for fourth much like the diamondbacks the rockies are in the midst of a youth movement and the season may turn out to be rather short on wins but the team has brought in a savvy veteran to help in bringing up its prospects hoping outfielder steve finley will rub off the right way on the teams youngest players ryan spilborghs who may or may not make the rockies out of spring training tells sarah trotto of the arizona daily star that having mr finley who has now patrolled the outfield for each nl west club during a nearly two decade long career is "better than having any coach just picking his brain just having a guy you can watch do everything every day hes great " but mr finley is far from wandering around rockies camp like a drill sergeant "guys ask questions ill answer them " he says drolly al east new york yankees first lost alds the yankees had a very well unyankeelike offseason largely sitting out of baseballs buying binge though they signed andy pettitte perhaps the yankees biggest move was the jettisoning of gary sheffield to the tigers for prospects gm brian cashman expressed the yankees new philosophy to the washington posts dave sheinin saying "were not going to be anybodys sugar daddy anymore " that has led to speculation that the yankees nine year reign over the american league east may end this season despite firepower to spare any lineup that includes alex rodriguez derek jeter jason giambi johnny damon hideki matsui and bobby abreu is going to score a lot of runs in fact the yankees scored runs last year more than anybody else despite being without messrs matsui sheffield and abreu for much of the season the biggest question mark on the field is the starting pitching which the new york posts george king has tagged "staff mri " given its recent health issues things have become so tenuous that carl pavano will be the yankees opening day starter carl pavano the newark star ledgers lisa kennelly writes "more than anything else for pavano this season is about redemption " as for the supposed rift between messrs rodriguez and jeter which is sure to fill the back pages of new yorks tabloids the records bob klapisch writes that it pales in comparison to the drama that embroiled the bronx bombers of the late s boston red sox third while the yankees made little noise in the free agent market the red sox made the biggest splash signing daisuke matsuzaka for more than &# million the biggest question will mr matsuzaka live up to expectations the next biggest question will signing him change the balance of power in the al east the new york timess murray chass writes that the red sox have already gotten their moneys worth simply because the signing means "no matsuzaka in the bronx " and while dice k mania has swept new england josh beckett could be the key to the red sox season writes providence journals sean mcadams boston didnt stop their offseason spending with mr matsuzaka the team also added j d drew and julio lugo to its lineup yet as the boston globes dan shaughnessy writes "there are several elephants in this big room that houses the boston red sox " among them whether jason varitek will start hitting and how rookie dustin pedroia will play at second base but the chief elephant in that room mr shaughnessy says is how coco crisp will play toronto blue jays second with frank thomas vernon wells troy glaus and lyle overbay the middle of torontos lineup is as dangerous as any in baseball but if toronto is to challenge boston and new york its pitching staff will need to step up in roy halladay and a j burnett the jays have potentially the best one two combo in the teams history writes the toronto stars richard griffin gustavo chacin however could hold the key to the jays season the stars allan ryan points out "when hes on the jays have a rotation clearly three fifths full " mr ryan writes "when hes off well the toronto rotation can amount to three fifths question mark " baltimore orioles fourth this once proud franchise has stumbled badly this decade known in recent years for chasing high priced free agents sometimes past their prime the orioles ignored the allure of big name signings and instead chased the likes of aubrey huff jay payton steve trachsel and jaret wright given all the player turnover and all the disappointment phil wood writes in the baltimore examiner "hang on to your programs from mondays season opener and look at em again around this time in hopefully i wont be simply writing an update of this column " but while the orioles may have not pursued a top free agent this offseason the washington posts thomas boswell writes of the owner blamed for the teams downward slide "peter angelos hasnt changed hes just gone underground " tampa bay devil rays fifth at &# million tampa bay had the lowest payroll in the division last year and still was able to pare another &# million from it this offseason yet despite the tight purse strings many are predicting that the devil rays could surprise thats because the team is brimming with young talent carl crawford rocco baldelli delmon young and scott kazmir mr young considered an all star in the making has long been known for his bat but last season he became infamous for it drawing a game suspension for throwing his stick at an umpire during a minor league game "can he be the stable franchise cornerstone level player the rays envisioned when they drafted him with the no overall pick in so far in his brief career that question is still up for debate " writes the orlando sentinels josh robbins the yankees and red sox werent alone in raiding japan for talent the devil rays signed third baseman akinori iwamura "life for iwamura is more than fielding ground balls hitting and running for the tampa bay devil rays " writes dennis maffezzoli of the sarasota herald tribune al central cleveland indians fourth the indians had a disappointing season in but several sportswriters say this year could be the year for the young team si coms john donovan thinks the pieces are in place but says the team needs to start playing to its potential before the window closes "now with their once green starting pitchers entering their prime and the young position players starting to come into their own with a front office that has done a top shelf job of spackling the biggest holes in this very talented team the indians are poised finally to live up to their promise but it has to happen now " much has been written about travis hafner one of the best hitters in the game and rising star grady sizemore but the plain dealers bud shaw picks another player that could make a difference for the team this year utility player casey blake detroit tigers second lost world series last years surprise league champions the tigers should play near the top of the al again this year with a tough lineup given a shot in the arm by the addition of gary sheffield justin verlander the rookie of the year is a standout in a solid rotation and the detroit free presss john lowe writes that a new pitch should help the young hurler be even better this year "its almost unheard of that a starting pitcher could have success over any length of time without a reliable breaking ball yet maybe thats how good verlanders fastball is " another free press writer jon paul morosi profiles quirky reliever fernando rodney tigers manager jim leyland says the popular player known among teammates for whistling latin music and talking in a kermit the frog voice will likely be among his picks for the all star team this year minnesota twins first lost alds predicting a third place finish in the division might not seem fair to a powerful twins team but theyre playing in the most competitive division in baseball the twin cities team boasts mvp justin morneau and batting champion joe mauer they also have ace johan santana who captured pitchings triple crown by leading the majors in wins era and strikeouts last season self proclaimed serious twins fan and blogger aaron gleeman writes a preview of his favorite team for deadspin mr gleeman appreciates the twins six year winning streak but wonders if this season will end as others have with a postseason flop meanwhile as spring training winds down and many minor league players dreams die the minneapolis star tribunes joe christensen recounts catcher "miracle" mike redmonds tale the year old catcher now in his th season didnt play in his first major league game until he was almost the florida marlins had offered him a spot as a minor league coach but mr redmond wanted one more shot as a player just one at bat to get in the books when he finally got his break a start in a marlins game against the brewers he went for at the plate "first at bat against scott karl single second at bat single third at bat home run " chicago white sox third the world champions won more than games last year and return seven of nine hitters from the lineup and three of five starters mlb coms scott merkin says captain paul konerko "a quiet leader an eloquent and articulate speaker " and manager ozzie guillen "boisterous brutally honest sometimes profane and a shoot from the hip entertainer " are like "the odd couple " but the goal of winning another championship has united the two another key chisox player addition jim thome talks to the chicago sun timess joe cowley about his "a j pierzynski moment" and being a power hitter in the steroid era the slugger is closing in on career homers kansas city royals fifth kansas city has averaged fewer than wins for the past three seasons and there isnt much reason to look up the royals who had the second worst record in baseball last year and the worst home record suffered from young and inconsistent pitching last season in the offseason they picked up starter gil meche for &# million when a reporter asked about the acquisition royals manager buddy bell usually calm when answering for his losing team went ballistic "were trying to get better here thats all and i dont care what the commissioner thinks about that i dont get what other general managers think i dont care what anybody thinks were busy here trying to win games and im not going to worry about that we think we got a guy who can be a no pitcher on our staff thats all " joe posnanski of the kansas city star says mr bell is at his best with outbursts like this because it shows his passion "he believes theres a right and wrong way to play baseball he doesnt crunch numbers he doesnt like kooky stunts he loves baseball " its that passion that has let mr bell keep his job despite a dismal record al west seattle mariners fourth the mariners have been the divisions cellar dwellers the past three seasons but larry stone of the seattle times thinks the team could be set for a rebound "after close observation of the mariners and glimpses of the three flawed teams they have to beat out in the cozy al west ive come to the rousing conclusion that that that theyve got a shot " mr stone says year old felix hernandez seems poised for a breakout year "felix has the ability if harnessed to carry a team in a fashion the mariners havent had since prime time randy johnson " one constant on the team remains ichiro suzuki the arizona republics joseph a reaves writes that "some things about ichiro suzuki simply are given hell play harder than anyone on a baseball diamond and look more beautiful doing it hell get hits a season and nearly always get one when its needed most hell be the first player inducted into both the japanese baseball hall of fame and that one in cooperstown n y " hell also continue to be a somewhat mystical figure heres a clip of "ichiro versus " a japanese tv show in which the star outfielder matches wits against a well known figure from far ranging disciplines such as stage fashion science and law whatever angels of whatever second all eyes will be on the angels in the outfield vladimir guerrero gary matthews jr and garret anderson despite little protection in the lineup and nagging injuries mr guerrero had a productive year homers rbi mr matthews earned a five year &# million contract in free agency after a career season in texas but that deal has been roundly criticized and magnified since news broke about an alleged link between mr matthews and human growth hormone in an interview with bill plunkett of the orange county register the center fielder says "my focus isnt what someone writes or what someone thinks or what someone says this is literally nothing i havent dealt with for years it was well we dont know if hell make it to the major leagues then it was well we dont know if he can be an everyday player or well hell never be an all star its nothing new people may not believe it but its truly nothing new " meanwhile mr anderson has battled through injuries back knee foot hamstring the last three seasons the los angeles timess mike digiovanna says the left fielder is optimistic that the injury bug is behind him "anderson is feeling whole again vigorous pain free a man in full and that has the angels thinking anderson could regain his form of when the career hitter averaged home runs doubles and runs batted in " oakland athletics first lost alds it was a typical offseason for the as with a couple of key players leaving for greener pastures barry zito bolted across the bay to san francisco and frank thomas headed to toronto can the team continue to patch its holes with a shoestring budget and contend for the division title oakland has finished first or second for eight consecutive years the oakland tribunes carl steward isnt optimistic about the teams chances "maybe the worst clause you can use to preface a teams chances heading into a baseball season is if everything goes right " mr steward continues "at least for the as theres already no chance of it center fielder mark kotsay is out for at least the first half of the season following spring training back surgery and the defensive domino effect could be devastating " mike piazza was signed to fill the big void left at designated hitter by mr thomas after a one year stop in san diego mr piazza hopes to embrace a new role in oakland the san francisco chronicles susan slusser writes "even piazza was among those wondering how hed take to fulltime dh duties after catching his entire career he was leery enough about the switch that he agreed to only a one year deal so he could re evaluate after the season hed also talked about catching bullpen sessions and joining in pitchers and catchers meetings and although he still might do those things at some point piazza hasnt this spring and he hasnt gone nuts from boredom " texas rangers third if you were building a fantasy baseball team in nobody would look at you
