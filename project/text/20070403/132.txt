soldiers beware going to the mall might be risky military tv offers tips on all aspects of life advice from cheerleaders bagram airfield afghanistan american forces network has a message for u s combat troops dont leave snacks on the countertop or spend too much at the mall or exercise without stretching and for everyones sake dont drive drunk tired on underinflated tires without a helmet with a cellphone or irresponsibly on narrow european roads in chow halls and morale tents throughout the afghan and iraqi theaters the nine television channels of afn are a source of news sports entertainment and a heavy dose of motherly scolding and advice barred from running commercial ads afn instead fills the white space in its tv schedule with hundreds of its own spots telling americas fighting men and women how to live safely and soundly the result is a melange of messages that can seem out of sync with a military at war "sometimes we all go a little overboard at the mall " the announcer intones empathetically in one spot "but understanding the difference between an occasional splurge and a serious spending problem is important for financial well being " "a routine is one way to help us deal with stress when were deployed " advises a soldier in another ad using his metal canteen cup to shave on the battlefield "help us avoid injuries so we can all support our team together " the orlando magic cheerleaders cheerfully implore in a spot touting the value of pre workout stretching "warm ups important for team success " afn broadcasts to all overseas military installations as well as to navy ships at sea entertaining troops with everything from judge judy to spongebob squarepants ultimate fighting championship to oprah winfrey bill oreilly to jon stewart "we cant air commercials and a minute show runs minutes " says air force senior master sgt richard simonsen superintendent of afn at bagram airfield a major u s base outside kabul "so weve got minutes each hour to fill " and fill them afn does with a barrage of life tips and educational announcements drawn from a list of pentagon approved subject areas afn generates about spots per year mostly put together by private production houses and keeps in stock the endless soundtrack to american military life in countries "we bring them entertainment and information just like theyd see watching tv back at home " says paul waldrop chief of the alexandria va production office of american forces radio &amp television service which runs afn "and at the same time we bring them spot announcements its command information to help service members in all aspects of their lives " the afn falls under the pentagons office of public affairs some messages come straight from washington such as reminders about how to apply for military savings accounts receive veterans benefits or avoid motorcycle accidents "there are so many service members involved in the war and that rush of adrenaline " says mr waldrop "then they come home and they think theyre invincible and dont necessarily practice good safety " other spots are produced at the direction of local commanders at bagram for instance ads remind soldiers and airmen to take their weekly pills on "malaria mondays " but troops also get antiterrorism tips about remaining inconspicuous at european cafes a reminder to file change of address forms with the post office well ahead of any move and advice about getting security deposits back on rented housing "how safe is your kitchen " one narrator asks instructing soldiers and their spouses to turn pot handles toward the back of the stove top out of reach of small children "keep the snacks out of sight " the narrator adds for good measure "take an honest look at your shopping habits " advises financial planner june walbert in another ad "do you shop to make yourself feel better are you hiding purchases from your spouse " in an antitobacco spot a pretty woman walks by a gi in civilian clothes they exchange smiles and she turns to admire his passing form then she notices the puck size circular mark on his jeans pocket the telltale shape of a can of snuff and her interest turns to revulsion "smokeless tobacco may be costing you more than your good health " the announcer says the soundtrack plays "whos sorry now " the hectoring strikes some in the military as condescending "im years old i kind of know not to drink and drive " says pfc daniel rangel a soldier stationed in afghanistan "i know to lock stuff " in part the incongruity of broadcasting lifestyle tips to war zones reflects the incongruities of the war zones themselves even in iraq and afghanistan big military bases can be insulated from the war when u s forces seized kandahar airfield in afghanistan in for instance it was little more than a shattered soviet terminal building set amid pomegranate trees and land mines today some coalition troops live there while the infantry grind it out in cold mountain passes supply convoys dodge roadside bombs and jets patrol the night skies many military personnel work within the razor wire confines of the base from the moment they arrive at the war to the moment they leave aside from the occasional incoming taliban rocket life at the kandahar base isnt that different from garrison life in europe japan or the u s the british have set up a pub like coffee shop that shows rugby games the canadians have brought in their favorite bagelry and built a street hockey rink with lights for night games the americans have imported burger king subway and pizza hut which even delivers to the troops modular housing "buckle up kandahar " signs warn along the hard packed streets through camp military police even ticket those who exceed the posted speed limit of miles an hour on their way to bingo night or the horseshoe tournament "we call it operational risk management " says air force lt col chris hannon the year old commander of the st expeditionary rescue squadron which retrieves downed pilots out of kandahar "things we can control lets control " the same philosophy guides the afn cautionary tales broadcast to troops who might be watching television one moment and in combat the next in one spot somber music plays as the camera shows the polished black granite and etched names of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington cut to a car crushed in a drunk driving accident "how do you want your soldiers to be remembered " the caption reads before morphing into "how do you want to be remembered " "the target audience is to year olds who might not have higher education " says air force master sgt rick sarchet afn station manager at bagram others put it more bluntly "they dont just put that stuff out there for the fun of it " says air force tech sgt eric mcnabb a year old helicopter door gunner "they do it because people are stupid enough to do those things its common sense not to tip over the vending machine but theres no class in high school or college to tell you not to do it "
