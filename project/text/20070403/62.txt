jolly green justices the current supreme court is a talented group of jurists but until yesterday we didnt think their expertise ran to climatology the justices would have done better in their big global warming decision if theyd stuck more closely to the law they showed no such modesty in massachusetts v environmental protection agency a narrow majority managed to diminish the rules of judicial standing rewrite the definition of "pollutant" under the clean air act and dramatically curtail the decision making authority of the executive branch and judging from justice john paul stevenss majority decision they did so because the five justices are personally anxious about rising temperatures as justice antonin scalia noted in dissent the "courts alarm over global warming" has led it to substitute "its own desired outcome" for the epas judgment the case goes back to when activists frustrated that congress hadnt enacted a global warming program demanded that the epa use its clean air act power to unilaterally regulate co "pollutants" from cars the epa declined to do so in claiming it lacked authority under the clean air act to regulate co the greens and several states turned to that mecca for frustrated liberal policy makers the courts the five supreme climatologists granted al gores fondest wish by declaring that "the harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized " the majority warned about a "precipitous rise in sea levels " "severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems" and "increases in the spread of disease " the court used all of this not so inadvertent opining to justify its conclusion that co is indeed a "pollutant " the clean air act requires the epa to regulate "any air pollutant" from cars that might "endanger public health or welfare " though the majority took the widest view that the definition includes any "physical chemical" substance that goes in the air next up oxygen justice scalia poked fun at this reasoning noting websters definition of "pollute" is "to make or render impure or unclean" which might apply to sulfur dioxide or other dirty gases but not a product of human respiration that resides in the upper atmosphere in any case isnt this something for congress to decide global warming was already a hot topic in when congress last amended the clean air act yet it declined to enact amendments that would have forced the epa to set co emissions standards the members have since been engaged in periodic brawls over whether and how to regulate co but voila the high court has now declared that it shall be so the ruling means the epa must regulate automobile co emissions unless that agency can show the science of global warming or the potential harm it may cause are too uncertain to justify action the bush epa will no doubt be sued whatever it does congress will also dive in with more regulation if only to clear up the legal uncertainty perhaps most distressing is the way the majority made a hash of traditional "standing" doctrine which determines when a plaintiff has a right to sue to justify its global warming afflatus the justices simply asserted that the massachusetts coastline faces imminent threat from rising seas not even mr gore goes that far but the court cites climate models to suggest future harm in order to claim the threat of immediate injury and thus standing by the bay state "aside from a single conclusory statement there is nothing in petitioners standing declarations and accompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss of massachusetts coastal land from th century global sea level increases " writes chief justice john roberts in his dissent "it is pure conjecture " and done for the purpose of pure policy invention standing is one of the few self restraints on the power of the federal courts and it is a far too frequent habit of the current supreme court to view its own power as unlimited by diluting the standards for standing the high court creates a highway by which judges can speed past the political branches and play an ever larger role in american public life it is also worth noting that this is at least the third case in two years in which justice kennedy has provided the fifth vote for a decidedly activist liberal majority someone recently quipped that justice stevens considers it his late lifes work to compete for the jump ball that is the jurisprudence of justice kennedy and he seems to be winning most possessions see related letters "letters to the editor judicial emissions on global warming" wsj april
