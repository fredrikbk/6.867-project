quarterly mutual funds review this managers folksy manner belies his record and worries boston to hear dan fuss talk you might not think he has run one of the top bond funds in the world over the past decade ask for a prediction about the market and he says "this is obviously guesswork the odds of this being correct are zero " or "this guess is on very tenuous very thin ice " or "does anybody call the economy well i dont " or "this is a bedtime story im telling you " the folksy manner belies his funds formidable record the &# billion loomis sayles bond fund which mr fuss has managed since its inception in has returned an average of a year since then and is ranked as the no fund in its corporate debt category over the past decade that makes mr fuss years old one of the best bond fund managers in the business arguably better than higher profile peer textbill gross of pacific investment management co who runs the biggest bond fund in the country mr grosss &# billion fund up an average a year since its inception is in a category that generally carries less risk mr fuss has prospered by looking for bargains in odd places from the debt of a troubled biotech company to general electric co bonds payable in new zealand dollars he and his co manager kathleen gaffney like finding out of favor bonds "before the rest of the world notices " he says after nearly years he likes to joke that hes been around the markets so long that they feel like a favorite corner tavern the only thing to worry a regular like him he says is "a change in the bartender " its definitely a time of change in the bond markets mr fuss believes after years of falling interest rates hes ready to declare an end to the era of cheap borrowing the u s governments need to fund its deficit will soon usher in a long period of rising interest rates he thinks that economic outlook reminds him of a similar period in the late s back then federal spending on the vietnam war and great society programs helped spark inflation that the government attempted to tackle by raising interest rates a trend that generally held until the early s mr fuss sees todays u s budget deficit expanding over the next years this time around the increase will be driven by "spending for old folks " he says "im very glad im an old folk and id like to see young folks support me " wisecracks aside the outlook of a bond fund manager who has profited from the turns of the economy over the past years is worth serious attention in recent months many investors have oscillated between fear of a steeper than expected business slowdown in the u s to cautious optimism about the economy the upbeat view has faltered in past weeks as turmoil hit world markets but one constant has been the expectation that interest rates will remain relatively low if mr fusss long term assessment is right investors will have to switch gears again higher rates typically hurt stocks by raising borrowing costs for companies and consumers further damping economic activity he sees the yield on the year treasury remaining near its present level of just above in the short term before rising to as high as over the next three years an environment of rising interest rates isnt necessarily bad news for bargain hunters like mr fuss and ms gaffney in recent years their bets have included indebted semiconductor companies retailer kmart co and currencies they believe will appreciate against the u s dollar "we were active in iceland a couple of weeks ago " he says mr fuss is "a voice of reason in the mutual fund arena " says paul herbert a senior fund analyst at morningstar inc "its not just his investing acumen but the sense that hes in it for the little guy " mr herbert notes that mr fuss has invested more than a million dollars of his own money in the flagship bond fund mr fuss got into the bond business in after returning to wisconsin following a tour as a lieutenant in the u s navy he began working at the local bank in wauwatosa where he had tucked away savings from his boyhood paper route he did everything from mopping floors to running numbers on the banks bond portfolio he started working for loomis sayles in mr fuss still favors some of the work routines he learned back in the early days he isnt averse to computers and blackberrys he uses both but also likes to keep track of trades and markets on an old fashioned column paper ledger "i learn a lot through the end of a pencil " he says "every day im doing some pencil work and also three colored pen work " each weekday he writes down prices for specific bonds on fridays he writes down commodity prices on saturdays he records trends in the bond and stock markets hes even been known to use a slide rule to do calculations "i do like the rule " he says "because unlike the computer you can scratch your back with it " ms gaffney joined mr fuss as co manager on the fund in her early days at loomis sayles were spent trading stocks and she used to poke her head in the "war room" where fund managers monitored the days events usually she was the only woman in the room and "dan would always chat no matter what " she recalls later he tapped her to join his team of bond traders the fund operates within certain constraints of its assets have to be in investment grade debt and no more than can be bonds from outside the u s and canada those limits aside the managers roam widely both in terms of geography and the credit quality of their bonds "theyre going places where others might not go to the same degree in emerging markets and high yield bonds " mr herbert says one good buying opportunity is investment grade bonds that have been downgraded due to a leveraged buyout or a private equity deal mr fuss says he loves getting "fallen angels" that are on the verge of climbing back into investment grade category another example of the duos bond picking strategy is their approach to biotech firm vertex pharmaceuticals inc in the mid s a promising drug in the companys pipeline didnt work out and the stock plummeted mr fuss and ms gaffney held the companys convertible bonds which are securities that can be converted into stock at a certain price the fund managers analyzed the companys finances and concluded it had enough cash to fund its operations for five to seven years so they decided to stick with it finally in vertex announced promising initial results for an oral hepatitis c drug with huge potential the stock jumped in a single day in may and from then until the end of that year it gained an additional such bets dont always pan out of course mr fuss and ms gaffney bought delta air lines inc bonds in because they thought the company had the strength to withstand an economic downturn but then the attacks of sept and the emergence of low cost rivals combined to hobble the airline bonds purchased at cents on the dollar fell to cents on the dollar at which point the managers cut their losses these days ms gaffney says its becoming more difficult to deliver returns in the developed world and places like asia have captured their attention "there are fewer pockets of value" in developed markets she says "its getting trickier and trickier " every weekday morning at mr fuss gets a snapshot of how bonds are performing around the world as traders recap the previous days action and talk about whats going on on one morning in february discussion swirled around hsbc holdings plcs announcement about the extent of bad loans in its mortgage business the meeting of finance ministers from the group of seven developed countries and a recent inflation figure from mexico mr fuss interest in overseas markets stems partly from what may unfold at home he expects federal spending will grow as a percentage of economic activity and budget deficits will require the government to issue more debt with a greater supply of treasury bonds in the market their prices will drop pushing their yields higher he expects inflation to pick up even as economic growth decelerates his term for it is "slowflation " which would be an unappealing prospect but still fall short of stagflation the combination of a shrinking economy and rising prices witnessed in the s mr fuss says its a good time to be cautious about higher risk junk bonds investors might also consider tax deductible municipal bonds as a way of protecting themselves against tax increases aimed at reining in a rising deficit for his fund he says an environment of rising interest rates "pushes you back toward item selection and patience "
