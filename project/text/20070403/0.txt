equal rights time warp last week a group of democratic leaders and feminist activists announced a campaign to resuscitate the equal rights amendment while the first campaign to pass this amendment stalled in the s supporters claim it will sail through in todays political climate as sen barbara boxer told a cheering mostly female crowd "elections have consequences and isnt it true those consequences are good right now " but the era would have no good consequences none and many terrible ones the era first introduced in says "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex " what could be fairer or more reasonable but the equal protection clause of the th amendment already bans unreasonable state discrimination against women while the civil rights act and other federal statutes ban unreasonable private discrimination a robust body of law has developed since banning sex discrimination in jury selection unemployment benefits and family property law and promoting womens progress in the workplace sports and other arenas anyone who believes the era would be applied with common sense has not been paying attention its proponents have an entirely different agenda to ban reasonable forms of discrimination by changing the constitutional standard from "equal protection" to "equality of rights " the era would hand radical feminist groups such as the national organization for women and the national womens law center a powerful weapon to wage war on what they view as "the gender system " consider for example what happened in when the u s department of education changed its regulations to allow public schools to experiment with single sex classes feminist groups were enraged now compared the new policy to separating children by race claiming that it "perpetuates sex stereotyping girls as the traditionally subordinated group are likely to experience a badge of inferiority as a result of being grouped on the basis of sex " the era would constitutionalize this point of view requiring judges to apply the same "strict scrutiny" they would use to evaluate a law or policy that segregates people by race i once debated celebrity lawyer gloria allred who was suing the boy scouts for excluding girls she accused the scouts of practicing "gender apartheid " she lost the case but the era would guarantee its success boy scouts would be forced to "integrate" sororities and fraternities would be eliminated or required to merge religious institutes that do not allow ordination of women would lose their tax exempt status single sex schools and summer camps for boys would be phased out tolerating them would be tantamount to tolerating separate but equal schools for blacks and whites or tax deductions for segregationist academies or religious cults the fallacy of era is that the sexes unlike the races really are different in socially pertinent ways but to hard line feminists every form of differentiation every departure from "equality of rights" is sexist discrimination but wait the official era web site sponsored by the alice paul institute and the national council of womens organizations assures us that the era "would not make all single sex institutions unconstitutional only those whose aim is to perpetuate the historical dominance of one sex over the other " for most feminists however traditional male groups by definition perpetuate dominance so what the era supporters are really saying is that female only groups can expect to enjoy special protection this double standard to permit women only groups is justified on the grounds that they are needed to help women overcome historical subordination that explains why there are now vast numbers of federal state and local educational programs for girls and few for boys deborah brake a former senior counsel at the national womens law center now teaching at the university of pittsburgh law school has argued that female only programs and organizations can be permissible "in light of the history of discrimination against women in education and the barriers that female student continue to face based on gender " never mind those female students no longer face barriers based on gender or that college enrollments are now female women are well protected from invidious discrimination by the th amendment and the civil rights act of era proponents need to explain why existing "equal protection" guarantees are inadequate and which currently legal institutions and practices they would like to see abolished should the era become law ms sommers a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute is the author of "the war against boys" simon &amp schuster see related letter "letters to the editor equal rights amendment is still needed" wsj april
