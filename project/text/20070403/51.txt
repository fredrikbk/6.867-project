guantanamo vindication not all the supreme court news yesterday involved judicial overreach the justices also rejected an appeal from guantanamo detainees who sought to challenge their confinement in federal court the rejection is important because it more or less puts an end to five years of legal challenges to the structure of how the bush administration has sought to handle enemy combatants in the war on terror the decision in boumediane v bush means that for all practical purposes the current bush architecture of guantanamo and the military commissions act will face no more frontal constitutional challenges it takes four justices to accept a case and three liberal members of the court said they would have done so justices anthony kennedy and john paul stevens issued a more technical "statement" saying they were open to hearing future appeals of the military hearings that the administration is now conducting at guantanamo but such appeals would relate to the adequacy and fairness of those reviews not to their constitutionality liberal activists and the lawyer at shearman and sterling who represents the terrorists at gitmo decried the rejection but it would have been astonishing had the high court accepted the case given its invitation in hamdan last year for congress to work out the rules on military commissions with the executive congress promptly did so in the military commissions act and president bush signed it even this willful court may think its going too far to so quickly challenge a decision reached by both political branches especially one the court itself had invited
