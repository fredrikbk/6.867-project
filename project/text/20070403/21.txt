colleges reject record numbers this years college admissions competition is turning out to be more brutal than ever and not just for students who applied to elite universities a number of top tier state schools and smaller liberal arts colleges say they received more applications this year from well qualified students and consequently are turning down a higher percentage of them the university of north carolina at chapel hill received applications up from last year the state schools acceptance rate fell to from at kenyon college in gambier ohio students applied up yet it accepted down from last year to prevent overenrollment even schools that admit the vast majority of applicants are becoming more selective miami university in oxford ohio saw a record applicants this year up from the year before it accepted of them down from last year "students are being more intelligent about what their options are when getting into school and they are looking in the next tier now " says jennifer delahunty britz kenyons dean of admissions and financial aid "schools that did not used to be on the radar of talented students are now on the radar " many ivy league universities also drew record numbers of applicants and consequently admitted students at lower rates the university of pennsylvania saw applications rise over the last year to a record while its acceptance rate fell to from about last year "the talent of students in the pool was so exceptional that we had difficulty making choices " says lee stetson dean of admissions at the philadelphia school dartmouth college had a record applications up from last year it accepted or its lowest acceptance rate in history harvard university drew a record applicants and accepted a record low at stanford university the number of applications rose to it accepted down from last year several factors are fueling the rise in applications one is population trends the number of students graduating from high school has risen each year since the school year according to the national association for college admission counseling the u s department of education predicts that the trend will continue until at least another is the growth in international students at unc chapel hill for instance recruiters went abroad for the first time this year making trips to shanghai and other asian cities to promote the college unc had foreign nationals apply this year up from last year the university admitted of them up from about a year ago a third is the growing use of the common application a form that can be completed online and sent to a number of admissions offices far more easily than paper based applications more than schools accept it the common application has "made it much easier for people to file applications " says charles deacon dean of undergraduate admissions at georgetown university georgetown doesnt take the common application to try to hold down its number of applicants he says still the washington d c university saw applications rise to from last year it accepted of them down from a year ago to be sure not all of the most selective colleges saw a rise in applicants yale universitys applications fell to from last year although there has been speculation that yales low acceptance rate last year caused fewer students to apply this year the dean of admissions has said the decline was due to a random fluctuation says yale spokesman tom conroy generally though college officials agree it has become more difficult to get into selective schools as a result some high school counselors are encouraging students to be more realistic in deciding where to apply "its more competitive every year " says shirley bloomquist a private counselor in great falls va "im seeing more parents and students look at safety schools " ms bloomquist says she now emphasizes that students should prepare for their "likely" schools those where they have a good shot rather than their "reach" schools she also encourages high schoolers to start looking at colleges during their sophomore year rather than spring of junior year when most begin the process that gives them more time to find additional schools that may not be their top choices but still would be desirable even high school seniors with exceptional grades are being careful with their expectations last year "i had some really smart friends who applied to some schools they didnt get into " says james newman the salutatorian at lamar high school in houston he has a grade point average boosted above by international baccalaureate courses and scored a on his sat out of he is active in his church youth group and has been an eagle scout vice president of the national spanish honor society and vice president of the school choir mr newman applied to princeton university stanford middlebury college duke university davidson college in north carolina and the university of texas at austin but he learned from his friends experiences "i tried not to have a definite first choice " he says "i thought its likely id get rejected because its so competitive " he was turned down by princeton wait listed at stanford and accepted by his other choices he says he is now leaning toward duke hes not optimistic about getting into stanford indeed college officials warn they may not take many students from their wait lists this year "we have not gone to the wait list for two years and we would like to " says tom parker dean of admissions and financial aid at amherst college wait lists allow colleges to adjust their freshman class if there is a shortage of students with particular strengths and characteristics who plan to attend amherst currently has students on its wait list mr parker expects fewer than half to stay on it of those who do amherst hopes to accept students in the past few years colleges even top level state schools have seen a higher than expected yield or percentage of students admitted who end up attending that means there are fewer spaces for wait listed students the greater competition has made the admissions process increasingly frustrating for students including those who dont apply to elite schools corey king a senior at urbana high school in ijamsville md who wants to study music heard from his first choice berklee college of music in boston via email last week "i actually injured my hand punching my door when i found out i didnt get in " he says mr king who has a grade point average is a member of his high schools rock music appreciation club and french club he also applied to mcgill university in canada the university of maryland and towson university in maryland "now im afraid i wont get into mcgill or maryland and ill get stuck going to towson " which he considers "one step above community college " if mr king is turned down by mcgill he says he will reapply to berklee next year he says he is feeling pessimistic after the berklee rejection but there is one consolation "no matter what everyone is like im so done with high school " he says
