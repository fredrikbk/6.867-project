face the music the road to american idol amateur night competitions date back to era long before rise of reality tv sometimes when im driving through harlem i think of simon cowell of course mr cowell the most notorious judge on the musical talent contest "american idol " isnt from new york city or even from america but i think of him when im uptown because of a local harlem landmark the apollo theater long before "american idol " would be stars would flock to harlem to try their luck at amateur night at the apollo the apollo formerly a whites only burlesque theater opened its doors to blacks in the amateur contest was launched that same year a television show based on the contest "its showtime at the apollo " has been on the air since apollo audiences dont just watch the show theyre part of it they often boo performers off before theyve finished their songs and sometimes before theyve finished the first stanza they are as opinionated as mr cowell only louder and there are many more of them listen to james brown singing "lost somebody" at the apollo real windows media its easy to dismiss "idol" as exploitation arguing that it turns musical artists into vocal gladiators and music appreciation into mob rule "i liked the first one " the british singer joss stone recently said on a u s talk show "but i think if you keep going with it it gets more and more cheesy " but the talent search has a long history in the music industry and "idol" is just the latest example of such a showcase ms stone may be openly skeptical of "idol " but she got an early career boost from an appearance on the bbcs talent competition "star for a night " "idol" is often categorized with todays many "reality shows" because it mixes documentary elements with game show razzle dazzle viewers are sometimes doubtful about the "winners" of reality shows wondering if they really deserve to share magazine covers and red carpets with the likes of justin timberlake tony bennett or michael jackson thats fine except all three of those "real" celebrities had their musical careers boosted by an appearance in a talent contest it makes more sense to see "idol" not as a modern day debasement of artistry but as just the latest attempt by the music industry to give its star making machinery a populist gloss the idea that in entertainment the customer should be king has roots in vaudeville "the audience is never wrong " to quote comedian singer actor eddie cantor in the vaudeville history "no applause just throw money" by trav s d or as singer and actor jimmy durante once put it "the customers are boss and you have to please them no matter how it hurts " which isnt to say that talent shows necessarily promote deeper kinds of musical expression in finding crowd pleasing singers "the amateur night is primitive " argued fanny brice the singer and comic who launched her career through an amateur night and whose life was fictionalized in the broadway show and film "funny girl " both starring barbra streisand "it is a thing of large proportions it is either terribly cruel or vastly appreciative leaping like a wild animal on the weak praising to the skies those who please it and always admiring a fighter " the idea of an amateur night competition goes back at least as far as the s to miners bowery theater according to the book "low life" by luc sante winners at miners amateur night held on alternate fridays might get a watch or &# in gold a competition featured a juggler a quartet of singing newsboys and even a clay modeler imagine mr cowell weighing in on an arts and crafts presentation people came to miners not just for the performances but also for the audience reaction which could be rough and rowdy in part because the theater was located near a poolroom and a saloon the idea of giving a performer the hook morphed into the idea of being voted off tv may have been invented at miners as the story goes the first hook was used by a quick thinking stage manager who lashed a stage prop shepherds crook to a pole and pulled off a performer who was bombing "give im the hook " became a catchphrase soon afterwards and other theater owners tried to copy miners by coming up with their own crowd pleasing ways to cut short failing acts blasts of seltzer from spray bottles or carrying performers out on stretchers some of the most successful talent shows such as amateur night at the apollo began during the great depression while suffering through economic hard times people were not only looking for escapist entertainment but for actual escape they wanted to see and hear that success and even stardom were still possibilities for ordinary americans talent contests offered proof of that while flattering listeners and viewers by soliciting their votes and making them part of the selection process in long before "idol" or ed mcmahons "star search " edward bowes launched what would be known as "the original amateur hour " a talent contest carried on the radio and later on television mr bowes said the purpose of the program was "to provide a forum whereby talented unknown artists may be assured a hearing" and in the days before cable tv the internet and ringtones that was a bold statement of purpose "the original amateur hour" soon caught on becoming famous for a gong struck to stop performances that were too awful to continue "the gong show" would bring the practice back in mr bowes would also spin a wheel of fortune to select participants while saying his catchphrase "round and round sh e goes and where she stops nobody knows " most of the shows participants dancers comedians singers and other entertainers started out unknown and remained that way but a few stood out frank sinatra for example appeared on the show with his group the hoboken four "im frank " he announced on the program "were looking for jobs how about it " pat boone and gladys knight also appeared on the show at one point nearly half of americans watching television were tuned into "the original amateur hour " today its "idols" turn at the top the rest of the music industry may be in a slump but "idol" is holding up well a fair number of the shows top participants have sold millions of records kelly clarkson and rocker chris daughtry for example several have won major awards carrie underwood won the grammy for best new artist and one recently picked up an oscar jennifer hudson of "dreamgirls" in the era of downloading it sometimes feels like the music industry has lost the knack for birthing new stars "american idol" shows that at least in some cases it still knows how to find talent listen to mr daughtrys "its not over" real windows media but there may be limits to "idols" accomplishments talent shows cater to popular tastes but they may also warp artistic judgment artists on such shows often eschew more nuanced song interpretations in favor of broader audience pleasing performances tailored to win applause and votes the old vaudeville idea that the customer is king in entertainment may be a good way to judge artists but is it the smartest way to develop them some of the most acclaimed artists in music history bob dylan for example began as little understood niche artists how would they have fared if their early efforts were put to a nationwide popular vote after all mr dylan was famously booed at the newport folk festival in though some music historians contend fans were just upset about the poor quality of the sound system moreover we should be careful about using "idol" as any indication of the music industrys future "idol" judges contestants on their performances not on their songwriting ability or instrumental prowess and it looks more to the past than the future until the final rounds contestants are generally asked to sing songs from years and even decades past show tunes pop standards disco ballads and top hits so far this year contestants have been asked to sing songs first made famous by diana ross and the supremes and numbers popularized by british invasion acts from the s hip hop latin music and other contemporary music trends are usually avoided "idol" is on top today but will that last talent show history offers a cautionary tale arthur godfrey the namesake of "arthur godfreys talent scouts " was one of the biggest television stars of the th century his show which ran on radio and tv from to helped launch the careers of patsy cline and lenny bruce mr godfrey was seen as a man of the people who gave ordinary folks a shot at stardom but in october he fired singer julius la rosa on the air that was seen as a particularly heartless bit of downsizing public opinion turned against mr godfrey and his career withered talent shows judge talent but in the end the shows themselves can get judged listen to mr godfreys "too fat polka" real windows media mr godfrey in his time at the top tried to stay somewhat current whenever his mother would ask him to feature more ragtime numbers on the air he would gently tell her they were considered out of date but his talent show became infamous for demonstrating how such programs can miss out on the most spectacular of talents one of the singers who auditioned for "arthur godfreys talent scouts" but was passed over elvis presley as "idol" gets closer to this seasons final pick its worth wondering how many potential stars were among the legions of rejects mr cowell seems to have an opinion on everything but even he may not have an answer to that write to christopher john farley at christopher farley wsj
