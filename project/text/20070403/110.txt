quarterly mutual funds review an elite clubs fall from grace triple digit gainers of offer lessons for investors once upon a time there were dozens of mutual funds that doubled your money in less than a year it was march a time when as the wall street saying goes trees really did grow to the sky for a fund with the right portfolio lots of go go technology shares that meant notching up returns in a matter of months that would normally take years and years at the end of march there were funds about of the stock funds around at the time posting gains of or more for the previous months according to fund tracker morningstar inc of those funds returned more than and one pbhg new opportunities shot out the lights with an astonishing gain of course this turned out to be a fractured fairy tale march marked the end of a decade long bull market and the start of a brutal three year downward march in stock prices so what exactly happened to this once elite group the "triple digit club " as the media dubbed them we asked morningstar to track down the club members and the results are a lesson in the perils of chasing past performance ninety seven of the funds no longer exist as investors in knew them forty four had their track records swept under the rug as the portfolios were merged into other funds twenty two were liquidated with what little money there was returned to investors morningstar was unable to determine the fate of another they had dropped out of its database of survivors tracked by morningstar only topped the broader markets modest average return of a year in the seven years since march while another half dozen eked out slimmer positive results for nearly a third of these funds an investor who bought on the day the nasdaq composite index peaked would have averaged double digit annual losses since losses were so severe at funds that they more than wiped out the earlier triple digit gains an investor who purchased van wagoner emerging growth in march would be down today there have been some results to cheer turner emerging growth which posted a trailing month return in march is up an average a year over the past seven years the fund has consistently been among the stars in its category beating its benchmark index routinely with the benefit of hindsight it is possible to draw lessons about the kinds of funds that have strategies able to stand the test of time "the worst were those funds that were pedal to the metal and were paying little attention to the downside " says christine benz director of mutual fund analysis at morningstar that is they threw money at stocks trading at nosebleed share price to earnings multiples and they concentrated bets in narrow parts of the market "funds that held up relatively better have been run by fund managers that pay attention to risk control " here is a look at some club members with vastly different experiences no mutual fund was hotter than pbhg new opportunities launched in february by pilgrim baxter &amp associates it was run by frank p slattery who was years old when he delivered a total return in march for the prior months the former investment banker was "like a kid in the candy shop" and "giddy with delight" even as the nasdaq index dipped in early april he told a reporter at the time then many investors thought the nasdaqs decline was temporary a lull in a rally that had distance to go mr slattery favored stocks with high and accelerating earnings growth rates and potential for positive earnings surprises and he was adding to holdings of small and midsize "momentum" stocks that he saw rebounding he said "my outlook is very bullish for the rest of the year " he said at the time pointing in part to wall street stock analysts who "are more bullish than i have ever seen them" on some companies but any bullishness for the fund which had assets of &# million in march was misplaced from march through may just before it merged with old mutual emerging growth fund pbhg new opportunities lost a year on average compared with an a year decline for the broader market mr slattery wasnt at pbhg to manage the worst of the downturn in late april he left to start a technology focused venture capital and investment management firm with some former credit suisse group investment bankers and research analysts pbhg co founder gary pilgrim took over for mr slattery mr slattery declined to comment for this article citing his current employers policy on media interviews mr pilgrim who resigned in as a result of a fund trading scandal that stretched across the industry declined to comment on past fund performance saying he is "sitting down in florida in the sunshine " removed from the funds business he also noted that he settled the regulatory charges "without admitting or denying guilt " not long after mr pilgrim took over old mutual plc a south african based financial services firm bought the wayne pa based pilgrim baxter three years later as the stock market finally was rebounding pbhg new opportunities whose money under management had dwindled to &# million was one of three pbhg funds merged with other old mutual funds matthew appelstein a senior vice president at old mutual notes that pbhg new opportunities played it risky it "had the opportunity to invest of its total assets in a single sector " he says old mutual decided to reduce the funds volatility small investors "want the upside " mr appelstein says but if the downside is too far down "you burn them so bad you lose them as a customer " in merging pbhg new opportunities into old mutual emerging growth fund old mutual preserved the ticker symbol and track record of the old mutual fund essentially throwing the pbhg funds history into the trash can "we didnt think that was representative of the returns we would have going forward " mr appelstein says of pbhgs track record "were trying to add a lot more discipline a lot more rigor " in january copper rock capital partners became subadviser for the &# million merged fund a morningstar analyst wrote "old mutual emerging growths prospects have improved but it has more work to do " pin oak aggressive stock fund is among the survivors but its results have been anything but inspiring the then &# million fund returned in the months through march in the seven years from march to march it lost an average of about annually shrunken to &# million the fund sits in the last percentile of performance for its "large growth" category for the seven years according to morningstar "pin oak aggressive stocks severely limited resources and outsized risks make it a fund to avoid " morningstar analyst katherine yang wrote in an analysis in november "its difficult when the market moves against you for a long period of time " says mark oelschlager who became an analyst for oak associates in and has been a portfolio manager for pin oak aggressive stock since may "it has been a tough time for aggressive growth" styles of investing "you dont have as many companies growing at off the chart rates like you did in the late s " but "we think the time is coming that this will reverse we dont limit ourselves but we do try to stick with the aggressive growth style " the fund holds a relatively few stocks "we dont invest in every sector we just try to identify the ones that we think are most attractive " mr oelschlager says the managers dont buy stocks "because we think theyre going to have a good quarter " but rather because they see potential for longer term good performance he notes that the funds performance started to revive in the latter part of last year the fund ranks in the top among peers so far this year "any time things are going against you in this business you get a lot of people saying why arent you doing things differently " says mr oelschlager "we listen to the criticism we re evaluate but we have basically stuck with our style you have to be a flexible thinker but if you change your stripes and drift too much from your investment style it can work against you " for nearly two dozen funds the downturn was fatal the funds shut down and money was returned to investors that was the fate for three of the five funds managed by garrett van wagoner that were triple digit club members in march van wagoner technology was up over the previous year post venture was up and mid cap growth was up almost on the nose the th club member mr van wagoner was a media star but as a morningstar analysis noted his aggressive investing style loading up on high priced technology companies in fast changing industries left little margin for error "we dont do a lot to mitigate the overall risk " mr van wagoner said that year when the market collapsed his funds were among the hardest hit "that sickening thud you just heard was van wagoner mid cap fund and its siblings getting clubbed over the head by reality " morningstar wrote in april each of the three triple digit van wagoner funds that are now defunct lost more than in those losses coupled with regulatory issues related to how mr van wagoner priced some investments sent investors fleeing mr van wagoner and van wagoner capital management neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in settling charges with the securities and exchange commission in shrunken to &# million from the &# billion they held in the funds were liquidated in october "we closed and consolidated some funds in " but "we still have three funds that are open currently " mr van wagoner notes today the firms outlook "hasnt changed at all but the world has changed " he continues "our focus is still on smaller high technology companies with unique products and services " for the best results since look to the far corners of the world triple digit club members from emerging markets categories by and large have gained the most in the seven years since nasdaq peaked leaders of the pack a pair of russia focused funds ing russia a and third millennium russia up an average of and a year respectively since march driehaus emerging markets growth matthews pacific tiger and columbia greater china also have double digit annualized results for the period al frank fund has the best annualized results for a u s stock fund up an average a year the fund which had &# million under management in and has &# million today searches out cheap companies no matter what size or business line that contrarian approach led it to snap up tech stocks in holdings not usually seen in bargain hunting "value" funds as this one is classified the tech positions led to the return for the months through march the go anywhere strategy of managers john buckingham and jessica chiaverini has resulted in a roller coaster experience for investors after gaining nearly in it lost in once again heavy with tech stocks to finish at the very bottom of its peer group in its tech shares led to a chart topping gain the bottom line an investor who bought the fund in march would have done quite well gaining triple digit club members that have held up well relative to peers include allianz rcm global technology fund its style is chockablock with risk small tech companies and heavy bets on certain names like other tech funds it is still underwater from the peak of the market down roughly a year but investors who were around in march are still in the black by the fund has posted better returns than three quarters of its peers like other tech funds rcm posted three consecutive years of declines starting in the fund had a rough when managers walter price and huachen chen built up a huge defensive cash position but fell behind when tech stocks staged a second quarter rally in a defensive posture that included using options paid off then in late they turned bullish nearly perfect timing "experience matters " morningstar analyst karen dolan writes of the actively managed tech funds in the firms database only have managers who were around when the bear market took hold in and just three have managers with at least years tenure "this fund is one of them " she says mr price and ms chen have worked together for more than years among other triple digit club survivors is needham growth which can have up to a fourth of its portfolio in stocks that are sold short that is it sells borrowed shares in hopes of buying the stock later at a lower price and closing out the loan with a profit like many club members needham had bet big on tech stocks then in and it touched its upper limit for short sales an ill timed reduction of those short positions in under its former manager cost the fund still it has returned an average of a year since march better than of all other "growth" funds focused on midsize shares since march the fund has returned
