calperss chief invests in asia commodities mr read moves fund to riskier markets chinas labor an issue russell read compares his job to piloting a supertanker because it takes a while to alter a big ships course thats the task he has undertaken as the new chief of the california public employees retirement systems investment portfolio since mr read began managing calpers &# billion in assets in june he has started putting money into oil copper and other commodities and increasing its emerging markets investments the latter move involved relaxing a rule against investing in china and other countries accused of failing to protect workers and shareholders "it is inconceivable frankly that we can be successful " mr read says "without critical successes in asia " given the funds size the year old mr read is one of the countrys most influential money managers investors scrutinize every shift in calpers portfolio and companies shudder when it criticizes them for corporate governance lapses to some mr reads move into emerging markets and commodities might look like he has arrived more than fashionably late to a party given the long run up those investments have enjoyed in recent years he argues that calpers is in fact right on time given that it is a pension fund interested in long term returns over years or decades he says asia is just starting its upward climb china and india have reached "critical takeoff conditions " mr read says their ultimate development is "inescapable and compelling " investments in emerging markets now represent about of calpers portfolio mr read says he expects that percentage to multiply in the next five to years with asia accounting for a double digit share of the total as for commodities some analysts believe prices have peaked but mr read argues that a decades long increase in demand for energy and raw materials is also just beginning given economic growth in those same emerging markets early this year calpers lifted its longstanding restriction on stock investments in emerging markets the rules had barred investments in china russia and venezuela and other countries deemed to have bad track records in labor shareholder rights or other issues the policy was intended to encourage governments to improve in those areas under a new policy that mr read advocated calpers evaluates companies on a case by case basis rather than being constrained by their home countries overall conditions the funds plan to invest more in developing countries "led to the need for a more sophisticated policy" on evaluating prospective investments there says mr read that represents a symbolic change for calpers given its influential role in promoting what it sees as good corporate governance and public policy goals the restrictions on emerging markets investments was a source of controversy inside calpers with some disagreeing over whether social concerns should have a place in investment decisions in the end the board agreed unanimously to the change mr read helped persuade board members that the best approach was not to "pretend china doesnt exist but to set high standards and only invest in companies that meet those standards " says steve westly a former california state controller who left the calpers board last year such changes are significant because calpers is a powerful activist investor recently it helped mount a campaign to change the way directors are nominated at computer company hewlett packard co to give shareholders more of a say the effort failed last year it banned investments in certain companies with business in sudan it is likely to employ similar tactics in some of its emerging markets investments mr read says the moves into emerging markets and commodities are part of a shift by calpers into riskier strategies as it looks to meet pension obligations to million current and former state employees it figures it has to earn at least a year to meet those obligations last year it hit its best result since the fund is exploring using smaller firms in addition to established ones to manage some of its portfolio calpers also is considering letting managers engage in short selling borrowing shares and selling them in hopes of profiting on a price slide by replacing them with cheaper shares bought later the fund isnt always as nimble as smaller investors but it has a history of being quicker to identify new opportunities than other large institutional investors "although its a supertanker process were the first supertanker in many of these initiatives " mr read says mr read grew up in chicago and houston he says he owes his ability with numbers to his mothers love of horse racing "i have a certain facility with statistics that i am certain stems from those six days a week at the racetrack " he says that aptitude helped him pay his way through the university of chicago working part time as an actuary he calculated risks associated with medical malpractice suits and in one of his more interesting assignments with insurance policies on actresses legs "i saw no pictures i just calculated the function " he says he stayed on to receive an m b a and then earned a doctorate from stanford university in political economy later he became a portfolio manager for prudential insurance and oppenheimerfunds an investment and mutual fund company he also served for four years as deputy chief investment officer at deutsche asset management the investment arm of deutsche bank ag outside of work mr read is working on his second doctorate in forestry at the university of maine the dissertation draws on his work with the university on an initiative to produce liquid fuels from timber and use them in cars and trucks that combination of academic interests and investment know how is reflected in mr reads plan for calpers he believes calpers can profit from direct investments in commodities infrastructure and forests "technologically most things that can be made from oil can be made from wood " he says "in an era of constrained oil that opens up many new frontiers "
