politics &amp economics court decisions may aid some utility profits in long term the two major supreme court decisions involving the federal governments oversight of pollution emissions at first glance appear to be setbacks for the utility sector but down the road the decisions could sweeten earnings for some utility companies by encouraging added spending on expensive pollution control equipment that in some cases could be passed along to consumers at a profit how utilities fare could depend on whether they sell electricity in regulated or deregulated power markets in one of the cases involving duke energy corp the supreme court rejected an argument the utility industry has used for not installing pollution control equipment at coal fired power plants in the other decision the court said that greenhouse gases are pollutants and fall under the clean air act possibly forcing utilities to spend billions of dollars on existing plants and discouraging construction of new plants that dont do enough to control greenhouse gases but the two decisions could result in higher profits for some utilities that are able to pass higher costs on to consumers in states where utilities still are fully regulated governments allow utilities to pass environmental costs through to customers and collect a profit of to on that spending utilities in the southeast great plains states and west appear the best situated to be reimbursed for expenditures in states where power plants sell electricity at market prices the owners may not be able to pass all the added expense through to consumers and may have to eat a portion cutting profit margins collection depends on what happens to prices in local power markets though long term contracts could ease the impact the midwest northeast and texas appear the most uncertain for cost recovery as deregulated markets the high court decisions come at a time when the sector already is increasing its spending on pollution controls from through the electric power sector spent more than &# billion seeking compliance with air and water pollution rules the industry expects to spend &# billion by to achieve compliance with additional new rules according to the edison electric institute a trade group for investor owned utilities in a unanimous decision the supreme court said that the environmental protection agency should look at the total output of conventional pollutants from older coal fired power plants when calculating compliance with the clean air act rather than focusing on hourly emission levels coal fired power plants have been running at higher levels of output and for more hours a year in response to market conditions increasing the total volume of pollution they produce the supreme court remanded the case to the fourth u s circuit court of appeals the bush administration has taken a softer approach to enforcement than the clinton administration which lodged civil complaints against seven coal burning utility companies over pollution controls several big utilities including dominion resources inc and teco energy inc settled their cases but duke southern co and american electric power co continued to fight enforcement yesterdays decision doesnt end the debate but it does dispose of one argument against enforcement that some utilities had taken many environmentalists expect the legal tussle to continue through the remainder of the bush administration but the fact that the cases still are pending could stimulate congress to take a different approach to regulating greenhouse gases said john walke senior attorney for natural resources defense council environmental groups are pursuing another case now in the d c circuit court of appeals that would give the epa authority over greenhouse gases in the power industry it was stayed pending the outcome of the case involving the automotive industry the decisions yesterday could give that case momentum the two cases have significance because "theres been scientific momentum on these issues and now theres legal momentum as well " said howard fox an attorney for earthjustice an environmental group involved in the epa case a spokesman for edison electric institute the utility trade group said the cases create more clarity about what lies ahead as such it is important because it will help utilities and states decide what sort of power plants to build in the future as the cost of environmental conformity becomes more clear it likely will tip the scales in favor of electricity sources that create fewer air pollutants such as nuclear power or coal burning plants that capture more pollution and prevent its release either before or after combustion "the more regulatory certainty the better for the power industry " said dan redinger eei spokesman "the investment decisions being made now will be with us for decades "
