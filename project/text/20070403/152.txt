water boys as the baseball season opens the years first outrage is not about steroids salaries or even spitballs the s word here is senate where john kerry and arlen specter have been trying to mess with a broadcast deal between major league baseball and directv ostensibly because it will deprive sports fans of their right to watch dozens of games a week when and where they want to but this is no case of righteous sluggers going to bat for the little man it would be more accurate to describe the senators as water boys for big cable in their hometowns of boston and philadelphia whats at issue is major league baseballs right in a free enterprise economy to package and market its products in this case the product is a package called "extra innings " which last year attracted about half a million cable and satellite subscribers who could afford &# annually for the kick of having access to some out of market games a week mlb offers a similar deal via its web site mlb tv where customers can watch up to six games simultaneously on their computer screen in however mlb plans to start its own baseball channel and so its been shopping for partners with two goals in mind one is to get broadcast expertise and risk sharing for the always expensive launch of a new channel mlb also wanted a commitment from carriers to transmit the baseball channel to of their digital subscribers to make a long story short directv stepped up to the plate and met mlbs terms while indemand the consortium of cable giants comcast time warner and cox along with echostars dish tv did not last month mlb announced that as of april "extra innings" would be broadcast exclusively on directtv which would also have equity in the new baseball channel sore losers indemand and echostar ran to congress they found eager ears on senators kerry and specter who happen to represent cities which are comcasts headquartered in philadelphia biggest strongholds mr kerry asked for and got a letter from politically sensitive fcc chairman kevin martin whining in tune with him about how disturbing it is when viewers dont have the maximum numbers of choices the senator also held a commerce committee hearing on the mlb directv deal last week during which he urged the league to go back to negotiations with the cable companies and make a deal in an interesting comment on the internet age mr kerry opined that the availability of "extra innings" on mlb tv doesnt count as choice because web watching is no fun meanwhile mr specter who has been hassling directtv for months about its exclusive "sunday ticket" package of nfl football games threatened to look into mlbs antitrust exemption last time we looked access to every baseball game was not a human right if it were and if that were the senators true concern they might have made a fuss about local games in philadelphia including the eagles phillies and flyers being available only to customers of comcast from the comcast sports network nor is cable some kind of weak sister in danger of being crushed by relatively small directv what we have here are the folks who only recently enjoyed a stranglehold and still do in many markets trying to fight off competition and real choice for consumers on the bright side while baseball officials continued to talk with indemand and echostar yesterday the league has stood firm so far asserting its right to do honest business without government interference and pointing out that it has offered every interested party a fair bite of the pie perhaps thats why for all the spotlights baseball attracts most of congress seems uninterested in butting into a private commercial deal
