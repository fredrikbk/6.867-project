the morning brief a resonating rebuke over greenhouse gases online edition he wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the supreme court yesterday accused the bush administration of shirking its duty to protect americans from the potential danger of greenhouse gases through the epas refusal to regulate tailpipe exhaust and other emissions blamed in part for global warming the ruling may quicken the growth of official and corporate support for such regulation even as it holds the prospect of costly implications for auto makers and energy companies the justices asserted that the state of massachusetts one plaintiff in yesterdays case had standing to bring the suit in the first place in part because of the harm it could suffer from rising sea levels blamed on global warming and because the original defendant the u s was in a position to do something about it "the sovereign prerogatives to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to negotiate emissions treaties with developing countries and in some circumstances to exercise the police power to reduce motor vehicle emissions are now lodged in the federal government " justice john paul stevens wrote for the majority the environmental protection agencys "steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to massachusetts that is both actual and imminent and there is a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prompt epa to take steps to reduce that risk " the potential damage of greenhouse gases make them de facto air pollutants and thus the epas responsibility under the clean air act mr stevens wrote the agencys "laundry list" of reasons for avoiding action and refusal to even judge the danger of such emissions dont excuse what amounts to unlawful negligence and once the case returns to a lower court the epa must explain "its reasons for action or inaction " he said though the ruling doesnt force the epa to act it suggests the agency will face additional legal trouble if it doesnt and it amounts to what the new york times calls "a strong rebuke to the bush administration which has maintained that it does not have the right to regulate carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases under the clean air act and that even if it did it would not use the authority " in what the wall street journal calls a second victory for environmentalists the court ruled unanimously to reverse lower court support for an epa move to allow operators of coal fired power plants to significantly overhaul old plants without installing new state of the art antipollution equipment the courts decisions come at a time when a growing proportion of american industry has to varying degrees been jumping on to the ecological bandwagon concluding as the journal puts it that "it was only a matter of time before they were hit with a rule that will limit how much fossil fuel they can burn " but "how such regulation will affect particular industries and companies remains unclear because the rules have yet to be written and will be the subject of an intensifying fight in washington " the journal says climate change concerns are affecting a spectrum of businesses energy decisions and are among the reasons responsible for the building momentum world wide to renew development of nuclear power cambridge energy research associates recently noted and the courts blow for auto makers comes as pressure on them is already building in washington to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles through higher fuel economy standards "a move that could cost the auto companies billions of dollars " the detroit news adds still as the los angeles times says if yesterdays decisions were a major victory for california and other states that want to regulate greenhouse gases "the battle is not over " before california for example can implement its gas emission regulations it still faces opposition from the epa and a lawsuit from the auto industry but yesterdays rulings improve the states chances zell wangles control of tribune the tribune company its stable of newspapers like the los angeles times and the chicago tribune television stations and other assets have finally been sold but the deals ramifications after what the wall street journal calls "one of the most wrenching auctions in the history of newspapers " may be difficult to parse the winning bidder was real estate magnate sam zell who in the end agreed sort of to pay &# a share to sort of take the company private the employee stock ownership plan or esop at the heart of the deal will leave most of the companys shares in the hands of tribune employees even as its heavy debt load "forces its new owners to face tough questions " as the journal says mr zell will put up &# million of his own money and tribune will essentially return &# billion to shareholders by offering a &# a share tender then if regulators approve the deal the esop kicks in essentially giving employees of the company and mr zell a warrant allowing him to acquire of the companys common stock the journal explains the deal values tribune at about &# billion in other words mr zell gets "effective control of tribune co for a relatively modest cash outlay " the los angeles times says even though financial analysts say hes "unlikely to exercise the option but instead would probably cash it out before its expiration " the paper takes note of another aspect of the deal after more than years the chandlers "the much celebrated and maligned family that once dominated the civic cultural and political life of southern california through its control" of the times is at last getting
