more bang for their buck ho hum another charter school study shows that educational choice improves learning the latest report comes by way of priscilla wohlstetter of the university of southern california and is distinguished by its focus on academic productivity in the golden state charters tend to attract minority and low income students from families fed up with the failings of traditional public schools unlike their district school counterparts charters are forced to include rent for building space in their operating budgets as a result "california charter schools typically have smaller per student allocations than non charter schools in their districts " the study found "yet charter schools have roughly equivalent levels of productivity they get more bang for their buck " not that this will keep liberals from insisting that more money will fix all that ails public education the study also notes that the "rates of improvement" at charters in california "are much more rapid than non charter public schools " or as ms wohlstetter told the los angeles times "charter schools are better able to increase student performance in a shorter period of time " another useful finding is that charters "employ fewer credentialed teachers many of whom may have less teaching experience " that cant be good news for the teachers unions whove long been in love with "certification" requirements and rigid seniority based pay scales to recap more school choice means more efficient use of taxpayer dollars and better educated students maybe not so ho hum
