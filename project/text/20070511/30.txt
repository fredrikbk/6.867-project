freescale tests private equity gumption of the billions of dollars worth of corporate buyouts done in the past year the &# billion deal for freescale semiconductor holdings stands out buyout firms had historically shunned the semiconductor industry because its extreme volatility made it difficult to make target companies borrow heavily but the demand for and the structure of the &# billion in debt issued to fund the deal could smooth the ride for freescales new owners blackstone group carlyle group permira advisers llc and tpg capital llc the group which bought freescale in september was able to structure the debt to give it flexibility to handle a slowdown that is just what they got when freescale reported a drop in revenue and cash flow last month which could be the start of a tough period for the company for now private equity shops remain confident they can handle a slowdown "we have a structure that can take the year storm " says bud watts head of technology investing for carlyle group "we can live to fight another day " with the economy slowing the way private equity firms have structured their deals will become vitally important to their success if the buyers are right the companies they bought will generate enough cash flow so they can keep making debt payments no matter how long the downturn lasts if they blow it their lenders are far more likely to be hurt than the owners themselves one reason for owners confidence is the huge demand for the debt issued to fund these deals because of this demand interest rates on the bonds have been relatively low and private equity shops have been able to win forgiving terms that might help them ride out a storm if the economy gets worse corporate borrowing often comes with strict performance requirements known as covenants which require a company to generate a certain amount of cash flow some &# billion of freescales borrowing was "covenant lite " meaning lenders wouldnt hold it to such performance requirements in the past covenants gave creditors the power to force companies into bankruptcy when it hit temporary difficulties but today an increasing number of borrowers are getting access to covenant lite money from lenders "capital structures are so flexible " ted virtue chief executive officer of midocean partners a middle market buyout firm said at a recent milken institute conference "it is difficult to actually default or have creditors put a gun to your head " year to date volume of covenant lite debt has soared to &# billion up from &# billion for the comparable period last year according to standard &amp poors lcd news and commentary this years volume amounts to twice that of the prior years combined of course there are potential downsides if companies do have problems there arent the usual early warning signs moreover if companies do eventually default many analysts such as sivan mahadevan part of morgan stanleys credit strategy group say lenders could take a big hit because they will recover less of their loans that could lead to a sharp pullback by some lenders further down the road the challenges for deal makers could grow as investors get more skeptical about these loans michaels stores inc which was bought by bain capital and blackstone group for &# billion last year spooked the debt markets the last week in april when it said it would refinance its loans and eliminate some performance stipulations dealers had to slightly lower the price on the newly issued debt to get the deal done in the case of freescale lenders have been extremely obliging when it comes to accommodating freescales desire for flexibility some &# billion of the money it borrowed gives it the ability effectively to turn interest payments on and off if it finds it has little cash to make payments it can suspend payments on that debt and in return give investors more securities that pay a slightly higher interest rate these securities are known as payment in kind notes in addition it has &# million in revolving loans that it hasnt tapped which allow freescale to call on banks for a cash infusion if it finds itself running out of money thanks to debt arrangements like this some private equity buyers say they are doing deals they would otherwise not do freescale was doubly hit in the recent quarter even as the ink was drying on the purchase agreement capacity growth in the industry was beginning to outstrip demand growth and inventories were building globally freescale has also been disproportionately hurt because troubles at its largest customer and former parent motorola inc profit margins on handsets narrowed especially for motorolas razr cellphone as the company lowered the price for its razr phone hurting freescale which supplies the chips for those handsets motorola unexpectedly cut back its orders to freescale people familiar with freescale say motorola reported a loss for the first quarter and lowered its outlook for the whole year at the end of april freescale reported that revenue fell and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization dropped to &# million from &# million the year before a spokesman at the company declined to comment on news of the disappointing results freescale bonds dropped in active trading but only marginally they still trade above the price at which they were issued moreover freescales owners have yet to take any of their own money off the table by paying themselves a dividend as private equity shops have quickly done with several other deals arranged in recent years that is a sign that if the economy turns down buyout shops might indeed need to stay in these investments for the long haul
