weekend journal sports by the numbers roger and them no team ever won a pennant race in april but some have come perilously close to losing it perhaps including this seasons new york yankees the yankees may be the highest scoring team in baseball but a sky high era has left them with a record through wednesday nights game their solution giving roger clemens approximately &# million to pitch from early to mid june through the end of the season the cost to the yankees once the luxury tax is figured in will be about &# million what are the yankees getting for their money a certain hall of famer what do they need for him to do a lot it turns out to the yankee organization failing to win the world series is bad enough but the idea of missing the playoffs theyve played in every postseason since isnt allowed into the realm of possibility but the teams slow start this season could put that sure thing into jeopardy since its taken an average of wins to take the al east and wins for the al wild card berth this year it may take more the boston red sox are on a win pace and the detroit tigers currently second in the al central project out to wins to get wins the yankees need to go for the rest of the season thats a winning percentage a season long pace the team has topped only twice and since their postseason streak began how much help will the other yankee hurlers be in getting there to find out well use established win level which estimates a players win loss record based on his performance the previous three years with recent seasons weighted more heavily established win level says the combined records of chien ming wang mike mussina and andy pettitte should come out to the rest of the way see chart the fourth spot in the rotation is where the troubles start carl pavano is likely out for the season due to elbow problems and jeff karstens has a broken leg darrell rasner or matt desalvo will likely fill in until either kei igawa manages to make it back from the minors or rookie sensation phil hughes recovers from a hamstring injury based on collective performance over the past three seasons the combination of the yankee bullpen and spot starters should yield about a mark resulting in a composite record of mr clemenss task then becomes clear for wins the yankees need mr clemens to go games over with a record of around can he do it the yankees will likely get mr clemens at his best when working a full season the rocket has been a first half pitcher from to his april era was but by august it was last year when he started in late june mr clemens posted a era and a record in august the yankees should give mr clemens better run support currently runs per game than the he got in houston so his era for last season is a better indicator of his potential performance than his record one hidden benefit to mr clemenss arrival is that the yankees will be under less pressure to rush mr hughes back into the rotation if the year old is able to heal and then become the no starter the yankees expect him to be this deal should pay dividends long after mr clemens has hung up his cleats for good
