canadian drugs eh listen to maine sen olympia snowe discuss importing drugs from canada and youll hear endless happy talk about "more competitive prices " "substantial savings" and how "crucial" reimportation is to "the american consumer " what you wont hear ms snowe mention much is the drug import program of portland maine interesting that since portland was one of those cities that gained notoriety a few years back for defying federal law and setting up a canada import program that it promised would save its thousands of city employees and their dependents a bundle on drugs three years in it has attracted all of participants that was also the flame out fate of a statewide plan by gov john baldacci to empower the penobscot indian nation to build a distribution center to import price controlled canadian drugs for some uninsured and underinsured mainers the tribe in february unceremoniously closed the program which never got its hands on canadian drugs but morphed into a domestic mail order business having attracted just medicaid recipients ditto all across america three years ago grandstanding governors and mayors vowed to break federal law and set up state run drug import programs giving millions of citizens the "opportunity" to buy cheap canadian drugs the media showered these souls with headlines praised them for being on the side of poor strapped u s consumers then forgot all about it today most state import programs are on life support while some have closed completely never mind all washingtons hifalutin arguments about intellectual property free trade and safety the overwhelming majority of americans appear to have little use for import programs that offer few drugs at long wait times under suspect safety conditions and with minimal savings all of which helps explain this weeks bizarre and highly cynical senate votes on drug imports many of the very senators who supported or co sponsored ms snowes amendment to change federal law and allow canadian imports hail from states that have seen their own high profile programs wither or die that includes wisconsins herb kohl and russ feingold missouris claire mccaskill and dick durbin of illinois these folks know firsthand that canadian imports arent really that popular and wont save much if any money but they do like what this debate offers namely the chance to bash u s pharma companies and to stand with "overcharged" u s consumers the votes are more a sideshow and it explains why some senators who publicly support the easing of drug import laws also voted for a poison pill that gutted ms snowes amendment on safety concerns it isnt as if masses of canadian drug fans will come storming down their doors if anything portland is a success compared to the more high profile state programs that got rolling in when illinois gov rod blagojevich introduced his i save rx program which was initially joined by neighboring wisconsin he dramatically declared that "the nearly million people who live in illinois and the more than five million people who live in wisconsin will have the opportunity to save hundreds and in some cases even thousands of dollars each year on the high cost of their medicine " mr blagoevich spent nearly &# million in taxpayer dollars developing it including some state workers from two dozen agencies who spent hours flacking the program all this caused illinois auditor general william holland to get curious about just how much benefit this wonder program was producing and last fall he issued a stunning report over months of operation a grand total of illinois residents had used the program which equals approximately of the population results from the four other participating states were even more laughably dismal wisconsin had people use the program kansas missouri and vermont mr holland also noted that the program was er illegal and that the state had failed to implement quality control things havent been much rosier for minnesota gov tim pawlenty a republican who felt it expedient to throw over the u s drug industry in favor of a few populist headlines mr pawlenty promised in that his minnesota rxconnect program would serve some people a representative from minnesotas department of human services explained to me this week that the state conveniently does not break out the number of people who use its program but according to its latest statistics minnesota rxconnect last month filled a total of prescriptions thats for the whole state programs like those in springfield mass have simply closed ask program administrators why so few people use canadian imports and theyll give you a frank and long list many consumers are wary about safety issues they like having a relationship with a local pharmacist and like knowing their drugs have undergone a u s quality check many drugs arent available that includes anything that needs to be taken immediately antibiotics for instance or specialty drugs such as injections for diabetics which are hard to ship its also the case that many chronic diseases are today managed with generics which remain cheaper in the u s those that do use import programs tend to be a very small population that take maintenance drugs say for high blood pressure or cholesterol perhaps an even bigger point is that huge numbers of americans dont even pay for their drugs but rather farm out their bills to an insurer thats even more the case now that seniors are getting their drugs through medicare joseph bruno the former republican minority leader in maines legislature and now full time ceo of a chain of pharmacies in that state points out that of his customers get prescriptions paid by a third party and so arent price sensitive "this is nothing but political posturing " he says of the u s senate debate he also notes that many of the infamous "bus trips" from maine to canada were in fact ginned up by labor unions that wanted to elevate drug prices into a political issue and that successfully left the false impression that americans were falling all over themselves for canadian meds "if you look at the numbers thats just not the case " still dont expect the political caterwauling over imports to go away any time soon theres still too much political upside to talking up a program that few americans really want to use
