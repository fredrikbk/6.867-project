weekend journal tastings informal inexpensive bordeaux smaller chateaux yield big bargains giving burgers style one of the best places to find a red wine bargain in the wine shop is also one of the most unexpected its the aisle marked "bordeaux " bordeaux produces some of the worlds best and most expensive wines but its a large region with thousands of small chateaux that most of us have never heard of chateau pimpine anyone in fact while most people know areas such as pauillac and saint emilion the wines were talking about often come from appellations that are obscure chateau pimpine for instance comes from an appellation called bordeaux cotes de francs which is hardly a household name even though it produces more than million bottles of wine a year mostly red many of these obscure wines are imported into the u s but theyre generally made in small quantities and imported in even smaller quantities so its impossible to know what you will find still weve rarely been in a wine store that didnt have at least a few waiting for some adventurous consumer to take a chance on a wine thats unfamiliar over the years we have found these generally to be excellent bargains theyre usually made primarily from cabernet sauvignon and merlot and often offer some of the same kind of tastes as more expensive bordeaux in a lighter package we have found however that vintage really does matter with these wines even though the vintage was a good one for the expensive wines the lower end wines were overwhelmingly disappointing in a broad tasting however the less expensive bordeaux from were delightful with many bargains now that the s are on the shelves we decided it was time to give them a shot we bought more than from retail shelves for a broad blind tasting some were simply "bordeaux" some came from well known appellations such as graves and many came from places like cotes de bourg cotes de castillon and cotes de blaye we set our price limit around &# giving ourselves some leeway on the higher end because we saw so many at &# and &# our conclusion the wines are a buy time and again we found them charming with lovely noses of fruit wood and cedar layered tastes of dark fruit balanced acids that make them food friendly and a dry easy finish overall these are not wines to rhapsodize about they tend to be fairly light and designed for early drinking but they hold more interest and offer more class than many wines at their price range our best value which was nicely rich and offered all sorts of interesting smells and tastes from sandalwood to black olives was clos floridene a graves whose white is a long time favorite dont forget that a white bordeaux such as clos floridene is excellent for elegant summertime entertaining another favorite from lalande de pomerol was chateau tournefeuille whose name will give you an idea why these encounter some consumer resistance in the u s but whose taste would convert anyone it will give you a sense of the diversity of these wines that its made from merlot and cabernet franc chateau pimpine by the way was not among our favorites but was typical of many of the wines soft and friendly and easy to drink if you can imagine bordeaux as an informal wine thats what many of these are our best of tasting had class some weight ripe fruit a hint of tar and a very special brightness about it "really tastes like bordeaux " we wrote "could age " this turned out to be chateau baury from margaux wed paid &# for it though &# appears to be a more representative price about cases of this were imported and distributed to states as part of our tasting we checked out a few s and found that they are still drinking nicely and some of the lower end bordeaux reds are already on shelves so we also tried some of them and found them good too well conduct a broad tasting of them when more are available so the bottom line is that the aisle of inexpensive bordeaux reds right now is a good bet dont worry about trying to figure out the appellations or pronouncing tournefeuille pick one up and have it with dinner tonight it will pair beautifully with steak but will also make pizza or hamburgers into a surprisingly elegant meal you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones cheap claret index in a tasting of red bordeaux sometimes called claret from the vintage that cost about &# or less these were our favorites they are generally made to drink soon we say every week that its folly to look for any specific wine because its impossible to know what you will find and that is especially true in this case because most bargain bordeaux is made by small producers and little is imported these will give you an idea of what is out there you will do best by asking a good wine merchant for a recommendation among the bordeaux in stock while the mouton cadet listed below was not among our favorites it rated good we have included it because for around &# its a fine summertime red widely available and the best mouton cadet weve tasted in many years vineyard chateau baury margaux price &# rating very good tasters comments best of tasting real class and some weight with black cherry fruit and lovely balance in which the fine acidity and elegant oak dont overwhelm the fruit nirvana with a rare hamburger could age a bit vineyard clos floridene graves price &# rating very good
