weekend journal the drivers seat kia rondo can a small van make it big in the u s strange as it might seem in our consumerist land of unlimited choice there are plenty of vehicles we cant buy in the u s not just diesel powered luxury sedans and exotic supercars but everyday transportation as common in the rest of the world as ford f pickups are here take small minivans for instance they are part of one of the fastest growing vehicle segments in europe called multipurpose vehicles or mpvs dozens of such models are sold there while we have a handful literally you can count them on one hand the seven year old retro styled chrysler pt cruiser one needs no introduction its largely derivative doppelganger the chevrolet hhr two deserves none the cultist scion xb three and the sporty mazda four are more representative of the genre as it exists in countries that ratified the kyoto treaty that leaves us with a thumb left for the newest entrant to this segment kias rondo the rondo is essentially a tall midsize wagon with an optional pair of folding seats in the cargo area that means it can seat as many as seven despite a footprint slightly smaller than the korean makers midsize optima sedan on which it is based to get a sense of how much a typical american minivan dwarfs the rondo consider that at inches long its more than inches shorter than the standard dodge caravan and nearly two feet shorter than the long wheelbase grand caravan unlike conventional minivans the rondo does without sliding doors an effective ploy in disguising its true purpose for the image conscious what style points the conventional doors give however the upright stance and large "greenhouse" what car makers call the glassed in area take away the overall look is something like a toyota camry crossed with a london taxicab in parts of the world where people actually know what the latter looks like kias front wheel drive people mover is powered by either a diesel or gasoline engine both with four cylinders and a two liters of displacement for the u s market however the vehicle comes with a choice of a liter four or a liter v both running on gasoline and mated to automatic transmissions that the "small" engine in the u s market is larger than its european counterpart is significant because this is the heart of the problem facing the rondo in its immigration to the states ostensibly the main reason someone would buy a compact mpv instead of a bigger roomier minivan is to get better fuel economy at least thats the reasoning in europe so lets do some math the four cylinder rondo sold in the u s has a combined epa fuel economy of miles per gallon while the v version gets but those numbers are for the five passenger version and adding the extra seats will tack on roughly additional pounds to the rondos plus pound curb weight and thats before you put any bodies in those seats a more real world answer to the fuel economy question is that in more than miles of driving in a seven passenger v powered rondo i averaged mpg now lets look at the big minivans the dodge caravan with a liter four cylinder engine has a combined epa rating of mpg opt for the liter v and that drops to mpg the toyota sienna and nissan quest both equipped with liter vs manage mpg and mpg respectively in everyday driving any of these minivans will average in the high teens are you thinking what im thinking because im pretty sure i know what kias customers are thinking the costco shopper types who tend to frequent kia dealerships are always on the lookout for the best deal and a mile or two of extra driving per gallon may not seem like a big enough payoff for a less roomy interior that means about the only way kia dealers can hope to snare these people away from regular minivans is with a cut rate price the least expensive seven passenger rondo starts at &# including destination charge which may or may not do it there is undoubtedly a dodge dealer in your neck of the woods who will be glad to unload a caravan for less thanks to the caravans imminent redesign hopefully the rondo can find a market as a nice alternative to the status quo it seems well screwed together and it moves with that quiet detached fluidity that has long been the hallmark of toyotas it doesnt come with power doors or a power tailgate or a dvd player in the back seat perhaps kia can get a coalition of librarians and newspaper publishers to promote this absence of feature there are no origami puzzle seats that disappear into thin air but the seats do slide and fold easily enough to allow your brood to clamber into an almost spacious third row that said theres still not a compelling reason to purchase a rondo instead of a conventional minivan save for it being slightly easier to park if kia would have left well enough alone and imported the four cylinder european version a stronger case could be made of course kias perception of the importance of power and acceleration ruled the day as it always does in the u s perhaps thats why we dont get more european vehicles here we just dont get them contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
