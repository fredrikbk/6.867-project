weekend journal review theater and she can sing too  in the shade studio w th st &# &# closes july deuce music box theatre w th st &# &# closes aug radio golf cort theatre w th st &# &# new york this has been a big season for tom jones and harvey schmidt first they revived "the fantasticks " their best known musical in a splendid off broadway production directed by mr jones that opened last august and is still going strong now the roundabout theatre company has brought " in the shade" back to broadway for the first time since it closed in and it turns out to be every bit as good as "the fantasticks " not only is lonny prices staging letter perfect but audra mcdonald who hasnt appeared in a broadway musical since is giving the performance of a lifetime as lizzie curry a plain jane gal from texas who is haunted by the prospect of permanent spinsterhood until a fast talking con man named starbuck steve kazee blows into town and awakens her inner babe id never seen " in the shade " which dropped from sight after its original broadway run and has yet to establish itself as a repertory item a couple of much admired revivals notwithstanding its been done by the new york city opera and arlington va s signature theatre now that i have im completely mystified as to why its so comparatively little known the score is by turns wistful sprightly and warmly lyrical and the book skillfully adapted by n richard nash from his still popular play "the rainmaker " is full of smiles of course its not profound but not many musicals are and unless youre allergic to sentiment in which case you probably dont like musicals anyway youll want to have a hankie at the ready part of what makes this production so effective is its simplicity its played on a smallish stage with a minimum of scenery making it easier to concentrate on the actors and the score such an approach wont work unless the cast is worthy of your full attention but mr price has put together an ensemble that repays careful watching yes ms mcdonald is the brightest star on the stage but the fact that shes "supported" by a shrewd old pro like john cullum who plays h c curry lizzies father with grand geniality makes her shine all the more brightly mr kazee is a charmer too " in the shade" is far more than a showcase for a high voltage charisma monger even so ms mcdonald gives the most fully realized performance ive seen in a musical this season not excluding donna murphy in "lovemusik" and raul esparza in "company " it goes without saying that she has the best voice on broadway but like kristin chenoweth she doesnt have to sing a note to grab your attention ms mcdonald is an actor who sings not a singer who acts and her interpretation of "old maid " the first act finale of " in the shade " catches every twist and turn in mr joness heart shredding lyric "always being one never being two rearrange the furniture theres nothing else to do " the one thing she cant do is be anything other than gorgeous and the whole point of " in the shade" is that lizzie is "as plain as old shoes" until starbuck teaches her to see herself in the eyes of those who love her katharine hepburn got away with it in the film version of "the rainmaker " but hers was a bony angular beauty that wasnt always obvious whereas ms mcdonald is pretty from any angle all she can do is act plain carrying herself with an awkward self consciousness that is unexpectedly and sufficiently convincing thats my only quibble and its barely worth mentioning in every other way " in the shade" is a triumph not just for ms mcdonald but for the entire company and production team i wish it could run forever but it closes in just five weeks so make your way to studio at once rejoice greatly stargazers angela lansbury and marian seldes have returned to broadway to share a stage in terrence mcnallys "deuce " would that this tale of two retired tennis pros were something other than an ordinary celebrity vehicle but great acting can ennoble the tritest of scripts and mr mcnallys leading ladies deliver the goods with postage to spare actually it would be closer to the mark to say that ms lansbury is a great star and ms seldes a great actor ms lansbury whose character is a tough talking old broad from the wrong side of the tracks serves up a series of obvious but nonetheless pleasing variations on the theme of herself ms seldes who plays a genteel high society type digs deeper into the thin topsoil of her role making the most of not very much the play itself is so transparent as to be all but invisible midge barker ms seldes and leona mullen ms lansbury americas most successful womens doubles team have come to the u s open to be feted as pioneers of womens tennis we see them sitting together at courtside reunited after a decade long separation chatting about old times as two bubble headed tv announcers brian haley and joanna p adler explain to the audience who they are and why it matters an admiring fan michael mulheren asks for their autographs and supplies a framing narration thats it no plot no action just minutes worth of moderately witty repartee "i married well as they used to say " "they still do " why bother because its ms seldes and ms lansbury who are batting the conversational ball back and forth and because michael blakemore and peter j davison the director and designer have buffed this wan gabfest to the slickest possible gloss you wont remember a word of it when its over but youll still be glad you saw it august wilson is back in town posthumously "radio golf " the tenth and last installment in wilsons "pittsburgh cycle" of plays about black life in th century america opened at the yale repertory theatre in seven months before the playwrights death it has since been performed by a half dozen other regional companies now its arrived on broadway in a road honed production directed by kenny leon designed by david gallo and performed by five first class actors three of whom have been with the show since its premiere the pittsburgh cycle which got under way in with "ma raineys black bottom " is a landmark of american theater but like many other such extended undertakings it loses steam toward the end "king hedley ii" and "gem of the ocean " the eighth and ninth plays in the cycle are inferior in quality to their predecessors in part because wilson became self indulgent and long winded as he grew older in "radio golf " the first of the plays to portray upwardly mobile characters who have vaulted into the ranks of the middle class he picks up the tempo and returns to something akin to the no nonsense form of "fences " the most theatrically effective play in the cycle for all its faults and they are considerable "radio golf" is as taut as a piano string so whats the problem mainly that wilsons take on the black middle class is simplistic to the point of cartoonishness instead of taking a searching look at the complicated inner lives of blacks who move from the ghetto to the suburbs he settles for giving us a pair of golf playing straw businessmen in bespoke suits harry lennix and james a williams whove lost touch with the street in the second act he rams the point home with a clankingly obvious speech "you know what you are it took me a while to figure it out you a negro white people will get confused and call you a nigger but they dont know like i know a dog knows its a dog a cat knows its a cat but a negro dont know hes a negro he thinks hes a white man its negroes like you who hold us back " translation in the unlikely event that you need it all black capitalists are uncle toms good drama doesnt always tell the truth it doesnt have to great drama on the other hand turns a spotlight on the world and forces the viewer to acknowledge the most painful and fundamental facts about human nature many of august wilsons plays do that but in "radio golf" he settled for the lazy half answers of the ideologue while that doesnt diminish in the least the genuine greatness of a play like "fences " i wish hed gone out on a higher truer note mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www
