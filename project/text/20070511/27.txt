difficult upgrade saps plan to globalize hits cultural barriers software giants shift irks german engineers u s star quits effort five years ago germanys largest software company decided it had to become less german to get more global sap ag hired thousands of programmers in countries such as the u s and india it assigned them to key projects that almost all had been handled from its home base in the small town of walldorf germany it adopted english for corporate meetings even in headquarters sap recruited hundreds of foreign managers and non germans made up half the companys top ranks by last year up from one third in the newcomers sought to inject a faster pace and open saps insular culture to more outside influences the resulting tensions show how the challenge of globalization goes far beyond navigating different languages and time zones in walldorf longtime employees feared the company was changing too much too fast veteran software developers protested the loss of autonomy and "americanization" of the company "we used to be kings here " says rainer huber a developer whos spent his entire year career at sap in walldorf but in silicon valley home to many of the newcomers as well as saps biggest rivals employees worried the company wasnt changing enough in march palo alto calif based shai agassi saps head of product development and most visible agent of change resigned frustrated with the internal conflicts "i became not only an agitator but a lightning rod for a lot of things " mr agassi says sap executives tried to assuage both groups promising german veterans that they would still have jobs while reassuring the newcomers of the commitment to change in globalizing "you have to tackle the shift of power " says sap chief executive henning kagermann "you cannot avoid it " saps shift was more dramatic than most as the company tried to remake itself to cope with the changes the internet was forcing on its business few companies try to globalize from top to bottom many companies build extensive sales service and manufacturing operations abroad but most keep top posts and important areas like corporate strategy and product development close to headquarters microsoft corp for instance continues to set software strategy from redmond wash even as it hires thousands of programmers in india sap by contrast split up its pivotal product development effort into eight centers around the globe directed from california by mr agassi the company hoped to smooth some of the bumps with cultural sensitivity classes for employees and beer outings for new executives in walldorf its challenge was all the greater because in much of europe unemployment rates are higher than in the u s and there is even more anxiety about losing jobs to emerging economies so called "national champions" often have been protected from competition and german companies have only slowly joined the globalization trend its not clear that saps internal revolution is helping its financial results software sales grew less than the company and analysts expected in as big customers slowed purchases and rivals stepped up competition sap shares have fallen about in the past year on germanys deutsche boerse and on the new york stock exchange while archrival oracle corp s have climbed about on the nasdaq revenue has grown however to billion euros last year or about &# billion from billion euros then about &# billion in founded in by five german ibm engineers sap grew into the worlds largest maker of software used by companies to run back office systems such as accounting and procurement sap expanded its sales force globally in the s and s but nearly all of its software was written in walldorf miles south of frankfurt developers there took a year or more to hone programs hashing out problems with colleagues at coffee bars that dotted the office hallways the programs they wrote were complex and expensive often requiring teams of experts months to install they didnt work well with software from other vendors since sap assumed it would be a one stop software shop for customers that comfortable model was rocked in the late s as businesses increasingly connected with each other and customers via the internet often transacting business with people who didnt use sap software instead of buying complicated expensive suites of software once every five years companies often turned to web based software sold by monthly subscription by saps rivals and upstart internet firms mr kagermann a former physics professor known for his careful studious approach to management was skeptical of the internet business model he and his co ceo at the time hasso plattner moved cautiously they experimented with online programs created subsidiaries specializing in internet business and bought smaller companies one acquisition brought in an israeli based company headed by the brash mr agassi who had founded four companies by age mr plattner one of saps founders was known as a technological visionary with a fiery temperament he once mooned the crew of oracle founder lawrence ellisons yacht during a race he took to mr agassi who argued back after mr plattner blasted his software during their first meeting mr plattner challenged mr agassi with difficult management assignments placing him in charge of other web focused units and hundreds of sap staffers mr agassi recalls pitching mr plattner scores of ideas each one rejected mr plattner declined to comment for the article toward the end of one of mr agassis ideas caught mr plattners attention "it was the first time he didnt say it was stupid he actually put his glasses on " laughs mr agassi under mr plattners direction the idea became sap netweaver designed from the outset to work with the internet and software from other vendors it also could be updated more quickly than traditional sap programs meanwhile messrs plattner and kagermann had concluded that their cautious approach to the internet had hurt sap in the u s the software business was moving away from saps complex applications to smaller more flexible programs and they needed more innovation competition was heating up too in oracle began a three year &# billion acquisition spree that swallowed more than software makers including peoplesoft inc and siebel systems inc in sap revenue fell for the first time in the companys history mr kagermann decided sap couldnt respond quickly enough if it controlled everything from walldorf "the lesson learned for us was that being the fast follower is not enough " he says "we have to be in many places and to get signals earlier " messrs plattner and kagermann loosened walldorfs grip bringing newcomers like mr agassi further into management in they promoted mr agassi to the seven member executive board and merged the internet subsidiaries hed headed into sap the next year they broke up saps product development teams a move mr kagermann calls the companys "first big cultural shift " they made mr agassi head of technology development and officially put him in charge of netweaver which was released in november sap hired thousands of programmers in india and china by it had eight global software labs with different areas of expertise the number of software engineers in german labs doubled but the proportion working elsewhere increased from a quarter of the total to by projects were carved up and sent to units around the world palo alto handled the products look and feel india specialized in analytical tools walldorf managed hard core coding the moves caused uneasiness in walldorf mr huber the veteran german developer says he missed piloting projects from start to finish developers of traditional sap programs meanwhile clashed with mr agassi on how to tweak their software to accommodate netweaver "they said you dont tell us what to do we tell you what to build " recalls mr agassi mr agassi complained to mr plattner and asked not to work on projects involving saps traditional software instead mr plattner promoted mr agassi in to oversee the older programs as well mr agassi describes the shift as "punishment" and "a challenge " the move effectively put a non german in charge of sap product strategy for the first time it also gave mr agassi responsibility for most of saps developers of them were still in walldorf where he had never been based mr agassi hired hundreds of silicon valley techies from rivals many into senior positions he oversaw a day plan to reorganize how products were developed then pushed to carry it out in days he asked deputies to identify german managers who could threaten change they came up with a list of people to win over mr agassi devised a number of projects some of which led to real products to show the engineers the new faster pace in one project dubbed "hercules " mr agassi gave a group of developers weeks to create programs to analyze data such as defects in car parts at saps normal pace one such application would take several months the developers tried to talk mr agassi into lowering the goal to he refused they ultimately met the target by creating a clever program that created other programs under mr agassis direction sap created new products last year versus one or two in previous years some veterans worried that the pace would damage quality "the fear is that you cant sustain the momentum over time " says eberhard schick a walldorf developer who took part in hercules its not "good old german engineering " programmers griped that walldorf had lost control over product strategy "the power went to palo alto " says mr schick the concerns crystallized at breakfasts in walldorf in early set up to introduce mr agassi to the rank and file developers grilled him about why he was hiring so many americans and whether he planned to abandon saps proprietary computer language in favor of languages more widely used in internet applications in august a german employee complained to a local newspaper that mr agassis "boys come in at very high levels without even being seen by the staff here " five months later germanys national handelsblatt newspaper published an article headlined "sap and globalization march of the americans " one german manager was quoted saying "its clear agassi would like to get as many functions as possible to the u s " mr agassi says his mission was "to bring the best talent we could find anywhere into sap regardless of location " in april sap executives hosted a town hall meeting in walldorf on the "americanization of sap " where workers aired concerns over the increasing use of english and the hiring of engineers overseas a few months later a handful of sap workers including mr schick won enough support to start a workers council roughly equivalent to a labor union their fears were fanned by saps moves to transfer some jobs out of germany much software maintenance updating and fixing older systems is now done in india some human resource work went to prague "the job of the workers council is to help the german staff manage the consequences of this globalization" by helping workers find other jobs at sap says mr schick mr kagermann was unyielding "there cannot be even a minute where you debate" globalization he says but executives reassured engineers that sap wasnt cutting employment in germany and reassigned those whose jobs were transferred executive board member and personnel director klaus heinrich says walldorfs engineering staff has been growing and no workers have been laid off mr heinrich advised the new foreign executives how to get along with german engineers work hard and impress them with content sap sponsored cultural sensitivity classes that taught for example that indian developers like frequent attention while germans prefer to be left alone another tip americans might say "excellent" when a german would say "good " meanwhile mr agassis developers were cranking out more programs but some of the new offerings didnt sell well and prompted grumbling inside sap "its nice to create a prototype " mr schick says of one new product "but i question whether the program is really being used by customers " mr agassi complained that the new programs didnt get enough marketing and service support people familiar with mr agassis thinking say he clashed with other executives particularly sales chief leo apotheker over the complaint and saps long term strategy insiders say "when you produce new products in one year the companys gearboxes start to crack " mr agassi said in an interview in late mr plattner had told mr agassi that he had a shot at being ceo someday but when sap in february extended mr kagermanns contract until mr agassi calculated it would be several more years before he would get the chance the "passion to cost equation" was no longer high enough he says and he decided to leave these days messrs kagermann and plattner are working hard to convince saps palo alto developers that the company wont return to its walldorf centric days "what were doing to globalize r&amp d is the right thing and we will continue " mr kagermann said in a conference call with reporters on the day mr agassis departure was announced he added "its not easy to manage "
