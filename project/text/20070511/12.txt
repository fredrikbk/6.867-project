can bush recover can president bush recover it matters enormously in the election particularly in the presidential race whether he does or not either way recovery or no recovery the president will have a powerful impact on the outcome if he fails to lift himself out of the political doldrums his successor in the white house is likely to be a democrat but should he pull off a strong finishing kick as president reagan did in the prospects of another republican president will improve significantly president bush of course wont be on the ballot but the status of his presidency whether hes seen as successful or not will frame the election year debate just as it did when harry truman dwight eisenhower lyndon johnson and ronald reagan left office after two presidential terms truman in and johnson in were seen as failures truman because of the stalemated korean conflict johnson as a result of the unpopular vietnam war both were democrats both were succeeded by republicans eisenhower in despite a deep recession in and remained personally popular but his republican administration was exhausted and uninspiring democrat john f kennedy won the presidential race reagan in contrast demonstrated how a presidents revival in his last year of office can save his party a republican he was beset in by the iran contra scandal and cancer but he recovered late in and with a string of successes on the overarching issue the cold war the soviets agreed to withdraw from afghanistan and sign a treaty proposed by reagan to ban intermediate range nuclear missiles in europe and reagans trip to moscow was a dazzling triumph the result republican george h w bush won the election whats clear in these elections is that the candidate of the outgoing presidents party is inextricably tied to that president its a political connection that cant be broken the candidate can criticize the president try to distance himself and snarl like the presidents worst enemy but that not only wont work its likely to be counterproductive after house republican moderates met tuesday with mr bush they leaked to the press that theyd informed him hes damaging the party by persisting with the war in iraq that wont help their re election theyre tied to the president too the best tactic is to build up the president not tear him down of the republican presidential candidates former new york mayor rudy giuliani appears to be the only one who understands this at their first debate last week the republicans were asked what theyd do differently from mr bush all but mr giuliani jumped at the chance to draw distinctions sen john mccain was the most critical faulting the president for mismanaging the war in iraq mr giuliani however noted that after terrorists were expected to attack again "we havent been " he said "i believe we have a president who made the right decision at the right time to put us on offense against terrorists i think history will remember him for that and i think as republicans we should remind people of that " a turnaround in iraq would give mr bush the biggest boost short of that some tangible progress in iraq would help the president has adopted a new strategy the "surge " to curb the violence impede the insurgency and secure baghdad but even the best case scenario for iraq doesnt foresee indisputable evidence the surge is working until this fall for the president to recover more than signs of success in iraq are required he must counter the conventional wisdom that america is failing in the middle east and losing influence elsewhere this may necessitate a tough new direction in his foreign and national security policy which now looks weak the image of weakness was reinforced last week at a conference in egypt of iraq and its neighbors secretary of state condoleezza rice sought to confer with irans foreign minister and was snubbed twice she did meet with the foreign minister of syria but that came a few days after the new american commander in iraq gen david petraeus had said terrorists fly into damascus the syrian capital on their way to iraq you might think the economy robust as it is would give mr bush a boost but it provides no help as a political matter wars overshadow the state of the economy truman discovered this in when the economy was strong but his political standing was so low he was forced to give up plans for re election there is one thing that mr bush and his republican allies in congress have done spectacularly well since their election defeat last fall play defense democrats rushed six bills through the house in january republicans have managed to sidetrack them in the senate by filibuster or veto democrats have yet to enact a single piece of serious legislation blocking liberal bills produces a kind of negative success it hasnt and wont trigger a bush resurgence democrats after all are more popular than republicans at the moment and several of their initiatives increased funding for embryonic stem cell research to cite one have considerable public support democratic presidential candidates by the way drew a bigger tv audience for their debate last month than republicans did for theirs in a speech in punta gorda fla last weekend bush aide karl rove had good advice for republicans "now is the time to be bold " he said "its easy when the winds at your back but the real test is now when the winds in our face thats when we find out if were tough enough inspired enough committed enough to do our duty " mr bush should take that advice too he needs to make sure congressional republicans reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform this year because hes championed the issue for years mr bush would get a large share of the credit just as important it would take the issue that most divides his party off the table and give republicans a shot at restoring their credibility with hispanic voters democrats can get by without any fresh ideas or legislative achievements they took over congress without offering any for mr bush a new idea or two would provide a nice contrast with democrats he never fleshed out his concept of an ownership society that would give individuals more control over their retirement health care and education funds now would be a good time to do that president bushs standing wont be the only factor that decides the election but it will be the most important one if he doesnt recover politically with progress in iraq spurring him on its hard to see a republican candidate winning the white house and the likelihood of a president hillary clinton or a president barack obama will grow mr barnes is the executive editor of the weekly standard and co host of "the beltway boys" on fox news channel
