canadian company that is a leading candidate to bid for daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group a surprise move that could complicate the auction for the auto maker and raise new concerns about foreign investment in the u s oleg deripaskas plan to buy a &# billion stake in magna international inc could provide vital cash for any chrysler bid made by the canadian auto parts maker although the russians past offers a potential red flag for regulators and political leaders who will scrutinize the deal u s law enforcement officials suspect mr deripaska may have ties to russian organized crime he has consistently denied participating in any criminal activity announcing the deal yesterday magna officials said the tie up with mr deripaska is part of the auto suppliers goal to expand in fast growing markets such as russia and isnt related to the planned bid for chrysler a spokesman for mr deripaskas basic element holding company said his company would consider the chrysler deal the way any other magna shareholder would magna said the proposed basic element transaction is subject to court and regulatory approvals in canada though owned by a german parent chrysler is still considered a u s company in that it continues to design develop and manufacture cars and trucks in north america and employs about people here if chrysler does work for the defense department or has operations that are deemed of national security interest the deal could be subject to review by the committee on foreign investment in the u s daimlerchrysler has held talks with several potential buyers of its unprofitable chrysler unit and is expected to name a lead bidder soon besides magna other interested buyers include private equity firms cerberus capital management and a team of blackstone partners and centerbridge capital as well as billionaire investor kirk kerkorian magna is the only automotive company in the running so far the proposed capital infusion into magna would give mr deripaska who had his visa to travel to the u s canceled last year because of washingtons legal concerns significant control of magna his investment would give him via a holding company an indirect stake and the right to nominate six of magnas board members as many as are named by the stronach family that controls magna the move to raise cash through a deal with mr deripaska instead of via bonds or loans reflects magnas long held strategy of keeping a strong balance sheet and avoiding debt magna ended the year with almost &# billion of cash on hand frank stronach magnas chairman and founder has said the company wouldnt incur debt in bidding for chrysler "we will continue to increase our cash flow so we can grow in the future " magna chief financial officer vincent galifi said yesterday on a conference call yesterday magna executives suggested proceeds from the deal would be used to buy back magna shares in the future because of increasing cost pressures in north america and the challenges facing the auto industry magna is looking elsewhere for growth mr stronach said the company has been looking during the past year for a partner in russia where auto sales and production are rising rapidly basic element owns oao gaz one of russias leading auto makers gaz is seeking technology and expertise to upgrade its outdated product lines of volga sedans and gazelle delivery trucks while magna is also looking for a partner to help expand its business supplying parts to russias auto industry siegfried wolf magnas co chief executive who has worked in russia said he was able to see how mr deripaska worked with his employees which was a huge motivating factor in the deal mr wolf said he then asked mr stronach about his thoughts on mr deripaska and his potential for becoming magnas partner the two sides began talks in november mr stronach said he spoke to a lot of european companies mr deripaska worked with and they had "the highest regard for him as a businessman " he said magna did research on who would be a credible partner and who would be accepted by the international markets and mr deripaska fit that criteria with magnas chrysler ambitions however the deal with mr deripaska could become a lightning rod for concerns about rising investment in the u s by russian companies with close ties to the kremlin and roots in the rough and tumble capitalism of s russia mr deripaska years old made his fortune in the s in russias hugely profitable aluminum industry where the battle for control over smelters and other assets once owned by the soviet government was particularly violent mr deripaska has never been accused of any wrongdoing and civil suits by former business partners alleging corrupt or illegal business tactics have all been dismissed the involvement of mr deripaska in a deal for chrysler could spark concerns in washington where some high profile foreign acquisitions have foundered in the past two years on political and security grounds the u s revoked mr deripaskas visa last year due to concerns about his possible ties to organized crime and the veracity of his statements on the matter to the federal bureau of investigation officials said they are unlikely to reverse the revocation and one official called the decision that initially gave the billionaire a multiple entry visa "a mistake " while chrysler is no longer a major u s defense contractor it does sell vehicles to the army and other agencies and works with the pentagon and other federal agencies to develop vehicle technologies some with military applications basic element spokesman konstantin panin said mr deripaskas visa wasnt a major issue in the talks with magna "we dont expect there will be any difficulties obtaining regulatory approvals " he added don walker magna co ceo said the company considers mr deripaskas visa "a personal issue " adding "hes a professional upstanding businessman and were looking forward to doing business with him " a magna bid for chrysler wouldnt create any apparent antitrust or national security issues according to u s officials the bush administration meanwhile has been pushing to re establish the u s reputation for openness to foreign investment after several high profile deals such as dubai ports worlds acquisition of several u s facilities were scuttled by heavy political opposition the deripaska chunk of magna would be held by a new canadian holding company that would be a partnership between stronach trust and russian machines a unit of basic element the deal has to be approved by magna shareholders who will likely vote on the issue in about three months mr stronach stressed that he doesnt think the deal would affect magnas talks to purchase chrysler he also said it was magna and canadian investment firm onex that were working together on the deal with a possibility that daimlerchrysler could retain a small stake in chrysler but russian machines wasnt involved in those talks he said mr stronach said he isnt aware how daimlerchrysler officials feel about basic elements investment but thinks they would view it as a positive development because russia would be a good market for both chrysler and mercedes benz products magna is also hoping it will be utilized by other auto makers looking to expand its russian presence "lets build jeeps in russia " mr stronach said chrysler ceo tom lasorda has said russia is one of the key markets where chrysler is hoping to expand with decreasing market share and increasing competition in north america mr lasorda has said one of the keys to his companys growth would be emerging markets a person familiar with the matter said daimlerchrysler officials werent aware of the russian investment in magna before yesterdays announcement daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment mr stronach said both stronach trust and russian machines would have veto rights over any major acquisitions which would include a deal for chrysler if magna were to emerge as the lead bidder the magna deal would be basic elements largest investment outside of russia and one of the biggest of a growing number of deals in which cash rich russian resource companies have acquired assets abroad in the u s most of those deals have gone relatively smoothly such as the &# billion purchase last year of oregon steel mills by russias evraz holding sa but amid the chill in relations over the past few years between moscow and washington and rising concern in the west about the kremlins tightening grip on business in russia politics are increasingly a factor mr stronach said he met before the deal with russian president vladimir putin who he says approved of the plan mr deripaska is one of the few s tycoons to have thrived under mr putin one lawyer who works on such cases said that whether a sale of chrysler to magna comes under government review depends on the extent of its security related work as well as mr deripaskas influence on magnas board if mr deripaska is believed to substantially control magna that would be more likely to spark an official inquiry among the things the u s considers in such transactions the lawyer added are "issues indicative of trustworthiness" in the buyer owned by mr deripaska basic element provides only limited financial information mr deripaskas company russian aluminum co had discussed plans for a securities listing on the new york stock exchange but has since shifted its attention to london where among other differences disclosure rules are less strict greg hitt in
