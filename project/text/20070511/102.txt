weekend journal taste houses of worship christianity without salvation within a few years of its publication in "christianity and the social crisis" swept through americas protestant churches like a noreaster selling more than copies to ministers and laypeople alike in an age of social upheaval walter rauschenbuschs jeremiad was meant to rouse the church from its pietistic slumber "if society continues to disintegrate and decay the church will be carried down with it " he warned "if the church can rally such moral forces that injustice will be overcome it will itself rise to higher liberty and life " the summons found many converts reflecting on the mood a few decades later preacher harry emerson fosdick gushed with nostalgia it "struck home so poignantly " he said that it "ushered in a new era in christian thought and action " the era of rauschenbusch is far from over his "social gospel" message continues to inspire activists and theologians of all stripes the question now though is whether its influence is a desirable thing or a distraction of the christian church from its deepest objectives many praise the reform efforts stirred in part by rauschenbuschs appeal the founding of settlement houses literacy campaigns help for refugees and food and health care for the destitute politically rauschenbuschs book helped along teddy roosevelts progressive agenda notably his antitrust crusades social gospel activists would later hail the creation of social security under the new deal surely there is much in the tradition for which to be grateful yet even a brisk reading of rauschenbuschs work suggests crippling weaknesses at least from the standpoint of faith were told that the larger social message of jesus teaching especially his concern for the poor was sidelined by the cultural assumptions of his followers the culprits the doctrine of sin and the "crude and misleading" idea of a coming apocalypse generations of believers wrongly came to regard earthly life as a snare and turned inward for personal salvation "such a conception of present life and future destiny " rauschenbusch wrote chidingly "offered no motive for an ennobling transformation of the present life " distorted ideas about heaven and hell have spawned great mischief in the name of christianity of course rauschenbusch must have seen plenty of it during a decade of ministry in new york citys "hells kitchen" neighborhood indeed the christianity of his youth looked unfit to cope with the "industrial crises" of his day nevertheless he seemed blithely unaware of others provoked by the very conceptions of sin and salvation he so despised men such as william wilberforce john wesley john jay lyman beecher and william booth to champion reform efforts of all kinds rauschenbuschs clever narrative of a faith held hostage was itself a captive of its cultural setting its no accident that phrases such as the "laws of social development " "scientific comprehension of society" and the "evolution of social institutions" litter his text he presents not so much the teachings of jesus paul and the apostles as the dogmas of darwin marx and herbert spencer richard niebuhr called this "cultural christianity " i e re imagining the gospel according to secular nostrums about the march of human progress as such rauschenbuschs gospel had little need of a savior it merely displaced the problem of evil the supreme tragedy of the human soul in rebellion against god with the challenge of social iniquities the kingdom of heaven would come soon enough if only we put our hands to the plow perhaps this earth bound emphasis explains the social gospels naive embrace of morally dubious causes including eugenics and abortion we underwrite modern social programs with similar illusions about human nature thus drug "maintenance" programs to take but one example leave the scourge of addiction largely untouched because they do not address its moral and spiritual causes the centennial edition of "christianity and the social crisis" just published by harper sanfrancisco includes essays from various liberal and progressive admirers tony campolo a left leaning evangelical praises rauschenbuschs "holistic gospel" for offering both eternal life and dramatic changes in the social order stanley hauerwas calls him "an evangelist of the kingdom of god " jim wallis likewise lauds rauschenbuschs "christian social ethic" as an "eloquent and necessary corrective" to privatized faith it is hard to see though how rauschenbuschs theology could be called christian in any meaningful sense of the term it required no repentance or atonement and carried no fear of judgment or bracing hope of eternal life he famously denied the doctrine of christs second coming with its promise of perfect justice and enduring mercy the result was a flattened view of the human condition "it is not possible honestly to confess that jesus is the christ of culture " niehbur wrote in "christ and culture" "unless one can confess much more than this " the christian confession of faith by itself offers no guarantee that either individuals or societies will be transformed but for believers not even the smallest steps forward can be taken without it mr loconte is a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center and editor of "the end of illusions religious leaders confront hitlers gathering storm "
