course change why jetblue shuffled top rank airlines board removes founder neeleman as ceo a need for new processes after a feb service meltdown that left passengers stranded on runways in new york for hours david neeleman jetblue airways corp founder chairman and chief executive took full responsibility for the problems now the airlines board has relieved him of responsibility for fixing them but the setback for the charismatic visionary mr neeleman who cedes his ceo title to longtime jetblue president dave barger and becomes nonexecutive chairman is far more than just a delayed reaction to the debacle sparked by a valentines day ice storm more important it signals anew how much more competitive and difficult the airline business has become over the past several years jetblue southwest airlines co and the other low fare carriers that were supposed to pave a new profitable way of doing business in the airline industry and seemed to be succeeding are now struggling with rising fuel prices difficulty raising fares and other day to day issues that have long bedeviled the so called legacy airlines mr neeleman said his new role will free him to focus on jetblues long term strategy and some of his other passions including supporting mitt romney in his republican presidential candidacy "as an entrepreneur you found a company you run it then it runs you " mr neeleman years old said in an interview "i dont necessarily like running stuff " the member boards decision made on wednesday and announced yesterday that mr neeleman should step down as ceo wasnt solely predicated on the valentines day mess which led to flight cancellations over several days and cost jetblue some &# million several people familiar with the situation said the board had been considering succession issues since last year increasingly concerned that neither mr neeleman nor mr barger was able to devote as much attention as needed to operations that had become increasingly complex one person close to the board said the decision to nudge mr neeleman aside wasnt made until the board met at jetblues forest hills n y headquarters on wednesday following the companys annual shareholders meeting when mr neeleman was told of the boards wishes he initially was "taken aback " this person said "despite a lot of signals along the way he didnt fully see it coming " but by the end of the board meeting "he was seeing the wisdom of this " "were growing rapidly and we need clear strategic vision " said joel peterson the lead director and one of the original investors in the airline "we couldnt grow beyond where we were without new processes " jetblue founded in began flying in february from its base at new yorks kennedy international airport with daily flights to fort lauderdale fla and buffalo n y it had employees mr peterson who runs a private equity firm and teaches at stanford business school said jetblue "is no longer a nimble little airline" and needs to articulate a strategy now that it has employees and jetliners operating about daily flights to destinations in the u s and caribbean "were not in trouble " he said "this is a very good company pointed in the right direction its time to let david and dave do what they do best and grow to the next level " mr neeleman a serial entrepreneur who says he is afflicted with attention deficit disorder has founded three carriers and an airline reservations company his third airline jetblue promised fares up to lower than competitors along with creature comforts like assigned seating leather upholstery and satellite tv on individual screens in every seat it was an immediate hit passengers snapped up the dirt cheap fares and warmed to the friendly snappily dressed flight attendants it promoted a cheap chic image serving animal crackers oreo cookies and blue potato chips on flights like southwest jetblue made major inroads against traditional airlines during the economic downturn that followed the bursting of the technology bubble at the end of the s and continued to profit after the terrorist attacks a time when many larger airlines had huge losses but costs for many of the discount carriers in recent years have begun to climb "its the revenge of the network carriers " said edward h bastian chief financial officer of delta air lines inc in a recent interview low cost carriers "can only grow so much before they begin facing the same cost issues as the rest of the industry " thats been particularly true for jetblue partly because mr neeleman decided two years ago to break from the low cost mold and start imitating some of the practices of the older carriers he bought a second type of aircraft added routes and airports and built a &# million training center in orlando fla as he anticipated building jetblues work force to by these moves increased the airlines costs while drawing it into competition with a greater number of rivals which in turn made it harder for jetblue to raise fares jetblue lost &# million in then thanks to a return to profitability program that throttled back growth and focused more on cost containment the company narrowed that loss to &# million in before the valentines day troubles jetblue had expected to be profitable in the first quarter of it posted a loss instead although narrower than the year ago first quarter it has lowered its outlook three times since february it became clear during februarys storm that jetblue had grown too fast the airline simply didnt have enough people to handle all the customers trying to rebook flights and to schedule the crews during the disrupted operations mr neeleman apologized profusely and publicly for days saying "we lost control " and vowing to make changes that would make jetblue better in march the company hired russell chew a federal aviation administration official and former american airlines manager as chief operating officer a post that had been held by mr barger while there was no specific consideration of ousting mr neeleman at that time directors were enthusiastic about mr chews expertise mr chews hiring relieved mr barger of some of the day to day burden and led to the creation of an office of the ceo with four senior executives reporting to both messrs barger and neeleman coming into wednesdays directors meeting succession "was certainly not a new topic to the board " mr barger said partly because messrs neeleman and barger were both three and a half years into five year contracts fellow directors had talked to mr barger about his longer term outlook with the company and he always said he was "perfectly content flying davids wing " he wasnt present at the part of the board meeting when mr neelemans future was discussed mr barger inherits jetblue at a time when new discount airlines virgin america inc in san francisco and skybus airlines inc in columbus ohio are poised to take off and fuel prices are rising again southwest airlines continues to grow while the big network airlines have slimmed down and delta newly emerged from bankruptcy court protection is bulking up at jetblues hub at jfk airport mr barger jetblues new ceo "understands how to run an airline " said gordon bethune retired chairman and ceo of continental airlines inc mr barger ran continentals newark n j hub during mr bethunes tenure in the s and proved himself "a first class guy" during tough times the former ceo added mr neeleman said he welcomes the opportunity "to unplug and do something more strategic" than continue the daily "grind" of running the airline now the nations eighth largest by traffic he hopes to devote his energies to potential airline alliances opportunities afforded by the new u s eu airline treaty jetblues route strategy and alternative fuels initiatives the owner of about of jetblues shares and already wealthy from his past business ventures mr neeleman has long donated his &# annual salary from the ceo position to a foundation that supports the airlines employees he said yesterday he wasnt certain if he would remain on the payroll but if he did he would continue to donate the funds joann s lublin contributed to this article
