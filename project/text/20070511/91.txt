weekend journal catalog critic an iron free way to smooth wrinkles its rare that a catalog critic test gets positively torrid but this one did we were trying out five garment steamers this exotic appliance it looks like the child of a humidifier and a vacuum cleaner with a vented nozzle on a long hose attached to a water tank zaps wrinkles faster and more gently than a standard iron retailers say the steam is also said to freshen up garments between dry cleanings for some tips we consulted sarah shirley a new york fashion stylist who regularly uses steamers at photo shoots she suggested we consider sturdiness heating time and how much room these appliances require a steamer wont give the crisp look one gets from an iron she said but for more fluid fabrics in which you dont want sharp creases say a linen suit it "makes everything look nice and soft " nevertheless our test surprised us with their vertical clothes hanging poles each took up almost as much floor and airspace as a person some of the poles could retract for storage wed envisioned billowing jets of vapor that would instantly annihilate wrinkles on our first test items a linen blouse and a cotton spandex shirt but with two exceptions the steam came out in puffs though the units heated up quickly the steaming process seemed to take longer than ironing and we never got a perfectly smooth garment we even started to miss our ironing board with steamers you have to pull down on the garment to keep it taut which can make it twist on its hanger the products sellers and makers agreed that an iron can provide a smoother crisper result but on delicate fabric that cant be ironed such as velvet a steamer would be useful and we were more successful when we steamed a heavier mens suit jacket none of the models truly stood out it really came down to features our best overall pick from amazon com had nice attributes for the price including a trigger button to stop and start the steam and a small "press pad" that served as a sort of vertical ironing board best value from drugstore com had a built in hanger that helped keep the shirts from twisting contact us at catalogcritic wsj com steam fast sf quick steam professional garment steamer best overall amazon com amazon com &# super saver shipping is free the good sturdy with a good head of steam and large water tank that can provide steam for two hours like all the models it had casters for easy mobility its small foam press pad you hold it on one side of the fabric and steam against it served as a vertical ironing board and helped remove more wrinkles the bad though described as "five times faster than ironing " it wasnt the shopping it can help to read the sites customer reviews this item has gotten a mixed reaction one reviewer preferred to iron conair fabric steamer deluxe gs best value drugstore com drugstore com &# standard shipping is free the good the attached hanger kept shirts from twirling around and its tank had water level marks indicating remaining steam time up to an hour and minutes the pole could be telescoped down for storage the bad the hanger plus a vertical tank design made the unit more wobbly than the others its maker says the product has passed stability tests the steam came out less in jets than in puffs the shopping an absolute breeze site sells another upright steamer from conair with lower wattage and fewer features for &# commercial steamer hammacher schlemmer hammacher com &# standard shipping adds &# the good best overall runner up it was steamy for up to hours and sturdy with a slimmer profile and smaller footprint than some of the others the bad for the price it was fairly bare bones the shopping site also sells a &# high output model with more water capacity commercial garment steamer frontgate frontgate com &# standard shipping varies we paid &# the good the heavyweight steamer had a "standby" switch you step on it to stop the steam temporarily and we loved its retractable cord ninety minutes of steam the bad a metal "cage" around the hoses base to prevent kinks slipped out of place as we worked the hose then kinked and with no pliers handy we werent able to readjust the cage the manufacturer says it hasnt heard that complaint the shopping site has a price guarantee if you buy an item then see it in another catalog for less shipping and taxes included theyll refund the difference amazon com sells this one the rowenta is for &# and free super saver shipping homedics perfect steam professional garment steamer walmart com walmart com &# standard shipping adds &# the good the horizontal tank made it seem more stable than the best value model trigger style steam control one hour of steaming it had three accessories including a lint brush the bad its steam output wasnt the strongest the shopping it irks us when an online retailer makes us register and create a password before checking out this one also asked for our year of birth to make sure we werent children guess what we lied
