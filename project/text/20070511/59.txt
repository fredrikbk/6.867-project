moving the market paulsons strategy picks up in bid to draw capital secretary to set panel for advice on auditors washington treasury secretary henry paulsons campaign to make the u s an easier place in which to do business and raise capital is beginning to move beyond the contemplation stage cautiously one of the steps treasury officials say will be the creation of an advisory committee to recommend adjustments to how the u s accounting industry operates including looking for ways to limit the liability of public accountants the committee is part of a broader set of steps that mr paulson plans to outline next week as part of his effort to improve the competitiveness of u s capital markets in march mr paulson hosted a conference at georgetown university with prominent attendees such as alan greenspan the former federal reserve chairman and former treasury secretary robert rubin who outlined a litany of problems with the current regulatory and legal regime among the issues mr paulson is expected to discuss are steps to reduce regulatory overlap particularly for banking institutions that are currently subject to multiple regulators mr paulson will also provide an update on the treasurys attempt to address a legal system that he has said exposes market participants to "significant litigation risk " reducing litigation risk for auditors was among the suggestions made by participants at the georgetown conference and the treasury plans to act by creating an advisory committee of about representatives including some from the accounting industry corporations and investor advocates the group would be expected to provide treasury with recommendations by the end of the year robert steel treasurys undersecretary for domestic finance said the way the accounting industry operates now is problematic because it places too much risk on accounting firms if they fail to spot problems shouldering that liability forces accounting firms to take a rigid approach to auditing companies which in turn makes those being audited less likely to take risk it is sometimes those risks that lead to new products greater productivity and groundbreaking r&amp d and critics say that companies will prefer to go overseas where there is less regulation or a better legal environment to allow for these advances "accounting is a judgment at a point in time its not a science there are estimates and guidelines " mr steel said in an interview "if people take risks in business and it turns out that a reasonable risk with everything disclosed doesnt go well thats not an opportunity to allege that something inappropriate happened " auditors have advocated limiting liability arguing that a single large lawsuit could put one of the big four accounting firms out of business any recommendation to shield auditors however would likely run into resistance from investor advocates who are worried about returning to the pre enron days before auditing standards were tightened mr steel said the committee wouldnt look to give a "free pass" on investor protection "you need people that understand the balance here so that entrepreneurs are encouraged to take appropriate risks and investors have appropriate protection " he said but he said in many cases auditors should be able to take a principles based approach to auditing where they look at a specific organization and weigh risk instead of merely complying with a uniform set of inflexible rules among the other steps mr paulson plans to outline are areas where regulators are already engaged including the rewriting of auditing standards governing a controversial sarbanes oxley rule by the public company accounting oversight board and the securities and exchange commissions move to allow foreign companies to comply with international financial reporting standards instead of adhering only to generally accepted accounting principles or gaap which u s companies must use
