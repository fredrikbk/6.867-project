boos for al hurra weve been watching the debate over al hurra the u s funded middle east tv channel that has lately developed a reputation as a friendly forum for terrorists and islamic radicals a bipartisan group of congressmen has called for al hurras news director former cnn producer larry register to resign and its time he and his supervisors gave taxpayers some answers with an annual budget over &# million al hurra is part of the long arm of americas public diplomacy in the middle east the network was established to provide a credible source of information in the region in a market dominated by al jazeera and al arabiya the goal was to help start a discussion about freedom and democracy instead the network seems to have aligned itself with everyone else in pandering to the so called arab street the shift began when mr register took over last november as journalist joel mowbray has detailed in these pages al hurra has made a practice in mr registers tenure of friendly coverage of camera ready extremists from al qaeda hamas and other terrorist groups most famously the network gave more than minutes of airtime to hezbollah leader hasan nasrallah who informed viewers that hezbollah was "facing a strategic and historic victory " under mr register holocaust denial panels became "holocaust existence panels " people like al qaeda operative muhammed hanja received airtime to celebrate americas "defeat" on september mr registers defense has been in essence that if al hurra doesnt run anti american content no one will watch he seems to have misunderstood his assignment al hurra is not meant to compete with al jazeera but to offer an alternative view of the middle east from those of either its dictators or jihadis but al hurra is not alone in its failures voa and radio farda in iran also stray into broadcasts that wax critical on u s policies heres betting those outlets see more scrutiny in coming days and theres plenty of people besides mr register to question starting with the broadcasting board of governors that is charged with the networks oversight the bbg failed to investigate mr registers change of journalism marketing strategy when criticism began to emerge after mr mowbrays original article in march joaquin blaya chairman of the boards middle east committee wrote us a letter dismissing the criticism mr blaya was more accommodating in a second letter that we ran may perhaps because hes feeling heat from capitol hill he certainly hasnt felt any heat from undersecretary of state karen hughes who sits on the board and has also preferred to see no evil ms hughes has conceded that the nasrallah interview was "a violation of our policy " but in a speech to the board of governors and freedom house last week she missed an opportunity to clarify what is expected of al hurra in return for taxpayer support on wednesday state department spokesman sean mccormack said mr register is doing "a very good job " al hurra which means "the free one" can be a useful tool in the battle of ideas that is crucial to the war on islamic extremism but if it and its sister broadcasts are merely going to provide one more outlet for anti u s propaganda who needs them dissidents in soviet russia and its satellites once looked to radio free europe and voa as sources of truth they werent getting from local media nobody thinks the cold war would have ended sooner if they had offered more airtime to the kremlin
