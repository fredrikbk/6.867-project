m every business day sign up for the e mail here president clinton and congressional republicans were able to come together on the importance of trade agreements and now so have congressional democrats and president bush after months of stalled negotiations treasury secretary henry paulson and house speaker nancy pelosi last night announced a compromise that elicits democratic support for a handful of trade accords in exchange for bush administration willingness to demand that partner nations enforce labor and environmental laws the deal opens the way for congressional approval of smaller bilateral trade pacts including pending deals with peru and panama and could pave the way for broader trade negotiation latitude in the future as the wall street journal notes while democrats have opposed moves to give mr bush so called fast track negotiating authority rep charles rangel chairman of the ways and means committee tells the new york times he can now imagine a limited extension of negotiating power if the doha round of world trade talks appears to offer a good deal for americans republicans have traditionally supported trade deals that open up cross border commerce and lower protective measures like tariffs and quotas including those endorsed by mr clinton during his presidency while democrats have pushed for the addition of environmental and worker protections but as the times notes they have done so without success since mr bush came into office democrats still want a trade pact with colombia to include provisions on the safety of labor activists and they oppose one with south korea because it doesnt provide enough access yet to that country for u s beef cars and car parts the times adds people involved in the trans pennsylvania avenue accord tell the washington post that the key to agreement was "the bush administrations reluctant assent to democratic demands for more stringent labor rules " while the white house resisted them because businesses feared they could bolster the power of american unions "the administration concluded that it had to swallow the labor rules lest its trade deals die in a congress controlled by the other party " the post reports the agreement means that under new trade accords partner countries would have to ban child labor and forced labor guarantee labor organization rights enforce environmental laws they already have and comply with the rules in international environmental pacts the times explains it also calls for "expanded access for developing countries to generic drugs a priority for democrats who say efforts by brand name drug makers to protect their markets have put many medicines out of reach in poor countries " the journal adds the willingness on both sides to make a deal promoting trade in this globalized age was highlighted by the fact that it came only hours after release of the issues most politically tricky trade data the u s trade deficit which as the los angeles times reports was pushed upward by oil prices and rising imports to &# billion the biggest gap in six months bush may allow benchmarks for iraq on a more contentious washington negotiating front president bush signaled he might agree to allow benchmarks measuring iraqs progress in the war funding bills again making their ways through congress in what amounts to what the new york times calls "his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse " mr bush said he told his staff to find "common ground" with democrats and republicans on capitol hill over the benchmarks reversing his previous resistance to any strings attached to the &# billion he has requested and in what the wall street journal sees as a sign of the support mr bush still has in congress for the u s mission in iraq house democrats joined with most republicans to defeat a proposal that would have required redeployment of american forces there within days and a withdrawal of most troops in six months still the white house is increasingly coming under pressure from its own party and karl rove was among officials dispatched to dress down two house republicans for talking to the media about a contentious session they had this week with the president the hill reports meanwhile a majority of iraqi legislators "have signed a draft bill that would require a timetable for the withdrawal of u s soldiers from iraq and freeze current troop levels " the washington post reports "the development was a sign of a growing division between iraqs legislators and prime minister that mirrors the widening gulf between the bush administration and its critics in congress " prime minister nouri al maliki also faces growing trouble with some of iraqs neighbors king abdullah of saudi arabia has told u s diplomats and military officials his kingdom no longer supports mr maliki and doesnt believe the u s strategy to secure baghdad will work american and arab officials tell the post and thats at least part of the reason vice

free press reports and by the end of the day mr stronach was even "speculating about building jeeps in russia " it adds but the move could complicate magnas bid for chrysler because mr deripaskas "past offers a potential red flag for regulators and political leaders who will scrutinize the deal " the wall street journal notes "u s law enforcement officials suspect mr deripaska may have ties to russian organized crime " though he has denied participating in any criminal activity oxycontin maker admits to playing down risks purdue frederick and the companys chief executive chief lawyer and
