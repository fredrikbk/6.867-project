rudy and the right as if republicans dont have enough problems their presidential candidates and interest groups seem eager to re stage a fight over abortion the american public doesnt want to hear blame both rudy giuliani and his conservative critics but if the gop wants to lose in they should keep this up mr giuliani has created the stir by flopping around on an issue that he should have been better prepared to handle as he seeks the gop presidential nomination the former new york mayor says he finds abortion personally abhorrent but nonetheless supports a legal right to the procedure it isnt news that this is a hard sell for many republican primary voters but for mr giuliani to change his views after so many years in public life would make him look unprincipled which is not what americans want in a president yet mr giuliani has wandered all over town on the issue saying one week that he favors federal funding for abortions while later noting "itd be ok" if roe v wade were overturned and "ok" if it wasnt in a recent interview on cnn he said he supported a "strict constructionist" reading of the constitution while also saying he believed abortion "is a constitutional right ultimately " the missteps speak to a lack of discipline by mr giuliani or perhaps a lack of preparation by a first time presidential candidate he would do better to be consistent and direct which by mid week his aides were saying he finally plans to be it isnt as if mr giuliani doesnt have a case to make whatever his personal views the political reality is that abortion policy is now determined largely by the courts legislation such as the ban on partial birth abortion matters only at the margin what counts are judicial nominations and on that score mr giuliani says hed appoint supreme court justices in the mold of antonin scalia samuel alito and john roberts if mr giuliani means what he says then in practical policy terms as president he could do as much to promote anti abortion goals as any of the other gop candidates he could credibly say that if roe and casey were overturned then abortion policy could and should be settled democratically in state legislatures this is where some of mr giulianis conservative critics are also politically opportunistic not to say cynical "americans do not yet realize how far outside of the mainstream of conservative thought that mayor giulianis social views really are " says tony perkins of the family research council knowing the networks will always put him on the air when hes trashing a republican adds tom tancredo the anti immigration congressman desperately trying to become a two issue candidate "if a republican president of the united states wont vigorously fight to protect the life of the unborn how long before the trend toward the culture of death becomes irreversible " these conservatives seem oblivious to the realities of contemporary life and the complexity of social change if roe is overturned its availability and more importantly the demand for it will not disappear whoever is president whatever he or she believes but these conservatives can posture with the most extreme position because abortion has been hijacked by the courts and thus denied the normal process of democratic compromise say that roe was overturned and abortion again became a matter for states to regulate most would probably enact measures reflecting the rough public consensus that abortion should be legal but more restricted than it now is we doubt there would be any major or radical shifts in voters in south dakota not manhattan or vermont overturned a ban on most abortions that the state legislature had passed the previous year as for the politics of the last thing the gop needs is another intramural abortion brawl as a resurgent democratic party advances all manner of misguided proposals for the economy taxes national security health care energy and the environment voters need republicans to revive their own reform agenda an abortion fight will make the party seem irrelevant to the main voter concerns or captive to its litmus test interests mr giuliani has his strengths and weaknesses but he shouldnt be disqualified for the nomination because of his views on a single issue that a president cant do much to change other than through the courts the only victor in a drawn out gop abortion donnybrook will be the democrat who winds up in the white house see related letter "letters to the editor president alone cant resolve abortion issue" wsj may see related letter "letters to the editor abortion we see real human beings killed" wsj may
