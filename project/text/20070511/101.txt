weekend journal taste de gustibus security deposit west point n y on a stormy night here a couple of weeks ago a group of men and women gathered at the u s military academy to discuss the future of national security nothing unusual about that the group included military brass naturally and a few scholars but it also included how to put this some rich people no this wasnt a top secret meeting of halliburton executives it was a conference called "national security studies and military history how philanthropists can make a difference " the point of the evening sponsored by the philanthropy roundtable wasnt to learn how to profit from government largess halliburton style but the other way around to discuss how the government or at least the pentagon and its mission might be helped by the efforts of americas philantropic citizens as it happens there is a long tradition of the private sector bolstering national security hayim solomon an th century new york city merchant invested &# in government securities to pay for gen george washingtons yorktown campaign during world war ii henry ford transformed his factories to manufacture b bombers these days no one is suggesting that private donors sponsor say the troop surge in ramadi iraq but as mark smith the conferences director told me later such help makes perfect sense "it is really the american way for the private sector to roll up their sleeves and get engaged " but where to begin stephen rosen a professor at harvard and a conference participant believes that people in the national security areas of government are focused too much on day to day "crisis management " they dont stop to think about the next decade or two that is where philanthropists can step in by sponsoring reasearchers who might think about and write about and talk about the long term challenges we face our relationship with say the islamic world the use of nuclear weapons and the behavior of china it is true that any number of scholars spend time thinking about the larger geopolitical dimensions of these questions and the diplomatic options for resolving them but few devote themselves to the actual military issues involved it is futile to expect universities to produce such people at least so the conference participants believed "a number of subjects subsumed under the subject of national security are looked down on or ignored by academia " said josiah bunting a retired officer and the president of the harry frank guggenheim foundation in his keynote address he contrasted the meager study of military history on university campuses with the shelves of barnes &amp noble which are "groaning" under the weight of books on military subjects mr bunting traces the current situation to the s with the retirement or death of the last college professors who served in world war ii "there was a much larger receptivity in that group toward military and strategic studies than in the generation that followed them " to revive that area of inquiry mr bunting recommends that patrons give money to a particular professorship or program that has a limited lifetime permanent endowments are likely to be misdirected another possible focus for philanthropy is the combating terrorism center based at west point itself started in february the center is headed by a military officer but most of the people who work there about in all are civilians specializing in everything from bioterrorism to intelligence gathering as mr smith explains the center can "serve as a bridge between the military and the academic community " it can for example thanks to its high security clearance "take documents that special operations has and translate them " walter p stern one of the conference participants told me that he was interested in giving money to the center "the resources are there in the private sector for this sort of thing " but arent the resources there in the public sector as well yes and no the defense department can spend millions of dollars on strategic studies but the national security council and other agencies in the white house are more likely to rely on reports coming in from outside scholars and analysts i asked one senior administration official who knew about the conference just how he would like to see philanthropists direct their money he offered a short list beginning with strategies for "the war of ideas in the war on terror " he wants some positive suggestions though "i could find you critiques of the way were conducting the war of ideas " ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor see related letter "letters to the editor how to fullfill a desire to sacrifice for the war" wsj may
