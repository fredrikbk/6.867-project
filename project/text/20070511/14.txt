cbot weighs options as futures exchange decides on a suitor other deals are likely chicago board of trade owner cbot holdings inc has an agreement to merge with its crosstown rival however the countrys oldest futures exchange has been weighing another offer and is expected to make a decision soon that the market believes will lead it to the other suitor the result could have an impact on the long list of other world wide exchange mergers and hoped for mergers that have exploded in recent months behind closed doors in recent days the cbots board has been weighing its two options the pact with chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc or an unsolicited bid from atlanta energy market intercontinentalexchange inc although the exact details of the deliberations arent known it is clear the cbot has a dilemma on its hands since mid march when ice launched its bid cme stock has fallen and ice shares have held steady ices all stock bid once valued closer to the cmes is now worth &# billion more than the cme making its offer hard to refuse analysts say the market impressed with ices fast growing trading volumes and concerned that the cme deal wont clear antitrust review without painful concessions has embraced the ice offer in a nod to the frenzied speculation about the two offers the chicago electronic u s futures exchange launched a contract with which traders can speculate on the likelihood of each deal happening ice has the edge trading yesterday showed that an ice cbot combination had a chance of happening by early december compared with a chance for a cme board of trade deal thats a big shift from the nearly odds traders were giving to a cme deal three weeks ago the chicago merc can still improve its cbot bid if the board of trade declares the ice bid superior but with ices stock riding high "the cme wont get the deal done" unless ices stock loses ground or the merc sweetens its offer predicts richard repetto an analyst with sandler oneill the cbot developments come amid speculation on both sides of the atlantic about what exchange will be next to merge last month germanys deutsche boerse ag clinched a deal to buy international securities exchange holdings inc a new york based options exchange for &# billion in april new york stock exchange parent nyse group merged with europes euronext nv to form a trans atlantic exchange known as nyse euronext nasdaq stock market inc recently failed in its bid to snag the london stock exchange and has looked at omx ab a nordic technology provider and exchange operator "in the next three to five years it is difficult to imagine you wont see more exchange consolidation " said andrew mitchell a london based analyst with brokerage firm fox pitt kelton mr mitchell said it makes sense as exchanges look to cut costs by combining trading platforms and cutting staff and because combining with another exchange makes it easier to sell each others securities to a bigger audience all eyes are on chicago with an announcement from the cbot expected by market watchers any day if the merc wins fast growing ice could become a target for a large exchange like nyse euronext which has said it would like to increase its presence in the u s derivatives markets where products that derive their value from something else like currencies are traded if ice wins the cbot chicago merc could look to do a deal with an exchange like new york mercantile exchange parent nymex holdings inc an energy and metals market that would help it diversify into new products and cut costs the stakes are high because the global business of derivatives investment contracts based on everything from how many hurricanes will hit the gulf coast next year to the chances of interest rates going higher has grown by about a year for the past four years last year the value of those financial contracts exceeded &# trillion according to the bank for international settlements the old fashioned stock and bond markets pale in comparison totaling about &# trillion and &# trillion respectively asked about the ice premium a cme spokeswoman wrote in an email "ours is the better long term strategic proposition " she said cme officials were ready to implement their deal quickly because they "have the clearing and technology scale to accommodate cbot volumes " ice has said that while smaller than cme it has a record of integrating deals successfully some cbot shareholders are growing impatient for a better offer from the merc "were the diamond in the rough and the only one that doesnt realize it is the cme " said larry dorf a cbot shareholder and former broker in the exchanges treasury note pit he said the cmes resistance to sweetening its offer smacks of "arrogance " regulators have been looking into derivatives and futures trading to determine whether the cme merger proposal could hurt consumers and investors many wall street brokerage firms have expressed concern that a chicago merc cbot merger would give them a near monopoly on futures trading and make it easy for the combined company to raise fees cme has countered that investment banks may be motivated by protecting their own trading profits and that the cbot cme merger isnt a monopoly when you look at things globally but ices stock performance makes it an uphill battle for the cme since ices bid march its stock is up while cmes is down ice is also willing to give cbot a bigger share of their combined company bringing the value of the ice bid to about &# billion or &# billion more than the current &# billion value of the cme bid meanwhile deutsche boerses next move is also up for debate the recently announced ise purchase established the frankfurt exchange as a global derivatives player but the firms ability to do more deals could be constrained by its own shareholders new york based hedge fund atticus capital lp which controls at least of deutsche boerse told the company it was "furious" about what it called the "value destructive" deal some insiders are wondering whether atticus could push for a breakup of deutsche boerse which has a number of units that could be chopped up or a sale to firms like nyse euronext or the chicago merc still with a market value of billion euros &# billion deutsche boerse is one of the worlds largest exchange operators making it difficult to swallow in any deal furthermore any deal that involves the lucrative derivatives trading platform eurex is complicated by the need to get consent of swx groups swx swiss exchange
