trying to minimize a lot of the buzz about blackberrys users are finding they are source of interference move away from speakers while the rev bill wiseman was delivering a sermon at his church in owasso okla a few weeks ago he heard a buzz coming through the speaker system slyly careful not to lose his train of thought he felt his way through six layers of episcopalian vestments to the bottom of his pants pocket so he could silence the culprit his treo wireless email device he had forgotten to turn it off "youve got all these words youve practiced and the timing is just right and all of a sudden this wah wah comes out the loudspeaker and you know its you " says mr wiseman "it looks like youre trying to scratch yourself during the sermon and thats not very appealing " hand held email devices are well known to cause woes ranging from wounded thumb tendons to strained marriages add to all that the aggravating hum emanating from stereos alarm clocks and public address systems when the devices are in close proximity to them the noise is known in some circles as "blackberry buzz " the mosquitolike noise happens when the electrical circuitry of a phone or other electronic device converts cellphone radio waves into audio waves this happens specifically with a type of wireless technology that transmits data in a series of pulses that cause the buzzing sound the noise occurs more often with smartphones like blackberrys than it does with regular cellphones because smartphones talk to cellular base stations more often in sending and receiving emails as well as calls a community of fed up users of blackberrys treos and other wireless email hand held devices is emerging rallying against the buzz that interrupts business meetings conference calls courtroom proceedings congressional hearings and sleep in the hopes of avoiding interference with speakerphones or amplification systems some hold their devices under the table at meetings and conferences others move them away from alarm clocks and baby monitors to block the buzz some have bought thicker cases for their devices or improvised aluminum foil shielding one user described removing the back cover of the device spraying it with lacquer and sprinkling on a layer of metal shavings in public settings the buzz culprits are often ashamed and try to surreptitiously silence the offending noise while attending a panel discussion with the cast of the tv show "everybody hates chris" in los angeles recently grant cohen couldnt resist pulling out his blackberry email device for a peek at incoming mail but mr cohen who is years old and works for a technology start up unfortunately was sitting next to a gigantic speaker and sent the buzzing across the entire audio system causing hundreds of people in the audience to cringe "i immediately thought shoot " says mr cohen who shoved the device back in his pocket so as not to give his indiscretion away "i was terribly embarrassed " rev wiseman who doubles as a political consultant and is known for writing the first lethal injection legislation as a state lawmaker has found his own solution he switches off his device when the buzz infiltrates his ipod speakers during marriage counseling sessions some people in search of a technical solution to the buzz have turned to chat groups online to seek advice and trade tips "are there any kind of shielded cases gloves out there can i wrap it in tinfoil anything " one user with the screen name "aklaum" asked on a consumer web site called blackberryforums com one response was from mark kimmey who says the noise got so bad on his telephone headset that he wrapped a piece of aluminum foil around his device which sits on his office desk for the most part it worked but he hasnt bothered to duplicate the system at home and still sometimes gets a hum "ive learned not to place it too close to my speakers on my desk at home " says mr kimmey a software consultant in new york at the consulting firm parsons brinckerhoff inc the solution may ultimately lie in software rather than hardware han lin a year old ph d student in electrical engineering at the university of cambridge in england was so frustrated with the noise that he came up with software that corrects the buzz the "ar template interpolator " as he calls it is a piece of software that can be downloaded to a computer or to another mobile device when connected to loudspeakers the interpolator captures a print of the cellphones radio pulse creates an opposing pulse of the same size and injects the opposing pulse to the speaker system by the time the original signal from the cellphone travels to the speaker the speaker has registered the opposing pulse and the noise is filtered out the idea hasnt gone beyond lab testing so far says mr lin "i think there is a definite need for a solution " says mr lin who studies audio restoration methods for wireless audio applications in cambridges signal processing and communications laboratory "the noise is not easy to ignore " phone makers say that the problem arises when electronic equipment converts a cellphone radio signal into an electrical signal its particularly pronounced with phones that use the worlds most prominent wireless technology called gsm global system for mobile communications gsm phones transmit at a hertz pulse rate an audible frequency when the electrical signal is picked up by a loudspeaker it becomes acoustic noise blackberry maker research in motion ltd says the company is aware of the problem jim balsillie rims co chief executive officer concedes he experiences buzz himself from time to time "ive definitely learned that whenever i give a speech i should for sure shut it off " he says adding that he has noticed that the intensity of the noise varies according to which model blackberry he carries a rim spokeswoman says the noise is unavoidable because rim designs its radio transmissions to carrier specifications and regulatory requirements the company predicts the problem will disappear eventually as telephone speaker and alarm clock makers improve the shielding in their products until then rims advice for users just move the devices farther away from each other david cowan a managing partner of silicon valley firm bessemer venture partners is bothered by the hum in his car radio when he goes for a drive with his blackberry but he thinks there is a plus to all this noise "in meeting rooms with a speakerphone " he says "the horrible buzz forces blackberry users to turn off their devices and pay attention to the discussion "
