sitting out chicagos olympic bid mcdonalds ties to games prevent it from backing hometown as host in few companies could benefit more from chicago hosting the olympics than mcdonalds corp having the games near its headquarters would give the company with longtime olympic ties an even more prominent role in the global marketing extravaganza theres just one problem mcdonalds is a top sponsor of the olympics and the international olympic committee prohibits top sponsors from supporting any individual city in its effort to clinch the games so while kraft foods inc aon corp boeing co sara lee corp and several other large companies based in and around chicago have contributed money to help the citys bid mcdonalds with headquarters in suburban oak brook cant give cash or otherwise use its considerable resources to help the citys effort "we have to treat this as an arms length relationship " mcdonalds chief executive jim skinner said in an interview "we dont have the ability to single out the city of chicago " but because of the fast food chains deep connection to chicago and the olympics several people with close ties to mcdonalds are among a circle of influential chicagoans working to win the bid mcdonalds chairman andrew mckenna is co chairman of the fund raising for chicagos olympic bid committee mike roberts who left the no spot at mcdonalds in august is using his experience attending at least five olympic games for mcdonalds to persuade other companies to back chicagos bid and in march mr skinner attended a chicago olympic fund raiser where tables sold for as much as &# as mr mckennas guest other mcdonalds executives were there too olympic officials say those things dont break any rules and a mcdonalds spokesman said the company hasnt contributed any money to chicagos bid effort while the ioc rules require mcdonalds to maintain "neutrality" in the city selection they dont prevent individuals affiliated with the company from acting on their own behalf to support a bid a usoc spokesman said for mcdonalds the rules "put them in a little bit of a tight spot " said gordon kane a marketer for the chicago bid committee "as much as wed love to run out and do mcdonalds olympic french fries with the olympics logos " mr kane said that would not "be in the best interest of the bid " chicago which last month beat out los angeles as the u s olympic committees entry in the summer sweepstakes will compete against a handful of other cities that are expected to include madrid prague rio de janeiro rome and tokyo the ioc will vote to pick a winner in with mr mckennas help the chicago bid committee has raised more than &# million as well as donations of services valued at more than &# million mr mckenna referred questions about his involvement in the bid to mr skinner who said that having mcdonalds chairman lead the fund raising doesnt violate the neutrality rules "hes doing that as a citizen of the city of chicago " mr skinner said because mr mckenna is one of chicagos most influential civic and athletic powerbrokers he has served as chairman of the chicago cubs and chicago white sox baseball teams and been a director of several local companies bid officials say he shouldnt be viewed as an ambassador for the golden arches "andy mckenna will be a valuable person " said jim scherr chief executive officer of the usoc "but not in his role with mcdonalds " patrick ryan chairman and ceo of the chicago committee said mcdonalds is "not involved in the bid at all " nonetheless people with close ties to the company are lending their support fred turner who helped mcdonalds grow from its first suburban chicago franchises and eventually became mcdonalds chief executive bought a table at the march fund raiser for chicagos bid mr turner holds the title of honorary chairman at mcdonalds mr roberts the former mcdonalds president was tapped by mr ryan last fall to join the bid effort because of his extensive olympic experience with the fast food chain mr roberts said he plans to encourage several dozen large companies with midwest headquarters to back chicagos bid by explaining the "transformational moment for a company and its brand" that an olympic affiliation can create he said in an interview one example hes citing is how mcdonalds has brought crew members from around the world to work at its olympic village restaurants mcdonalds formal ties to the olympics date to when the company air lifted hamburgers to u s athletes in grenoble france the chain has been an official sponsor of the games since and mr skinner said he anticipates mcdonalds will be a top sponsor of the games he declined to say how much mcdonalds spends on its olympic sponsorship although four year top olympic sponsorships are estimated to sell for &# million or more among other things top sponsorship allows mcdonalds to use the olympic rings in its marketing and to feed athletes as the official restaurant of the games coca cola co found itself in a situation similar to mcdonalds when atlanta bid for the summer games there was intense speculation in the media that the beverage maker helped lure the games to its hometown a coke spokesman says the company adhered to its neutrality requirement as a sponsor and didnt help atlanta win the games however coke bottlers which are separate entities have pitched in to help cities with olympic bids the spokesman says mr scherr the usoc chief executive said he doesnt think chicagos bid is at any disadvantage because mcdonalds is prohibited from officially supporting it to broaden their fund raising bid committee officials are positioning a chicago olympics as a "midwest" olympics and encouraging big companies with headquarters in the region to back these games since chicago may be the closest the olympics ever get to them "theyre probably not coming to detroit anytime soon " mr kane said mcdonalds officials say that in addition to being bound by the sponsorship neutrality rules the company wouldnt back an individual city because it has restaurants in all of the other cities are expected to be vying for the games "were a global company " mr skinner said "we happen to be housed in chicago " arches and rings highlights of mcdonalds involvement with the olympics  mcdonalds airlifts hamburgers to u s athletes in france after they reported being homesick for them  the chain becomes
