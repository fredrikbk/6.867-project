the evening wrap time machinations online edition baghdad and washington are eight hours apart but even more time zones separate the government of iraq and congressional democrats when it comes to just how long they want american troops to remain in iraq speaking to students at cambridge university in england iraqi president jalal talabani said that he believes u s and british troops should remain in his country for another one to two years and asked that congress reconsider votes to set a deadline for the withdrawal "i think within one or two years we will be able to recruit our forces and prepare our armed forces and tell goodbye to our friends " he said adding "we hope that congress will review this decision and help the american army to stay until the iraqi army will be able to replace them and to protect the security of iraq " last night house republicans shot down a measure that would demand that the pentagon start to redeploy troops within days and have most of them out of the country entirely in six months nevertheless patience with the war and with iraqs government is in shrinking supply around washington a fact that president bush seemed to acknowledge yesterday when he said that hes willing to accept benchmarks to measure iraqs progress but democrats arent backing down and last evening they passed legislation that would release war money in two installments the first provides enough money for only a few more months of combat the second packet would be released in july after congress can assess conditions in iraq mr talabani said that iraq is doing its best "to have real political achievement in reconciliation" and that western media have exaggerated the violence in his country "there is no danger of civil war " said mr talabani a kurd but at the same time violence in iraq was continuing a pair of suicide car bombers killed at least people and damaged two bridges in baghdad american forces have been working to root out the car bombing networks

another nine military officials said that al qaeda linked sunni groups have been trying to provoke counterattacks from shiite militias that are laying low in an effort to avoid confrontations with american soldiers amid the security sweep in baghdad the bridges in the capital have been an appealing target for terror attacks and the attacks have continued despite new checkpoints and the requirement that large trucks be thoroughly searched before crossing the massive influx of american muscle in baghdad may also be flushing some violence into other areas and maj gen benjamin r mixon the commanding officer in northern iraq said that he didnt have enough boots on the ground for his mission in diyala province diyala is northeast of baghdad and it has seen an increase in violence since the security crackdown in the capital got started earlier this year the u s has also been taking higher casualties in the region six soldiers were killed there last weekend when their vehicle was destroyed by a bomb and two other soldiers died there this week in separate incidents gen mixon said the iraqi government has been too slow in deploying what he called the "most powerful weapon" against the insurgents that is a government that can provide adequate services for its people gen mixon has already received extra troops and has stepped up his offensive against militants but he
