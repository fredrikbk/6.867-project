whats so bad about murdochs offer i am somewhat amused at the reactions of readers who are dismayed at the prospect of a takeover of dow jones &amp co by rupert murdoch and who have threatened to cancel their subscriptions "readers react to the news that murdoch is at the journals gate " letters may why should anyone look at a possible takeover of dow jones any differently than the takeover of any other company if the journal believes that the market is the final arbiter then mr murdoch is telling the world that he can extract more value than what the current ownership and management is doing the company should have considered such a situation when it decided to seek public funds having gone public the only yardstick that one has to evaluate is the interest of the shareholders hari gopal philadelphia any customer so passionate in his belief that the journal needs to be saved from the clutches of mr murdoch should go into the market and buy every share he can afford in order to vote no on the proposed transaction it is highly duplicitous for any person to claim that the company needs to be saved at any cost without being willing to share personally in the &# billion financial sacrifice that a rejection of the deal would entail scott sipprelle new york a bunch of media elites are wringing their hands about how mr murdoch will destroy the journalistic integrity of the journal because he tends to actively manage his business since when is it bad for the owner of a company to be actively involved the only real complaint any of these people really have regarding the sale is the center right political leanings of mr murdoch and instead of being honest about it they try to sugar coat it with concerns about a decline in journalistic integrity as a relatively new subscriber to the journal i enjoy reading the paper each day should the bancrofts do the right thing i look forward to reading the journal over a cup of coffee as i watch the financial news on the fox business channel alan williams elko minn
