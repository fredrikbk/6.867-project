true believers health claims by sales force boost supplement firm mannatechs products attract the gravely ill disclaimers on labels when doctors found a tumor in angie mchenrys bowel in the spring of they told her that her cervical cancer had become terminal but her uncle stephan huffman gave her some hope mr huffman a retired high school teacher is a sales associate for mannatech inc a publicly traded company that markets vitamins and nutritional supplements he and his wife persuaded ms mchenry to swallow each day mannatech tablets and six scoopfuls of the companys ambrotose a derivative of aloe vera and larch tree bark "he said it would knock the cancer away " recalled ms mchenry a coldwater ohio mother of three in an interview last month "i would go into full remission he said he had seen proof in other people " mannatech based in coppell texas relies on an army of enthusiastic consumers of its nutritional supplements to sell the products to family friends and others these sellers are unsalaried but receive commissions and bonuses from the company based in part on their recruitment of other sellers some of them make sweeping claims about the power of mannatech products to provide relief from serious diseases in the eight years since mannatech went public several questions have loomed large for company executives and board members are nonemployee salespeople pushing its products in ways that violate food and drug administration guidelines and how far should mannatech go in policing its free lance sales force about half of mannatechs supplements the company says contain nutritional sugars it calls "glyconutrients " the body needs simple sugars but some scientists say there is no proof that sugar supplements provide health benefits mannatech say its glyconutrient mixture called ambrotose "supports the immune system " because none of the products are approved by the fda for the treatment of disease it isnt legal for anyone to market them as such mr huffman who sold &# of mannatech products to ms mchenry says he doesnt recall telling her they would "knock her cancer away " he adds though that "in many instances " ambrotose "encapsulates the cancer " ms mchenry consumed the tablets and powder for two weeks last year she said until nausea made them difficult to swallow and her oncologist persuaded her to quit mr huffman says he returned her &# to alleviate hard feelings ms mchenry died on april "nobody is claiming these products by themselves are providing a treatment for disease " says mannatech chairman and chief executive sam caster one of the companys founders mr caster identifies himself as a christian and some customers are drawn to the company for that reason he and his wife linda refer to mannatech as a blessing and say god spoke through her to give him the idea for the company many top salespeople share their religious beliefs marshall howard a salesman who says hes a christian recently told hundreds of associates at a gathering that they were "chosen" people in the "glorious mission of mannatech to change hundreds of thousands of lives " such fervor is visible when mannatech devotees many of them nonsalaried sales associates gather for an annual company sponsored event called mannafest at this years gathering a four day affair held in dallas in march at least people came on stage one night to testify that after taking mannatech products they recovered or found relief from conditions ranging from paralysis to tumors to lesions another people said they took glyconutrients and found relief from afflictions such as leukemia arthritis cystic fibrosis down syndrome and cancer mr caster says the consumer testimonials are perfectly legal because none use the words "cure " "treat" or "mitigate" in referring to diseases mannatech product labels which are reviewed by the fda state that the products are "not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease " mr caster says that message is repeated frequently during conference calls with associates he says he and the company abide by all laws and train associates to do the same nevertheless scrutiny of the companys marketing has been increasing the federal trade commission has logged at least complaints about mannatech since alleging deception making false health claims and improper sales practices the ftc has brought no action after reports about the companys sales tactics caused its stock to drop in shareholders filed lawsuits in state and federal courts several have been consolidated as a federal class action in dallas federal court it alleges that executives knew about and ignored improper health claims by employees and salespeople and that mr caster overruled recommendations by the companys regulatory compliance committee to discipline big sellers who made such claims mr caster says the company has fined some associates as much as &# and has terminated some for making improper claims "does something like this ever get away from us " he says "well of course those are the types of things that were out there looking for and that well catch " he says the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation the texas attorney generals office indicated in a memo last october that it had been investigating mannatech for possible health law violations since the memo reviewed by the wall street journal said the state "anticipated filing suit against" mannatech for alleged violations including "unproven health claims " to date the attorney general has taken no action a spokesman for the attorney general declined to comment mannatechs vitamins powders and capsules arent sold in any stores the company sells them over the internet and through a large sales force of free lancers it has no salaried sales force companies whose salespeople are independent and are paid based on their own sales and those of other sellers they directly and indirectly recruit are known as "multilevel marketers " mannatech has more than active sales associates arrayed in a hierarchy mannatech pays commissions to associates based on the purchases of the associates they recruit and others down the line from them to be eligible for financial bonuses an associate must buy &# in mannatech products each month top mannatech associates have earned as much as &# million a year according to compensation information shared with associates at mannafest books home and beauty products and cleaning materials have long been peddled in this fashion these days so are many nutritional supplements multilevel marketers accounted for &# billion of &# billion in sales of dietary supplements in says grant ferrier editor of nutrition business journal mr caster helped start mannatech in months later congress passed the dietary supplement health and education act under that law makers of dietary supplements arent currently required to document that their products are safe or effective but it bars them from claiming without fda approval that any product can treat cure or prevent illness mannatech went public in and sales have grown steadily last year mannatech earned &# million on sales of &# million compared with &# million earned in on sales of &# million early on mr caster and his wife turned to friends and prayer partners to sell products and recruit other salespeople according to ms casters self published book "undeniable destiny " steven barker a professor of veterinary medicine at louisiana state university who served as a mannatech director from to said the board was concerned about religious influence on marketing "people would become overzealous and start making claims that this was manna and it had miraculous properties that it was gods gift " says mr barker "sam is a very religious individual and he would listen to people making claims they thought were miraculous the board wanted him to tone it down they didnt want it to become a revival some kind of ultrareligious event " roger e beutner a retired engineer who served on the board until says "exaggerated" claims about product benefits made some directors uncomfortable co founder charles "skip" fioretti then chairman and chief executive of mannatech worried that the fda could take action on unproven claims says mr barker in addition there was tension between messrs caster and fioretti over business issues in the board removed mr caster as president after what he says was a clash of values with mr fioretti mr caster became co chairman but quit weeks later mr fioretti did not return calls seeking comment mr casters supporters were upset according to mr barker and mr caster returned as a director within weeks mr caster says he made it clear that he and his wife intended to talk about their faith when speaking about the company eventually more of his supporters joined the board and by mr fioretti had left mr caster became chairman and later chief executive these days god and the bible are mentioned frequently by some sales associates during meetings and conference calls at this years mannafest one associate led a training workshop called "leadership lessons from moses " which used quotes from exodus at "leadership skills from a biblical perspective " associate dottie anderson described "jesus as the first network marketer " to sell the products many associates rely on testimonials and case histories at mannatech conferences h reginald mcdaniel a dallas area pathologist and the companys former medical director sells various reports containing case histories he says he has chronicled hundreds of cases of patients with cancer parkinsons disease allergies and cystic fibrosis whose health improved and some whose symptoms disappeared after taking glyconutrients "id be derelict if i implied everyone with an improved diet gets a turnaround in health yet a significant number do " he says during the "testimonials" program at this years mannafest a mother showed slides of her two sons in hospital beds after taking glyconutrients she said they are now free of brain seizures a young man walked to the microphone and told the crowd that he had been paralyzed from a car crash before taking ambrotose jordan scott a wan year old from lubbock texas said that when she was a toddler cystic fibrosis frequently left her choking on mucus and battling lung infections she began taking glyconutrients she said and she can now play the oboe and she placed third at a cross country meet "a doctor said i have the lungs of a healthy child " she said sobbing and thanking god as the audience applauded mr caster says mannatech products are "not a cure for cystic fibrosis i think dietary supplements can improve the quality of life " "i have never ever said" that testimonials "should substitute for science " mr caster says health benefits reported by users he says help "guide us in our research " mannatech says it is conducting studies on the benefits of using its products some researchers says they doubt that ambrotose offers any health benefits hudson freeze who studies complex carbohydrates as a professor of glycobiology at the burnham institute for medical research in la jolla calif contends the body cant digest ambrotose because humans lack the enzymes necessary to break down the plant fibers it contains into simple sugars mannatech has said it has completed a study that shows the body can break down glyconutrients and that it is slated for publication in the journal of alternative and complementary medicine the journals managing editor barbara nell perrin says it will publish an abstract of the study that will not be peer reviewed mannatech associates often post messages on web sites including the mannashare forum on yahoo com seeking tips on selling mannatech products to people with specific afflictions including cocaine addiction hemophilia and down syndrome "if anyone anywhere has any information studies testimonies anything on glyconutrients and esophageal cancer please e mail it to me " mannatech associate joan francis of batavia n y wrote in january on one forum after her father had been diagnosed with the disease after posting the message ms francis says she consulted with several doctors who recommended amounts of mannatech glyconutrients to take dr mcdaniel the companys former medical director was

health services periodically reviews mannatechs product labels and promotional materials among other things cynthia culmo a former director who oversaw mannatech inspections says that recommending ambrotose to treat a disease or specifying dosage amounts beyond the guidance given on the label are "likely" violations of federal law mr caster says he did not know about web sites that suggest dosage amounts for the desperately ill the web sites can be seductive jackie wells a nurse in new mexico was diagnosed last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the degenerative nerve disease that
