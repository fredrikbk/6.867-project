weekend journal review books tvs go go years get a closeup billion dollar kiss by jeffrey stepakoff gotham pages &# sometime during my first month as a writer for "cheers" then one of the biggest hits in television history my boss took me aside to give me some advice i was years old my job essentially was to sit on a sofa all day with the funniest people in the world and make jokes plus lunch was free my bosss advice was simple never never tell people how much money you make for doing this it would only lead to resentment he said and maybe violent revolution jeffrey stepakoffs "billion dollar kiss" violates my old bosss rule he tells us in pretty excruciating detail exactly what he made during his years as a staff writer and producer on some of televisions biggest shows including "dawsons creek" and "the wonder years " he also tells us what a lot of other people made too halfway through the book he lists about two dozen writers and tells the reader how much each was paid and for how long during televisions go go years to the low person on this platinum plated totem pole was alexa junge a writer producer for "friends " who made &# million for two years work the top of the pile phil rosenthal executive producer of "everybody loves raymond " who made &# million for four years mr stepakoff also tells us what he bought with the money nice houses a ghurka bag a mazda miata "one of the first ones in the country " he tells us "which was a very big deal in los angeles " he ate well too great spots like michaels and chinois on main and took some cool trips "mud baths at two bunch palms swim up blackjack at the trop tubs of iced coronitas on the beach in huatulco " look the guy worked hard was paid well enjoyed himself no crime there right i certainly didnt think so when i was savoring my own version of the hollywood good life im not so sure about mr stepakoff he hit the jackpot and seems chagrined as it happens im in this book its not a big deal just about every writer producer from the s that i can think of is in mr stepakoffs exhaustingly thorough memoir but it was vaguely disconcerting to learn that he and i shared an agent ate at the same restaurants have the same ghurka bag and lived parallel lives but have wildly different perspectives on the business that has treated us both so well "billion dollar kiss" presents itself as a morality tale though its not quite clear what the moral would be the closest mr stepakoff comes to telling us is when he writes "while my colleagues and i were all beneficiaries of one of the greatest run ups in corporate america what was essentially the leveraging of hollywood i came to believe that the overall effect this had on the business had ultimately been to hurt the product we all loved so much " in his mind the "the true golden era of television" began in the s when "the supremacy of the writer and the competitive spirit of the independent production companies" reigned the era ended in the late s he tells us with the dawn of "a new era the age of the conglomerate " mr stepakoff buttresses this gloomy assessment with lots of talk about writers guild of america contract wrangles and the relaxation of television studio ownership rules as if there was something intrinsically wrong about the television business in the s as if the combination of media mergers deregulation newly profitable demographic slices and general hysteria over the success of "seinfeld" on nbc and in syndication created something more sinister and ominous than what was lets face it a bubble it doesnt matter what business youre in really bubbles happen bubbles burst thats what they do which brings to mind the second piece of advice my boss gave me all those years ago after telling me to keep my salary to myself save your money he said this will all come to an end someday come to an end it did about half a dozen years ago the money train began to squeak the brakes hissed salaries contracted and fewer deals were made the ones that sneaked through tended to be in figures that we out here in los angeles call "the high sixes" rather than the "mid sevens " there are as many reasons for this as there are writers sitting around starbucks complaining mr stepakoff fingers media conglomeration but ive heard that it was the internet many folks blame reality television mr stepakoff compares working in television during the big money years with one of those game shows where a contestant is in a glass booth filled with cash and they turn on a giant fan the trick is to stuff as much cash as possible into your pockets before the fan is turned off on some level of course thats always the trick no matter who you are or what you do to mr stepakoff though its a bit more dark "this is what it felt like to be working in television in hollywood at this time " he writes "except none of us knew that the machine would soon be turned off " you sort of expect a music cue there duhn duhn duhn duhn its worth noting that there are roughly twice as many networks buying original material now than there were a dozen years ago its worth noting that even if broadcast network television seems as drab and canned as mr stepakoff complains cable television even free cable television is a great place for fresh fun programming reality television which every decent screenwriter in hollywood would join mr stepakoff in loathing is still a relatively limited item on network schedules occupying roughly the same real estate that variety programs did or years ago the truth is this is a great time to be a television writer there are more places and more opportunities to do your stuff there just isnt as much money a naturally occurring phenomenon when opportunity meets competition margins get squeezed fat gets cut rich studio deals get slimmed down everybody works harder which is a pain let me tell you i get paid an embarrassing fraction of what i used to get paid but i still do ok thanks for asking the problem with mr stepakoffs book is that he seems to forget that its show business its crazy but its supposed to be crazy id accept the morality tale pomposity if we were talking about say the heart stent business or the world peace business but its hard to gin up the proper amount of cluck clucking dismay when were talking about you know "dawsons creek " dont misunderstand me "dawsons creek" was a good show im not in the target demo but i caught it a few times and it was well written and well acted in fact the best parts of "billion dollar kiss" are all about "dawsons creek " the books title refers to a writers idea to have two of the teenage characters kiss which produced a love triangle storyline increased the shows popularity and led to a lavish syndication deal mr stepakoff knows how to spin a great story about the frantic crisis atmosphere of television production and his deft compact sketches of individual moments on the "dawsons creek" staff are worth the price of the book alone we see producer alex gansa squeezing "an odd device that he brought to work with him a batchler sheep castrator " when forced to take calls from the "increasingly freaked out" series star james van der beek during the shows troubled third season the actors were in rebellion over new storylines a freelancer heidi ferrer is brought in and told to help develop an underutilized female character but when she pitches her script over a speakerphone to the network and studio shes met with silence save for an executive who cuts her off saying he doesnt want to hear about the character using an obscenity to describe her ms ferrer bursts into tears and runs out of the room "i never saw her again " mr stepakoff writes but "dawsons creek " arriving in was too late for mr stepakoffs "true golden era" or "second golden age" of television then again it could be argued that with shows like "the wire " "house" and "the office" on the air now this is the golden age of television a golden age i guess is in the eye of the paycheck holder mr long a former writer for the tv series "cheers " is the author most recently of "set up joke set up joke" bloomsbury see related letter "letters to the editor someone cried and ran it certainly wasnt me" wsj may
