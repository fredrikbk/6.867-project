weekend journal review film lohan fonda upstaged by bird in georgia rule smarmy comedy grates lively weeks later riffs on zombie genre certain words should be reserved for special occasions abysmal is one of them and "georgia rule" is as special as such occasions get think first of a script that combines the tortured family relationships of "long days journey into night" with a variant of the shattering accusation in "the childrens hour " then imagine if you can the story played mainly for laughs as a smarmy disjointed sex farce with lindsay lohan as just the sort of out of control child woman that recent stories and rumors have painted her to be if nothing else this film is a triumph of atonality its not that they got the tone wrong there isnt a trace of consistent tone from start to finish at the start which plays like a trailer no flesh just melodramatic bones ms lohans rachel is being forcefully relocated from san francisco to small town idaho by her desperate alcoholic mother lily felicity huffman lilys plan is for the seductive poly addictive and chronically wayward teenager to spend the summer in a kind of single camper boot camp run by her grandmother georgia shes a strict god fearing tough loving idahoan played by jane fonda ms fondas performance is dislikable but "georgia rule" is a veritable pantheon of unpleasant performances no one escapes unscathed except for georgias pet canary who chirps cheerfully on cue but may have been computer generated the movie was shot by karl walter lindenlaub a fine cinematographer whose presumably rich images have been washed out by the magic of studio overlighting the clumsy title derives from georgias principles of conduct and personal philosophy "everybodys savable thats the rule " she declares though her granddaughter threatens to be the exception that demolishes the rule were supposed to be amused i think by the boundary free excursions of rachels id when she meets a virginal young local who is planning to become a mormon missionary she makes it her mission to seduce him the movies vaguely derisive attitude toward mormons is all the more surprising since the screenwriter mark andrus is himself an idaho mormon born and bred when rachel meets an older man who has lost his wife and child she seeks to seduce him in the spirit of lay therapy "georgia rule " which was directed by garry marshall peddles shopworn principles of intra family therapy its all about healing reconciliation and forgiveness in the familys bosom still theres no reconciling the relentless comedy with the darkness of the content in reality unacknowledged though it may be rachel and her mother arent just distressed theyve been poisoned by a river of toxic emotions that flow from georgia the bright eyed matriarch who makes all the rules and rachel herself isnt just a hard case she is or would be were she portrayed honestly a scary sociopath who tosses off with equal abandon truths that may be lies and lies that may be truths sound like fun you cant imagine  weeks later theres no better fun for movie lovers than a small unheralded film that turns out to be terrific unless its a small unheralded sequel that trumps the original such is the case with " weeks later " which comes four years after " days later " the brilliant riff on zombie flicks that danny boyle directed from a script by alex garland in that earlier example of what might be called genre hop a movie that transcends its humble origins london was ravaged by what came to be called the rage virus a primate disease that once unloosed on homo sapiens turned healthy human beings into crazed ravening monsters that description may cover other groups including paparazzi and teenagers grounded for the weekend but its the classic definition of zombies the new movie begins six months later when the city is supposedly free of the disease heh heh and u s army troops are repatriating londoners to a smallish green zone in the central city thats been cleared of rotting corpses and tidied up quite nicely why the tommies arent there to help with this task is unclear but no matter because the yanks among them snipers on rooftops go about their appointed tasks with courteous efficiency until the rage virus re emerges and all hell breaks loose again this is not after all a remake of "dr ehrlichs magic bullet " in which edward g robinson finds a cure for syphillis its an action thriller focused classically on a small band of brave survivors who struggle to remain survivors until the zombies subside and sanity not to mention sanitation is restored at the same time its a thrilling display of virtuosity on a modest scale the director this time is juan carlos fresnadillo working from a screenplay he wrote with rowan joffe jesus olmo and enrique lopez lavigne the script is occasionally less than logical but rarely less than exciting until now mr fresnadillo has been known outside his native spain mainly for "esposados " an oscar nominated short from and for the feature "intacto " an allusive elusive and stylish meditation on luck and love this will change dramatically however for genre hop applies to filmmakers too mr fresnadillo is not only ready for prime time but as of now in the midst of it he works exceptionally well with his excellent cast and tells his story with spellbinding skill thats complemented by enrique chediaks stunning cinematography the cast includes robert carlyle catherine mccormack jeremy renner rose byrne and playing brother and sister as if born to charm the camera young imogen poots and younger mackintosh muggleton " weeks later" doesnt depend on big moments but it isnt short of them the fire bomb cleansing of canary wharf a helicopter in wembley stadium an inspired helicopter chase a night vision venture into the underground and brace yourself for genuine horror when this one comes around a husband and wife making not so nice in a hospital isolation chamber dvd tip sidney lumets magnificent screen version of eugene oneills "long days journey into night" stars jason robards katharine hepburn ralph richardson dean stockwell and jeanne barr lindsay
