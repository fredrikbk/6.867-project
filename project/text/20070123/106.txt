executive charles o prince on the hot seat to deliver a quick rebound at the global financial giant yesterday citigroup removed sallie krawcheck as chief financial officer and strategy chief amid lackluster operating results at the company and growing unease among investors about her suitability for the job instead the year old ms krawcheck will run citigroups wealth management business which includes the smith barney brokerage unit a slightly enlarged version of the job she left about two years ago in that post ms krawcheck succeeds todd thomson whose ouster was announced yesterday the departure of mr thomson once a rising star and a disciple of former citigroup ceo sanford i weill came amid internal tension over his judgment and expenses including use of citigroups corporate jet people familiar with the matter said on one business trip in november for instance mr thomson flew with a group of citigroup employees to china and left them there to make their own flight arrangements home at the companys expense while he flew back on the corporate jet with maria bartiromo a cnbc correspondent one of these people said kevin goldman a cnbc spokesman said "she asked permission from cnbc she received it and payment was arranged " mr thomson who preceded ms krawcheck as citigroup cfo developed a reputation inside the company as a free spender and his citigroup office replete with a fish tank was known internally as the "todd mahal " mr thomson whose relations with mr prince had grown increasingly strained in recent months will "pursue other interests " citigroup said in a statement mr thomson said in a statement that he is "looking forward to exploring new challenges " the shake up comes as wall street increasingly questions the business model behind citigroup the worlds largest financial services firm by market value a global behemoth it contains a huge corporate and retail bank a major investment bank a big trading operation a brokerage firm and securities lending operations under one roof citigroups competitors including bank of america corp and goldman sachs group inc have achieved stronger earnings with more focused business strategies investors have grown increasingly frustrated with citigroups results and underperforming stock which is up since mr prince took the helm in well short of the increase in the dow jones wilshire index of u s bank stocks over the same period people inside and outside citigroup have questioned mr princes leadership during his tenure he has spent much of the time cleaning up regulatory issues faced by the company but has failed to significantly cut expenses or jump start the stock now after shifting the heads of major citigroup business units only his own people remain in the most senior executive ranks with mr thomsons departure mr prince has removed the remaining vestiges of his predecessor mr weill who built citigroup into a global powerhouse wall street gave the shake up a modest thumbs up sending citigroups stock up cents to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange in an interview mr prince said he removed ms krawcheck as cfo before naming a successor "to look at as full a slate of candidates as possible" for the job though he expressed support for her performance as for mr thomson he said only "todd is leaving because sallie is moving into his job " other citigroup executives declined to elaborate on the moves some investors have suggested that the latest shake up could presage a restructuring of citigroup a symbol of the modern era financial conglomerate that seeks synergies from its many operations that business model has gotten harder to pursue amid growing regulatory constraints and global competition particularly without a domineering leader such as mr weill this "may signal a split up " said douglas e kass a market bear and head of seabreeze partners management inc a palm beach fla financial firm that doesnt own citigroup shares citigroup executives repeatedly have dismissed notions that the company might break up its operations yesterday mr prince said "i think i have been pretty clear in my views about that " investors have been frustrated for months with citigroups lackluster results in core businesses like u s consumer banking on friday citigroup also reported disappointing results in its wall street operations last year citigroups net income from securities operations rose just rivals such as goldman lehman brothers holdings inc and merrill lynch &amp co saw profits rise or more driven largely by gains in their investment banking and trading businesses the latest shake up is the second in the past several weeks last month under pressure from shareholders mr prince selected robert druskin as citigroups chief operating officer mr prince has asked mr druskin a veteran citigroup executive who took over running the corporate and investment bank when mr prince became ceo to find big cost cuts at the company since mr druskins appointment citigroups shares have risen the shuffle is a chance for citigroup to bring "new blood" into the bank by tapping an outsider for the cfo post says james carroll a portfolio manager at loomis sayles &amp co in detroit "as a long term shareholder the worry that ive had is that theyve simply taken their eye off the ball i definitely want citigroup to go back to basics " says mr carroll mr prince has felt pressure from investors to replace ms krawcheck as cfo for months amid complaints that she couldnt handle the job some groused that ms krawcheck a former ceo of research firm sanford c bernstein &amp co had failed to successfully navigate the interest rate environment others have criticized citigroups strategy of internal growth and smaller acquisitions particularly in the u s where its credit card arm and retail bank have underperformed rivals ms krawcheck will remain cfo until a successor is found meantime mr druskin the chief operating officer will oversee the wealth management business which includes smith barney and the citigroup private bank after a strong fourth quarter with revenue up the wealth management unit contributed about of citigroups total revenue the unit has employees world wide about of the companys total mr prince called ms krawcheck over the weekend to offer her the wealth management post asked if she wanted to move to the new job ms krawcheck said "i wanted to when chuck asked me about it " ms krawcheck said she had enjoyed her time running smith barney and the chance to run the similar yet larger and more global wealth management division excited her mr thomsons exit comes after he had complained to others that citigroup had changed dramatically under mr prince it also follows the departure in march of year old michael carpenter the head of citigroups alternative investments group and one of the executives who helped mr weill create citigroup mr carpenter left to start his own financial venture mr thomsons sprawling th floor office in midtown manhattan with a view of central park created buzz inside the company at a time citigroup was seeking to make cutbacks for a joke a few executives with mr thomsons knowledge had business cards printed up for him with "todd mahal" emblazoned on them outside of work mr thomson drives a lamborghini sports car the spending at the new headquarters offices for the wealth management unit upset mr prince who remains under intense pressure to rein in expenses according to a person familiar with the matter
