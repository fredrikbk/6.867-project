politics &amp economics experienced dodd toils to win notice in bid never a rock star democrat is revered by partys activists washington at her first public event after declaring for president last weekend new york sen hillary clinton drew a horde of cameras and reporters for months before illinois sen barack obama got into the race fire marshals were turning fans away from his packed houses meanwhile another democratic hopeful connecticut sen chris dodd travels the country a year before the first nominating votes "hoping someone will show up " he quips mr dodds experiences are typical of the early days of a presidential campaign which often are humbling even demeaning for all but the rare clinton like celebrities and obama like phenomenons his colleague mr obama has been a senator for two years mrs clinton is starting her second term mr dodd has been in the senate for more than a quarter century and was in the house for six years before that he is chairman of the senate banking committee and he is an asterisk in early presidential polls yet ask many democratic activists whom theyd personally most like to see as president and mr dodds name comes up often including from some committed to other candidates notably mrs clinton frequently described as witty smart and one of the most qualified figures in the party mr dodd enjoys goodwill beyond washington from his mid s stint as national party chairman at the same time few of these democrats have been pressing him to run with voters as disgusted by washingtons partisan games as at any period in recent memory and seemingly hungry for a fresh face a man who has been in congress for a third of a century would be a hard sell democrats say so would a new england liberal even one with a business friendly record who has tangled with one of his partys most powerful interests trial lawyers meanwhile the competition includes the first viable female african american and hispanic new mexico gov bill richardson candidates each of whom excites segments of the liberal democratic base by the history making potential donna brazile al gores campaign manager who is neutral in the contest says of mr dodd "hes like everybodys big brother hes down to earth yet engaged in the nitty gritty " but she adds "personally i sometimes wish hed just stay in the senate in a field that contains so many rockstars i dont see how dodd will take a slice of the electorate " "i dont have any illusions about it " mr dodd says acknowledging his underdog status but he adds "the most important compass is your own " the son of a senator who was a prosecutor at the nuremberg nazi war crimes trials and himself a peace corps volunteer in the dominican republic at mr dodd says he no longer can stay in the senate "bleachers" with the country so tarnished in the eyes of the world "im not afraid of using military force " he says but the force of americas ideals around the globe have been squandered under the bush administration "ive got to try at this time because the nations situation is too worrisome to me " in politics it is a truism that timing is everything yet politicians have their own clocks as the contrast between the silver haired year old senator and the year old mr obama suggests mr obama has said he didnt intend to run the outpouring last fall at book signings for his second bestseller and the emergence of an internet draft spurred advisers to tell mr obama he had to seize the moment mr dodd on the other hand has been on the political scene so long that he can recall when one of his young campaign drivers was mark warner who went on to be virginias governor and last year explored a presidential campaign himself before deciding this wasnt his time likewise mr dodd has weighed and ruled out presidential bids before as evidenced by ebays recent offer of an old campaign button featuring a dark haired dodd in the past he says he believed being single was a liability especially given something of a playboy image or he had to defer when fellow connecticut sen joe lieberman was running or his washington experience was a disqualifier in years voters preferred outsiders now mr dodd is married the father of two young daughters and despite the current "obama mania" for his less seasoned colleague mr dodd argues that with the nation roiled by war terrorism and economic globalization he can persuade voters that his experience is an asset "certainly the last six years has reminded people that maybe maybe experience has value not that anyones ever really ready for this job " mr dodd says having voted in to authorize president bush to use force against iraq he now says congress and the nation were misled last week he proposed legislation to block mr bush from sending more troops without new congressional authorization as it happened the medias focus that day was on the antiwar moves of his democratic rivals sens clinton obama and joe biden of delaware mr biden has been a senator even longer than mr dodd since and faces some of the same doubts as he runs for president but as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee his foreign policy pronouncements grab greater attention mr dodd ranks just under mr biden on that committee and has been prominent in foreign policy debates for two decades in the s he was a main target for republicans attacks as he came to define the democratic opposition to the reagan administrations interventions in central americas conflicts he knows numerous world leaders and met with those in iraq syria jordan and israel last month the liberal gets credit for popular laws for workers family and medical leave child care and head start and testing of prescription drugs for children yet he has a moderate record on business issues reflecting connecticuts corporate presence in and the same years he was serving as president clintons chairman of the democratic party in the senate mr dodd was chief sponsor of two business measures that drew mr clintons vetoes and the wrath of his partys special interests the first was a bill to limit securities lawsuits that high technology companies wanted and trial lawyers didnt mr dodd got congress to override that clinton veto the second was a bill restricting product liability suits also opposed by trial lawyers mr clintons veto stood dark horse christopher dodd born may
