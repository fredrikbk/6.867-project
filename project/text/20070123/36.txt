dreamworks reboots for life beyond shrek in the summer of dreamworks animation skg inc s board held a retreat at the exclusive jackson hole wyo mountain resort the animation studio behind the "shrek" franchise had stumbled badly in its first few months as a publicly traded company and executives were under pressure to come up with a new game plan one of the boards conclusions was basic the company needed to make better movies while arch rival pixar animation studios was making one highly polished movie a year dreamworks was rushing to meet a more ambitious slate of two consequently dreamworks was suffering from a decidedly mixed track record outside of its flagship "shrek" movies so dreamworks has a new motto for its business going forward slow down the company has decided to add a year to the production of its films "weve been racing to the finish line and that has meant compromising on story telling sometimes " says dreamworks chief executive jeffrey katzenberg theres a strong financial incentive he adds "if we improve our box office performance by it adds &# million pre tax profit to the company " the studio has been making other changes too it has overhauled its top team after its problems in when it had to restate its earnings estimates twice because of miscalculating how many "shrek " dvds it would sell that episode resulted in an informal sec inquiry which was later dropped the glendale calif company also has has unified its production systems and streamlined its corporate structure the changes are important because as it stands dreamworks animation risks looking like a one trick pony whose only trick is the popular "shrek" franchise the third installment of which comes out in may two of its last three movies have required write downs including "flushed away " which cowen &amp co analyst lowell singer estimates could be as high as &# million there also is the realization that "shrek" may not last forever that has forced the company to think about developing other franchises a particularly difficult task at a time when a flood of animated films is hitting movie theaters many of them about cute talking animals this summer alone has "surfs up " about surfing penguins and "ratatouille " about a rats adventures in paris "i didnt realize how similar they were all going to be " says mr katzenberg who describes a moment a year ago when he was in a movie theater and sat through back to back trailers for several near identical animated movies "fortunately our next six or seven movies are unlike anything weve done before or anything anyone else is doing " the next months or so will bear out whether dreamworks animation can make the transition it has in mind despite the slower production schedule it still is aiming for one original movie and one sequel each year mr katzenberg says the studio is able to stick to its goal of two movies a year while also extending the production time because it had a "deep bench" of movies in development that is unlikely to include movies with its production partner aardman animations though with the two expected to break up this year after "flushed away " having put some of its early problems behind it mr katzenberg says the studio already is in better shape with a strong slate of movies after "shrek " it is releasing jerry seinfelds animation debut "bee movie " in november next year brings "kung fu panda" and "madagascar " to strike the jackpot of one sequel a year in the long term the studio needs at least three franchises running at any one time it currently has two "shrek" and "madagascar " dreamworks executives say "shrek" may have two movies left in it after no a fourth is already in the works for "madagascar" has been sketched out as a four chapter series with a third movie possible in either or the studio already has plans to keep those franchises alive in other ways it is planning a spin off of "shrek" called "puss in boots " based on the swashbuckling cat voiced by antonio banderas a "shrek" christmas tv special is in the works as well as a broadway musical for next year it also is developing a tv series with viacom inc s nickelodeon based on the penguins from "madagascar " but the real bucks are in feature films dreamworks president lew coleman says "what were really doing here is looking for sequels " while sequels are more expensive than the originals they are less risky and usually more successful he says because of the higher costs involved in luring back the talent sequels can cost anywhere from &# million to &# million versus &# million for an original movie among upcoming candidates for sequels the storyline of "bee movie " about a disillusioned bee doesnt particularly lend itself to a sequel executives say although mr seinfeld himself might prove to be an animation franchise "kung fu panda" does however the tale of an ancient chinese panda forced out of his armchair to learn kung fu to protect his village it is being released the year of the olympics in beijing in a show of confidence in the story dreamworks already plans to spin it off into a nickelodeon tv series sometime after the movie comes out dreamworks is working on two original movies for "monsters vs aliens" and "how to train your dragon " both potential franchises "monsters vs aliens" is b movie style comedy about a squad of monsters who emerge from a secret military base to save the planet "how to train your dragon" is based on the book by cressida cowell about the son of a viking who is on a mission to capture a dragon those two movies will be the first to fully benefit from the extra year of work which will stretch their production time to years mr katzenberg says the extra year will be spent largely on developing the story of its movies a relatively inexpensive exercise he notes that if they had had the extra time on movies like "madagascar " they could have worked on strengthening the final act which wasnt as sharp as the first two acts of the movie "weve been getting the job done but we felt we could do better if we had more time " mr katzenberg says "its a very small investment for a very high return "
