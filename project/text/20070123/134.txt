with foresight mayors around the world join to end nuclear war will be remembered as the year the world turned its back on nuclear weapons if so the remarkable jan editorial page commentary "a world free of nuclear weapons" by george p shultz henry a kissinger william j perry and sam nunn may be pinpointed as the day the great change began their joint piece is remarkable not so much for its content the list of those who have proposed essentially the same ideas could be extended far beyond the few excellent examples they cite but because of the evident determination to underscore the nonpartisan nature of their abolitionist stance steering the world away from nuclear catastrophe toward a nuclear free future is not and must never be a political ax used by one faction against another if humanity cannot unify behind this objective then hiroshima and nagasaki will not remain much longer the only two victims of nuclear attack it is important to recognize that support for the abolition of nuclear weapons is not the idiosyncratic position of a small circle a march ap poll demonstrated that the great majority of americans support global nuclear disarmament with the greatest respect i would like to offer the following constructive amendment to the above commentary i am president of an international network of cities known as mayors for peace our members come from countries and a wide range of political persuasions our organization had the single largest delegation governmental or non governmental at the last nuclear non proliferation treaty review conference where we advanced what we call the vision that all efforts should be bent toward ridding the world of nuclear weapons by the year we selected this date specifically because the goal is quite feasible we would all not least those who survived the atomic bombings like to see nuclear disarmament occur even sooner but we have been advised by experts in this field that there are no physical or financial obstacles to dismantling all nuclear weapons and degrading all the special fissile materials that are required for making them by it is therefore strictly a matter of political will or more accurately of good faith the international court of justice found in that all nations are under a legal obligation to pursue and conclude good faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects with this established obligation in mind mayors for peace has called for negotiations on a framework agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons if we are to remain on track for such negotiations should commence without delay and be concluded in the year of the next npt review conference messrs shultz kissinger perry and nunn rightly observe that every president of both parties since richard nixon has reaffirmed these treaty obligations but non nuclear weapon states have grown increasingly skeptical of the sincerity of the nuclear powers by challenging everyone to work toward a feasible date bipartisan u s leadership could break through the pattern of vague promises in october the world voted to u s india north korea to abolish nuclear weapons a dramatic change in u s nuclear policy would be warmly welcomed world wide and lead to rapid liberation from the terrible threat we have lived with too long tadatoshi akiba mayor of hiroshima japan president of mayors for peace hiroshima japan see related letter "letters to the editor why are we still free because were vigilant and nuclear equipped" wsj feb
