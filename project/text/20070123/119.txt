the middle seat snaring a seat during a storm while fliers wait some airlines sell first class spots the denver airport reopened on dec after a record setting blizzard and charlene king like thousands of travelers whose flights had been canceled was anxious to get there by christmas yet united airlines told her there were no seats open for her until christmas night not exactly ms king with help of a travel agent found a first class seat for sale for a dec flight from philadelphia price &# one way she told the agent to buy the ticket then asked which airline it was on united "what is this how to profit from a snowstorm " ms king asks "i got to denver because i could afford to pay a scalpers price for a ticket " when a storm hits and the airline says there are no seats that isnt always true it turns out some major airlines like ual corp s united will let stranded coach travelers continue to wait for a confirmed seat even if there are flights with available seats in first class instead the airlines try to sell those seats to customers willing to pay first class fares carriers do finally release those seats close to departure time they go first to elite frequent fliers and holders of full fare coach tickets holders of discount tickets are last in line not all airlines hold seats back for sale during big storms other major airlines including amr corp s american continental airlines inc and us airways group inc say they generally use all available seats to rebook customers northwest airlines corp and delta air lines inc say they like united reserve first class seats for first class customers sometimes even a stray coach seat will pop up for sale when there are hundreds of travelers waiting that is because airlines say seat inventory on flights changes so drastically and so quickly some travelers cancel reservations and airline computer systems list those seats for sale until an agent grabs them for waiting customers sometimes large blocks of travelers are shifted to other flights or canceled flights are reinstated or new flights are added to help move the masses in each case you may be able to jump to the front of the line if you look hard enough and often enough to catch an open seat and buy it "i think its a great idea for a customer in a dire situation " said a reservations executive at a major airline others see the practice as bordering on price gouging akin to a lumber yard holding back some plywood during a hurricane and selling it at premium prices "its wrong " says travel lawyer al anolik of san francisco "if they say they have no seats for you but they do have seats for sale its the same thing as gouging from a consumer standpoint " the department of transportation says the practice is permissible as long as the airline spells it out in its "contract of carriage" the copious rules on tickets in uniteds case its contract says it will rebook customers on the first available seat "in the same class of service " ticket contracts for american and continental dont include the "same class" exclusion northwest and delta do include it for ms king that meant united only had to offer the first available coach seat it could find even when first class seats were available she had asked united agents about rebooking to a first class seat and was told no seat was available for her the earliest coach seat she was offered was three days after her scheduled departure meaning she would miss a christmas celebration with family as long as united didnt send any planes to denver with empty seats while customers were waiting then the airline fulfilled its obligation says indiana university airline expert clinton oster ms king made a rational choice he adds since it was worth it to her to pay more to get there quicker "i suspect that many other passengers would have done the same thing if they had thought of it " he said united says its goal during weather events is to make sure every plane leaves full "first class seats are for customers who purchased first class tickets or want to use their upgrade certificates " a spokeswoman said only when a flight gets close to departure time do empty first class seats get filled by offering free upgrades to premium customers or calling people off the stand by list "before our plane flies we fill it " the spokeswoman said airlines say they prepare for storm situations by initially reducing how much over booking they will allow on flights they also can decide whether to restrict the sale of unsold seats in order to hoard seats for rebooking customers off canceled flights after that they fill flights from a standby list of travelers left in the lurch it is far from first come first served elite level frequent fliers get priority and they are placed on planes in order of their standing at the airline platinum level before gold for example most carriers take into account how much you paid for a ticket a full fare passenger gets priority over a discounted customer ms king complained to united asking for a refund of the first class fare or at least the half of the original ticket she didnt use the airline responded with an apology but no refund she complained again and united offered a &# voucher for future travel ms king told the airline she didnt consider that fair and uniteds third response gave her a refund of half of her original mile travel award coach ticket during weather disruptions airlines routinely waive ticketing restrictions and refund tickets from canceled flights without penalty if customers dont rebook still ms king says it was worth paying to get an earlier flight "i am still very pleased that i was able to jump to the front of the line " she says "its the principle that bothers me " online today email scott
