jazz and bluegrass musical cousins stage a reunion soulgrass at the blue note new york tonight through sunday www bluenote net jazz and bluegrass made similar journeys in the th century from maligned to refined these days both are celebrated with presidential medals and enjoyed at high rent festivals all over the world still it is our nature to put music in boxes and many may assume that the urbane jazz box with its horns and drums and the bluegrass box with its rustic roots and its stringed instruments would have or should have little to do with one another in fact bluegrass and jazz particularly bebop are musical contemporaries and cousins progressive departures from the dominant sounds of their day forged during world war ii both drew a line between the traditional and the modern in their respective forms even musically there were similarities beginning with common roots in the blues both were inclined toward blazing tempos rhythmic intricacies and intense even competitive improvisation suggesting that these schools despite coming from cultures as distant and disparate as s new york and s nashville might one day meet and mingle to good effect they have though with far less frequency or commercial potency than the jazz rock fusion movement or even "newgrass " the acoustic string band counterpart jazz vibraphonist gary burton recorded with bluegrass innovators the osborne brothers and fiddler richard greene in the s mandolinists david grisman and mike marshall have updated and augmented django reinhardts hot swing oeuvre perhaps most conspicuously banjo innovator bela fleck has reached large audiences with his funky sax and percussion saturated flecktones band but few jazz grass mash ups have had the pedigree and potential of this weeks six night stand by soulgrass beginning tonight at the blue note in new york led by saxophonist bill evans the group takes its name from a concept album it began when mr evans a wide ranging listener cold called mr fleck with an invitation to record mr fleck who knew mr evanss work rounded up his old friends a peerless team of progressive acoustic musicians mandolinist sam bush dobro player jerry douglas and fiddler stuart duncan mr evans who is no relation to his famous piano playing namesake planned to bring a rangy and contemporary rhythm section including bassist mark egan alumnus of the pat metheny group and gil evanss orchestra and drummer vinnie colaiuta a technical wizard who did years with frank zappa and sting a nashville rendezvous was made between two groups with no history of collaboration and no real game plan just a lot of faith "theyre different languages but theyre both valid languages " mr evans said by phone from his home in westchester county "jazz obviously has a little bit more harmonic depth to it and i think the forms may be a little bit more intellectual but the essence of both kinds of music is their expression theyre both improvisations theyre both a form of music where the instrumentalist is creating something fresh and new and thats what ties everything together " that doesnt mean there werent language barriers mr evans was surprised when he laid out his charts and the bluegrassers divulged that they work by ear not off the page it gave mr evans a chance to be amazed when the nashville veterans picked up the complex tunes in just a few minutes "guys in bluegrass have the biggest ears in the world " he said mr evans absorbed a lot of his adventurous spirit directly from miles davis the restless legend for whom he worked in the early s his name thus made he became a musical cosmonaut exploring hip hop world music and funk he has a following in europe a solid artistic reputation and nary a concern about critics who disdain any departure from orthodoxy another common point with bluegrass hes long been a regular with guitarist john mclaughlin and he has a muscular r&amp b saturated modern jazz band called soul bop with trumpeter randy brecker released by the german label bhm "soulgrass" drew a grammy nomination for best contemporary jazz album last winter eight of the albums pieces are evans originals with a bill monroe tune "shenandoah breakdown " and a miles davis tune "jean pierre " added as lodestars of their respective genres in places the disc sounds like a busier more daring version of the flecktones regular flecktone victor wooten plays bass on half the tracks lending his fretless slurs and deep funk pocket to the spirited free wheeling set of pieces mr fleck who loves nothing more than playing with musicians who challenge him stands out his staccato tone and harmonic control meshing delightfully with mr evanss voluble joyful saxes mr evans is not dabbling in bluegrass space he reconfigured his road band around a fiddle and banjo for a tour in europe this weeks shows mark the start of a u s tour a no pun intended grassroots journey to see if his fellow americans like the music his regular fiddler christian howes will be at the blue note the rest will be high order sidemen richard bona is a distinguished electric bassist from cameroon drummer dave weckl plays with chick corea and mike stern ensuring that like the album these sets will be rooted in funk and slippery worldly polyrhythms two bluegrass stars round out the band including mandolinist sam bush his resume in country bluegrass looks like mr evanss in jazz replete with star sideman turns and important studio and stage collaborations hes an aggressive picker resolute about rhythm and happy to blaze up the neck at the telluride bluegrass festival hes a rock star yet he understands how bill monroe played that seminal bluegrass mandolin filling the important banjo chair is new yorker tony trischka one of the few players in the world as qualified as mr fleck for the gig because he was mr flecks first important teacher and in many ways the father of banjo fusion as it happens after two nontraditional projects mr trischka has a new album out today called "double banjo bluegrass spectacular " featuring duets with banjo greats like founding father earl scruggs the new record reminds us that the best crossover players frequently return to the wellspring of tradition for refreshment mr trischka says his efforts to bring the banjo to stages like the blue note has been a lifes work he remembers not that many years ago hearing a fund raiser on a new york classical music station "and they said they had a matching grant and if they didnt have like &# by the end of the hour they were going to play some banjo music it was a threat " mr evans and company remind us that in the hands of master musicians bluegrass offers nothing to be afraid of mr havighurst is a writer and media producer in nashville tenn
