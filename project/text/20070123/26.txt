businesses now is figuring out how to use it its no small task sold to businesses since late last year the new version called office has a completely revamped "user interface" the screens icons and other graphical elements you use to control the software which includes word excel and other programs since the mid s microsoft has pumped out an upgrade of office every few years to little fanfare often new features and improvements were so imperceptible from version to version that businesses had little reason to upgrade those that did upgrade had a relatively easy time employees were so familiar with how the product worked a new version demanded little or no training but the changes to office are a different matter companies large and small with early versions of office are studying how to teach millions of workers how to relearn a tool that every day processes the reports calculates the finances and displays the sales plans of thousands of businesses around the world the early conclusion appears to be a combination of training online and in person that many have never had to do before in the past trw automotive holdings llc for instance "slowly dribbled in" upgraded versions of office on its corporate computers and its employees adapted says trw chief information officer joe drouin "this one would be a lot more of a deliberate decision " he says of office "it will take a lot more planning and definitely some thought toward training " mr drouin echoes executives at other companies most of who typically gradually move to new software as they test it in their companies forrester research estimates that the bulk of business will make the shift to office in three to five years in the meantime businesses are looking at ways of helping employees through the shift including new online training programs in house courses and external training specialists in a survey of large businesses forrester research found that on average most expect to give employees between two to three hours of formal training in office followed by a period of decreased productivity while they acclimate to the product that lower productivity could last between two and four weeks according to forrester analyst kyle mcnabb "a lot of enterprises are trying to develop individualized training" to lessen a productivity hit from office mr mcnabb says two wall street brokerage concerns are planning two full day courses for their financial analysts he says the office overhaul affects the way a pc user does functions in word excel and powerpoint the changes all done with an eye toward making office easier to use do away with all of the pull down menus like "file" and "edit" as well as a host of functions familiar to the million people who currently use office in their place microsoft redesigned the interface it says to make the layout of controls more logical and to make it easier to find features that were hidden in the past one change is called the ribbon which is a dashboard of clickable icons for saving editing and all the major controls in office software microsoft says the changes in sum mean that average office users have to move their mouse and click less than in the previous version of the product resetting margins in a word document for instance used to take about clicks it now can be done in three says microsoft vice president chris capossela among the areas that could trip people are "contextual tabs" on the ribbon that replace the familiar toolbars says richard losciale president of premier knowledge solutions inc a software training specialist in st louis microsoft says that once people get used to the tabs they make the program faster and easier to use microsoft has an array of online training it designed for office when an office user hits the help functions they are automatically taken to office online a web site with interactive guides and animated videos among other tutorial aids since office went on sale to businesses on nov people have run interactive guides and about have checked out videos he said "in some sense the burden doesnt fall on it to train all their people " mr capossela says "its really built into the product " mr capossela said microsofts research indicates average office users can get comfortable with the product between two hours and two days while using it heavy users of the programs who know the office software intimately say financial analysts can take as long as two weeks he says such "power users" are a big challenge executives say because they have grown accustomed to how past versions work "folks that are deeply immersed are having a greater struggle as opposed to the dilettantes who dont have much to unlearn " says mr losciale at trainer premier knowledge companies with intensive users say they wont rely on microsoft run web training alone one of those is duke energy corp which has regulation specialists who can have as many as different tool bars open in word at any one time says kevin wilson product line manager desktop and mobile mr wilson thinks recent experience switching its email program to microsoft outlook from international business machine corp s lotus notes prepared his company to handle the office change in the email move his group held daylong training "expos" at duke facilities around the country followed up by phone support duke will likely bring office and windows vista to its pcs in the second half of he says at trw the auto parts maker mr drouin says that in coming months his information technology team of between and people will begin using office first to figure out how to best teach the rest of the company which has about pcs world wide "that would gives us hands on experience and knowledge and the idea of what level of effort its going to take to get the rest of the organization over the hurdle " he says businesses that arent intensive users of office may have the easiest time elite model management recent set up its three offices with versions of office that included a custom application within office to track and book the models that elite manages the agency employees werent heavy office users before "the thing about a modeling agency is were not really tech people " says cathy gould the team leader who managed the project the transition was "extremely simple " she says its too early to see how the new interface will affect sales of office the promise of better ways of doing tasks could juice sales while the learning curve could put off some companies from upgrading getting business to like the changes is an important job for microsoft which depends on office as its second largest profit and revenue generator throwing out tried and true ways of doing things in pursuit of a better product is a risk not lost on company executives "needless to say this is a dramatic shift for us " microsofts mr capossela says
