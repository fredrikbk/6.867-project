chinas gift the bush administration is sounding a muted alarm over chinas destruction by means of an adapted ballistic missile of an old weather satellite miles up in space wed be better off treating the jan test as a rare and useful gift wittingly or not the chinese have put paid to four decades of wishful thinking about the militarization of space and what america should do about it that wishful thinking was nicely captured by a statement put out last week by the left leaning union of concerned scientists "the development and use of asat anti satellite weapons " it declared "threatens to undermine relationships and fuel military tension between space faring nations " the group urged the u s "to enter international discussions to develop rules guiding the use of space and to ban the testing and use of destructive asat weapons " there must be something indelibly stamped on the human brain that prevents the lessons of arms control from ever really being learned in the civilized world forbade through the first hague convention "the launching of projectiles and explosives from balloons or by other new methods of a similar nature " then came wright bleriot garros and fokker in the kellogg briand pact outlawed war "as an instrument of national policy " then came hitler as for the militarization of space prevailing liberal orthodoxy holds that as long as the u s refrains from taking the lead nobody else will feel obliged to follow the u s air force successfully tested an asat in but has since largely abandoned the effort that same year congress prohibited the test of a chemical laser capable of tracking and potentially disabling satellites several hundred miles into space in the clinton administration allowed a single test brookings institution scholar john steinbruner denounced it as "an unbelievably foolish judgment " the u s he said was going to "start the game of destruction and legitimize it " that didnt happen instead china took the initiative and for entirely logical reasons "the test is consistent with chinas publicized military strategy " says yuan tiecheng of shanghais pacific institute for international strategy "china must develop some sha shou jian critical battlefield weapons as deterrence to those forces that support taiwan independence or oppose reunification " but why should asats of all weapons be chinas sha shou jian of choice the asat test says bernard cole of the national war college "is something theyve been trying to do for a long time if you look at their analysis of western military strategy going back to desert storm they saw that if they could deprive the u s of the ability to use space then they would really have a leg up " thats especially true given the u s militarys increasing reliance on precision and networks over mass and concentration in combat situations reliance that is almost wholly dependent on space based surveillance positioning and communications satellites disable or destroy them and u s military assets such as aircraft carrier battle groups become about as exposed and helpless as the polish cavalry was circa september thus the chinese have been working toward an asat capability while the west has been doing its best to set a good global example and speeding chinese efforts along as recently as the early s the chinese had not even mastered the technicalities of large solid fuel motor propulsion this they acquired with the help of u s defense contractor martin marietta now a part of lockheed during the clinton years the chinese also mastered the arts of micro and nano satellites each with potential asat uses thanks to the assistance of britains surrey satellite technology ltd the chinese also seem to have fielded ground based laser systems similar to the one congress tried to quash in last september a report surfaced in defense news that the chinese had aimed the lasers at u s satellites the result as demonstrated by the jan test is a remarkable technical achievement "there are a lot of parts to an anti satellite kill " explains richard fisher of the alexandria based international assessment and strategy center "you have to track your target precisely lofting a kill vehicle and making it arrive at a very specific location at a very high rate of speed is also a tremendous technological problem this is an asat capability that considerably exceeds our own " that may be something of an exaggeration the pentagons "black budget" for runs to about &# billion twice the figure and presumably some chunk of it has been invested in technologies to destroy or defend satellites but the chinese have been making seven league strides of their own the missile likely launched in this months test was the "pioneer" kt capable of lifting payloads or reaching targets in low earth or polar orbits which are typically used for surveillance satellites including satellites that serve our anti ballistic missile defense shield the chinese have also unveiled designs for a much longer range kt based on an existing icbm design which can deploy or destroy satellites as high as miles up americas gps satellites on which things like precision guided bombs depend orbit the earth at about miles none of this is to say that china is an enemy of the u s even if the chinese military sees the u s as its most serious potential adversary in east asia and especially over taiwan but it does raise serious questions about china and for america about china why was its ministry of foreign affairs so slow to acknowledge the test and account for its purpose how credible is the ministrys insistence that china opposes the introduction of weapons into space was it informed of the test beforehand and if not what does that say about the accountability or lack thereof of the chinese military within the overall structure of the chinese government for america does the view that the u s ought not to further militarize space make sense now that the chinese have demonstrated a capability to destroy key space assets should we put our faith in international legal conventions to protect those assets or seek to do so through technical means and if the militarization of space is inevitable whom would we prefer as its dominant power china write to bstephens wsj com
