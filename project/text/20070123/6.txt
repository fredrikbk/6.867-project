arnolds health care surprise your jan editorial "schwarzenkennedy" merely touches on the problems that the schwarzenegger health proposal presents to the people of california the governor is proposing that businesses with or more employees be required to provide insurance or else pay of their taxable social security wages into a fund to subsidize insurance for the working uninsured it is far worse the plan offers nothing even worth discussing and it is disrespectful to those of us working on legitimate workable solutions and to the patients we serve you are correct physicians will go out of business the tax on total revenue amounts to a tax as high as for oncologists who administer chemotherapeutic drugs to their patients the governor pretends to offer increases in medical dollars he must have forgotten that fee for service medical here in california is almost extinct thanks to the latest state regulations meaning that all those extra dollars will go to intermediaries more dollars in the hands of administrators marcy zwelling aamot m d internist los alamitos calif well so much for the speculation that the democrats are starting a recall effort what would they have to lose now with this health care proposal he is their governor maybe some democrats will be party switching it really is the republicans who should recall arnold when candidate schwarzenegger declared his party affiliation three and a half years ago he meant to say that he was an austrian republican who knew dennis duggan mcmahon san francisco perhaps milton friedmans idea is a better approach to health care issues for the poorer of california and indeed for all of america friedman proposed expanding tax advantaged health savings accounts and to improving access and affordability by creating a national market for private health insurance but the realities are that his principles have not been proffered in a specific meat and potatoes plan that actually seeks action toward solving the need perhaps arnold schwarzeneggers plan is not the best but in the absence of other plans that have a reasonable chance of solving the problems and a reasonable chance of getting adopted at all your reference to milton friedmans idea or other "better" ideas simply distracts from the real needs at hand dr karl e moyer lancaster pa
