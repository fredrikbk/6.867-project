the daily fix after his third retirement is parcellss legacy secure after four nfl makeover jobs bill parcells is ready for his third retirement mr parcells turns in august and four years in dallas without a playoff win and with plenty of stress seem to have diminished his taste for coaching and perhaps his reputation while parcells turned a cowboys team that had won just games in their three prior seasons into a two time playoff qualifier he also hasnt won a playoff game since inspiring a memorable putdown this season on nbcs "studio on the sunset strip" each of his coaching performances was a bit less triumphant than its predecessor from two super bowls with the new york giants to an appearance with the new england patriots to falling one game short with the new york jets to dallas disappointment if parcells really is done coaching this time hell end his career with four losses in his last five games capped by quarterback tono romos botched hold on a would be game winning field goal in a wild card playoff game against seattle "if that was our last look at parcells in coaching mode then our lingering image will be of him walking off the field in seattle a stunned look in his eyes and all of his years showing in the deepening lines on his face " don banks writes on si com "it was not the script or the ending parcells envisioned for himself when he accepted jerry jones offer and the challenge of rebuilding americas team he goes out with great fanfare but with his greatest successes being a long way in the past " several others point out that parcells seems to have lost his love for football sportslines mike freeman says the coach has looked "worn" this season and the onion fictitiously yet presciently reported on a press conference after the playoff loss in which parcells declared "ive always hated football " whats next for parcells enshrinement in the pro football hall of fame in canton ohio espn coms john clayton argues calling parcells "one of the greatest coaches in nfl history " but sportslines clark judge says its no gimme blaming the canonization of parcells and not other two time champs such as tom flores and george seifert on east coast bias new york daily news columnist bob raissman suggests that parcells could be bound for broadcasting immortality if hes really done with coaching some of his most memorable moments in dallas came not on the field but in verbal sparring matches with reporters "if parcells returns to tv with no intention of returning to coaching he would be devastating on camera " mr raissman writes "during his previous tv stints when he only had one foot in the door parcells was glib and direct there were also many times he lightened up to prevent offending someone he might end up coaching or another coach he might ultimately face across the sidelines " in texas columnists are focusing on whats next for the cowboys buck harvey of the san antonio express news notes that parcells was valuable to mr jones because he represented a brand "if this departing coach had the name of bill smith instead of bill parcells the crowd would have been howling for him to be fired " "now jones has a new stadium on the way with romo and t o to market " mr harvey writes "he doesnt need to pay millions for the publicity a name coach would bring a capable coach will do " among the names he floats wade phillips ron rivera and jim mora mr rivera is busy as defensive coordinator for the super bowl bound chicago bears so is his boss lovie smith but chicago tribune columnist mike downey speculates that the big sandy texas native could be pursued by mr jones nonetheless "what a twist of fate it would be if smith the nfls most poorly compensated coach could be coaxed away to his moms dream team with a big money offer that bettered that of the bears " mr downey writes mr smith and his super bowl counterpart tony dungy of the indianapolis colts provide a stylistic contrast to parcells that mr jones and other employers would do well to observe bob kravitz writes in the indianapolis star while parcells was wont to "rule with an iron fist " messrs dungy and smith "are both devout quiet self contained head coaches who break the mold in a league that has long featured profane myopic workaholics who proudly proclaim they have no life outside of football and demand the same warped accountability from their players " as parcells departed two nfl teams hired young assistant coaches to fill head coaching vacancies leaving fewer candidates for mr jones the pittsburgh steelers replaced bill cowher who resigned two weeks ago with mike tomlin who was the minnesota vikings defensive coordinator and the oakland raiders replaced art shell fired two weeks ago with lane kiffin who was uscs offensive coordinator raiders owner al davis has a knack for finding coaching talent gwen knapp writes in the san francisco chronicle unfortunately he also has a knack for driving said talent away former raiders coach jon gruden might be able to advise the year old mr kiffin whose father is mr grudens defensive coordinator in tampa bay "kiffin must have heard all the requisite well informed warnings and decided to come to oakland anyway " ms knapp writes "perhaps he didnt eat his vegetables as a child either or its possible that he got the best possible advice on how to cope with davis " san jose mercury news columnist tim kawakami isnt optimistic "we know that anybody who had another option in the nfl or college ranks rejected the raiders out of hand we know that even a few guys who didnt have great options decided this was the nfls typhoid vacancy stay away at all costs so its kiffin who was not exactly beloved at usc who was als second choice even among young trojans staffers and who walks into a locker room where half the roster already is devoted to defensive coordinator rob ryan this ought to be fun " hopes are higher in pittsburgh befitting a franchise that has won more games and one more championship than have the raiders in the past two seasons "mike tomlin looked the part and spoke the gospel while making a first impression that couldnt have been better " pittsburgh tribune review columnist mike prisuta writes of the steelers new year old head coach "he thanked god and the rooney family in that order he flashed a smile and a super bowl ring " and finally two stories about the best and worst of the nfl after the new orleans saints lost to the bears on sunday and headed home heartbroken fans gathered to greet the team at the airport "so much in professional sports is canned and this was something real something spontaneous and pure " wright thompson writes on espn com "through a neighborhood they drove down a winding dark road to a private terminal where the teams charter would land cars parked one after another the headlights looking like that scene from field of dreams fans brought coolers and bottles of wine standing in the pouring rain giving something back to the team that gave them so much " many of the san francisco ers who won the super bowl years ago tomorrow gave their good health to their pro career in a devastating series entitled "glory has its price " the san francisco chronicles ron kroichick documents the teams glory and the price with of players interviewed suffering today from "significant physical issues " in sidebars mr kroichick profiles dan bunz who must cope with constant pain and explains why the players must pay out of their own pockets for many of their medical costs tip of the fix cap to reader rob haragan
