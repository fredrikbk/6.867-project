pushing a different vision instead of standard questionnaires about income levels and family size imagini has developed a sort of electronic rorschach test it presents an array of photographs and asks people which one best describes phrases such as "my idea of a good time " or "happiness to me is " the software then analyzes the photo choices and comes up with what imagini calls "visual dna" a profile of a persons tastes attitudes toward work and family and other characteristics imagini launched months ago by alex willcock a former conran group marketing executive is one of an increasing number of firms seeking to push market research to the next level the london start up uses pictures instead of words to gather data clients say imagini can pick up on subtleties that other consumer tracking misses such as peoples motivations or aspirations because its tests which appear on sites such as microsoft corp s msn give users instant feedback on their personalities and tastes it has attracted attention from web surfers and bloggers who might turn their noses up at a typical market research quiz in december imagini posted a gift finder on its site imagini net to come up with gift ideas for a friend the user chooses from sets of photos to answer questions about the person such as "their favorite color is " or "their house looks like " the program then matches the answers with everything from gadgets to books users can search for gifts for themselves and email a wish list to friends and families about people took the test in the first hours it was on the site imagini says such ideas have drawn clients such as msn mobile phone provider vodafone plc and british shopper loyalty program nectar which have used imaginis software to gauge reaction to ad campaigns and identify clusters of consumers the most common approach to such research "behavioral targeting " uses software to track the web sites people visit as well as when and what they buy online yahoo and other such sites use that information to tailor ads for particular groups of customers big online advertisers rely on such "clickstream" research because it provides quantifiable data on sites users have already visited imaginis visual surveys on the other hand allow users to provide their own definition of their likes and dislikes imaginis tack has its skeptics bill gossman chief executive of new york based revenue science inc which uses behavioral targeting to help online publications channel ads to readers sees imaginis reliance on peoples answers to questions about themselves as potentially flawed "im telling the service about myself instead of the system learning about me " as tracking web surfing would do he says imaginis founder mr willcock sees that as the services chief strength the use of images instead of words he says "allows you to understand consumers on a deeper and more subtle level" to gain insight into their motivations and what they might do in the future every time a person takes an imagini test the information is compiled into a database which groups people into different clusters more than people have taken the visual quiz so far matching a picture with statements such as "if an extra hour appeared today this is how i would spend it " nearly of respondents to that statement selected images that depicted people reading or lounging around with a book in bed such a cluster could be targeted with ads for bookstores or magazines while imagini remains a niche application it has started to attract more attention in late october msn did a pilot project in which it linked to an imagini test on its web site for a week about people took the quiz microsoft plans to mine the data for clusters of people who can then be used to attract online advertisers selling everything from vacations to mortgages nectar the u k s biggest customer loyalty program with million members collecting points on purchases found it easier to gather customer information using imagini than through typical online surveys nectar a division of closely held loyalty management uk sent members an email questionnaire about their views and tastes half got text based questions via email and half got the imagini test nectar found people were times more likely to complete the imagini questionnaire imaginis picture based approach "solved one of the traditional problems of market research it is hard to get people to engage and tell us about themselves " says simon hawkes managing director of loyalty management services at nectar since august imagini has been working with vodafone to refine its "make the most of now" advertising and branding campaign which it uses world wide the television ads feature a mayfly which has a lifespan of one day flitting around to convey
