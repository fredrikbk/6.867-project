career q&amp a the right time to talk about salary q during a second interview the employer asked my earnings requirements i gave a range and he agreed to the top number later i learned companies typically pay more for this job can i bring up salary again a before interviewing candidates should know three numbers the first is the market rate companies pay for the job this is typically stated as a minimum midpoint and maximum salary at big companies new hires are usually paid along this spectrum based on their skills and experience smaller companies may have less formalized salary structures the second number is the amount you want to be paid annually the third is the minimum you will accept companies generally prefer not to reopen pay talks after an offer has been made and accepted but because you havent received a concrete job offer you can still negotiate without being viewed poorly how you ask is critical though says taren gray a recruiter in boise idaho for wells fargo &amp co "if you sound arrogant it could put a bad taste in the hiring managers mouth " when you make your request is also important says peter vergano senior manager hr strategic staffing for samsung electronics america inc in ridgefield park n j if you want the job regardless wait until after you receive an offer he says at that point its fine to say you have done more research and were hoping the starting salary could be increased however he notes if you dont want the position unless you get this raise clarify the issue now you should also consider a few other factors one is the quality of your pay data generalized averages produced by online salary calculators arent always applicable to specific companies and jobs your experience and salary history will also be taken into account it is possible you lack the experience to warrant a higher starting salary at this company if this company is reputable the interviewer probably isnt trying to take advantage of you its bad business to pay candidates below the market rate for a job because theyll likely become dissatisfied and leave when they find out also its generally not wise to turn down a good career opportunity over a few thousand dollars you can meet with your manager after starting work to ask when raises are given and what you can do to get the biggest increase ms gray says with good performance your pay may rise faster than you might expect
