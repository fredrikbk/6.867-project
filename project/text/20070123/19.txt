business technology new yahoo ad system irks small customers companies that buy online advertising through yahoo inc are generally excited about a major upgrade to the internet giants ad system designed to make it more stable and sophisticated and to boost profits but some advertisers particularly small businesses are complaining that moving existing accounts to yahoos new search ad system is painful that was the case for imagers a family owned atlanta digital printing business with a staff of that last year spent about &# a month on search related advertising through yahoo after its account was converted to yahoos new system around the start of this month imagers says yahoo declined to let the company continue running some ads linked to specific keywords search advertisers bid to have their ads displayed when a user types in certain terms in imagers case yahoo stopped allowing it to link ads to some of the keywords including "color printing" and "digital printing" that were most often typed in by users and still linked to ads by imagers rivals imagers says yahoo customer service wasnt able to rectify the problem immediately so it slashed spending on yahoo to about a &# monthly rate and increased its budget for ads on rival google inc yahoo late last week resolved some of imagers issues and the printing firm then raised its spending with yahoo to about a &# monthly rate the ad system upgrade dubbed "panama " is a high stakes endeavor by yahoo to give advertisers a better system for managing their ads while boosting yahoos ad profits at its core it involves replacing a web based system created in the late s for companies to buy search related ads which had developed a reputation among some advertisers for outages and other problems as part of the upgrade yahoo plans to change how it selects which search ads to display for any user query adopting a strategy already used by google that has proven more profitable investors have been clamoring for the upgrade the beginning of whose rollout yahoo in july delayed until mid october on the grounds it was complicated to move the accounts of its hundreds of thousands of existing advertisers to the new system since october yahoo has been moving accounts over and says it expects to finish in line with its announced timeline by the end of this quarter the sunnyvale calif firm will likely provide an update when it reports fourth quarter earnings today "we obviously want every customer to have a great experience but no matter what change is change " says steve mitgang yahoo senior vice president of advertiser products and platform yahoo says it has offered extensive training and support to advertisers making the change from online tutorials to in person seminars yahoo says the process is generally going smoothly with calls to its support center for help below levels it had projected search marketing experts say they dont expect customers overall to reduce the amount they spend with yahoo because of confusion or problems related to the upgrade some marketing agencies specializing in search say they have been happy with the process in part because yahoo devotes a lot of attention to them and their large advertiser clients "we have been so impressed with the transition " says bill wise chief executive of search engine marketing agency did it llc chris wallace vice president of media for search marketing firm icrossing inc whose clients include coca cola co says "our experience has been positive in part because we do a significant amount of due diligence prior to migration" to the new system veronica muth a marketing coordinator for telogis inc a fleet management services and software firm in costa mesa calif that spends about &# a month on yahoo search ads agrees about the experience "the migration process was easy " says ms muth who attended a yahoo seminar about the upgrade for advertisers last week but the complaints by some other advertisers highlight the often underestimated impact in time and money of such major system changes by a service provider on companies that rely on it daily rob montalbine says technical glitches prevented the hawthorne n j relocation services company where he is internet marketing manager from accessing yahoos search ad system for most of three days after its upgrade "with an aggressive search marketing campaign and matching budget three days is a millennium " says mr montalbine whose company buys ads linked to keywords through yahoo and at times has spent more than &# monthly on search ads a more common issue for advertisers was that the switch to the new system meant search ad campaigns were reorganized and in some cases altered in ways they had trouble understanding andre leach director of search and email services at internet marketing agency silverfox in san francisco says he drastically cut yahoo search advertising by a wine industry client for three days while he sorted out the changes mr leach says they included changes to what the client who spent about &# on yahoo search ads in december was bidding for its ads to be displayed alongside certain keywords "it was like it was completely scrambled " says mr leach todd handler owner and operator of online dog products retailer hot dog collars in elkton fla says he is working through similar changes to his yahoo account after it was upgraded early this month mr handler says "it created a little more work for us but were not hugely disappointed " meanwhile a glitch with yahoos old ad system created headaches for advertisers earlier this month pest control company orkin inc says yahoo inexplicably shut off orkins search advertising for hours starting on jan orkin a unit of rollins inc bids to have its ads linked to hundreds of thousands of keywords ranging from "pest control" to "termites " yahoo said the problem with the old system has since been fixed rob crigler orkins director of interactive marketing says "yahoo has not been terribly cooperative " but its search advertising "works for us and ultimately we want to spend money where it works you kind of feel like youre stuck " he said
