business technology talking tech paradoxes abound in telecommuting with high speed web connections at home telecommuting has for good and bad become one of the byproducts of the internet age but the trend to telecommuting comes with a paradox most managers by a margin think their employees are just as productive if not more so when they work at home yet at the same time of managers think telecommuters wont go as far in their careers as full time office workers because they lack office "face time " the figures are from a survey of a unit of korn ferry international the executive recruiting firm the companys robert mcnabb explains q why might telecommuting have an adverse effect on someones career a it relates to the old way of running companies where managers say "i want all my key people in one location so i can see them when i make decisions and we can talk about things " in both publicly held and privately held companies leadership wants key employees to be closer to the heart and soul of the business both for making decisions and for maintaining compliance on financial issues this obviously has been driven by sarbanes oxley q doesnt that suggest that employees to be successful have to go in to the office and play this political game of waving their hand and letting everyone they are working hard a youre probably right to some degree but it is a fact that its the way companies are run its sort of the old school versus the new school q do you think people get more work done at home a i think that it takes a certain level of discipline a certain level of motivation to be able to perform at equivalent levels at home as in the office i think it takes a unique individual to do that many telecommuters stay home and work because they find so many distractions in the office that get in the way of getting things done there i think if you are in a motivating company with a winning culture and a successful business with the right kind of environment then i think you can be just as productive in office or away from the office q what about younger people who grew up with the internet a younger workers have a different motivation than older workers with baby boomers retiring companies will really be struggling to find the right kind of talent companies are going to change how they operate because they will have to there will be more flexibility around telecommuters a lot of people want telecommuting to go away for a different reason because they want to get back to a to workday where you can leave the office behind rather than be checking emails in the evening and on weekends i think companies today think as much as possible about how they can maximize the productivity of their work force that means spending a full day at the office and then going home and getting on the computer and doing emails or reports and i think a telecommuter does the same exact thing i think the reason there are so many laptops today is that companies want to keep driving productivity out of their employees that is our culture today
