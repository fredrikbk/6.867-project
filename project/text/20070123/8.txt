a dollar stores rich allure in india a u s franchises success shows made in america sells lessons for wal marts entry mumbai india corporate lawyer archana singh travels to europe every year and returns laden with fine italian cheeses french wines and single malt scottish whiskys at home in mumbai she likes shopping at the neighborhood "dollar store " which sells exotic products like the newest flavor of pringles in red white and blue decked aisles that make her feel shes on vacation in the u s as wal mart stores inc and other retail giants prepare to enter india an unexpected american rival californias my dollarstore inc is already here and attracting the affluent middle class customers wal mart and others covet in the u s most of the so called dollar stores that sell discounted products at a single price are in low rent strip malls in india my dollarstores target big spenders setting up in prime ground floor spaces at the newest malls even the prices are higher end while everything costs &# at my dollarstores in the u s in india the same products sell for rupees or about &# thanks to transportation costs and import tariffs since opening its first store in mumbai in indias my dollarstore franchise has been a testing ground for what works and what doesnt for a new entrant to the subcontinents nearly &# billion retail industry spanning food to footwear ajoy krishnamurti chief executive of sankalp retail value stores which was created to manage the my dollarstore franchise in india walks the aisle of a my dollarstore in mumbais center one mall pointing out products "hersheys chocolate syrup really rocks salad dressing is hot " he says "papaya and carrot juice not particularly hot " though the average annual salary in india is still less than &# my dollarstores track record suggests "made in america" is a good formula for attracting indias well to do and free spending middle class the governments of india and the u s have not always seen eye to eye on political issues but goods associated with the american way of life doritos chips kelloggs pop tarts alberto vo hair conditioner have long been carried home by indians living in and visiting the u s that helps explain why a store chain associated with bargain basements in the u s is attracting the cream of indias shoppers in an economy whose gross domestic product is growing more than a year recently ms singh says a trip to my dollarstore reminds her of traveling abroad she enjoys trying new products and likes the wide aisles a contrast to the mom and pop shops that dominate food cosmetics and clothing retailing in india she spends &# in a typical trip "before you realize it youve picked up so much " she says international chains are scarce in india where the government generally doesnt allow direct foreign ownership in the retail industry it restricts foreign investment to single brand retailers such as chanel or nike or those that come through franchise agreements international brands provide the products retail technology and marketing but the stores are owned by indians guess inc tommy hilfiger corp and my dollarstore are among those that have entered the market through franchises yet the government has hinted its ready to open the sector to more foreign investment and indians are at last shopping enough to make large retail investments worthwhile in november wal mart announced plans to enter india through a joint venture its indian partner bharti enterprises ltd will own the outlets while wal mart controls the supply chain and wholesaling operations last week u s office supply retailers staples inc announced it would also enter india through a joint venture frances carrefour sa and tesco plc of the u k are scouting for partners too and expected to follow with their own india plans certainly just setting up shop will not be enough wal mart last year had to pull out of both the german and south korean markets after years of disappointing results there in india these behemoths will likely be learning some of the same lessons the tiny my dollarstore chain has already absorbed dollar stores have been around for decades in the u s but my dollarstore is relatively new in indian immigrant and former leather importer rex mehta started dollarstore inc as a web portal to help independent shops buy and sell goods in it moved into the brick and mortar business of running a chain of my dollarstores and the next year it took the franchise abroad now the privately held company has annual sales of close to &# million from franchise fees wholesaling and consulting it typically charges &# upfront to anyone who wants to open a my dollarstore provides the layout of the stores the products and the technology needed and charges the stores around of sales its been expanding faster internationally than at home and now has around store franchises abroad from eastern europe to central america to southeast asia in the u s where it has about my dollarstore franchises and provides other independent stores with products and services its major competitors are the listed giants of the industry including family dollar stores inc and dollar tree stores inc abroad mr mehta says he has little competition "we are very excited about india " says mr mehta who heads the entire operation and is chief executive officer of dollarstore international inc the company that runs the groups international franchising in india my dollarstore plays heavily on the american dream theme the store in mumbais center one mall features the same red white and blue decorating scheme and employee uniforms as the u s stores and takes it a step further with posters of the statue of liberty on the walls so far the formula is working last year million customers shopped in my dollarstores in india up from two years earlier most of the my dollarstore outlets mainly in indias larger cities attract more than customers a day three times the average in the u s mr krishnamurti estimates the my dollarstores in india brought in more than &# million in sales last year almost twice the previous years revenues he plans to expand to more than stores across the subcontinent in the next three years my dollarstore learned other lessons on the way to its current success its first shops offered exactly the same products sold in u s stores container loads of goods from the franchises long list of products from baby clothes to health and beauty products snacks and stationary while indians rushed to buy super size bottles of shampoo and cartons of apple juice they were also wary of the discounted products fearing the goods might be shoddy or locally made imitations of international brands my dollarstore solved this problem by hiring more staff to answer questions the stores in india have around employees per square feet more than times that of the u s stores its possible because labor is cheap in india the average shop helper makes less than &# a month "is this really old spice " a customer asks mr krishnamurti at the center one store customers are confused about newly arrived cans of hair mousse the stores manager says "they keep calling it mouse " to encourage consumers to try unfamiliar products like blueberry syrup and dog shampoo my dollarstore offers something unusual in india a money back guarantee no questions asked one customer returned a partially eaten jar of peanut butter chinese made products re exported from the u s proved too expensive so the stores in india found a way to import directly from china a practice allowed under the franchise rules some industry experts caution the novelty of my dollarstores could wear off once wal marts carrefours and tescos come to town but mr krishnamurti notes that in the u s dollar stores have thrived under the noses of the mega retailers for decades meanwhile his team is learning every day an edge mr krishnamurti hopes will help when the global retailers arrive "it doesnt scare me at all " he says "they still have to figure out what is going on with the indian consumer "
