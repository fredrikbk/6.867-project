politics &amp economics thailand looks to king to restore stability how nation handles crisis will help determine economic rivalry within region bangkok thailand when tanks rolled into bangkok in september as the military overthrew an elected prime minister many thais werent sure what to think until their king said it was all right since then this tropical buddhist kingdom one of the u s s chief allies in asia has been rattled by a series of troubling events and political rifts whether king bhumibol adulyadej years old can help guide thailand back to democracy will have a huge impact on thailands economic prospects as it seeks to compete with regional powers china and india the armed forces have ripped up the constitution and are now drafting one that may limit the powers of civilian leaders some in the military have said they want to retain the right to name the prime minister even if democratic voting is restored as military rulers have promised meanwhile technocrats appointed by the army to guide thailands vibrant economy have introduced new policies that are deterring foreign investment and could slow growth then on new years eve a series of bombings ripped through bangkok killing three and wounding dozens more including foreign tourists a mainstay of the countrys economy with the country now facing the very instability that the coup aimed to prevent king bhumibol is trying to restore order through direct appeals to his subjects and through his chief counselor year old retired gen prem tinsulanonda shortly after the new years bombings the king appeared on television to deliver an annual speech in which he urged thais to keep his kingdom united he also is trying to use his few public appearances to bolster support for the government installed by the military after the coup many military installed cabinet members are already in their sixties and seventies and the thai media has nicknamed this government of grandees "old ginger" after the aromatic root which is said to get better with age in his birthday speech in december king bhumibol who has spent years on the throne praised his aging government and referred to younger politicians as "greedy " the premier that the coup ousted telecommunications billionaire thaksin shinawatra is years old acknowledging his own advancing years and health problems the king spoke for only minutes far short of the two hours worth of homilies and folk wisdom which he usually offers in the annual speeches the new government is also adopting some of king bhumibols long held beliefs about promoting broader based economic growth and better preparing thais to withstand the buffeting that economic globalization can bring this concept of "self sufficiency" appears to be reflected in some of the governments recent moves including the introduction of capital controls to prevent speculative money ramping up the value of thailands currency and new measures to limit foreign shareholdings government officials say these specific policies were crafted independently of the kings economic philosophy gen prem who served as prime minister through much of the s has invited generals perceived as close to ousted premier mr thaksin to his modest bangkok home for private discussions the kings chief aide now wants to maintain good relations with all sides to mediate a settlement if more serious trouble breaks out people familiar with the situation say in an example of that gen prem met with mr thaksins wife despite the militarys efforts to diminish the former premiers influence both king bhumibol and gen prem declined to be interviewed the king like britains queen elizabeth ii has little formal power but thais hang on his every word and largely through gen prem he influences nearly every facet of life in his kingdom images of the king are everywhere in thailand sometimes decked out in full ceremonial regalia complete with a golden cape and sword reminiscent of how his great grandfather was depicted in the film "the king &amp i " the events happening now offer a glimpse of how tense thailand could become after the current king passes one possible heir his son doesnt enjoy nearly as devoted a following "the succession issue figures a lot in the balance of power between the military and the royal palace on one side and politicians like mr thaksin on the other " says paul handley the american author of a biography of king bhumibol the kings popularity and near divine status for many will increase his chances of shepherding the nation to a return to democracy and stability and ensuring that the country stays together after his death he is not in the best of health having had past heart troubles and a back operation over the summer and so far there is little sign that the upheavals are affecting thailands biggest foreign investors general motors corp ford motor co and toyota motor corp all use the country as a production hub but there are few signs so far of the current tensions easing police have detained people including eight military officers in connection with the new years eve bombings but its still not clear who was behind the blasts the thai army has suggested mr thaksins followers planted the bombs an allegation mr thaksin denies and although thailands new government has said mr thaksin can return from exile if he promises to stay out of politics state run television stations are banned from broadcasting mr thaksins image authorities have also revoked his diplomatic passport which is standard issue for past prime ministers and which he has used to travel through asia and europe since the coup thailand also curtailed diplomatic relations with singapore earlier this month after mr thaksin visited to meet members of its government and gave interviews to the wall street journal and cnn in northern thailand where mr thaksins following is strongest arsonists have razed dozens of schools in what has been seen as an act of political rebellion leaflets bearing mr thaksins face and the slogan "the poor will not forget you" are being distributed in the thai heartland one of thailands leading buddhist monks phra khru atthamedhi has also lent his support to mr thaksin and his thais love thais political party "in the provinces people want the former prime minister to return to work they still love thais love thais and remain part of your fan club " the monk said in a recent new year ceremony
