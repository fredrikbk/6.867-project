the ironic mr spitzer what you denounce in politics can depend on where you sit and heres hoping thats true of eliot spitzer as new yorks attorney general the democrat was the scourge of the financial industry and in a final rhetorical flourish in that job he was among the first to denounce last months report by the committee on capital markets regulation pointing to a decline in american financial industry competitiveness now however mr spitzer is new yorks governor and it will be fascinating to see if he assumes a more statesmanlike pose toward the same industry both the new york state budget and mr spitzers own political future depend on the financial industrys prosperity as the same capital markets committee report made clear while the securities industry employs of new york states workers those workers earned of the states gross income in the industry accounts for no less than of "gross state product " and heres the kicker at its peak in the securities industry paid of total new york tax receipts according to the state comptrollers office the numbers for arent yet in but expect another banner year for bankers tax bills its fashionable to decry big wall street bonuses but new york politicians would be destitute without the income tax revenues from those bonuses heres another irony mr spitzers fate as governor may also depend on the enforcement forbearance of his successor as ag andrew cuomo as the capital markets committee noted one of the main threats to u s public financial markets is multiple layers of regulation that can create double and triple jeopardy in london investors deal with a single regulator but in new york mr spitzer made the state ags office into another securities and exchange commission if mr cuomo uses his powers the way mr spitzer did even fewer companies will want to go public in the u s two other new york politicians new york city mayor michael bloomberg and senator chuck schumer issued a new report yesterday on the regulatory risks to u s financial markets that well have more to say about soon theyre calling for less onerous regulation and tort reform perhaps mr spitzer will have a similar epiphany once he discovers how dependent he now is on the states financial entrepreneurs
