politics &amp economics calderon risks gridlock alliances for ascension in mexico may now build walls mexico city coming off a narrow and hotly disputed victory in last years election mexican president felipe calderon has quickly strengthened his hand by reaching out to traditional power brokers forging alliances with everyone from union bosses to billionaire television moguls while that strategy has bolstered the presidents otherwise weak political position it may prevent him from making the deep political and economic changes mexico needs to modernize economists say they say tackling endemic problems such as monopoly control of industries dismal education high energy costs and rampant corruption requires confronting the powers that be rather than cozying up to them mr calderons ability to change the face of mexico during his six year term will have major implications for the u s including whether its southern neighbor can create enough jobs to stop driving hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants across the border each year social stability also will depend on whether he can offer hope that mexicans will see more economic opportunity and political justice and less violent crime and corruption the early signs arent encouraging take education where mexico is slipping far behind global manufacturing rivals such as south korea instead of challenging the countrys powerful teachers union which steadfastly opposes any attempt to improve accountability or raise standards mr calderon named the union leaders son in law to a top education ministry post analysts say the president wants the union leader to deliver votes for him in an opposition controlled congress mexico ended seven decades of single party rule in when the institutional revolutionary party candidate lost to vicente fox mr fox soon found out that it was easier to kick the pri out of power than to change its legacy of patronage and vested interests that has left many mexicans longing for the kind of "change" vowed by mr fox and mr calderons national action party or pan a conservative organization that is tight with the business elite and criticized as out of touch with broader mexico "our democracy has not been able to dismantle the powers that be which in the end limit what calderon can do " says hector aguilar camin a prominent mexican writer and analyst "standing between every reform in politics is a powerful union and standing between every economic reform is a powerful monopoly or group of companies " if mr calderon fails to show he can tackle the countrys interests he could play into the hands of his defeated election rival andres manuel lopez obrador mr lopez obrador who refused to accept mr calderons victory and leads the countrys biggest left wing party struck a chord with poor mexicans during the campaign by telling them that the rules of the game are rigged against them by the establishment mr calderons advisers say the year old former congressman remains committed to economic restructuring but cant be expected to solve all of mexicos problems at once most of his energy they say is focused on keeping his main campaign promise of restoring law and order to violence ravaged regions his popularity has soared as he dispatched troops to combat drug violence around the country mr calderons allies argue that building a strong presidency now will make it easier to push economic legislation through congress when the time comes "the countrys agenda is varied and long and the idea is to focus on problem areas one by one " said ernesto cordero a senior finance ministry official and longtime ally of the president still the early experiences of companies such as general electric co show that bold economic strokes arent likely

antagonize televisa mr calderons free market credentials have also drawn scrutiny following last weeks agreement to set price controls to stop the rising cost of corn tortillas a staple of the poor masses whose price is politically sensitive some advisers urged mr calderon to adopt a free market solution to the problem lower the price by eliminating quotas and tariffs that protect inefficient local corn producers encouraging more participants in the industry to promote competition mr calderon has opted for price controls a strategy reminiscent of the days when the pri micromanaged the economy moreover the new price locked in a healthy profit for the big domestic tortilla flour producers at the expense of the consumer "the way in which the government resolves this situation will say a lot about the future of the mexican economy " luis rubio a leading mexican economist wrote in an opinion piece in the leading reforma newspaper on the political front mr calderons overtures to the pri may get in the way of his promise to overhaul the countrys costly and corrupt political system even some of the presidents fiercest supporters say he took rapprochement too far when he agreed to a
