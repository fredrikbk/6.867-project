opening arguments the case against stents new studies hint at overuse defenders say devices for heart disease give quick symptom relief few innovations have transformed medicine more rapidly than the popular heart device known as a stent in just over a decade cardiologists have implanted the tiny metal scaffolds more than million times to prop open diseased arteries now a series of studies suggests aggressive drug treatment would serve many patients just as well as stents if not better while saving billions of dollars in health costs just last month a paper in the journal of the american college of cardiology reported that drugs were as effective as stents in improving blood flow through the coronary arteries in patients who were stable after a heart attack options for heart disease patients stents wire mesh scaffolds to prop open blood vessels offer quick relief of symptoms but evidence that they can save lives and prevent heart attacks is thin drugs for blood pressure high cholesterol and the like offer proven lifesaving benefits but dont usually fix specific blockages of vessels bypass surgery is the most invasive procedure involving cracking open the chest but for especially serious disease it may be the best solution recent studies also suggest that for patients with especially serious heart disease stents may fail to match up to the more invasive procedure they were supposed to replace bypass surgery stents are big business cardiologists who implant them have built lucrative practices and largely supplanted heart surgeons as the generals in the fight against heart disease the devices have proved vital profit makers for johnson &amp johnson and boston scientific corp which dominate the &# billion global market the new findings arent definitive but they are emerging as cardiologists temper their enthusiasm for advanced versions of stents that are drug coated to prevent reclogging of blood vessels in rare instances drug coated stents may trigger fatal blood clots long after they are implanted in patients recent studies have shown "the clotting risks ended up changing the equation a little bit and are forcing a broader re examination" of americas passion for stents says steven nissen chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic there is wide agreement that stents save lives when used to treat patients in the midst of a heart attack or to prevent an impending attack in people who suffer from acute chest pain stents are especially effective more so than medications alone at providing fast lasting relief from chest pain or angina which is a telltale symptom of heart disease but critics say a significant portion perhaps or more of the million or so americans treated with stents each year have generally mild or stable symptoms that dont require urgent treatment others have no symptoms at all a large body of evidence shows that drugs to lower cholesterol control blood pressure and thin the blood can prevent heart attacks and death in such people the evidence in favor of stents is weaker in a patient study stents provided no benefit over drug therapy in patients whose arteries remained blocked at least three days after suffering a heart attack researchers reported at a meeting of the american heart association in november at a big meeting of the american college of cardiology in march doctors will unveil results of a seven year randomized study comparing aggressive drug treatment against stents plus drugs in patients with stable heart disease if stents fail to win that face off "it will be a major challenge to current practice " says christopher cannon a cardiologist at brigham and womens hospital boston who isnt involved with the study heart surgeons long among the most prestigious and well compensated doctors in medicine have seen their business erode dramatically with the rising popularity of stents especially since the drug coated devices were introduced in the number of patients discharged from hospitals each year after bypass surgery has fallen nearly since to just over according to health data company solucient llc evanston ill in bypass surgery surgeons connect replacement vessels to the heart to circumvent those that are clogged birinder s madan found out last month he had heart disease in three arteries including a blockage in the most critical vessel doctors at a long island hospital recommended triple bypass surgery but the year old chief executive of a brooklyn n y commercial food equipment company worried hed have to take a couple months off work after the operation which involves cracking open the chest for another opinion he went to samin sharma director of interventional cardiology at mount sinai medical center new york who assured mr madan that drug coated stents could handle his problem "one hospital is saying i need a triple bypass on the other hand i have a shortcut " mr madan says "and dr sharma was so confident " clotting worries with the stents caused mr madan to hesitate but a new years eve phone call from dr sharma persuaded him early this month during two procedures a week apart dr sharma implanted five stents in mr madans coronary vessels mr madan plans to be back at work this week "the majority of patients are going to stents for this " dr sharma says some doctors arent so sure they should recent evidence supports bypass surgery as the preferred option for many patients with disease in all three of the hearts main vessels or with other complicating factors such as diabetes duke university researchers published results of an patient study in the annals of thoracic surgery last year showing a significant survival advantage for bypass surgery over stents in patients followed for up to years a similar five year patient study at the cleveland clinic in came to the same conclusion both studies had important statistical limitations and most of the patients were treated with bare metal as opposed to drug coated stents in europe a study comparing drug coated stents with bypass surgery in patients with disease in several vessels found stents were comparable nevertheless some heart experts say the trend raises tough questions about the rush to treat complicated patients with the devices "maybe weve abandoned bypass surgery too quickly " says the cleveland clinics dr nissen who is a cardiologist not a heart surgeon stent companies and interventional cardiologists as those who perform stent procedures are known strongly defend current use of the technology donald s baim chief medical and scientific officer at boston scientific natick mass readily acknowledges that for the average heart patient stents dont reduce risk of death or heart attack nor he says does bypass surgery "the main driver is lifestyle and symptom relief and the ability to conduct normal activities without having angina " says dr baim who recently joined the company after a year career as a cardiologist and professor at harvard medical school "if youre happy having angina times a day you dont need a procedure but of patients want to be able to walk their dog or play tennis and not have angina " kirk garratt an interventional cardiologist at lenox hill hospital new york says even in patients with stable disease it can be risky to leave untouched an obstruction reducing the supply of oxygen rich blood to the hearts muscle he thinks stents are often warranted in such cases "symptoms dont tell the whole story " dr garratt says "the relationship between insufficient blood flow and the probability of a patients dying within two years is robust " in a statement johnson &amp johnson said its drug coated stent "is an important and meaningful option for the treatment of coronary artery disease and suitable for many patients with the disease " like other medical breakthroughs stents have captured the public imagination many patients feel theyre getting second class treatment if they dont have one says neil shadoff an interventional cardiologist in albuquerque n m he says he routinely advises patients who suffer from only occasional twinges of chest pain while golfing or climbing stairs that medication is a good option often he meets resistance "these patients are convinced theyre going to have a heart attack and die " dr shadoff says "if you have a procedure that can be done to fix the problem they look at that as being very positive they approach the idea of medication as not being aggressive enough " a common scenario says dr nissen is a patient without symptoms whose treadmill test during a routine physical reveals potential trouble that leads to an angiogram where a doctor sees some narrowing and puts a stent in "what is the scientific evidence that weve done anything positive for that patient " dr nissen asks the stents roots go back to when legendary cardiologist andreas gruentzig using a device fashioned in his own kitchen performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty procedure in zurich the patients chest pain was immediately cured the event heralded the age of interventional cardiology offering the promise that patients could get diseased arteries fixed without open heart surgery angioplasty involves threading a balloon tipped catheter from an artery in a patients groin to a blockage in the arteries that supply the heart the balloon is then inflated to clear the obstruction and restore blood flow to the hearts muscle but angioplasty was far from perfect one problem vessels stretched open by the balloon were prone to snapping shut within days of a procedure potentially causing a heart attack enter the stent it is a wire mesh scaffold delivered to the blockage via an angioplasty catheter the stent provided a structure to prevent the vessel from snapping closed when johnson &amp johnson introduced the first coronary stent in the u s in it quickly became the hottest device in medicine it soon emerged however that stents had a flaw of their own the tendency to promote formation of scar tissue that often reclogged the artery triggering a recurrence of chest pain the problem was called restenosis and in to of cases it required a repeat procedure usually within six months of the first one paul cormier a year old retired newton mass policeman has had stents implanted on three occasions over the past decade after suffering problems with scar tissue mr cormier previously had triple bypass surgery in following a heart attack despite the need for multiple stents mr cormier says the procedures along with plenty of pills seem to have stabilized his disease "as long as im dealing with good doctors i put my trust in them " says mr cormier who both swims and meditates at least once a week as part of his still active life nonetheless the restenosis problem prompted many patients to stick with bypass surgery cardiologists believed if they could solve it the triumph of stents would be complete that explains the intense interest in drug coated stents which carry medication to prevent the growth of the scar tissue in one early study of patients who received johnson &amp johnsons cypher drug coated stent none developed restenosis by june when the new j&amp j device was approved patients were lining up on waiting lists to get it by years end it had captured an estimated of the stent market industry sources put the u s stent market at about one million patients a year though estimates based on hospital discharge data by solucient are lower boston scientifics taxus drug coated stent hit the u s market in march triggering a marketing war that fueled interest in the technology some doctors say other factors including financial and aesthetic considerations also fanned enthusiasm for the device a doctors fee for implanting a stent is typically around &# much more than what doctors get for sending patients home with a few prescriptions after a routine office visit "its a medicine for dollars scenario " says kevin graham director of preventive cardiology at the minneapolis heart institute "the doctor who practices disciplined medicine makes significantly less money than the doctor who is trying to find some justification for stenting a patient thats the system people get paid for doing things " a stent is implanted through the same catheterization procedure used to determine whether a patient needs the device with little risk of restenosis it becomes easier some say more tempting for doctors to implant a stent even if the angiogram or picture of the vessel is ambiguous "once youre there youve got tubes up there youve got the team ready you might as well do it " says john osborne a preventive cardiologist at cardiac specialty associates of north texas some cardiologists speak half jokingly of an "oculo stenotic reflex" the impulse among doctors to treat any stenosis or obstruction as soon as they see it on an angiogram a wide open vessel treated with a stent looks elegant compared with the hourglass like narrowing that marks the spot where plaque obstructs blood flow stent proponents reject such notions saying the interests of patients drive use of the device most cardiologists "are seeking to provide relief of symptoms " says j p reilly assistant director of cardiac catheterization at ochsner health system new orleans "i dont believe people were hellbent on putting in stents " dr osborne agrees that stents are "good for symptoms " but says their apparent inability to provide significant protection against heart attacks suggests a crucial insight atherosclerosis is a systemic disease not a single obstruction in a blood vessel "stents dont treat the disease they treat the narrowing " he says "were kidding ourselves if we think that just by pushing the plaque around that were treating the disease " dr nissen says his research suggests that in patients with established disease plaques are present in at least of an artery even if a stent successfully prevents a specific plaque from causing a heart attack it only covers perhaps of the disease he says "you cant alter the outcomes of the other " by contrast drugs while less effective in quickly relieving chest pain provide a systemic treatment for the disease treatment guidelines now call for most patients with established heart disease to take aspirin as well as drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure whether or not theyve had a stent yet only about of such patients are consistently taking the recommended regimen "systemic therapies are ultimately going to be more important than a mechanical fix " says paul ridker director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at brigham and womens hospital
