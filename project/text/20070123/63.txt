justin timberlakes well oiled machine los angeles its hard to imagine a pop star entering an arena in his hometown with as much career momentum as did justin timberlake on jan when he performed at the staples center here his "futuresex lovesounds" zomba had been the no album in the u s and two of its songs topped the singles charts he hosted and performed recently on nbcs "saturday night live" a film in which he co stars "alpha dog " opened jan and the announcement of the end of his relationship with actress cameron diaz gave him an extra publicity boost the lanky year old was even pressed into service at the golden globe awards the night before his show accepting an award for prince whose influence is heard throughout the "futuresex lovesounds" disc with all that buzz behind him mr timberlake was on the spot to deliver in concert and he did serving as the focal point of a tight wall shaking and ultimately engaging r&amp b show that drew equally from his new disc and his solo debut "justified" zomba hell continue his tour through march and so tightly choreographed is his two set performance that one senses no show will be better or worse than its predecessor unless the notable hip hop and r&amp b producer timbaland declines to appear his presence gave the show heft and spark it otherwise would have lacked what separates mr timberlake from other stars who blend song and dance to create an arena sized extravaganza madonna and janet jackson come to mind as does michael jackson clearly a model is that he projects very little star power the pop star pink she of the hit "get the party started " opened the show she has a brassy charisma that might overshadow mr timberlake were they to perform together a songwriter with a knack for melody and melodrama mr timberlake is competent at everything else he does but his vocal style is highly derivative of mr jacksons and its easy to lose sight of him when hes gyrating with his phalanx of dancers when hes at the piano or playing the guitar mr timberlake can seem colorless even during his performance of the lovely down tempo "take it from here " since joining the cast of "the mickey mouse club" in and two years later becoming a founding member of the wildly popular boy band n sync mr timberlake seems most effective as part of a team he did here too particularly when he folded his voice into a rich four member choir in "what goes around " despite its flaws mr timberlakes show was superb at times as the screaming youngsters in tiny skirts and ankle wobbling stiletto heels throughout the arena would attest they are mr timberlakes fan base even if the new album strains for an older audience the word "girl" is ubiquitous in his songs and his onstage look recalls a fashion conscious teen dressed up for a big night out gray three piece suit white tie and white sneakers for the first set dark vest and off center red tie for the second his charm is conveyed by a winning smile which is far more effective than his bad boy sneer the sprinkling of profanity in his lyrics and the single digit obscene gesture he used to punctuate an aggressive routine on stage he withstands the tumult around him mr timberlakes band is a whirlwind with two drummers a battery of synthesizers guitars and bass his in concert sound is fatter and more powerful than what he along with timbaland rick rubin and will i am of the black eyed peas created for his new album at times the sound at the staples center was muddled but when it found its level particularly during an effective second set it gave mr timberlake a textured platform for his sweet well crafted ballads and house rocking hits like "damn girl " which punched hard live minus horns a notable instrumental soloist and the possibility of spontaneity mr timberlakes live music is modern technology driven r&amp b but what works well on disc and the dance floor can be leaden and redundant in a vast echoing arena the bands interpretation of the beats gave mr timberlakes performances a needed lift as did timbaland who joined mr timberlake on stage for several hits he produced including "sexyback " for someone better known for his studio work and the occasional guest spot on a music video timbaland displayed an out sized personality on stage and the crowd responded to his exhortations when mr timberlake left the stage between sets timbaland remained joined by two keyboard players he performed beats that recalled mr jacksons best work and as their images were projected on billowing sheets floating above the stage such artists hes produced as missy elliott nellie furtado and aaliyah but mr timberlake was the shows pivot and while its hard to detect a distinct musical personality he is a seasoned performer who no doubt is aware of his limitations his greatest strength may be to draw from more gifted artists and add what he can on this night he did so delivering on the hype with music dance and occasional flashes of the man beneath the veneer of his calculated kind of stardom mr fusilli writes for the journal about popular music justin timberlake and pink in concert selected dates and venues xcel energy center st paul minn
