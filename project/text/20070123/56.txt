illegal health care gop governors arnold schwarzenegger and mitt romney have become media darlings for proposing sweeping state health insurance reforms aimed at achieving "universal" coverage now out of office mr romney is trying to ride his plan to the republican presidential nomination but it turns out state schemes that feature "pay or play" employer taxes or mandates are probably illegal at least thats the clear implication of a significant but underreported ruling last week by the fourth circuit court of appeals which said that marylands "fair share" health legislation otherwise known as "the wal mart tax" violates a federal employee benefits law known by the acronym erisa in this case maryland had sought to require all companies with or more employees to spend at least of their payroll on employee health care or pay the state the difference wal mart happened to be the only employer in maryland large enough to fit that precise definition but it joined with other firms under the retail industry leaders association to challenge the law which was first struck down by a district court last summer judge j frederick motz wrote for that court that "the act violates erisas fundamental purpose of permitting multi state employers to maintain nationwide health and welfare plans providing uniform nationwide benefits and permitting uniform national administration " last weeks fourth circuit ruling affirmed that decision and it could spell trouble for the california and massachusetts schemes leave aside that the plan muscled into law by marylands democratic legislature was far less ambitious the basic similarity is that all three plans feature employer mandates or taxes aimed at changing employee benefit plans in this case by requiring employers to provide health insurance like the maryland law the california plan is explicit on the point and would require all firms with or more employers to provide health care or pay a tax this would seem clearly illegal according to the reasoning of the fourth circuit which also said that the ostensibly "voluntary" nature of the maryland tax was irrelevant from the standpoint of erisa no reasonable firm it said could be expected to choose to pay money to the state to avoid changing its employee benefit plan mr romneys massachusetts scheme is slightly different since it doesnt feature the same kind of percentage tax but not only would massachusetts charge a &# a head fee to employers that dont provide insurance it would also make them liable for the catastrophic medical costs of uninsured employees again this is likely to fall afoul of erisa says one legal expert with whom we spoke because these penalties are aimed at changing employee benefit plans that are supposed to be voluntary according to federal law there were sound reasons that congress decided to create a uniform national regulatory framework when it wrote the erisa law way back in to wit freeing employers from the administrative burden of having to comply with a multitude of state and local requirements leaves them with more money to spend on actual health care and other benefits it doesnt speak well of messrs schwarzenegger and romney and their staffs that they didnt seem to have given this well known legislation much if any thought when crafting their reforms this week brings one other piece of bad news for proponents of the massachusetts model by the way early bids suggest the soon to be compulsory insurance policies that will pass muster under the scheme will be expensive starting at a whopping &# per month or &# a year for an individual thats hardly surprising when you look at costs in other states that overregulate their insurance markets such as new york but its more evidence that the better way to get people covered is to mimic the practices of less regulated states such as connecticut where a year old man can get covered for as little as &# per month were all for state policy experiments but these ballyhooed health care reforms are policy blunders that wont stand scrutiny in court much less in the marketplace see related letters "letters to the editor first class will go down with steerage when health care titanic sinks" wsj feb see related letter "letters to the editor health care reform involves all of us" wsj february
