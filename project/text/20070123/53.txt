health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions mindless eating has clearly been on your minds last weeks column about the distractions and habits that can cause us to unknowingly overeat generated a slew of advice from readers about how they try to manage snacking and food intake one of my favorite tips comes from a reader in philomath ore who suggested brushing your teeth as a way to avoid snacking "ive found that brushing your teeth after every meal helps you resist the temptation to snack " he wrote "of course its good for the teeth too " several readers suggested eating five or six small meals a day rather than big ones and several noted they never skip breakfast one reader suggested using a deck of cards as a way to gauge how big a typical "serving size" of meat should be the same reader stocks her desk and work refrigerator with healthful snacks so she can avoid the temptation of the office snack machine another reader shows how much commitment and effort it can take to lose weight she writes down everything she eats and even used an excel spreadsheet to analyze her eating habits and to take an inventory of the food in her house she also keeps a spare set of measuring cups and spoons at work and uses the web site www calorieking com to look up calories in the foods she eats "while this sounds like a lot of work its become easy to do i like being in control of my body again " she writes "i keep the chicken soup for the dieters soul on my night stand and read a couple of stories every few days to help with staying focused " another reader responding to the notion that people tend to eat more when dining with friends says she encourages her friends to split entrees or order just a few appetizers for the whole table she also often starts a meal noting that she is still full from her last meal so theres less pressure for her to order a lot of food another reader who has lost pounds did so in part by using salad plates instead of dinner size plates to encourage smaller servings the reader also serves up a plate and puts leftovers away before sitting down to eat to avoid the temptation of seconds and when eating out she asks for the to go box at the start of the meal and puts half of her food in the container before starting to eat a doctor wrote to me to share that he advises patients to adopt a minute rule "when tempted to eat a second portion of caloric food i tell my patients and myself to wait minutes before eating any more " he says "it will also give others at the dinner table time to catch up after minutes if they or me is still hungry go ahead with the second helping but at least of the time after minutes youve lost the extreme hunger and dont want the second helping " email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
