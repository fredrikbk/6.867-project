the morning brief the limits of speech in a troubled presidency the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the vast powers of the u s presidency make it a little silly to question whether the leader in the oval office has lost his relevancy after all president bush is going ahead with plans to deploy additional u s troops to iraq in the face of bipartisan resistance in congress and opposition from a majority of americans but his increasing isolation in polls and in washington does raise the question of just what he can accomplish with tonights state of the union address mr bushs advisers tell the new york times his speech will "re energize" the white houses domestic agenda with its bipartisan and ambitious tone "the power of the ideas requires people to take notice and take seriously important domestic initiatives " presidential counselor dan bartlett argues but as the wall street journal says "much of the public has stopped listening to him " a new poll from the journal and nbc news indicates that only of americans want mr bush to set policy for the country that just express confidence in his goals and that only approve how he has handled the war a new washington post abc news poll find that "for the first time majorities of americans say bush cannot be trusted in a crisis has not made the country safer and should withdraw u s forces from iraq to avoid further casualties rather than leave them until civil order is restored " according to the post a bigger majority now opposes the bigger troop deployment than the margin against it when mr bush announced his policy change jan the post adds the white house and mr bush himself have said he will offer sweeping new proposals to improve health care in the u s and reduce the countrys reliance on oil but many of the health care ideas enter the debate with little white house political capital to see them through a gantlet of organized opposition democratic rep pete stark chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee on health has said he wont consider mr bushs proposed changes to the tax code which would give tax breaks to people who purchase private health insurance while making employer provided health benefits taxable income and which would cost the federal government millions of dollars in lost revenue the post reports at the state level mr bush also wants to divert federal aid to hospitals to help pay to cover the uninsured a move likely to draw criticisms from cities around the country as the times reports the white house has saved most details of mr bushs energy proposals for tonights speech but administration officials briefed some lawmakers on the policies yesterday one senate aide tells the times the plan will be "very ambitious" in the promotion of alternative energy sources and could include the improvement in fuel standards for cars that would mark a continued ebbing of the bush administrations early resistance to conservation efforts and any large scale move to replace the use of fossil fuels and the president is also expected to offer more acknowledgement than he has in the past that human activity contributes to global warming but such energy concessions he has made in the past translated into scant change in policy al hubbard chairman of the national economic council recently predicted his boss will generate "headlines above the fold that will knock your socks off in terms of our commitment to energy independence " and daniel yergin head of cambridge energy research associates suggests in a journal op ed piece that a call for "energy independence" will be at the center of debate over energy policy in the coming months but mr yergin questions what "energy independence" could mean "for a &# trillion economy that uses the equivalent of million barrels of oil every day " "is it realistic and achievable " he asks "or is it rhetorical overreach that will lead as in the past to disappointment and cynicism the kind that drives the cycles of inconsistency in energy policy and leaves the u s no less vulnerable the latter is more likely at least without a realistic appraisal of the u s position and the countrys possibilities " mr yergin argues that emphasizing a central goal of diversifying energy sources and recognition of energy interdependence with other nations would make for a more constructive path growing opposition to iraq policy a day before the state of the union senior senate republicans joined the opposition to mr bushs new plans for iraq "the american gi was not trained not sent over there certainly not by resolution of this institution to be placed in the middle of a fight between the sunni and shia and the wanton and just incomprehensible killing thats going on at this time " said sen john warner the ranking republican on the armed services committee mr warner and other senators from both parties offered a nonbinding resolution that opposes the new deployment of more troops and urges the white house to find an alternative strategy its tone is softer than one offered by fellow republican chuck hagel with other democrats last week and the journal says it "showed promise last night of sparking negotiations on a compromise able to maximize support from both parties " sen warners move to break ranks with the white house followed a weekend of violence in iraq that saw the deaths of u s service members and it came the same day insurgents set off car bombs in baghdad that killed at least people in what the los angeles times described as a possible "warning sign that sunni arab militants will challenge the proposed u s playbook for calming the countrys sectarian violence " parsing the personnel push at citigroup the head turning personnel moves yesterday among citigroups top ranks raised a lot of questions and about the only aspect many industry observers seemed in agreement about was that the banking giants turnaround aims havent yet gained traction chairman and chief executive charles o prince described sallie l krawchecks move from chief financial officer to head of the firms wealth management businesses as a promotion in returning to a job she left about two years ago ms krawcheck succeeds todd thomson who had in turn been cfo before he took the current post and whose free spending ways seem to clash with an increasingly cost conscious attitude at the financial conglomerate citigroup said mr thomson is leaving the company "to pursue other interests " and his departure raises the question of whether "ms krawcheck was being promoted and possibly groomed to be the next ceo " american banker says but the magazine adds another question had "she failed at her first c level executive post dimming her chances of becoming the ceo one day " both mr thomson and ms krawcheck were once "rising stars" at citigroup and seen as potential successors to mr prince the new york times adds but the paper views yesterdays moves as "implicit acknowledgment of criticism that they were not the ones to lead a turnaround at citigroup " the times also notes robert a druskin recently promoted to chief operating officer is a few years older than mr prince and isnt viewed among the ranks of possible successors what the double switcheroo does mean the wall street journal says is that mr prince is "on the hot seat to deliver a quick rebound" for citigroup "the shake up comes as wall street increasingly questions the business model behind citigroup a global behemoth that contains a huge corporate and retail bank a major investment bank a big trading operation a brokerage firm and securities lending operations under one roof " the journal notes this strategy and citibanks poor stock performance contrast with more focused approaches at rivals like bank of america and goldman sachs group testing the value of acupuncture on mice there has been little scientifically produced evidence thus far to support the use of acupuncture to treat pain and illness but nature reports that a new unusual study on mice suggests it "has a marked effect" in slowing the kind of brain inflammation seen in parkinsons disease since mice cant tell whether they are being treated for illness or not a study using mice has the advantage of stripping out any placebo effect to examine how acupuncture might help the brain where low levels of the chemical dopamine are associated with parkinsons a team at kyung hee university in seoul used mice who were injected with a chemical that kills off the brain cells that manufacture dopamine "some of the injected mice then received acupuncture every two days in two spots one behind the knee and one on top of the foot" spots that in humans are considered by acupuncturists to be involved in muscle movement which is hindered by parkinsons nature reports another group of mice received acupuncture in two spots on the hips that arent considered effective for acupuncture and a third group had no acupuncture at all seven days later while the latter two groups had a decrease in dopamine levels in the acupuncture treated group nearly of the dopamine remained nature says the south korean research team suspects "that because inflammation in the brain often accompanies and worsens other symptoms of parkinsons disease acupuncture might maintain dopamine levels by preventing inflammation " also of note businessweek with its dispatch of jobs and a handful of research and manufacturing
