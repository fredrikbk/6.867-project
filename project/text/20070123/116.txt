the doctors office taking some lessons from medical student assistants keeps this physician up to date on latest in care my medical student and i were trying to make sense of a complicated patient with unusual visual disturbances emotional distress and an old chart thats about three inches thick her visual problems started after a horrific auto accident two years ago that left a teenager severely injured from the depths of her purse the patient produced a series of octopus like drawings made on white index cards with a black marker the images she said described what she saw as "tentacles in her vision " our patient had seen an ophthalmologist a neurologist and a retinal specialist and had undergone comprehensive tests they found that the patients eye and brain were physically normal now it was rachels turn to try to help the patient whose story was unusual and who seemed dramatic rachel listened without judging and took time to gain the patients trust quiet and non threatening she seems less of an imposing authority figure than the typical big city doctor together we made the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder and a conversion reaction with the eye problem we started the patient on medication and gave her a referral to a mental health clinic rachel wenger the fourth year medical student is my sidekick for hours on the average day plus middle of the night deliveries early morning surgeries and weekend rounds she travels with me between the hospital and offices in three different counties as a future rural family physician shes completing the last four months of her medical school career out in the country with me after that shell move on for at least three more years of on the job training known as residency our daily curriculum comes from the concerns the patients bring to us rachel has delivered babies helped me cast fractures sutured the lacerations from a fist fight and made nursing home rounds shes seen many routine cases and a few rare cases like the congenital heart defect tetralogy of fallot with most every patient i send her in first and let her figure out what to do then i see the patient and figure out if shes right i supervise students closely and i prescribe medications or give treatment only after my own evaluation students and i sometimes disagree on who needs an antibiotic i will often get more of the story because i ask questions differently or by asking things a second time new information comes out ive had a student with me full time for ten of the past twelve months we dont charge for any of the services the students perform and dont rely on them for documentation of care so whats in it for me lots of things students help me keep up to date on my knowledge by asking a lot of questions teaching has also been good for the development my practice both of my partners are former medical students of mine to help keep a steady stream of rural physician candidates i participate on the volunteer faculty for two medical schools each within about miles all of my teaching is done through my practice not the lecture hall my partner has a third year medical student with her for six months his grandmother is a patient of mine most of our students are in a special rural training program to select students from rural backgrounds to prepare them for rural practice we participate because medical students who are from rural areas are an endangered species and studies suggest medical students from rural areas are more likely to pursue careers in family medicine medical schools do not put enough of an emphasis on likelihood of serving underserved communities in their admissions processes click here for more information i know a community based approach toward training and recruiting doctors works my partners and i also went through a program designed to recruit and retain doctors for rural practice with the narrow exception of some women patients not wanting to work with male students my patients generally enjoy having the students help with their care and have been very accepting of them they ask about the students when theyve moved on or graduated some drop off extra baked goods for them and encourage them to come back to the area to practice for the patients sake and mine i hope theyre persuasive write to dr benjamin brewer at thedoctorsoffice wsj com
