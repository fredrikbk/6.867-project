leisure &amp arts bookshelf say what they want to hear and if possible mean it words that work by frank luntz hyperion pages &# a few weeks after president reagan delivered his state of the union address dick wirthlin the presidents pollster met with the white house speechwriting staff of which i was a member in the first and only presentation of its kind to reagans writers dick shared the results of a new polling technique pulse or dial testing forty or randomly selected voters had been assembled to watch the state of the union address each was given an electronic response device twisting the dial to zero meant that the listener hated what was being said and that he couldnt get enough of it with the numbers in between registering gradations of response results were averaged and appeared as a temperature chart line over a linear printout of the text to prepare the speech tony dolan the head of the speechwriting office had given each writer a section to draft with tony editing the parts into a final whole as it happened a phrase i had written regarding volunteer and nonprofit local organizations "a thousand sparks of genius in a thousand communities" had caused the temperature line to blow through the top of the chart "we need to keep an eye on this one " dick said of the formulation that later in other hands morphed into "a thousand points of light " it was the beginning of the now common practice of isolating through dial tests the exact phrases to which the public responds then playing them back in speeches statements and advertising pollster frank luntz calls these hyper tested terms "words that work " mr luntz emerged as a celebrity pollster after serving as an adviser to ross perots successful effort to sink president george h w bushs re election bid and newt gingrichs successful effort to end the year democratic party hold on the house now he has produced in "words that work " a book that offers his prescriptions for public communications political and otherwise it would be easy to use a few words that work to lampoon this volume far from original mr luntzs central theme "its not what you say its what the public hears" comes straight out of dale carnegies "how to win friends and influence people " his chapter on "ten rules of effective language" includes the essential ideas of strunk and whites "the elements of style " in big black bordered boxes he admiringly quotes bland passages from two ceos these offer examples of "words that work " mr luntz asserts but do they both men pfizers hank mckinnell and fords bill ford have recently fallen victim to board revolts and mr luntz displays an off putting taste for glitz and glam the opening scene finds him at the center of a hollywood party in the home of trans ideological "political activist to the stars" mr luntzs term arianna huffington mr luntz is the evenings guru of honor chosen to lecture the likes of rob reiner and norman lear "luminaries of the hollywood left" on why george w bush then led john kerry in the polls yet despite the over selling and self promotion "words that work" deserves an attentive read mr luntz offers a fair amount of good advice to anyone who must communicate publicly most important "be the message " by this he means that if you want to talk the talk and be believed you must walk the walk which is to say you must mean what you say and act on it integrity sells as the book develops mr luntzs "words that work" turn out to be portals for his clients to think hard about what they and their opponents stand for and how to align their positions more closely with what their audiences actually care about this isnt hocus pocus its just the result of hard work careful thought and empathy the staples of all intelligent public discourse thats the bright side of mr luntzs work then there is the dark side mr luntz describes the american people on the whole as ill read provincial sullen and frightened they are he says susceptible to mere rhetoric and responsive to arguably bogus appeals to values no matter what the facts true his analysis of the election doesnt fit this portrait he sees former gop voters as all too well informed about the performance of the last congress and not liking it still mr luntzs own public statements and many passages in "words that work" suggest that often for him communication is really just a form of manipulation the left has focused on mr luntzs more cynical statements as proof that only the gops masterly use of language a product of his machiavellian guidance put the party in power the most prolific proponent of this evil genius to be copied view of mr luntz is george lakoff a berkeley professor of cognitive science and linguistics in his volume "dont think of an elephant " mr lakoff holds up mr luntz as "the rights language man " mr lakoff has made a name for himself by telling liberals that all they have to do is in luntz like fashion find the right words the right "frame " in his lexicon and the public will tag along this profoundly undemocratic view has won mr lakoff a considerable following among democratic party leaders blurb contributors to "dont think of an elephant" include howard dean george soros and robert reich if they want to consolidate their recent victories mr luntzs admirers on the left would do well to see in him the doer behind the cynic and self marketer like focus groups and polling dial testing is simply a way of listening and leaders listening are part of responsive government thats when words work best mr judge a former special assistant to president reagan is head of the white house writers group in washington see related letter "letters to the editor just let polsters choose our leaders " wsj jan
