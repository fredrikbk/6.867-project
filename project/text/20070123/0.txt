energy independence a cry is being heard across the nation and loudly so in washington it is the call for "energy independence " and it will be at the center of the national energy debate over the next several months providing the rationale for new policies and expansion of existing ones indeed one might even anticipate a "declaration of energy independence" this july but what does "energy independence" mean for a &# trillion economy that uses the equivalent of million barrels of oil every day is it realistic and achievable or is it rhetorical overreach that will lead as in the past to disappointment and cynicism the kind that drives the cycles of inconsistency in energy policy and leaves the u s no less vulnerable the latter is more likely at least without a realistic appraisal of the u s position and the countrys possibilities but "energy independence" can provide a constructive framework for policy if it is properly thought through and the realities are recognized with geopolitical turmoil volatile prices and continuing reminders of the international political power of oil the concept of energy independence is compelling and deeply appealing in fact it has been appealing for quite some time the idea was introduced by richard nixon in november three weeks after the arab oil embargo when he introduced "project independence" and pledged that the u s would within seven years "meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign energy source " it was a bold assertion but one that puzzled his own advisers "i cut the reference to independence three times from the drafts but it kept being put back " recalled richard fairbanks a drafter of the speech "finally i called over and was told that it came from the old man himself " nixon knew that energy independence was something that americans would crave after the oil shock he deliberately modeled his project independence on john f kennedys apollo goal of getting a man on the moon within a decade back then the goal may have seemed only somewhat unlikely after all when nixon began his political career after world war ii the country already had a long history of energy independence and then some for it had actually been the worlds no oil exporter indeed out of seven billion barrels of oil used by the allies in world war ii six billion were produced in the u s by the late s the u s had become a net importer of oil although the real surge in imports did not begin until the s it proved much easier to get a man on the moon than to make a nation energy independent in the three and a half decades since nixon the u s has gone from importing a third of its oil to importing and that share is set to continue rising the country is on a similar path for natural gas which is about of our total energy usage north american supply has flattened out yet large amounts of new natural gas fired electric power generation have been added over the last decade which means that demand will increase natural gas is also used in the making of ethanol adding to the demand growth this means growing imports of liquefied natural gas lng rising from of our current demand to more than by all of which suggests that thought needs to be given both to what energy independence means and what can be achieved for right now the u s is moving at some speed in the opposite direction toward greater integration into the global energy markets how dependent is the u s if we look at total energy including coal nuclear and a small but growing share from renewables the country is over self sufficient oil refined into liquid fuels for transportation is where most of the current dependence comes from the risks do not owe to direct imports from the middle east contrary to the widespread belief some of oil imports do not come from that region thus only of imports and of total petroleum consumption originates in the middle east our largest source of oil imports is canada its also the source of most of our current natural gas imports via pipelines one can hardly say that either canada or energy imports from canada constitute a major threat to national security the energy trade is part of a normal trading relationship with the country with which were conjoined economically and which just happens to be our biggest trading partner our second largest source is mexico with which we are also in a dense relationship mexico depends upon oil for about a third of total government revenues the picture becomes more complex when one turns to our third largest source of oil imports venezuela the once much discussed "hemispheric energy solidarity" loses much of its resonance when balanced against the "stcentury socialism" of venezuelas hugo chavez after all president chavez is currently nationalizing the private sector has on occasion threatened to embargo oil shipments to the u s and is putting much effort into fashioning an anti u s alliance the latest manifestation being the visit of iranian president ahmadinejad to caracas these are not the actions one normally associates with a good friend or a reliable trading partner yet the source of imports is significant only up to a point energy security is a global issue although oil around the world varies greatly in terms of physical qualities and transportation costs there is only one world oil market so disruptions and loss of supply in one place radiate throughout the global market and global politics affecting consumers everywhere even if the u s did not import a drop of oil it would still be vulnerable to turmoil involving oil outside its borders what are the prospects for "energy independence" in the way that richard nixon defined it years ago that is s style "autarky" and total self sufficiency based on where we are today very small at least for a couple of decades in terms of vehicles as pointed out in our new study on "gasoline and the american people " only about of the auto fleet turns over every year so the lead times are long for more efficient vehicles to enter the fleet ethanol derived from corn is on track to grow to about of our total gasoline pool in a few years this is certainly not inconsequential it represents diversification and is equivalent to creating a new indonesia level oil producing country in americas midwest but signs are already evident of an upper bound on corn based ethanol as the fuel versus food trade off pushes up corn prices setting off vocal protests from livestock growers and dairy farmers and in due course from those who buy breakfast cereals and soft drinks made with high fructose corn syrup what about technological advances that provide new answers there is a "great bubbling" all along the innovation frontier of energy ranging from conventional energy and efficiency to especially renewables alternatives and "clean tech " activity this wide ranging has never been witnessed before the impact could well be considerable or even transformative one would be very hard pressed today however to say when and what form this impact will take in the end if energy independence is presented as self sufficiency it will likely fall flat and as prices run through their cycles disappointment will undermine the longer term commitments that are required for a sound energy future today quite simply cutting ourselves off from global energy markets is not realistic but if the goal of energy independence is understood differently to mean energy security resilience robustness reduced vulnerability then it is much more useful this kind of definition recognizes that trade in itself is not bad at the same time it emphasizes the central goal of diversification encouraging investment and higher levels of research and development in both alternative and conventional energy sources it means a new push for energy conservation higher energy efficiency lower energy intensity a theme that german chancellor angela merkel will make the centerpiece of her agenda as chairman of the g countries later this year it certainly requires a consistent commitment to pushing the innovation frontier in ways that eventually lead to economically competitive alternatives and new technologies and it requires an understanding that this kind of energy independence as measured in energy security actually requires interdependence with other nations both consumers and producers of energy indeed how we manage our relations with other countries and other regions is a very essential ingredient for our own energy well being mr yergin chairman of
