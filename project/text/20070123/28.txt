casinos divide to conquer gambling firms consider splitting real estate from operating companies to cash in on lucrative las vegas land streamline hotels and resorts blackjack players who are dealt a pair of aces often "split" the cards into separate hands giving them two shots at hitting the jackpot now some casino companies are considering a split of their own effectively dividing their real estate assets from the operating companies that run the casinos it is a model that gained traction more than a decade ago in the hotel industry when companies split off their physical real estate holdings from their hotel management operations these days some wall street investment bankers are peddling the same idea to the gambling industry especially in the wake of a flurry of deal making highlighted by the recent agreement to sell harrahs entertainment inc to a group of private equity investors for &# billion plus the assumption of &# billion in debt another attraction the real estate assets held by the casino companies have skyrocketed in value properties and land on the las vegas strip in particular have commanded unprecedented prices in the past two years making a separate real estate company a potentially attractive play "ive been bombarded by banks that are showing me these transactions and its thought provoking " says jim murren president of mgm mirage harrahs chief rival in las vegas "the intensity of the light is increasing dramatically on gambling and the harrahs deal is going to stimulate more transactions in the industry along the lines of leveraged buyouts and splitting companies into separate entities " mr murren adds "no one can tell me that with private equity buying pure hotel companies at times cash flow and the best hotel gaming companies are trading at nine to times cash flow that we dont have a better business opportunity here " harrahs and mgm mirage have looked at this model in the past and it could be a viable alternative for companies like mgm mirage and others for an industry that in nevada alone earned &# billion on revenue of nearly &# billion in the fiscal year ended june the idea of splitting off buildings that sit on highly valued pieces of land is enticing so too is the thought of streamlining operating companies into lean organizations that simply run the hotels restaurants and most importantly squeeze the cash from the casinos but it isnt so easy to break apart gambling resorts the biggest hurdle strict state licensing regulations that involve exhaustive and arduous background investigations and hearings for individuals who wish to own or operate casinos the hotel industry saw the successful split in of the former marriott corp into two publicly traded companies host hotels &amp resorts inc formerly host marriott is the real estate investment trust while marriott international inc largely manages and franchises the companys brands and in recent years the major operators including marriott starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc and hilton hotels corp have adopted an "asset light" business model under this model which is used world wide operators sell their hotels to third party real estate firms and then sign long term contracts to manage the properties "if its done right the individual parts could end up with higher values than the sum of the parts today " says christopher nassetta president and chief executive at host hotels &amp resorts inc in marriotts case the newly formed real estate concern held on to the hotel companys accumulated debt one of the most contentious issues in the process of splitting the company apart says matt hart now president at hilton at the time he worked with stephen bollenbach who became chief executive of host marriott "during that cycle in the early s real estate ownership of hotels wasnt really favorable and figuring out where the debt went made it tricky " mr hart says the new operating company that was spun off today is known as marriott international mr bollenbach is now ceo of marriott rival hilton he is also an independent director at harrahs and led the special committee of independent directors who handled the recently announced harrahs deal over the past three years money has flowed into hotel deals but breaking up the big casino companies or even smaller ones like station casinos inc and boyd gaming corp involves more than simply casino licenses issues regarding taxes transfer of pricing debt allocation as well as the cost of recurring maintenance and upgrades are all serious considerations and unlike hotels casinos often provide their hotel rooms and dining options to many guests at a steep discount and sometimes without charge to lure them into casinos a hotel owner would likely need to be compensated by the operating company to make up for lost room revenue even a move toward a model where individual properties are sold off but the casino company retains a management contract to run both the hotel and casino could potentially hit snags with gambling regulators but some observers say unlicensed hotel owners could potentially lease the casinos to licensed gambling operators thereby keeping the cash generated in the casino off the hotels books and maintaining the necessary separation between the owners and operators gary loveman harrahs chairman and chief executive said last month that his company would consider individual asset sales in the wake of the private equity buyout by apollo management lp and texas pacific group yet there likely wont be a split of the company or a wholesale divesture of the casinos the company owns or operates much of the leveraged buyouts value is contained in harrahs customer loyalty program known as "total rewards " mr loveman said it would be foolhardy to alter or destroy the system that connects each casino in the harrahs network and provides perks for its gamblers
