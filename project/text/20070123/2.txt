act one nevermind the bullets gunfire and graffiti aside there are upsides to living in neighborhoods with low rents when david vallas years old decided to take a year off from his lucrative job as a systems engineer and move from anchorage alaska to pennsylvania where he grew up he needed to do it cheaply he wanted to relax hang out with his dog and maybe write a book his girlfriend would be the breadwinner but she didnt have a job lined up in philadelphia he grew up in the suburbs but she was set on the city in december they moved into an &# a month two bedroom house in west philadelphia a part of town that is cheaper than many other neighborhoods the two story unit is within their budget and has a washer dryer and yard but mr vallas is not relaxed in early january he and his girlfriend heard gunshots outside their door they huddled in the basement police arrived and chased a suspect along the side of their house an officer at philadelphias th precinct casually characterizes the incident as an argument between two acquaintances not a homicide "in the end a bullet went through our right neighbors window " says mr vallas "four bullets went through our upstairs neighbors car police tape was strewn across our porch " when a neighbor later suggested that the chipped bricks on the side of his house were the result of bullet ricochet not from the mayhem in january but from a shooting incident three months before mr vallas and his girlfriend decided to move for young adults on a tight budget in the city moving to a less expensive and less fashionable neighborhood is a way to make ends meet the hood has perks in addition to more space for less money we may find historic housing stock a bohemian atmosphere and vibrant multicultural communities many of us were brought up in the suburbs now we either cant afford to move back or cant stomach the prospect of being so isolated and bored ever again but as mr vallas learned there may be irreconcilable downsides besides gunshots mr vallas says theres a litany of problems on his block there are two condemned buildings their backyard is actually a mudflat where neighborhood dogs jump the fence and attack their doberman pinscher phoenix the front porch attracts uninvited neighbors who leave empty pepsi bottles and chip bags in their wake one neighbor relieved himself on the side of mr vallas house next month he and his girlfriend will move to a pricier part of town near phillys posh rittenhouse square where theyll rent a smaller apartment for &# a month "theres less likely to be a shooting there " says capt benjamin naish a spokesperson for the philadelphia police department others who cope with inner city conditions may be amused by the cat calls of local lotharios and appreciate graffiti these hearty individuals can be rewarded for their patience hrag vartanian is one of them he first moved to new york citys bushwick neighborhood in brooklyn six years ago when the area was in bad shape much of bushwick burned in riots looting and arson prompted by a blackout and the housing stock still hadnt recovered in mr vartanians rent for an square foot loft was &# a month quite low for a comparable space in fancier city districts the price was right he was single a free lance writer and earning just over &# a year working at a nonprofit in manhattan he says he wanted to live alone with more space and light to do his writing than he had in a basement apartment he had shared in manhattan in bushwicks rd police precinct had violent crime complaints including rape felony assault and murder five miles south in brooklyns tony park slope neighborhood the th precinct had violent crime complaints the same year mr vartanian says he was robbed of his cellphone once while walking down the street attacked once by muggers and he says there was a crack house at the end of his street the neighborhood had small grocery stores and only a few restaurants where he says the staff often gave him the cold shoulder but he puts a positive spin on it "it encouraged us to cook " he says he laughed at the teenage wise guys who heckled him and befriended his fellow tenants a carpenter a bartender a writer an artist "it put me at the epicenter of creative life in new york " he says mr vartanian and other creative types may have helped spur bushwicks continuing gentrification though he says his rent has not increased significantly in the past six years nearby loft spaces of the same size listed on craigslist com are on the rental market now for &# to &# a month a couple of hip restaurants have arrived and quirky residents of the areas copious converted warehouses host dance performances d j parties rock concerts and open studio tours that make it into blogs newspapers and magazines mr vartanian says that "the new york times " long absent from neighborhood shops is finally available the crack house went out of business its building has been refurbished and adorned with a graffiti mural of penguins sanctioned by its owner the number of violent crime complaints in the rd precinct was down to in young adults have been homesteading in neglected urban neighborhoods since after world war ii according to geographer neil smith an author and professor who studies gentrification at new yorks cuny graduate center artists did it long before in spurts he says now gentrification by the poorer younger crowd is almost systematic in cities around the world that doesnt mean we will reap the benefits when the neighborhoods become trendy unless we buy we may eventually have to leave when the urban trenches become rose gardens and rents rise accordingly "people who are moving in at the front end of the process often become victims along with the long time residents of the very gentrification that they helped foment " says mr smith in atlanta andy sisk says he and his wife bought a three bedroom house in the edgewood neighborhood two years ago for &# "in the suburbs of atlanta we could have found a cheaper house but traffic is notoriously bad and theyre cookie cutter housing developments " mr sisk a financial analyst at a real estate fund figures that the value of his bungalow has appreciated about each quarter on average since he bought it based on atlanta real estate price appreciation rates from the office of federal housing enterprise oversight "early on we suffered two home break ins and one stolen car stereo " he says "but we began to adapt i enjoy being close to the cultural center of atlanta where i can catch a play or go to the aquarium " mr sisk says the eclectic mix of people in his neighborhood has exposed him to sorts of people he didnt meet growing up in the small georgia city of warner robins "it has been nice to not worry about keeping up with the joneses next door " he says part of the reason mr sisk chose the neighborhood in is because he foresaw a demographic transition and subsequent increase in the value of homes he says in chorus barnes &amp noble target and best buy arrived with other "big box" stores a year later however atlanta police department crime statistics show that rates of violent crime robbery and burglary have gone up in mr sisks neighborhood in the past two years while crime there is not the citys worst its not low either in texas christian stagg bought a three bedroom house in east austins govalle neighborhood last august for &# about &# less than the median home price in the metropolitan area austins city demographer ryan robinson describes govalle as a "historically undervalued barrio thats gentrifying its the last part of the urban core thats affordable " he says ms stagg grew up in rural idaho she works in development at a university and produces theater with her husband the house was in their budget "people always ask me do you walk around at night by yourself but i feel pretty safe " she says their lawn mower was stolen but otherwise the neighborhood has been hospitable she can walk to the theaters she works in and to an organic farm a few blocks away where she gets the bulk of her groceries "after growing up in a rural community where you are so dependent on cars its huge "
