others with lean budgets are going gourmet last fall union foods newcorp of irvine calif launched several ramen noodle products including gourmet snack noodles soup and mamma mia microwaveable noodles that are low in sodium have no monosodium glutamate and no trans fats the company also is pushing new noodle lines infused with vegetables as well as ones with spices and sauces that appeal to different ethnic tastes union foods one of the smallest players in the ramen noodle market with an estimated market share according to the company is betting that its souped up noodles will differentiate its offerings and help it better compete with larger rivals nissin foods usa co and maruchan inc at a time when growth has stagnated in the dried soup foods category the company is hoping to lure among others people who once feasted on ramen noodles in their youth but are now looking for a healthier alternative to that end union foods hopes to eventually use its healthier and more expensive products to shift away from lower cost retailers and into higher end stores like those of whole foods markets inc which specialize in more healthful fare "theres been such a view that ramen is really low end stuff and we dont believe that our products should be in that low end market " says victor sim chief executive of solafide inc a private equity firm that acquired union foods in june as union foods experience shows small companies can find it difficult to compete in a niche market when their products become commoditized and the industry is dominated by one or two large low cost producers and while launching a new product line is a way for companies to differentiate themselves the move is fraught with uncertainty in tweaking its products and marketing message to make an impact on the industry and make a profit union foods will have to walk the fine line of capitalizing on its traditions while promoting whats new "i think the challenge is finding a balance in retaining taste and retaining affinity to your consumers and offering them a better product and making them feel better about their choices " says debra joester president and chief executive of joester loria group a new york based licensing and branding firm she says the name change to snack noodles with no reference to ramen could alienate some consumers instant ramen noodles which typically come in a cup or a square package that costs cents to cents a pop is well entrenched as a cheap quick meal just add hot water some packaged ingredients and let it sit for three minutes but

billion packages sold in according to the japan based international ramen manufacturers association china is no but u s ramen sales have been sliding due to the explosive growth of ready to serve

shrimp according to a report by mintel international group a consumer research firm until recently instant ramen noodles hadnt changed significantly since they were created in japan in by momofuku ando the recently deceased founder and chairman of nissin food products ltd a market leader in the ramen category at union foods though big change is under way which the company hopes will boost sales the company says it broke even last year with revenue of &# million to &# million mr sim expects revenue to climb to &# million to &# million with &# million to &# million in profit in addition to taking the unhealthy ingredients out of its noodles union foods is putting good stuff into a more diversified line of products for instance its injecting noodles with vegetables like spinach and beets it offers a line of "picante " or spicy noodles called enchilosa and came out in october with a higher end product called fiesta that comes in a biodegradable container not the traditional styrofoam both target hispanic consumers union foods also launched in december an asian market product called dae jang gum which uses a spice based on kimchi a traditional korean dish of spicy pickled vegetables such as napa cabbage and its new mamma mia spinach noodles with alfredo sauce is packaged in a biodegradable cornstarch and paper container all this new goodness is going to cost consumers though &# to &# each compared with to cents for its original ramen noodles which the company still sells mr sim says his ultimate goal is to attract interest from high end food retailers like whole foods of austin texas and trader joes co monrovia calif he says the company is in the early stages of sending them samples but a healthier approach alone may not be enough to garner the attention of these stores the fact that union foods had never had a product to appeal to them will make it much harder to persuade those stores to carry the new ramen line so far union foods has made some inroads in the healthy market mark trotter chief executive of yonaturals inc a san diego based maker of vending machines that serve healthy items plans to soon put the new ramen noodles in his hot meals vending machines where people have access to microwaves and hot water including corporate campuses for now though union foods is banking on traditional outlets to drive business in november the eleven
