king pharmaceuticals sets unusual play super bowl spot to cite risks of target disease but wont name drug many advertisers see the super bowl as a perfect opportunity to get their name in front of the biggest television audience of the year this year one marketer is taking the opposite tack a super bowl ad that doesnt mention its product at all king pharmaceuticals a midsize drug company that markets altace a drug that combats high blood pressure is buying for the first time a national spot in next months big game but the ad produced in association with the american heart association wont mention altace instead the second spot which is to appear in the second quarter of the game and is crafted by publicis groupes glow worm agency will tell viewers about the risks of having high blood pressure using a character dressed as a human heart the spot directs viewers to an american heart association web site where they can take a test and determine if they ought to consult with a physician the only way viewers will know who made the spot will be if they notice king pharmaceuticals logo which will appear discreetly on screen king expects the ad will boost the number of consumers asking doctors about medication to help prevent high blood pressure and related illnesses such as stroke as altace has to of the market for two of the main categories of blood pressure medication king expects to benefit from any increased prescriptions says steve andrzejewski kings chief commercial officer some in the ad business think this approach works only for companies that dominate the market so called unbranded spots which aim to educate consumers about a medical condition and thereby promote an entire category of drugs have become more common in recent years as pharmaceutical companies have come under criticism for spending heavily on tv ads promoting specific drugs the unbranded spots have some advantages over drug specific ads for one thing marketers dont have to worry about regulatory rules requiring them to talk about the many side effects each medication might have says richard evans an industry consultant unbranded ads also typically suggest viewers check out the marketers web site for more information visits that can yield consumer information useful in building a marketing database still these spots only make sense for a drug maker that has " to of the business " says michael guarini president of wpp groups ogilvy healthworld for those players getting " new people to the doctor" can mean " new prescriptions " he says brands that dont dominate the market "cant expect to do that well " he says kings tactic is "a little bit curious " king is betting most of its annual budget for consumer directed advertising on the spot and two related ads with a tv audience that regularly reaches million people in the u s super bowl ads tend to command record prices this year reaching &# million or more for a second spot king is spending &# million for the second quarter ad a short five second "bumper" spot during the broadcast and a post game spot in contrast the company spent around &# million on consumer ads for altace in and around &# million in the first nine months of according to tns media intelligence the bulk of kings altace marketing dollars are spent promoting the drug to physicians and other medical professionals rather than consumers executives from the bristol tenn company believe the money will be well spent "there is nothing as strong as the super bowl to give you quick impact to a wide audience " mr andrzejewski says running a campaign with the drugs name in it would require more advertising to be effective he says and more spending working in kings favor is that in one major category of blood pressure medication ace inhibitors altace is one of the few major consumer advertisers the category is dominated by generic drugs that dont do much traditional advertising ad spending on altace therefore has represented the bulk of spending in this category in recent years still some on madison avenue question whether the ad will play well next to commercials for soda chips and beer that dominate the super bowl broadcast "the super bowl is not the place for health care brands period " says anne devereux chief executive of omnicom groups tbwa world health "health care advertising on tv works when the recipient is in a mindset to pay attention and take action if there ever was a time when the consumer wants to suspend all reality and just enjoy themselves " she says it is the super bowl indeed in two makers of erectile dysfunction drugs that bought spots during the super bowl ran into criticism that it wasnt the right forum for the spots mr andrzejewski says kings super bowl ads avoid conventional themes often seen in pharmaceutical ads such as doctors in white lab coats in favor of a concept that is designed to be more entertaining to a large audience prior to this effort consumer oriented ads for altace had featured golf legend jack nicklaus mr andrzejewski says that campaign which ended last fall had "mixed results " the value of altace prescriptions fell in to about &# million according to wolters kluwer health from around &# million in the new advertising approach follows the expiration at the end of last year of a co marketing agreement between king and wyeth pharmaceuticals that governed altace now king has more of an opportunity to guide marketing for the drug mr andrzejewski says
