ciscos homegrown experiment slower growth forces networking company to be its own start up san jose calif last march cisco systems inc chief executive john chambers sat in a cramped conference room as engineers hooked up three adjoining inch television sets with microphones and cameras soon a high definition image of engineers assembled in a room elsewhere on the companys campus flickered onto the screen "hello " they chirped through the tv to the ceo according to several people who attended the meeting it wasnt exactly "mr watson come here " but it was a big moment for the networking hardware giant the telepresence high end video conferencing system is a test of ciscos new plan to juice growth create new products especially those outside its core networking gear from scratch on its own in the past cisco bought companies to add new products to its portfolio rather than make products on its own most of its in house innovation has been directed at markets where it already is a key player but to make the video teleconferencing system cisco engineers shopped around for parts at their local home depot and frys electronics stores they welded parts together in ciscos parking lot they spent months testing the system out "were basically an internal start up " says marthin de beer a cisco veteran who is leading the three year old emerging markets technology group "were to operate in entirely new markets its a new infrastructure " the group is another example of how slowing growth has forced new approaches at cisco after expanding rapidly in the late s by selling routers switches and other equipment that carries internet traffic over networks ciscos business has matured the companys high double digit growth rate has slowed to low double and single digits to recapture some of its former glory cisco is trying to jump start new growth by making completely new products outside of networking gear on its own "we are transitioning from being just a technology plumber " says mr chambers of the moniker given to network equipment companies "we see how the role of the network is changing so weve had to make changes as well " last year the emerging markets group introduced three products apart from the telepresence system the unit launched a corporate video on demand system called digital media system and sypixx a network surveillance service in the next five years mr de beer says the goal is to introduce a total of new products it is unclear how successful this division will be the unit isnt likely to quickly contribute to ciscos bottom line since it typically takes time for new products to take off analysts say indeed telepresence has received a lukewarm reception the cost of the system including network upgrades can exceed &# which analysts say places the product in a niche category nonetheless jeffrey evenson an analyst with sanford bernstein &amp co says ciscos new group will likely keep some company talent from leaving for the start up businesses that are populating silicon valley again more importantly mr evenson says the new unit is creating products that will help push more traffic through ciscos networks and thus drive new sales of core switching and routing gear "executives at cisco see the only way to spur growth is to invest in themselves " mr evenson says the emerging markets group operated in stealth mode for nearly two years before cisco officially announced it a year ago the unit was launched by charlie giancarlo ciscos chief development officer who is often mentioned as an heir apparent to mr chambers mr giancarlo says he wanted to set up a structure to house new nonnetworking products that were bubbling up within the company the new group will help establish new revenue sources by creating a pipeline for ideas and a playbook on how to bring those ideas to market he adds "how does a company create a process where it can operate outside the box where it can build something unrelated to its core " mr giancarlo says mr giancarlo tapped mr de beer to lead the unit mr de beer quickly set up a different structure for the group than most cisco units he launched an in house web site called izone that lets employees contribute and comment on ideas for new products to date ideas have emerged managers participating in a cisco executive training program are given the task of testing the legitimacy of these ideas by crafting business models around them some of the ideas also are discussed with silicon valley venture capital firms the video conferencing project began in early at mr giancarlos request cisco executives knew that market had potential such technology is projected to generate &# billion in sales by up from &# million in according to telespan publishing corp an altadena calif research firm that tracks the conferencing market a team of about engineers was assembled to create telepresence by december the engineers had put together a crude prototype they had crafted with off the shelf parts when they showed it to mr giancarlo it crashed four times after making adjustments the team showed the product to mr chambers in march where the system performed without a hitch telepresence formally launched in october george mattingly an information technology executive at wachovia corp is one customer who is positive about telepresence he says his company which plans to upgrade from its current video conferencing technology examined different systems before deciding to buy five telepresence systems in november using telepresence will be "like going from listening to the radio to watching high definition television " says mr mattingly who expects the systems to be installed by mid "its a big difference "
