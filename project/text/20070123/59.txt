gap will fashion its future without pressler former disney executive out as ceo of struggling chain board looks for retail expert when gap inc and paul pressler parted ways yesterday it wasnt because the ceo hadnt repaired the balance sheet or wasnt a popular leader it was partly because of scenes like the one following described by a former executive at the retailer during top managers final reviews of the products for an upcoming season mr pressler a former walt disney co executive who often acknowledged that understanding fashion was not his strength simply asked questions about the merchandise rather than making decisions after he left the room his charges huddled and like kremlinologists tried to deconstruct his remarks and reinterpret them as orders as a result they frequently fussed over trivial issues such as how the woven shirts should be folded or whether the legs of the khaki pants should hang off the table a larger sense of direction never became clear the second

pressler joined gap in after running disneys theme parks he initially benefited from merchandise decisions made by his predecessor millard "mickey" drexler who now runs j crew group inc mr pressler
