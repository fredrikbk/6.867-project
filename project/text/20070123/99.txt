politics &amp economics the wall street journal nbc news poll president faces skeptical public poll underscores extent to which bush has lost nations ear washington president bush tonight gets another shot at persuading americans to support his iraq war strategy and domestic agenda his problem much of the public has stopped listening to him a new wall street journal nbc news poll on the eve of mr bushs state of the union address underscores the extent to which he has lost the nations ear just of americans say they want the president to set policy for the country express confidence in his goals and approve his handling of the iraq war only one third of americans rate mr bush highly for being "honest and straightforward " that is down from half at the start of his second term two years ago two thirds say his performance in office is unlikely to get better in his last two years as president "what he faces is an extremely skeptical audience " says democratic pollster peter hart who helps conduct the journal nbc poll the findings adds his republican counterpart bill mcinturff suggest "little capacity for movement on his major policy initiatives especially iraq " mr bush hopes to overcome that skepticism with a series of eye catching ideas on domestic policy particularly on health care and energy his health care plan outlined over the weekend focuses on overhauling the tax code to make health insurance more accessible to people not covered through employers his energy plan likely will feature a big proposed increase in the use of alternative fuels like ethanol and a revamping of fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars as well as greater acknowledgment of the problem of global warming still the president has had a tough time breaking through this month mr bush spoke to the nation outlining plans to increase u s troop strength in iraq and the poll shows he failed to shift public opinion in his direction just one in four americans calls it "an acceptable outcome" to increase u s troops now and keep them in iraq until that nation becomes a stable democracy one reason majorities of men and women of whites and nonwhites of all ages income groups and regions of the country say the presidents new iraq strategy will make "very little difference" or none at all in securing iraq though mr bush has steadfastly resisted any timetable for u s withdrawal from iraq a majority wants u s troops to leave within the next year "america has come to a public judgment on iraq wrap it up " mr hart says the telephone survey of adults was conducted jan and has a margin of error of plus or minus percentage points the president despite an overall approval rating standing at just while disapprove has offered no indication of bending to that judgment instead he has reiterated his intention to proceed in the face of opposition not only from democrats now the majority in congress but from an increasing number of his fellow republicans the survey shows mr bush and his republican allies on solid ground with rank and file americans on at least one point opposition to any legislative blocking of funds for u s troops in iraq so while a majority of americans say the president should abandon his planned troop increase if congress passes a nonbinding resolution against it americans oppose by congressional attempts to stop mr bush by cutting off funds democratic lawmakers have been juggling that issue leaders insist they wont stop funding troops in the field but some senators and house members seek restrictions such as caps on the number of troops in iraq both journal nbc pollsters say mr bush may be able to improve his standing by accommodating his reduced stature and the loss of his republican congressional majorities with a revamped policy agenda to some degree the white house has signaled plans to attempt just that tonight the president will tout a health care initiative designed to expand coverage with new deductions for americans seeking insurance on their own financed by taxes on some generous employer provided health plans that emphasis tracks the findings in the journal nbc poll showing health costs as americans foremost economic concern and the number of americans without health insurance as atop respondents list of disturbing conditions in the country ahead of declining morals illegal immigration sub par schools or outsize ceo compensation mr bushs higher target for renewable fuels jibes with democrats stated aims a u s diplomat held out hope that the higher renewable fuels standard also would create a steady demand for agricultural products that will keep prices high and hold down u s subsidies thereby helping satisfy international demands in the doha round of trade talks many of the new white house domestic initiatives have features that appeal to democrats yet the journal nbc poll makes clear that americans have little expectation that mr bush will work effectively with his political adversaries on capitol hill just expect the president to "strike the right balance" in dealing with the democratic congress while predict he will be "too inflexible " the survey underscored the message of last novembers midterm elections that americans are increasingly open to democratic leadership a majority wants congress rather than the white house setting policy for the country by to americans say democrats could bring "the right kind of change" to the country rather than the wrong kind though dont expect much change either way in the broadest gauge of the two parties images americans rate democrats favorably while republicans are rated negatively on specific issues americans say they prefer the democratic approach by a double digit margin on issues such as social security energy and the federal deficit the wall street journal nbc news poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of american adults conducted jan by the polling organizations of peter hart and bill mcinturff
