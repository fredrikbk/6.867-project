telecom division before leaving the company in late the revelations come at a sensitive time for top managers at siemens who have been fending off criticism ahead of an annual holders meeting thursday that they didnt do enough to stop corruption evidence of wrongdoing could cause some countries to ban siemens from participating in big infrastructure projects that generate much of its revenue the investigation also could complicate the conglomerates efforts to jettison its telecom business merging much of it into a venture with nokia corp of finland the testimony alleges that bribes took place in siemenss wireless telecom business and werent confined to the fixed line unit which was the original focus of the criminal investigation german authorities are investigating the allegations which

wolfgang kreuzer a lawyer for mr siekaczek said his client is cooperating with prosecutors "police have investigated and verified mr siekaczeks statements " mr kreuzer said the witness statements were made by two men who were considered loyal siemens officials for decades the statements are significant because they were presented as evidence in an arraignment hearing where prosecutors would have been required to point out any contradictions or inaccuracies in the statements the two witnesses said that the alleged involvement of the finance chief mr kaeser occurred while he oversaw finances at siemenss wireless telecom equipment unit he belonged to the executive management board of that unit from april to october mr siekaczek who left siemens in late after four decades told prosecutors
