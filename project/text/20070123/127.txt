tools of a minister to modern seamen cash phone cards in hong kong mr ellis takes faith to sailors with no time to go ashore hong kong several mornings each week the rev peter ellis a year old welshman navigates the throng of tourists and commuters here at the kowloon waterfront and jumps aboard a motor launch that ferries him to his seaborne flock instead of packing religious tracts and bibles he lugs an armful of newspapers in a babel of languages a satchel bulging with prepaid cellphone cards and two wallets one stuffed with hong kong dollars and the other with american dollars mr ellis the anglican priest at the mission to seafarers is a port chaplain in one of the worlds busiest maritime centers racing to keep up with upheavals in global trade his congregants are the crewmen and officers on any of plus ships that call here each month from every corner of the globe the rising use of standardized containers to ship goods has made loading and unloading of cargo much more efficient crews have dwindled from more than a hundred men to as few as a dozen and port calls that once lasted weeks now take just hours these rapid turnarounds mean that many crews lack the time to go ashore at all so mr ellis has responded to the changing times by calling on the ships themselves aside from harbor officials and ships agents port chaplains are the only visitors many of the crews of modern container ships get as they roam the world for months on end these maritime padres "become the link between us and the outside world " says loke yien loong the thai captain of the container ship apl kennedy which was laid up for modifications in a dry dock over christmas so mr ellis has made a calling out of tending to his flocks earthly needs as much as to spiritual ones sailors welcome his services exchanging currency and peddling at cost the phone cards they need to keep in touch with their distant families "you get inundated with people wanting the cards it would be churlish not to bring them " mr ellis says often he leaves his own new jerusalem bible behind when he makes his rounds of the enormous vessels anchored in the harbor or laid up for repair if he can shore up a mariners flagging faith or welcome a committed convert he considers that a bonus "i dont just want to claim another scalp for the church " says mr ellis who has ministered to men of the sea for years "for me its more important that people have a faith than no faith at all " unlike mr ellis chaplains in other ports rarely bother to clamber up the gangway of the apl kennedy says mr loke captain of the foot long leviathan many of the or more christian chaplains working world wide prefer to meet crewmen at onshore missions the hong kong priests on site visits make a difference especially for younger crewmen who may feel anxious or lonely says mr loke a buddhist who has known mr ellis for four years "we all have problems and need someone to talk with " he says mr ellis thinks of himself as an "anchor" for men whose jobs and lives are buffeted daily by the forces of globalization "everything is changing around them " he says "new employers new regulations about the only thing thats constant is the seafarers mission " a boxing fan mr ellis is a tall burly man with thinning white hair his crooked nose broken twice in childhood accidents gives him a vaguely pugnacious look that has helped him over the years he says when he has had to break up fights between drunken sailors "i think some people must have looked at me and thought it looks like this guys been in the ring leave him alone " he says recently mr ellis visited a ship from north korea that authorities here had impounded for safety violations he delivered the grateful crew a care package of soccer games recorded on dvds and cigarettes plus some newspapers from south korea "probably not the best thing i suppose " he says reflecting on the provocative political opinions the communist crew might find in papers from capitalist south korea another day he visited the container ship msc jemima and joined its ukrainian crew for a lukewarm lunch of boiled beef and cabbage he did his best to console a crewman whose daughter was sick with meningitis the ships steward told mr ellis that he wanted to take a dvd player and other gifts home with him when he flew back to odessa mr ellis perched on a filthy green sofa in the ships dilapidated lounge phoned his secretary and asked her to check on the weight restrictions for hand luggage on flights to ukraine his secular services make it easy at times for crew members to forget they are dealing with a man of the cloth late last month mr ellis says "some africans wanted to have some whiskey for christmas but i said no i felt i couldnt do that " a few sailors inevitably ask him to provide women "i just say i thought you were married and they tend to back off " he did however once visit a health clinic to collect test results for a mariner worried that he might have contracted a venereal disease mr ellis once thought hed be happy to be a small town churchman as his father was he says he doesnt even like the sea but a stint as an assistant to the seamens mission in hamburg and a chance dinner with a chinese tanker crew opened his eyes to the mariners world impressed by the candor of the sailors he met and the multiethnic harmony of shipboard life he began working full time with ships crews he came to hong kong as an assistant port chaplain in married and with two grown children he has spent most of his time since then either here or in singapore on shore mr ellis runs the hong kong mission or "mish" as it was once commonly known housed in an story ocean blue building near hong kongs victoria harbor the mission still provides those sailors who make it ashore with short stay apartments and a bowling alley swimming pool and bar theres also a chapel which mr ellis shares with his lutheran and roman catholic colleagues but his sunday services rarely draw more than five aging anglicans he says in the busier days of the seafarers mission mr ellis organized teetotaler dances twice a week inviting visiting seamen and local nurses one dance in erupted in a brawl between chinese and fijian mariners that left mr ellis who pried the fighters apart spattered in blood he recalls "the mistake " he says "was that the dj stopped the music " when sailors have problems with employers or governments port chaplains are often the only ones willing to step in to help mr ellis recently intervened with immigration officials to try to arrange for visas to be issued to a replacement crew from the philippines for some seafarers stuck on a vessel that was being repaired without port chaplains says arthur bowring managing director of the hong kong shipowners association "im not sure who would fill the gap "
