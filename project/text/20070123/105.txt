this year at a news conference tomorrow in frankfurt saps american depositary shares eased cents to &# by p m in new york stock exchange composite trading in frankfurt saps shares fell to euros &# a month ago u s rival oracle corp reported that sales of new software fell below analysts expectations last week symantec corp which sells software that helps companies store and secure data lowered its earnings and revenue forecasts too "these are three important companies " said tony ursillo an analyst at loomis sayles &amp co "you cant help but be nervous " loomis sayles doesnt own sap shares but has invested in oracle and symantec according to securities and exchange commission filings as of sept the scenario is frustrating for the big players because they havent been able to cut themselves a larger slice of the business software pie companies are expected to spend &# billion on software this year up from &# billion last year according to forrester research inc that growth rate is higher than that of any other category of information technology spending including computer or communications equipment some argue saps slump highlights a broader shift under way in business software in which start up companies wield an advantage over established titans under the traditional business model companies buy large costly packages of software from sap and oracle to help them run their back office functions like billing payroll and supply management but as the business software industry matures many companies already have the big software pieces they need and feel little urgency to replace them much of the money that firms spend on software this year will go to maintaining programs they already have when companies buy new software it will be to fulfill new tasks such as predicting business trends or securing corporate files that kind of software increasingly comes from upstarts which can move quickly to address new markets such as salesforce com inc the san francisco start up business that lets salespeople manage data about their customers via a web site "increasingly its going to be hard for the big vendors to really outpace the industry because the real growth

pieces of software using the web just how quickly they can get customers to these new platforms will determine their fate this year sap under mr kagermann already has begun its effort to switch its customers to its new generation of soa products called mysap persuading companies to take the plunge hasnt been easy according to some analysts "its not that the clients dont want to make the change
