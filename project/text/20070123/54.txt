hillary takes a pass congratulations to senator hillary rodham clinton for acknowledging right from the start that she wont accept public money for her white house bid now if shed only admit how much the current fund raising rules hurt her competitors top tier or wealthy candidates have been forgoing public financing for the presidential primaries for some time because it limits their spending ability steve forbes shunned it in as did he and george w bush in howard dean john kerry and president bush all refused public funds in the primaries but now senator clinton says that if she wins the democratic nomination she will be the first to forgo taxpayer funding in the general election as well congress enacted a public financing law for presidential candidates beginning with the election taxpayers fund the system by checking off a box on their income tax form in return for receiving public funds which are expected to total around &# million in a candidate agrees to limit private fund raising and overall campaign spending the claim then and since has been that this will limit the influence of special interests and make presidential contests more competitive the reality is close to the opposite the system now benefits mainly well known and well heeled candidates and thus limits political competition serious presidential contenders like senator john mccain and mrs clinton begin the race with greater name recognition long donor lists and the ability to garner far more media attention their lesser known challengers have to claw for every &# individual contribution and then they are limited in how much they can spend long gone are the days when a few rich backers could elevate an unknown with a cause antiwar eugene mccarthy in by writing big checks instead you have to be a gazillionaire yourself or be a famous senator or have a last name of bush or clinton one irony of the race is that popular former governors such as tom vilsack and mike huckabee probably cant raise enough cash to be competitive but new york city mayor mike bloomberg might be able to make waves next year as an independent because hes a multibillionaire as for special interests those handful of rich donors in the past could at least be identified and their interests put on the record now the candidates have to bow to interest group lobbies that can "bundle" contributions trial lawyers or provide in kind support does anyone really believe that john kerrys decision to accept public funds in the general election made him immune to the pleadings of big labor the trial bar and other liberal groups or that mrs clintons decision to spurn public financing will make her any less accountable to voters if she wins speaking of which the public these days doesnt think much of the current election financing scheme fewer than of taxpayers want a portion of their tax dollars siphoned off for political purposes perhaps voters are more sophisticated than campaign finance "reformers" give them credit for being or perhaps taxpayers understand that limiting the pool of candidates competing for the most powerful job in the world is a really bad idea
