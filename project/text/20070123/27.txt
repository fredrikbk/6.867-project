business technology why intel alliance widens suns appeal sun microsystems inc s new entente with intel corp is partly about computer chips but chief executives of the onetime antagonists put even greater emphasis on software as part of a deal reported by the wall street journal yesterday intel said it agreed to use its engineering resources to make suns software more appealing to business customers intel plans to help companies create and refine application programs to work well with suns solaris operating system which needs such support to gain a greater foothold in software for server systems intel which also gains the right to resell solaris joins advanced micro devices inc as a supplier to sun of microprocessor chips based on a popular design called x over the long term sun and intel say their engineering teams will work together to exploit features of each others products and to improve them "this definitely changes the game in the operating system landscape " said jonathan schwartz suns chief executive during a news conference yesterday in san francisco it also changes the rhetoric between the companies which have often argued about chip technology and other topics sun which originally offered solaris to operate with computers that use its sparc microprocessors was relatively late in promoting the software for the x based servers that are now commonplace in computer rooms though sun says seven million copies of the operating system have been downloaded most such machines run the linux operating system or microsoft corp s windows but paul otellini intels chief executive said solaris is a favorite for "mission critical" applications that require high reliability and performance and in markets such as financial services and telecommunications where intel hopes to play a bigger role he said intel can benefit from suns expertise in software that exploits multi core chips which pack two or more processing units on each piece of silicon and in "virtualization " which allows computers to run multiple operating systems john enck research vice president for market researcher gartner inc said the deal should broaden the appeal of solaris among "white box" server makers with little known brands and possibly even among big sun competitors such as hewlett packard co international business machines corp and dell inc mervyn adrian an analyst at forrester research inc said the deal will also allow sun to tune solaris to work better with intel chips and to take advantage of virtualization technology that intel is building into its chips but al gillen an analyst at the research firm idc noted that customers are already able to run solaris on x servers while sun should sell more servers now that it has adopted intel microprocessors "it doesnt fundamentally change the market opportunity for solaris " he said john fowler a sun executive vice president who helps lead its hardware development predicted it will deliver machines with intels xeon chips late in the first half of sun also plans to keep exploiting amds strengths he added where xeon based systems typically have sockets to install up to four chips sun already sells systems with up to eight of amds opteron chips when the number of microprocessors on each opteron doubles next summer to four those eight socket machines could have electronic brains mr fowler said
