journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources medicine doctors decision making routine may lay the groundwork for errors the medical school ideal of a doctor who matches the patients symptoms to a mental medical encyclopedia can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses says jerome groopman a professor of medicine at harvard university typical diagnoses are a good place to start but medical schools need to teach their students to be aware of inherent human biases to which even the fact crammed minds of m d s are vulnerable many doctors errors derive from the simple rules of thumb that allow them to make their necessarily rapid decisions the rules can save the life of a typical patient but can blind a doctor to the problems of an atypical one for instance a very fit man in his s who unusually has coronary heart disease misdiagnoses occur in some of u s cases says dr groopman citing studies from the s and s a tendency in the human mind to "judge the likelihood of an event by the ease with which relevant examples come to mind" leads doctors astray if six patients have the same flu it is common to assume that the seventh with similar symptoms has caught it as well even though that might not be the case even warm feelings for a patient might lead to misdiagnoses dr groopman cites an example from his own career where he ended an exam too early to lessen the pain and humiliation of a patient he particularly liked to disastrous results by paying attention to these tendencies doctors could learn to avoid cherry picking the symptoms that only confirm their hunches the new yorker jan education researcher refutes notion of liberal bias the notion that university professors are an overwhelmingly liberal group whose political views help foster a biased curriculum on u s campuses has little hard supporting evidence a higher education researcher says john b lee tells the chronicle of higher education that all eight of the studies on bias in academia that he reviewed were flawed some limited their surveys to top ranked schools which overrepresented private institutions and in some cases only certain departments were analyzed furthermore mr lee says there is little evidence to suggest that professors political views change in a fundamental way what is taught or whether more conservative academics receive fewer job offers or promotions in that sense he says universities are like the military the armed forces are dominated by republicans but there isnt any indication that democrats are kept out of the military or blocked from promotions but wouldnt an imbalance on college campuses lead to one sided scholarship even if the bias is inadvertent not necessarily says mr lee academias body of knowledge is held up to fresh scrutiny by each generation of scholars and the constant reassessments act as their own check against prejudice at least thats what this scholar thinks the chronicle of higher education jan politics rephrasing a question gets different results how can hillary clinton know whether some of the of americans who regularly say they are comfortable with a female president arent lying to avoid seeming sexist to a pollster researchers at northern illinois university found subjects in a survey expressed much more discomfort when asked about a female president in a different way says salons tim grieve researchers asked people which of the following statements upset them "the rising price of gas the high salaries paid to professional athletes pollution by large corporations and laws that require seat belt usage " the researchers then added a fifth statement "a woman serving as president" and gauged the responses the researchers found that around one quarter of the subjects were troubled by the statement about a female president within that group the researchers found that resistance to a female president cropped up evenly among men and women and among respondents of different education levels salon jan economics brain drain may aid the folks back home the developing worlds loss of smart and talented individuals to richer nations might not be the problem for poor countries that it is sometimes assumed to be richer countries can offer more opportunities for these expatriates to apply their smarts and those left behind benefit in the form of say a medicine that might not have been
