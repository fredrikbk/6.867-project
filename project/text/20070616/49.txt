politics &amp economics u s tries arming iraqi tribal groups baghdad with progress toward national reconciliation stalled in iraq senior u s military officials are exploring ways to curb the violence there from the ground up by working with and in some cases arming tribal groups and other local leaders but over the long term arming such local leaders to fight radical sunni terrorist groups like al qaeda risks further inflaming iraqs civil war defense secretary robert gates making his fourth trip to baghdad since december said friday he was concerned that the u s has been "too focused on the central government and not enough on the provinces and tribes and what is happening in those areas " the initial surge strategy was built around the theory that if the u s pushed more troops into baghdad it could reduce the violence there and spur political reconciliation at the national level so far that hasnt happened this week the iraqi government imposed a citywide security crackdown in baghdad after a bombing toppled the two minarets of the askariya mosque about miles north of the city mr gates is the third senior u s official to visit baghdad in the last week and push iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki and other national leaders to move faster toward passage of key political benchmarks such as an oil revenue sharing law and an amended constitution u s officials say these steps are essential to reconciliation and to persuade congress to give the current u s strategy a bit more time the stalemate seems to be forcing a change in approach among u s military officials focused more on making progress at the local level the hope is that in the near term tribes and groups can do what u s forces have so far been unable to do reduce the killing in recent months marine corps and army forces in al anbar province in western iraq have begun arming tribal leaders who initially opposed the u s presence and in some cases may have passively supported al qaeda in iraq frustrated with al qaedas barbarous tactics these tribes have begun to work with u s forces to drive the terrorist group out of the area the result has been a sudden drop in violence in a province that had been among the most deadly for u s troops in the country "some of these local developments deserve our attention as well as national legislation benchmarks " mr gates said in an effort to duplicate the success in al anbar military officers are trying to build similar relationships with other regional leaders in baghdad and surrounding provinces it remains to be seen if a similar strategy can work in these areas which include mixed populations of sunnis and shiites al anbar is made up almost entirely of minority sunnis who have been largely motivated by a nationalist desire to drive the u s force out of the country in the more mixed areas of iraq most of the fighting seems driven by sectarian conflict between sunnis and shiites in some cases the iraqi government army and police force appear to be working with radical shiite militia groups to drive the sunni minority from mixed areas of the country said u s military officials such attacks are forcing the sunnis who have made up the majority of the insurgents to align themselves more closely with radical groups for protection it is unclear what impact arming sunni tribes in al anbar province where the locals remain deeply mistrustful of the central shiite government will have over the long term u s officials are also continuing to push for progress at the national level mr gates said he would tell mr maliki in their meetings saturday that u s "troops are buying them time to pursue reconciliation and that frankly we are disappointed with the progress so far " adm william fallon the top commander in the middle east and deputy secretary of state john negroponte conveyed almost identical messages in their meetings with the prime minister earlier this week mr gates echoing other bush administration officials also sought to play down the importance of the coming september progress report on the new surge strategy by gen david petraeus the top commander in iraq in recent days some administration officials have said they likely wont be able to reach any firm conclusions on the strategy in september mr gates said that the last of the u s surge troops had just arrived in the country and that the u s should have a sense of "direction and trends on where things are headed" by the september report although administration officials may be reluctant to pass final judgment on the strategy by the fall an increasingly frustrated congress may be much more willing to draw conclusions unless violence which has been on the rise starts to drop
