the devout doctors prescription how donald landry reconciled science with religion and got the attention of washington one morning in april dr donald landry the interim chairman of columbia universitys department of medicine boarded a a m train from new york to washington d c he was there for an unfamiliar kind of meeting though hes neither a political insider nor a stem cell specialist dr landry was in the capital to tell two dozen u s senate staffers how he proposed to sidestep the ethical concerns that have largely blocked stem cell research back at home later that day dr landry and his two teenage sons watched on c span as senators debated the merits of a plan the doctor had hatched during off hours musing a few years earlier "it was surreal " says dr landry dr landrys unlikely brush with national policymaking culminates a personal journey that began years before when the devout catholic grappled with an ethical dilemma as a man of faith he believed harvesting stem cells from a human embryo was an immoral destruction of life as a doctor he believed stem cell advances could save lives his solution which involved extracting stem cells from dead embryos rather than live ones turned out to be persuasive and it has led to a new avenue of research it will also figure prominently in a conflict that is likely to come to a head in coming weeks president george w bush is expected to veto a bill that would provide government funding for research using stem cells derived from living embryos that are unused by fertility clinics instead the white house has signaled that it prefers legislation that incorporates dr landrys proposal among others the doctor has been to the white house to discuss his stem cell approach and is due for another visit in coming days the state of new york has provided &# million to help dr landry kick start his own experiments at columbia "the destruction of nascent human life is something that society should be wary of " dr landry says "i think ive found a potentially simple answer to the problem " dr landrys answer has drawn fire from other scientists harold varmus who won the nobel prize in medicine in and is president of memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york says the approach is scientifically dubious the bill that includes the landry proposal he says is an effort to "provide political cover for people who want it both ways to say they voted for stem cells but without offending their political base " the eldest of four boys dr landry grew up in a catholic family in jersey city n j he attended mass every sunday and served as an altar boy in college he took philosophy courses and thought about becoming a priest but he changed course after coming down with a dangerous bout of rheumatic fever his doctor promised to heal him and did "it gave me a first hand glimpse of what the practice of medicine can mean " dr landry says he received a doctorate in organic chemistry at harvard university in and a medical degree at columbia in he made a mark in both fields experimenting on rats in the early s he discovered an artificial enzyme that destroys cocaine molecules in the blood and was a potential treatment for cocaine addiction a few years later dr landry showed that a hormone vasopressin can reverse clinical shock in patients a condition of extremely low blood pressure that is fatal in most cases "not many of us invent something that allows people to walk out of an intensive care unit " says qais al awqati a professor of medicine at columbia who has known dr landry for nearly three decades throughout dr landry balanced science and faith he attends mass daily he keeps the biography of john paul ii on his home bookshelf and keeps a recording of the late popes televised funeral says his wife maureen oreilly landry a clinical psychologist at the same time he would organize "science themed" birthday parties for their two sons even a trip to the bathroom could yield surprises "there were always coke bottles and tubes hooked up " says ms oreilly landry describing how dr landry taught their sons about the physics of water pressure "while some people can be religious and rigid hes not hemmed in " in dr landry founded a division at columbia to recruit organic chemists to help discover new drugs it was also a breakthrough year for the science of stem cell research in the quest to treat some of the most intractable diseases scientists found they could harvest "master" stem cells from microscopic celled human embryos these cells have the capacity to become any of the other or so tissues in the human body which could then be transplanted into patients and used to treat ailments from diabetes to heart disease the technique involved manipulating an early stage embryo which opponents called immoral because it destroys a nascent human life the emerging science had already been frozen out of most government funding in the s the republican dominated congress had inserted a clause into the budget preventing federal support for research in which embryos are destroyed the restriction became part of federal law when president bill clinton signed the budget legislation and was included in subsequent budgets at the end of the s as researchers in the u s and abroad made strides in the field scientists began to clamor for the government to lift the funding restriction in dr landry was named associate professor of medicine at columbia that summer newspapers were filled with articles about whether president bush would maintain most of the funding restrictions many scientists opposed the decision "this was a test for the president " dr landry recalls "he gave the impression that he had a moral compass so what would he do " it also posed a dilemma for dr landry he opposed abortion and the death penalty and he had never advocated euthanasia but he wondered what was the proper stance for a catholic on whether embryos should be destroyed to save people one sunday afternoon steeped in articles about the political clash he had what he calls an epiphany master stem cell lines he hypothesized could be derived from embryos that were created during in vitro fertilization procedures but whose cells had stopped dividing naturally such embryos he reasoned were dead because they wouldnt continue growing if implanted in a womb but they would still contain some healthy cells if those cells could yield fresh tissue that could be used to treat disease or test medicines there shouldnt be ethical objections dr landry says he picked up the phone to run his idea past an embryologist at columbia the colleague confirmed that after a typical in vitro fertilization procedure about half of embryos stop growing because of genetic abnormalities many of those embryos known as mosaics have a mixture of normal and abnormal cells though dr landry says he had "no history" of political involvement he prefers to vote by issue rather than by party he says and declines to disclose how he voted in past elections he believed his concept might interest the president he contacted a former classmate from medical school who knew a senator from kentucky through that channel the doctor sent a one paragraph summary of his idea to the white house in august the white house was in the midst of launching its own initiative to reconcile faith science and politics the president ordered that federal funds may only be used to pay for research employing some human stem cell lines that existed at that time he also announced that he would form the presidents council on bioethics which would advise him on issues such as human cloning and stem cell research it included many intellectual heavy hitters and was led by leon kass a university of chicago philosopher with conservative views the council was controversial from the start critics pointed out that it had few bioethicists and no members of the public some scientists feared the council would become a bully pulpit for imposing the presidents religious views on cutting edge medical research a spokeswoman for the council says its membership is diverse and that members have been split on key ethical issues including stem cell research dr landry didnt hear back from the white house dr al awqati who was then deputy editor of the journal of clinical investigation urged the doctor to press ahead and publish the proposal "it was a typical don idea " he says "the kind you kick yourself for because you didnt think about it yourself " dr landry teamed up with howard zucker a pediatric cardiologist with a background in law and an interest in medical ethics who had recently begun a fellowship in the department of health and human services dr zucker introduced dr landry to prof kass the bioethics council chairman in november drs landry and zucker presented their case in a paper published in the journal of clinical investigation their approach they argued was the ethical equivalent to harvesting a functioning organ from a human cadaver the next month prof kass invited the two doctors to present their idea to the presidents bioethics council a few months later the council published a policy "white paper" that detailed several ways that master stem cells could be obtained without harming human embryos including the landry zucker method it isnt yet clear which if any of the approaches outlined in the councils paper are viable in one proposal human embryonic stem cells would be derived from genetically altered embryo like bodies that arent actually embryos in another so far demonstrated to work only in mice mature cells revert to an embryonic like state yielding tissue that could be used for treating disease in may a white house staffer briefed the president and senior staff on the white paper president bush called the paper "interesting and encouraging " recalls the staffer yuval levin who is now a fellow at the ethics and public policy center a washington think tank the president said it "appealed to him because you could do what the scientists wanted without the ethical issues " according to mr levin in late february dr landry received a high profile backer new yorks then governor george pataki was laid up in new york presbyterian hospital the main hospital of columbia university recovering from complications related to an appendectomy dr landry was his internist in the governors hospital room the doctor mentioned his recent meetings with policymakers in washington and explained his stem cell proposal he gave mr pataki a copy of his published paper a few days later dr landry received a call from a member of the governors staff new york the staffer said might want to implement a stem cell initiative of its own dr landry met the staff twice in the summer of he says and in july gov pataki phoned him the governor said hed be willing to fund the research dr landry later applied for a state grant and received &# million in august mr levin invited dr landry and other scientists involved in stem cell research to meet the president in a televised address from the east room that day president bush vetoed legislation passed by congress to expand federal funding of embryonic stem cell research a rival bill which proposed funding for alternative approaches but was restricted to animal research didnt pass the house a few weeks later the landry proposal received another boost this time on the science front in a paper published in the journal stem cells a group of scientists from newcastle university in the u k described how they had taken cells from an arrested human embryo and created a living stem cell line the newcastle scientists hadnt heard about dr landrys work while conducting their experiment but knew that in vitro fertilization clinics around the world stored frozen embryos left over from the procedures many of them not viable for implantation "its better to use them for research than to put them in a rubbish bin " says co author miodrag stojkovic now a scientist at the prince felipe research center in valencia spain dr landry took the early morning train to washington in april and made a minute presentation about his work to senate staffers later that day senators discussed his proposal as part of the debate on the hope act which would fund studies involving stem cells derived for research purposes without injuring viable embryos or without creating new embryos the senate passed the bill sponsored by minnesota republican norm coleman by a count of votes to many scientists back a rival bill sponsored by nevada democrat sen harry reid which would allow government funds to go toward research using stem cell lines derived from viable embryos that fertility clinics would have discarded called the stem cell research enhancement act the rival bill was recently passed by congress president bush has signalled that he will veto it dr landrys proposal has come under criticism from many quarters some scientists say the embryos dr landry proposes using typically have stopped dividing due to genetic errors and suggest that those defects may be transmitted to patients receiving tissue transplants derived from the embryos in april sloan kettering president dr varmus who is a former director of the national institutes of health told the senate majority leader in a letter that passing the bill incorporating dr landrys idea "would be a significant step backwards" for american science "limiting the scope of research in this way places a muzzle on the scientific process placing short term incremental advances ahead of the more challenging goals of preventing or curing diseases " he wrote another question is whether the embryos dr landry proposes using can in fact be defined as dead "in our haste to obtain what we want we may be killing an embryo " says rev tadeusz pacholczyk a neuroscientist and ethicist at the national catholic bioethics center in philadelphia and dr landrys approach depends on in vitro fertilization which the vatican opposes dr landry believes his work stands up there are no genetic defects so far he points out in the stem cell line created by dr stojkovic when it comes to determining when a cell human embryo is dead he says traditional concepts such as heart and lung failure or brain death arent useful dr landry and his colleagues examined data on more than human embryos kept by an ivf clinic in new york and concluded that an embryo is dead when most of its cells have naturally and irreversibly stopped dividing he is willing to diverge from the catholic churchs position on in vitro fertilization "it creates life not kills it " he says in response to dr varmuss charge that alternative methods of stem cell harvest are motivated more by politics than science he says "if science can advance without violating the ethical sensibilities of half the populace whats the downside " the hope act which includes dr landrys proposal now awaits debate by the democrat controlled house it is unclear whether the house will put it up for a vote regardless of what shape the debate takes in coming years dr landry is pressing ahead he is using the &# million from new york to assemble a team at columbia to conduct experiments on his approach he believes his alternative will appeal to part of the population "the ultimate use of embryonic stem cells if they achieve their promise is the treatment of patients " he says "those patients are going to have their opinion on the morality of destroying embryos "
