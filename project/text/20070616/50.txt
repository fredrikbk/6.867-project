pursuits a fathers legacy playing in dads office cheering with him at the game hiking together then losing him to illness at age how a few short years of parenting can change a childs life forever as a girl my wife spent hours playing in her fathers law office she cheered with him at denver bronco games hiked with him in the colorado foothills and tagged behind him on the links carting a child sized set of clubs in photographs beside him she looks like the happiest girl in colorado springs the attention he bestowed upon his daughter made it all the harder for her to lose him to a sudden illness when she was a quarter century after his death she still cant talk about her dad without crying yet even as her sleep remains haunted by dreams of him alive his eight year reign helps explain why my wife functions with a degree of confidence that humbles me in her mind she remains his princess "he was a wonderful father " she says a reverence for fatherhood is common among the children of dead fathers their sorrow is often encased in a glow of memories and those memories are often unblemished by the maturing childs clearer eyed view of dads faults for the children of dead fathers the impact of his brief appearance can last a lifetime to hear the children of dead fathers talk about fatherhood is heartrending but also inspiring their view of dad tends to be free of satire free of cynicism free of disrespect and their memories can offer insight into mysteries that living fathers ponder how much of me would my child remember if i died today am i really having any impact on a year old what is the most important message i can communicate to my child the positive memories of these children stand apart at a time when even advocates of fatherhood measure its power in largely negative terms recent research into parenting has produced reams of studies about the toll exacted by dads who are divorced deadbeat distant alcoholic workaholic abusive or just plain lazy forcing mom to carry the load the premier work of david popenoe perhaps the most quoted expert on fatherhood in america is called "life without father " the relentless focus on negative role models has created a recent phenomenon that could be called the defensive dad he is the dad who scrambles to change diapers toss balls call the pediatrician coach soccer and read bedtime stories not because he recognizes the power of his influence hes just trying to stay out of trouble even if he sidesteps all the pitfalls that bad dad experts warn about even if he attains something akin to paternal perfection he will continue to hear the pervasive message that dad matters less than mom having known my own father for years ive gained perspective from a wife who knew hers for only eight when i call my year old dad tomorrow to wish him a happy fathers day he will compliment me on this essay he reads everything i write but without any hope of hearing her father say he is proud my wife still strives to please him in her mind the sound of his voice still echoes calling her smart calling her pretty laughing at her jokes twenty five years after his praise fell silent being worthy of it still means everything to her despite having thrived in the field of journalism and having received loud hurrahs from her supportive mother she felt called to follow the path of her father last year she finished law school passed the bar and entered the practice of law the first time i heard her speak about her father i understood that she was in love with him and at that instant i started falling in love with her as she gushed about how he had played baseball for a farm club of the chicago white sox how his prosecutorial skills had won him a prestigious award from the u s attorney general how he had posthumously been named one of the outstanding lawyers in colorado history what i heard was elation over how much he had loved her it occurred to me his greatest achievement had been as a father little science exists about the lasting influence of dead fathers but outcome data suggest that it is powerful such data show that children who lose a father fare significantly better than those whose father is alive but not present and nearly as well as those who never lose theirs about of american children will lose a parent before the age of and nearly of those losses will involve a father reflecting the greater vulnerability of men to accident and illness say bereavement experts they stress that the loss of a mother can be similarly overcome especially if the child received professional counseling and sensitive care from the surviving parent after years of studying the role of mothers in early life psychoanalysts are turning with fervor to the influence of fathers just last year an international consortium of freudian analysts convened a seminar at columbia university called "the dead father " based in part on the premise that the role of the father in early childhood has been underappreciated "the father has tended to get left out of the theorizing " says stuart taylor a columbia university psychiatrist who helped organize the seminar sigmund freuds description of the father as godlike an omnipotent figure that imposes law and order perpetuated the long held cultural belief that dad becomes relevant as his offspring ages but psychiatrists increasingly realize that when a child receives love approval and guidance from a godlike figure the young psyche develops a crucial sense of importance one that can outlast the early death of the father or the eventual recognition of him as merely human "as if he knew he would die prematurely not live to see me reach adulthood my father left books for me that he inscribed in his handwriting " mary gordon writes in "the shadow man " her biography of david gordon the father who died when she was "i never feel so prized as when i see my name in his handwriting he has inscribed me in the world he has never ceased to think of me " a month ago ms gordon won induction into the american academy of arts and letters on the strength of a writing career that is a tribute to the father she knew for only seven years in story after story ms gordon has drawn reverential portraits of fathers and the heartbreak of losing them researching her father for the biography she turned up painful truths that he was an anti semitic jew for instance but as a dad he was extraordinary he taught her to read when she was praised her agility with words and confessed that he loved her more than god sacrilege for a radical catholic the devastation of his death only deepened her commitment to fulfill his vision of her "if a father makes a daughter feel like she has a right to take her place in the larger world as an achieving person and a desirable person as mine did nothing can take that away " says ms gordon another daughter of american letters sylvia plath illustrates how damaging a fathers death can be when he failed to nurture his child in a poem called "daddy " ms plath attributed her first suicide attempt to her distant and disapproving father i was ten when they buried you at twenty i tried to die and get back back back to you i thought even the bones would do published research shows an association between exceptional accomplishment and the early loss of a father bart kosko exemplifies that he was just a fun loving kid growing up on the same dead end street in kansas as i did until his father died in a car wreck when bart was "when someone loves you that unconditionally and its gone irreversibly its shattering " he says yet his father had taught bart to handle responsibility at a young age when bart was his father had shown him how to build a fuel propelled rocket in third grade the boy received a shotgun for christmas resisting dispensing knowledge barts father had shown how to obtain it through books taking his late fathers message to heart bart now became his own authority teaching himself how to write music at he composed a full length orchestral overture that won him a scholarship to the university of southern california at dr kosko is a usc professor of electrical engineering a lawyer and the author of several books including a pioneering tome on fuzzy logic "it bothers me to no end that i cant show him what ive done " says dr kosko "i think of him everyday i remember his voice i remember his teachings " yet he doubts hed have achieved as much if his father had lived "he was a godlike figure and when god died i became stronger more driven more independent maybe a little meaner " he says fathers often try to separate their professional and personal lives but work is where men often are most effective and commanding and stamped upon the memories of children with dead fathers are powerful images of dad at work my late father in law did fun things with his girls but the amusement park isnt where his eldest girl fell in love with him after serving as a highly decorated federal prosecutor he joined the law firm his grandfather had started in inside its corridors he exposed his girl to the demands and rewards of serious work in broad outlines he explained his purpose as a lawyer and the value of high standards explicit in these conversations was his belief that she and her younger sister would find success and fulfillment in careers of their own this was a radical departure for a man who had believed that women didnt belong in the workplace the softening of that position by all accounts had everything to do with the birth of his daughters at a celebration of the naming of his firms first female partner a woman told my wife something she never forgot "this wouldnt have happened if not for you " see related letters "letters to the editor fathers who were loved remembrances of times past" wsj june
