business insight a special report technology all roads lead to the seo as companies digitize core processes they often overlook a key ingredient a strategic execution officer more and more companies are digitizing the processes that are most important to their businesses for some companies an it based system might be used to create transparency across the entire supply chain at others it could improve customer service by coordinating all processes related to the sale and servicing of products such systems help lower costs increase productivity and provide a competitive edge as important as these digitized processes are however only a few companies can unequivocally claim success in developing and using them according to research at the massachusetts institute of technology problems arise not so much from the technology as from the management challenges of driving the business process changes once systems are in place installing and using companywide information technology business processes requires cooperation and sharing of resources across businesses regions and functions but thats something most companies do poorly often because there is no strong central figure overseeing the project someone with the necessary authority to push for change some companies however have found a solution the strategic execution officer thats a title we have coined though the position it describes is real enough the seo is an executive put in charge of building and managing a platform of digitized processes and data that serve key companywide purposes tom nealon chief information office at j c penney co describes such platforms as dealing in a companys "sacred transactions" crucial data that influence operations of multiple departments functions or business units the platforms capture such information and then make it available to everyone who needs it at an airline for example reservations are a sacred transaction because a carrier cant run without accurate data on who has a reservation on what flight similarly goods received and sold would be sacred transactions for a retailer but building and implementing such a platform has proved to be a daunting task in the past most companies have assigned oversight for installing and tracking the success of such systems and related changes in business processes to executive governance committees which tend to be useful for defining strategy but not executing it other companies have assigned implementation and operational duties to it task forces which lack the authority to make the kinds of organizational and personnel adjustments that are often necessary for the system to maximize its intended benefits by contrast strategic execution officers usually senior executives often chief information officers take ownership of digitizing the processes most core to the business driving adoption of both standardized activities and the underlying technology in effect they fill the management void between companywide strategic planning and companywide strategy execution not only must they be well versed in it but they also must have the authority to redefine roles and incentives for relevant managers and workers seos and their staff have a personal stake in the outcome of such systems and can move people out of the way if they are resistant to change cios frequently bring to this role not only technological expertise but an awareness of how companywide business processes make new kinds of employee behaviors possible and how the processes require greater coordination across units one note of warning seos arent made in a day at the companies we studied the seos grew into the role by gradually taking on more responsibility for executing company strategy by far the most common evolution is for the cio to build a solid technology platform then gradually take on responsibilities for execution of business processes and strategic initiatives at u k telecommunications giant bt group plc cio al noor ramji was put in charge of a strategic initiative in september that is part of an effort to transform bt from a traditional phone company to a provider of networked it services in the past bts various business units would have been charged with fulfilling such responsibilities separately with coordination from an executive governance committee but mr ramji who is also ceo of bt exact is responsible not only for implementing the related it systems across the entire company hes also responsible for overseeing the processes and behaviors that will attempt to make sure the initiative generates the intended benefits at the heart of the initiative will be a platform of digitized business processes that serve multiple aims giving senior executives a way to measure both quality and speed of every service provided by bt across its multiple business lines and customer segments customer service representatives also will be able to see the status of every customers account and transactions as well as a history of their transactions and eventually customers too will be able to view their account information online and track bts progress in filling orders and delivering services at companies with diverse activities where integration of operations isnt critical the seos responsibilities may be focused on a platform of shared services for example at jm family enterprises inc a privately held group of automotive related businesses there is little overlap among the data or it processes used by the separate units the deerfield beach fla company runs a toyota distributorship a provider of automotive finance and insurance products several financial services companies a technology products and services company and a lexus dealership although the businesses all relate to the automotive industry they have very different business processes ken yerves president of the companys shared services unit jm service center has responsibility for procurement facilities and a variety of services supporting employees as cio for jm family he also has responsibility for it this unique role allows him to build a solid technology foundation and on that foundation build a platform of standard services reaching across the businesses relieving individual units of certain responsibilities the platform helps integrate acquisitions more important it establishes a high level of employee service at a company that prides itself in being one of fortune magazines best companies to work for in while specific seo duties may vary depending on a companys individual make up our research suggests there are four major responsibilities defining and managing the components of the core business process platform accepting a leadership role in the companys it governance process brokering opportunities for driving value from the platform and establishing an organization and incentives for sustaining the platform the following is a more detailed look at each responsibility help to create and manage it systems used for strategic initiatives seos must digitize the core business processes that create a foundation for strategy execution in doing so they plug gaps among business units product lines and functions united parcel service inc offers an example of how an seo gives shape to a business process platform in the late s when ups anticipated the need to blunt competitive threats to its growing package delivery operations management authorized development of a package tracking system the cio at the time frank erbrick recommended that ups focus on building not just a tracking application but a platform for expanding the business as a package delivery company mr erbrick in effect upss first seo identified three key components of such a platform a centralized standardized system that would minimize the cost of tracking and delivering millions of packages a day a centralized database that would protect the integrity of all of the companys package data as opposed to multiple databases that might spring up as new applications were developed and a global telecommunications capability that would enable access to the package database by ups workers anywhere the atlanta based company offers service ups followed these guidelines and today has a multilayered global platform that sets the standard for delivery of packages the company has evolved into a nearly &# billion enterprise thanks in part to the capabilities enhanced by its digitized process platform accept a leadership role in the companys it governance process today technology is at the heart of nearly every companys ability to execute strategy it has proved particularly valuable for enabling cross functional and cross business unit communication and coordination thus most seos will have some kind of responsibility for the effective use of it in the company as a start seos will usually be a point person in it governance processes it governance assigns decision rights and accountability for effective use of it in a company the seo is uniquely positioned to recognize it priorities and trade offs at the companywide level so it is natural for the seo to play an active role in governance at state street corp a boston based financial services company with &# trillion in assets under custody and &# trillion in assets under management a small group of senior executives led by the ceo is in charge of governance processes and establishing business strategies but cio joseph antonellis vice chairman and head of north american investor services and a member of the committee owns implementation and value delivery its a balance of power that helps the company make informed decisions about it investment and maintains the role of the digitized business processes as a key part of the companys ongoing strategy while mr antonellis provides key input on committee decisions about the it budget and it investment priorities the committee approves or disapproves of those proposals defines the metrics used to evaluate ongoing it services and develops reviews after the implementation of new processes during his tenure he has created a digitized platform for strategy execution that now includes business process servicing in india and new product development in china push business unit leaders to maximize their use of digitized business processes and help develop new ones while governance can sustain investment in the companywide it platform governance processes rarely drive value from it thus another key responsibility of the seo is to make sure business leaders drive value from the business process platform and continue to identify ways to add to it business leaders should see the digitized platform as a core competence that will help identify strategic opportunities for example upss package delivery platform has created a set of cost effective digitized processes that form the foundation for future business strategies ups business leaders identified new customer services that reused all the layers of its package tracking platform from the core technology infrastructure through the end to end package delivery process one such service quantum view provides shipment notifications to a customers customers along with customized inbound or outbound shipping reports another service flex global view extends that visibility across multiple transportation modes with event alerts ups continues to add products to its platform thereby driving further value from its existing capabilities establish structures and incentives that will sustain and enhance companywide initiatives to facilitate seo efforts companies will usually find it necessary to concentrate additional organizational resources on building and managing the strategy platform at state street of it staff ultimately report to mr antonellis even as his role has expanded to become vice chairman and head of the north american investor services business placing it staff under the seo greatly increases his or her ability to deliver the technology platform required to support the core data and digitized processes mr antonellis for his part further ensures the commitment of his it people to maintaining the platform by tying of annual bonuses to the companys overall performance similarly mr ramji at bt and mr yerves at jm family have staffs to support each layer of their platform this arrangement ensures a tight linkage between it and business process a relationship that has traditionally been strained at many companies at some companies the cio has responsibility for the it platform while a business leader takes on responsibility for the cross functional cross business unit business processes getting unit leaders to sign on to business process and technology changes which sometimes take years to implement may be the toughest of the seos challenges cooperation of those leaders is necessary for the efforts to get the resources they need the seo will need to identify obstacles preventing adoption of enterprise strategies and work with the unit leaders to overcome those obstacles more than one company reported that its seo relied on "force of personality" to win the continuing commitment of its business leaders the challenges and responsibilities are many companies can build and benefit from these strategic and digitized business process platforms only when they dedicate a great deal of management focus to the effort without passion and persistence such companywide initiatives intended to provide a foundation for future business strategies will die a slow death on the other hand companies that create an effective seo have some extra assurance that they will be able to position themselves for the next strategic opportunity dr ross is principal research scientist at the mit sloan school of managements center for information systems
