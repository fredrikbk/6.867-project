hot topic hamas in gaza what does it mean fighting between rival palestinian factions in the gaza strip left more than dead and put hamas the islamist movement apparently in control of the territory after ousting the largely secular u s backed fatah that raised the prospect of permanent division of the palestinian territories with gaza controlled by hamas and the west bank by fatah a huge setback to the u s sponsored israeli palestinian peace plan and a blow to the effort to rout havens for terrorists the issue is sure to be at the top of the agenda when israeli prime minister ehud olmert meets president bush in washington next week heres a look at whats at stake how do the two factions differ both hamas and fatah want a palestinian state but offer competing visions for how to achieve that goal fatah leads a mostly secular political movement that has acknowledged israels right to exist hamas is a militant islamic group funded in part by iran that calls for the eradication of israel the u s considers it a terrorist organization fatah controlled the palestinian authority from its inception in until hamas won elections in and took control of the palestinians quasigovernment fatahs base of support is in the west bank which has higher living standards is about times as large and is twice as populous as gaza why are they fighting hamas and fatah fought this past week over control of palestinian security forces in gaza and the power and influence those forces offer the groups have long running and deep personal feuds and have clashed on and off since last years elections saudi arabia brokered a power sharing agreement in march that sought to end violence and help restore much needed foreign aid which dried up after the u s led a global campaign to diplomatically and economically isolate the hamas government and force a change in its militant anti israel stance but the power sharing deal began to unravel in may when a key minister resigned in frustration why does this conflict matter when israel withdrew its forces and dismantled its settlements in gaza two years ago many hoped that relative autonomy would give rise to a flourishing palestinian territory but hamas control presents a much different potential scenario with gaza shut off from the rest of the world and under islamist rule the fear is that it could become a humanitarian disaster and a breeding ground for al qaeda influenced radical islamists the u s also has hoped that settling the israeli palestinian issue would help build support among arab governments to contain the growing influence of iran and stabilize iraq instead a hamas controlled gaza provides a foothold to an iranian ally and islamic militants on israels southern border increasing the risk of war it also could make other arab governments nervous about similar radical movements in their own countries many fear a wider middle east war if the two factions escalate the conflict in the west bank what is the u s stance toward the fighting the u s has taken an increasingly aggressive tack in recent months by pledging &# million to help fund and train fatah security forces that may have pushed hamas to conclude that "confrontation could not be avoided and that the longer they put it off the stronger fatah would be " suggests mouin rabbani a senior analyst at the brussels based international crisis group how does it set back the peace process the u s peace plan rested on the premise that palestinian president mahmoud abbas the head of fatah would rein in palestinian militants and in exchange israel would recognize him as a partner in negotiations but israel is unlikely to engage palestinians if there are two competing governments what options does that leave for the u s very few israel and the u s could continue peace talks with west bank palestinians even as israel takes separate measures in gaza israel could cut off electricity to the province and seal its border further isolating gaza but also worsening the humanitarian crisis inside some israeli officials have pushed for an invasion to confront hamas militants before the problem gets worse others have suggested engaging more moderate hamas leaders or deploying international peacekeeping forces to the region nick timiraos points of view "the big danger is that hamas will convert gaza into a kind of al qaeda like base for all the bad actors in the region " martin indyk director saban center for middle east policy brookings institution facts the youth population in the palestinian territories is expected to grow by between and according to a united nations report the palestinian territories have youth unemployment rates of for men and for women while of palestinians support the firing of rockets into israel by palestinian
