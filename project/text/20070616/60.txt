this dodge is tantamount to reinventing the toasted marshmallow at a higher level of accomplishment and pretension as the bible says there is nothing new under the infrared warming lamp the savory meat lollipop may be an emblem of todays cutting edge but it began long ago under a different name as a classic idea in french haute cuisine chefs still talk about frenched lamb chops whose flesh is

all without a stick the basic sweet lollipop would just be an ordinary hard candy with a stick inserted during the molding process it became a convenience food before its time the th century english

tinctured with scrambled egg in a shot glass preserve us from the equivalent humbling of mignardise into "mean " i can hardly wait to see where this is inevitably going somewhere degenerate i bet like
