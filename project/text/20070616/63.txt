pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations the old affection go deeper thats what i keep thinking as americans fight the washington establishment the republican party the democratic party their big contributors on immigration go deeper look at the real emotions driving the struggle as opposed to what politicians and the media claim are "the high emotions surrounding this issue " you know what i think is the american mood right now on immigration anti immigration and for the immigrant against the abstract and for the particular were against gushing borders and illegal immigration which is at this point even souring the general mood on legal immigration because we dont trust our bureaucrats to let in the people america needs we dont trust our bureaucrats and leaders to care a lot about america we assume that when senators are together if someone says "but what about america " everyone laughs and then the top senator says dryly "your concern is duly noted next " but thats the abstract "immigration " in the particular the immigrants we see and work with and know were for them were asking for closed borders and pulling for newcomers and this isnt ambivalence and it isnt confusion its common sense plus humanity the white house is exploiting american alarm at uncontrolled borders to get its way this of course has added to the sense of national alarm they believe the alarm works for them if you dont pass our bill well never control your borders yes "your" and youll suffer in the general air of agitation anger festers people feel powerless rage follows and in this case i believe deep fissures will follow that what gets lost in the alarm and will get lost in the fissures is the old affection the whole country felt and still feels for its newcomers not shallow sentiment or softness but something more constitutional more civic as in im in mass or in the deli down the street or the bathroom of a restaurant and i see a hispanic woman obviously hardworking obviously so far not lucky not yet this is what i think hi grandma my grandmother was a bathroom attendant on the fifth floor of the a&amp s department store in downtown brooklyn she was an immigrant from ireland when i see new americans i think im seeing her and i am not alone and i know what we feel and it is not antagonism it is some kind of old civic love some kind of connection that echoes back that doesnt quite have a name but is part of who we are in new york last weekend we had the puerto rican day parade i walked from midtown to uptown in the throngs babies strollers mommies people dressed in red white and blue puerto ricans are citizens of the united states but some of the people around me were new arrivals on th street at the end of the parade i saw a teenage girl in a silver white gown shed just gotten off a float and was sitting on the curb she looked like a miss universe contestant brown skin big eyes beautiful she looked like she wants to be jennifer lopez this is a very american thing to want to be near her there was another girl in a gown she was shorter thicker and had a tattoo on her arm of the american flag i thought shell be a marine some day some things were not good not at all a young man hurled an obscene epithet he was that angry i wasnt latin and he felt i should know another young man deliberately frightened a shopkeeper on madison avenue when he walked by the store he put out his arm as if he had a gun in his hand aiming it at her i was behind him i looked at the woman as she flinched and our eyes locked this is bad were going to have to work on that young man on both of them but we always have to work on young men dont we lately in the immigration debate we have been discussing and debating statistics on such things as family breakdown education levels and criminality among hispanic newcomers this reminds me of a number of things some of them perhaps to this day delicate one is that among the immigrant irish of the late th and early th centuries there were fairly high levels of dysfunction family neglect alcoholism as for criminality they didnt call it the paddy wagon for nothing my tribe was an obstreperous one many tribes are at least the interesting ones people are human and human is messy another thought is that statistical breakdowns on our ethnic groups bell curves and reports on out of wedlock birthrates are not in themselves necessarily wrong but theres something rather rude about them that is perhaps a sissy thing to say but what i mean is this if you have a mother and a father with a big family of kids it would be rude and unhelpful and not conducive to promoting peace for the grown ups to sit around the table at night and say to their children "joey youre the smart one " and "elizabeth is dumber and yet dogged " and "bobby here is our promiscuous one " how exactly would that help its not even "realistic" todays reality can change an academic might say "im not their father " fair enough but youre a grown up and if youre a grown up youre in charge of america right now a little love would go a long way right now we should stop putting newcomers in constant jeopardy by blithely importing ever newer immigrants wholl work for ever lower wages the ones here will never get a sure foot on the next rung that way we should close the border pause absorb what we have and set ourselves to "patriating" the newcomers who are here the young of americorps might help teach them english those reaching retirement age who happen to be the last people in america who were taught and know american history could help them learn the story of our country we could as a nation set our minds to this we shouldnt be disheartened so much good could be done once a great pause begins once the alarm is abated what will we do about the million here nothing radical were not really a radical people americans having no borders thats radical saying to the american people in essence back my big bill or i will not close the borders is radical insisting on "all or nothing at all" is radical leaving your country wide open in the age of terror is radical but america isnt radical if its leaders only knew our leaders are in need not only of wisdom but of faith and as always love as opposed to mere sentiment and vanity and pride
