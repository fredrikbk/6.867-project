loaves and fish piscine gluttony in pennsylvania bread toting tourists feed multitudes of carp throw it like a frisbee linesville pa pymatuning state park in northwestern pennsylvania offers boating fishing camping and the wildlife learning center by far the most popular activity here however is throwing stale bread to carp hundreds of tourists show up daily in the summer to hurl sliced bread moldy muffins graying bagels and desiccated dinner rolls into the murky brown water of pymatuning reservoir carp weighing as much as or pounds slither over one another thrashing ravenously as they lunge for their carbs their shaped mouths resemble vacuum cleaner nozzles now to make this pastime even more appealing pennsylvania has spent &# million on a new parking lot paved platform and other facilities lake pymatuning may not be quite as inspiring as some of the states other attractions such as the liberty bell or gettysburg even so its "churning mass of ugly fish is strangely compelling " says the web site of the state tourism office compelling enough to attract more than visitors per year making the sport of tossing bread into the lake one of the biggest tourist draws in western pennsylvania bigger certainly than fallingwater the house designed by frank lloyd wright over a waterfall in southwestern pennsylvania which had visitors last year or the andy warhol museum in pittsburgh with a mere lake pymatuning was created in the early s when the state built a dam to control flooding visitors enjoyed tossing food to the lakes ducks geese and carp so much that quick witted local entrepreneurs began selling them stale bread since then carp feeding has thrived here despite a virtual absence of promotion only a pair of small wooden signs on linesvilles main street easily overlooked point tourists toward the feeding grounds a brochure for the state park devotes just one sentence to the fish a press release from local politicians announcing state funding for the renovation made no mention of the carp referring only to "tourism fishing boating and various other activities " the fish gather at a spillway where water drains from one section of the lake into another when people arrive with sacks of bread the carp swarm so densely that ducks and geese can waddle across their backs as if on a piscine causeway to brawl for their share hence the towns unofficial slogan "where the ducks walk on the fish " t shirts for sale at the spillway say "carpe feedm " christopher seeley the mayor of linesville pop says the carp tourism helps "keep this town afloat " supporting several restaurants and a high end gift shop as well as people who supplement their incomes by selling day before yesterdays bread from the trunks of their cars but this doesnt stop the locals from finding the tourism a little perplexing when he was a boy mr seeley recalls "we just thought it was the strangest thing that people would come so far to see this " pete houghton the state park manager has mixed feelings about the feeding frenzies he and other park rangers across the country have spent decades trying to train tourists not to feed wild life "would we let it develop today " he says "no " but banning the sport would damage the local economy he says "youve got to look at the big picture " mr houghton says carp which can grow several feet long ordinarily eat insects plants and other aquatic organisms says mukhtar farooqi a fisheries biologist in abilene texas they arent fussy he says "theyll just suck in whatevers there " that apparently includes jewelry virginia seeley a retired glass factory worker and the mayors grandmother accidentally dropped her gold watch into the soupy lake one day while feeding the fish "i just saw it go down and right in a fishs mouth " she says occasionally a drunk falls in and has to be fished out fred mcconnell a former operator of a concession stand at the site says the carp though known to eat just about anything draw the line at pickled people since the authorities cant ban the feeding theyve attempted to make it less squalid and even a little educational the renovation completed in may has added indoor toilets a concrete platform at the waters edge and blue guardrails where once there were only open pit latrines a stony shore and chain link fences the state park plans to put up a kiosk with information on carp and local history one woman who visited the park on memorial day weekend told mr houghton the park manager she was so impressed with the new facilities that she wanted to hold her wedding there "things like that will happen more often " mr houghton predicts scientists are split on the effects of a high carb diet for carp konrad dabrowski a professor of aquaculture at ohio state university says carp are unlikely to suffer many ill effects from bread binges though "they probably get lazy " but andrew m turner a biology professor at clarion university says all that bread is bad for the ecosystem he monitored "breadthrowers" for a month and found that they were loading the lake with phosphorus contained in preservatives this could lead to outbreaks of "toxic algae low water clarity fish kills loss of biological diversity and increased likelihood of invasion by exotic species " prof turner wrote in his study the study also confirmed some midwestern stereotypes of the bread being thrown into the lake is white other items tossed to the fish include corn chips hot dogs birthday cakes and dog food the researchers noted shawn barker a welder from nearby greenville pa turned up one recent afternoon with his six year old daughter bridgette and several bags of stale bread "how about an english muffin " mr barker suggested to bridgette "throw it like a frisbee " the fish engulfed the muffin "did you see the white one down there that had all the sores on him " mr barker asked mr barker figures he has made at least trips to feed the carp over years starting when his father brought him here as a boy "theres always something different to see even when its just fish and geese and ducks " he said its also an inexpensive hobby there is no admission charge at the feeding area and a few dollars buys several loaves of old bread during the tourist season mary mcdonald drives her van to bakeries in erie pa or youngstown ohio three times a week to buy around loaves of oldish bread at a red cottage near the carp feeding area she charges &# for a bag of four or five loaves her bread stand features a sign reading "not for human consumption " but ms mcdonald suspects some of her customers ignore her admonition in spite of all the fattening carp seldom makes an appearance in local kitchens the locals dont fancy it at a carp eating contest in linesville two years ago organizers substituted other types of fish rather than serve bony carp carp have often been maligned in the u s for being frightful to behold and lacking in culinary appeal as well as for crowding out other more courteous fish but ray "herkel" corcoran a director of the carp anglers group a club that promotes carp fishing says the bread throwing proves that theyre among the canniest fish "just think about all the humans that these fish have trained to come by day in and day out to throw them their daily bread "
