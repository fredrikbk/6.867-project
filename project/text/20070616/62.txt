pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state picking the price what determines the prices of wines obviously from your ratings theres little clear relationship between the subjective quality of wine and the price is it driven by supply and demand the whim of the wine seller or what mark miller professor of economic development &amp geography the university of southern mississippi hattiesburg miss all of the above seriously many factors affect the price of wine the price of vineyard land in say napa valley is higher than it is in less prized areas hillside land generally costs more than flat land and is far more expensive to cultivate real oak barrels cost more than oak chips good cork is more expensive than cheap cork or screwtops dropping fruit or disposing of some of the grapes on a vine to concentrate flavor in the remaining fruit means money is left on the ground while allowing vines to be as productive as possible creates far more and far more inferior grapes a winemaker once told us "winemaking is fun and sanitation" and aggressive sanitation is expensive the cumbersome business of wine with all sorts of hangovers from prohibition adds cost too there are thousands of other factors all that said especially at the high end it really is all about a combination of buzz and supply and demand when critics praise a fine wine supply remains essentially constant only so much is made in each vintage but demand goes up and so do prices sometimes to ridiculous heights there is indeed no direct and consistent correlation between price and quality we have tried many inexpensive wines that are great values because they taste good and we have tasted many expensive wines that are great values because theyre mind blowing and the opposite is also true you should never assume that just because a wine costs less than &# it cant be good but you should also never assume that any wine that costs &# or more is a rip off
