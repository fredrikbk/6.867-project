pursuits leisure &amp arts in the fray yes classical music criticism is in decline but the last thing the industry should do is blame the press theres been a lot of talk in the past few weeks about cutbacks or possible cutbacks in classical music criticism minneapolis the newspapers classical critic takes a buyout when cutbacks leave no space for him atlanta the newspaper seems to plan cutbacks then denies it new york a glossy weekly new york magazine fires its classical critic a distinguished soul whod served them for years of course theres also been a lot of talk about the decline of classical music itself so classical music people are quick to set off alarms but these critic alarms miss the point i think especially when classical music people worry that newspapers no longer care about art or culture id make three observations first any decline in the amount of classical music criticism published is partly due to the rise of new cultural institutions i learned this in the mid s when precisely to address these decline of criticism alarms which were being sounded even then i asked publicists from opera companies around the country if their press coverage was growing or shrinking shrinking they said and why in part they said because there were new museums new dance companies and new theater groups in their cities which newspapers had to cover and of course the papers couldnt expand their culture pages because newspapers as everybody knows have been hurting too but the decline in classical criticism has other causes too and has been going on for at least years this is my second point the s were the pivotal decade the decade when classical music criticism visibly started to disappear in time magazine had a full time classical critic and by my own informal count ran twice as many pieces on classical music as it did on pop when vanity fair started publishing in it too had a classical critic me then in tina brown took over vanity fair canned classical music and made the magazine the success it is today as the s rolled on time published fewer and fewer classical reviews and by again by my own informal count the proportions were reversed so that now the magazine published two pop articles for every piece on classical music these examples could be multiplied in i was music critic of entertainment weekly which had just been launched "music critic " of course meant pop music critic but bucking the trend we still ran three classical record reviews each month but we didnt buck the trend long a few years later i became music editor and reader surveys showed that hardly anyone read our classical reviews i was ordered to drop them which brings me to my third point who reads classical music reviews theres been a decline of interest in classical music especially among younger people one sign of that is the aging of the classical music audience which as measured by the national endowment for the arts and by private studies has been going on ever since the s do newspapers survey their readers what if they found just as we did at entertainment weekly that not many people read their classical reviews what if the editors themselves dont listen to classical music this i think is where we are now though i dont have reader studies to back me up how should people in the classical music business react the last thing they should do in my view is blame the press "newspapers dont care about art or culture " people cry but id turn that around and ask if people in the classical music business really understand the current state of our world because heres something else i learned back in the s when i talked to those opera company publicists one thing any publicist wants is advance coverage preview articles about whatevers being publicized once the opera publicists said theyd get these automatically but that had stopped "youre doing la traviata " an editor might say "you did it three years ago whats the story now " for orchestras this could hit even harder "youre playing brahms you played brahms last week " classical music can look predictable to the outside world and to be honest not very interesting same old same old great classical masterworks played by acclaimed classical musicians so the classical music world needs to look at two things what it offers and how it talks about what it offers why are we playing brahms what does brahms give us that mozart feist or bruce springsteen cant and how exactly is this weeks brahms performance different from last weeks some classical music institutions are learning to answer these questions but as for the many that havent in an age when new arts groups compete for coverage and popular culture keeps getting smarter why should they expect any press coverage at all mr sandow is a veteran critic composer and consultant whos writing a book on the future of classical music
