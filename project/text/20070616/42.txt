pakistan in the balance lahore pakistan as lawyers civil society activists and now journalists protest president gen pervez musharrafs ham handed ouster of chief justice iftikhar chaudhry last march and his recent crackdown on the press most pakistanis are convinced the military strongman is a "goner " most international commentators see mr musharrafs increasingly repressive measures as a sure sign of his regime unraveling others are already calculating the beneficial effects of a likely return to "civilian democracy" sooner rather than later mr musharraf has other ideas last week he told worried bigwigs of the ruling pakistan muslim league party that he might be down but was definitely not out this storm will pass he assured them the next general elections would be held as pledged by the end of this year and they would win so how is the united states core ally in the war against terror going to fare who will replace him if he is ousted will there be greater or lesser democracy and would that be good or bad for pakistan the protests arent sufficient to end mr musharrafs rule they lack a mass base there havent been any prolonged countrywide shutdowns traders and businessmen still support mr musharraf opposition parties have failed to impress in the numbers game the two main opposition leaders former prime ministers nawaz sharif and benazir bhutto are reluctant to end their exile and return to pakistan fearing arrest even the most virulent opposition from the muttahida majlis amal mma an alliance of six religious parties who hate mr musharraf because of his support for the u s war against terror is tempered with pragmatism its leading political party jamiat i ulema i islam is averse to clashing with the federal government which could endanger its political rule in two provinces all political parties fear that any head on confrontation with mr musharraf might lead to martial law as if to reinforce this fact mr musharraf last week called a meeting of his top military commanders who duly warned against the expression of any anti army sentiment in public or in the media the situation could worsen for mr musharraf if the supreme court were to reinstall the chief justice and thereby invigorate the pro democracy movement or if the government were to blunder into killing protestors fueling their anger and swelling their ranks or if ms bhutto and mr sharif were to return to the country and succeed in whipping up a storm or if washington were to nod at another general to take over but all these scenarios are uncertain the supreme court case may drag on until next year the government may successfully avoid provoking more violence ms bhutto and mr sharif might stay away longer finally the u s is unlikely to ditch mr musharraf partly because he is still shoring up the war against terror in pakistan and partly because there is no guarantee that his military or civilian successor would fare any better in fulfilling this international agenda pakistans experience with "democratic" governments hasnt been reassuring previous administrations under ms bhutto and mr sharif saw corrupt squabbling politicians drive the economy to bankruptcy they lost their sheen when they became dynastic autocratic and repressive worse their political failures no less than those of the military led to the growth of the religious right if mr musharraf were to be ousted by the popular forces of "undiluted democracy" in a country that is deeply fissured by regionalism ethnicity religious sectarianism separatism talibanism and class struggle the result could be political anarchy and economic meltdown there is no single mainstream party strong enough to hold the center and the periphery stumbling and squabbling coalition governments would bring democracy into disrepute again this would only benefit the forces of political islam which are the real long term pretenders to the throne in pakistan because of their strategy of merging religious ideology islamic nationalism and class struggle meanwhile shorn of all responsibility for its actions after retreating to the barracks the powerful army would start pulling strings to destabilize and discredit elected governments from behind the scenes as it has done during every civilian stint in power under these circumstances the gains made under mr musharrafs regime like the peace initiative with india economic revival efforts to stall religious extremism and support for the war against terror however insufficient would fall by the wayside without generating an alternative sustainable governance paradigm one other significant issue needs to be factored into the analysis in the next five years many middle class army officers recruited from the urban areas of pakistan during the islamicization years of gen zia ul haq in the s will become three star generals these homespun officers are all imbued with islamic nationalism anti india sentiment and anti westernism their anti americanism is rooted in the s when the u s cut off all military aid to pakistan for pursuing its nuclear program as field officers they compelled mr musharraf not to wage war against "our own people in waziristan" at the behest of america they remain unhappy at the ostracism of pakistans nuclear hero a q khan by gen musharraf again at americas behest and they have personally benefited in terms of perks and privileges from the direct intervention of the army in politics and civilian affairs if the army is not led in the future by a strong moderate and cosmopolitan leader it could institutionally succumb to the collective mindset of islamic nationalism pakistans military has historically been part of its problem but left to themselves pakistans mainstream democrats conservative and liberal alike have not been able to provide the solution meanwhile the country has become seriously ungovernable and the states writ has progressively broken down in large areas of the nation political islam is seeking to fill these spaces what is needed is a transitional power sharing partnership between the military and political parties on the basis of an agreed moderate and liberal reform agenda a sort of truth and national reconciliation process that heals political wounds and charts the road to a new pakistan it is a tall order much will depend on whether or not mr musharraf can pull off the next general elections without provoking an effective opposition boycott and further instability that in turn will depend on renewed efforts to diffuse the current judicial crisis and make new political allies after the elections he will have to take off his uniform and share power with mainstream politicians in order to enlarge the new governments capacity to reform state and society in the past mr musharraf has demonstrated the skills of a commando in blasting his way out of trouble or beating a tactical retreat when the odds were against him but in recent times he has seemed isolated arrogant and rigid which mr musharraf will prevail what will pakistan look like with or without him in the near future the conclusions are not foregone mr sethi is the editor of the friday times and daily times in lahore pakistan
