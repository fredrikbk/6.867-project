mailing cases of wine to customers in new york she decided to make a federal case of it "i was furious never so cross as cross as i can get " ms swedenburg told the washington post in april a month later the supreme court ruled in swedenburg v kelly that a new york law preventing wine sales across state lines was unconstitutional the decision was hailed by winemakers who confront a bewildering array of state laws created after the st amendment which repealed prohibition in gave states the power to regulate alcohol "it is a huge boon to the wine consumer " says jeremy benson executive director of free the grapes a napa calif based group that opposes state regulation on wine after the swedenburg decision more states opened their borders to mail order wine sellers now of americans

filed suit in to ensure she wasnt violating the law the family winery still does very little mail order sales ms swedenburgs day before the nations high court was set in motion in the early s when lawyer clint bolick of the institute for justice a washington d c based libertarian law firm stopped by her middleburg va tasting room there he discovered "a chardonnay with the toastiest nose i can remember " mr bolick wrote in his book "davids hammer" which includes ms swedenburgs story in an anthology of david vs goliath tales mr bolick and ms swedenburg got to talking he writes "when i told her that among other things i challenged regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship she exclaimed have i got a regulation for you " a career foreign service officer she discovered her love of wine and her future husband and fellow foreign service officer wayne swedenburg while stationed in saigon in the early s "we drank really good and bordeaux and cabernets " she said in the interview both farm kids the swedenburgs purchased a middleburg farm in the mid s first raising angus cattle before adding a vineyard in the early s by the early s the swedenburgs were producing at least five different wines including pinot noir riesling and "cest la vie " a wine that ms swedenburg once described as "a european style rose with oomph " the couple handled most operations themselves from planting the vines to monitoring the grapes for sugar content with a refracting scope mail order sales amounted to about to of the cases of wine she was selling each year she said in a wall street journal interview she didnt realize she was breaking the law until she read in a wine magazine about new state laws prohibiting mail order sales "we also have an angus cattle business here and i sell them all over the country " ms swedenburg said "so why cant i sell wine the same way " ms swedenburg a member of the daughters of the american revolution saw the law as inconsistent with the economic union underpinnings of the u s constitution "protecting the constitution is every bit as important as what my revolutionary ancestors did " she said in the interview she carried small copies of the document in her pocket to distribute to anyone who took an interest her lawsuit initially filed in federal court in manhattan ended up involving a clash between two parts of the constitution the commerce clause which makes it illegal for states to erect protective barriers against each others products and the st amendment which empowers each state to regulate alcoholic beverages as a result of the amendment most states including new york created a three tiered system with wholesale distributors between alcohol producers on the one hand and stores and bars on the other as small wineries began to bloom in the s more states began to create exceptions to the three tier system allowing wineries to market their wines directly through tasting rooms or to supply restaurants themselves says bill nelson president of wineamerica a washington d c winery trade organization direct sales to consumers mushroomed further with the expansion of the internet in the s increasingly alarmed wholesalers lobbied state legislatures to pass laws banning direct sales to consumers and successfully urged congress to empower state attorneys general to bring cases against wineries in federal court wholesalers with the help of former christian coalition director ralph reed argued internet sales made it easier for youngsters to obtain alcohol wineries said wholesalers were trying to squash competition in swedenburg v kelly named for edward d kelly chairman of the new york state liquor authority ms swedenburg challenged the new york law allowing wineries to mail wine to customers within the state but barred wine from outside her victory was "the best day for wine lovers since the invention of the corkscrew " mr bolick who argued the case before the supreme court said at the time gordon w murchie president of the vinifera wine growers association an alexandria va based trade association is less sanguine citing remaining disparate state laws "were still suffering the hangover of the prohibition years " he says ms swedenburg expressed regret that her husband didnt see her constitutional arguments prevail "he never made fun of me for doing something as foolish as this some men would say what are you getting into all this foolishness for not him " she told the washington post "he would always be very quiet when id go off on my rampage about the situation " the decision
