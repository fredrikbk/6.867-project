the week ahead our take on coming events airplanes now boarding boeing airbus put final touches on new jets by daniel michaels and j lynn lunsford if executives from boeing co and rival airbus appear distracted at this coming weeks paris air show they probably are thinking about the shop floor the worlds two top plane makers certainly will tout new orders and do their usual posturing at the big european trade show but in an unusual coincidence both manufacturers this year are focused intensely on ensuring their factories are at peak performance for looming milestones boeing is promising to roll out its new dreamliner the first large passenger jet made primarily of epoxy and carbon fiber rather than aluminum in early july unable to pass up a marketing opportunity the chicago aerospace giant has promised to reveal the completed jetliner on july get it but the world will only see the outside so for now the plane only needs to look good not fly an even bigger test comes this fall when boeing promises to get the dreamliner airborne nailing down the exact date of any new aircrafts first flight is dicey because of the work involved manufacturers usually will sacrifice a few days for debugging to avoid hitches but boeing has little wiggle room it is promising to deliver the first dreamliner to all nippon airways co next may barely nine months after boeing gets light under the planes wheels in that time boeing must convince u s and foreign regulators that the plane is safe and reliable anyone doubting how tough it can be to get a new jetliner in customers hands only need glance at airbus the european plane maker promises this october to deliver its first a superjumbo two years late and billions of dollars over budget after three postponements that sparked months of management upheaval and continuing financial pain at parent company european aeronautic defence &amp space co airbus managers say the superjumbo and the company are back on track there is little doubt airbus will get its first a off to singapore airlines ltd on time the plane was wired up in january and now is undergoing extensive testing the bigger challenge for airbus will be delivering dozens more as and getting the program back on course its success at that should become clear by next years air show at farnborough outside london politics a message for democrats move further to the left by jacob m schlesinger american liberalism is holding a victory party this coming week to celebrate its resurgence and to prod democrats to move even further to the left the annual three day "take back america" conference opens monday at the washington hilton drawing together a spectrum of progressives old organized labor community activists and new moveon org bloggers every major democratic presidential candidate will stop by a year ago the gathering drew attendees this year organizers expect "we really do believe were driving the debate right now " says conference organizer robert borosage who rose to prominence on the left as part of jesse jacksons presidential campaign "its a historic turn a repudiation from the last years of conservative dominance " the democratic sweep of last years congressional election was just the start activists can also credibly claim credit or blame depending on your view for pushing the new democratic majority and the aspiring democratic presidential candidates to go further than they had planned on a number of issues large and small that list includes the partys near unanimous endorsement for universal health care and withdrawal from iraq after liberals blasted congressional leaders three weeks ago for paving the way for a new war funding bill senate majority leader harry reid said he may find new ways to challenge president bush on the war this coming week possibly pushing a bill that would revoke the presidents initial authorization one cautionary note liberals also cite as a "success" the candidacy of ned lamont who did succeed in defeating connecticut sen joseph lieberman in last years democratic primary only to lose the general election to mr lieberman running as an independent liberals arent yet satisfied a big part of the coming weeks events is about "the need to drive the debate further " as mr borosage puts it he ticks off a range of areas where party leaders and presidential candidates remain out of step with where the progressive coalition wants them to go while the candidates all use mr borosages preferred rhetoric on iraq they still talk too much for his taste about a big military and a muscular foreign policy not enough about multilateralism and shifting resources from the pentagon to other causes party leaders still embrace balanced budgets and the fiscal discipline that became a big intra democratic dividing line in the s between old style liberals and the disciples of president bill clinton and treasury secretary robert rubin perhaps the most significant event of the conference will be the speech tuesday morning by democratic presidential front runner hillary rodham clinton while her two main rivals former north carolina sen john edwards and illinois sen barack obama have competed aggressively for the liberal base the new york senators campaign has reflected more the tensions between the partys centrist and progressive wings mrs clintons own rhetoric has in recent weeks sounded more and more well pre clintonian from her opposition to a free trade agreement with south korea to a speech devoted to the theme "i believe we can curb the excesses of the marketplace " how much further she goes in the coming week will signal how far the left has taken back the democrats if not america immigration for republicans poll shows perils by gerald f seib the troubled bill to overhaul the nations immigration system arrives back on the senate floor in the coming week that alone represents an act of either great political courage or great political folly on the part of the republicans who have brought the legislation back to life which comes in greater measure courage or folly will be determined in part by what happens in the next week of course but the stakes in the effort particularly for the republicans behind it become clear from a look inside a new wall street journal nbc news poll which delves into the immigration issue the survey makes clear that the easy path for both president bush and the republican senators who stand with him in promoting the immigration overhaul would have been to simply let the bill die there now is no doubt that it was yanked temporarily from the senate floor earlier this month because of intense resistance among conservatives which prevented senate leaders from bringing it to a final vote the poll paints a picture of opposition that increases steadily as you move left to right across the political spectrum the survey asked americans whether the immigration bill that the senate is considering is an "acceptable compromise " among self identified "strong democrats " said it was of "strong republicans" agreed by contrast of strong republicans agreed that the measure gave "too many compromises to illegal immigrants by allowing them to stay in the u s " just of strong democrats shared that sentiment a point gap between the true partisans on the key issue in the debate to be sure some feelings about immigration appear to be bipartisan in this time of rising anti immigrant sentiment a striking of those surveyed said they strongly favored requiring all immigrants who apply to become citizens to learn english and strongly favor imposing new fines on businesses that hire illegal aliens yet the toughest job of explaining clearly falls to the republicans who have decided they are prepared to swim against a strong tide president bush himself sens john mccain mel martinez and jon kyl among others their specific job is to rebut conservative arguments amplified by right wing blogs and radio talk shows across the land that the bills provision allowing an estimated million illegal aliens to stay and seek legal status doesnt amount to amnesty or at least any more amnesty than illegals enjoy by simply staying below the radar screen now their next task will be to deliver perhaps two dozen republican votes for passage the broader task that the bills sponsors face is the tricky one of saying the legislation will both tighten border security and be uplifting for america by welcoming new blood a mixed message if ever there was one sen edward kennedy tried to strike the balance at a capitol press conference as the bill was revived "it is about broken borders and national security " he said "but it is much more than that if this nation stands for anything it stands for hope it stands for progress and it stands for opportunity "
