pursuits books the day the tornadoes swarmed f by mark levine miramax pages &# over the course of hours in early april tornadoes including a staggering six fs wreaked destruction across the country it was the worst tornado outbreak on record with twisters roaring into states the swath reached from illinois to new york in the north and from mississippi to alabama in the south the death toll was thousands were injured some communities were essentially wiped off the face of the earth as mark levine writes in "f " meteorologists were astounded by the intensity of the storms never before or since have more than two f tornadoes been reported during a single outbreak and they are rare the f level twister that destroyed greensburg kan a few weeks ago was the first such storm in eight years the past years have seen just half a dozen fs yet in half a dozen were loosed on the countryside in one day in the hands of a less gifted writer "f" would be just another disaster book in what has become a crowded field but mr levine wisely avoids concentrating solely on the white knuckle drama of the violence and its aftermath he provides clear explanations of how and why severe storms and tornadoes spring to life in the earths atmosphere and he leavens his account by telling us about the life of tetsuya "ted" fujita the japanese born university of chicago meteorologist who developed the fujita scale a method of rating tornado power fujita acquired national fame during the media frenzy following the tornado swarm around that time he discovered the microburst a severe and sudden downdraft from a thunderstorm that can cause plane crashes during take offs and landings earlier this year the national weather service adjusted the tornado classification system calling it the enhanced fujita scale fs will now be called efs but mr levine is at his best when he tells the story of the outbreak by focusing on the people of limestone county ala and on the ways they coped with a sudden terrifying assault from the sky a sheriff lies down in a ditch seeking safety but the storm plucks him up and blows him yards before setting him down safely "it was as quick as a car wreck as quick as getting shot " mr levine writes nearby a pastor and and a group of church elders who had been warned by the sheriff of the tornados approach lie in the same ditch linking arms and praying as the tornado roars past a white car whipping through the air above them once the storm is over limestone counts its losses more than a dozen dead hundreds injured houses and mobile homes destroyed and begins to rebuild although the tornado rampage of was extraordinary it was not a disaster on such an epic scale that it became embedded in the american psyche as hurricane katrina has done no major cities were devastated and the wreckage occurred in pockets over a vast area but that is the way with tornadoes they aim their violence more narrowly than hurricanes they do not swell up slowly from the sea tracked by the weather channel over several worrying days but appear in what seems like an instant daggering down from a blue black sky that americans from the appalachians to the rockies learn to fear "f" memorably conjures the tornado effect for anyone who has never seen it but one can be grateful for the book above all as a well told story of natural danger and human resilience mr burt is the author of "extreme weather a guide and record book " a revised and updated version has just been published by norton
