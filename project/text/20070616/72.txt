pursuits the golf journal the problem with par if players at this weekends u s open cant hit the target score who can the course at oakmont country club site of this weekends u s open is one of the hardest in the world even as its normally set up for members it has bunkers two or three times the normal number and greens so slick and slanted that sam snead once joked that the coin he used to mark his ball there was constantly at risk of sliding off the putting surface yet the u s golf association in setting up the course for this weeks championship felt it needed to make oakmont even tougher so it narrowed the fairways and allowed the rough to grow so long that in many cases players are having to chop their balls out sideways with a wedge just to get back to the fairway the hole locations are perilous as a result only two players nick dougherty and angel cabrera finished under par in the first round and the scores during fridays second round were even higher averaging about seven strokes over par the winning total will almost certainly be over par perhaps even higher than last years five over winning total at winged foot which raises the question whats the point of par anyway officially according to the usga which in addition to staging the open is golfs governing body par is "the score that an expert golfer would be expected to make for a given hole par is errorless play under ordinary weather conditions allowing two strokes on the putting green " but if this weeks national champion an "expert" if ever there was one playing at the top of his game cant come close to shooting par this quasi scientific formula for par would not seem to hold much water neither does it make much sense when applied to typical winning scores on the pga tour which err in the other direction frequently falling in the to under range the record low winning total for a four round pga tour event is under par the truth is that par although useful as a standard for comparative difficulty on ordinary golf courses for regular golfers is really more of a philosophical concept when it comes to golf played at the highest levels historically par is a relatively recent addition to the games vocabulary in the really olden days players didnt even bother keeping cumulative scores golf was a game played against an opponent on a hole by hole basis match play as its now called only required keeping a record of holes lost won or tied but towards the middle of the s it became necessary to establish a basis of comparison so that golfers from different courses could compete against one another using handicaps originally what we now think of as par golf was called bogey golf the bogey score being what the flawless but theoretical bogey man based on a character in a popular british song of the period would always shoot to beat you but as balls and equipment improved the consensus on what constituted a "perfect" score on any given hole drifted lower and people began to think of the bogey score as one worse than the ideal score which became known as par from the latin meaning "equal " the notion of par has always been somewhat mushy and is further confused by the words other english language usages in most pga tour events for instance subpar scores are par for the course unless of course a pro is feeling physically subpar in which case he might shoot above par on the other hand only amateurs with decidedly above par skills can ever hope to post subpar scores critics of the way the usga sets up courses for the open and there are many accuse the organization of a macho obsession with "protecting" par exhibit a is the organizations penchant for violating its own guidelines for the relationship between par and a holes length par three holes according to the guidelines should be no longer than yards yet the par three eighth at oakmont this week is listed at yards depending on the wind some players may not be able to reach the putting surface even with a driver par fours should be no longer than yards according to the guidelines but five of the par fours at oakmont are playing longer than that including the ninth which played as a par five the last time the open came to oakmont in from the usgas point of view however these changes are necessary not "to humiliate the best golfers in the world but to identify them " in the famous words of then president sandy tatum after the "massacre at winged foot" in when the winning open score was seven over par deeming a par five to be a par four for instance also usually means shortening the hole just enough so that everyone in the field with a good drive can reach the green in two since long approach shots of yards or more are among the most difficult in golf only the very best players will have consistent success when played as a three shot par five with most players laying up and firing at the pin on their third shots using short irons the hole wouldnt reward the best players skill as decisively also forcing players to confront many extremely long par fours messes with their minds which is another important setup consideration the open unlike most other pro tournaments is all about pars and patience not birdies and bravado and only players with great mental fortitude can prosper mike davis the usgas point man in setting up open courses has said that if players arent walking off the course muttering to themselves he hasnt done his job the competitors of course know that what counts is not their score in relationship to par but to each other and they devise various methods for trying to get their heads around that notion sergio garcia for instance told reporters this week that in his mind the "real par" for oakmont was not by that standard his one over par in the first round score was pretty good unfortunately by the usgas standards it was nine over par in the end no matter how you think about par the low score wins email me at golfjournal wsj com
