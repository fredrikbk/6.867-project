pursuits sports college athletics wanted female players thirty five years after title ix colleges struggle to fill womens teams at just foot and with only average speed in the pool julia bridgford isnt exactly a college swim coachs dream but in the last three weeks the high school senior from dewitt mich has been the subject of intense interest from over teams she says shes weighing offers from multiple schools willing to pay her as much as &# a year to compete "i didnt think there was a chance " ms bridgford says of swimming in college "apparently i was wrong " this month marks the th anniversary of title ix the law that effectively bans sex discrimination in college athletics and as a result schools have added thousands of new womens teams coaches and facilities but many colleges say they are still wrestling with a problem getting enough athletes to fill the mandated roster spots that is forcing a debate about why spots on womens teams are going begging some people say there just isnt enough demand to meet the supply of roster spots but others argue that the real problem is sellerspaltry recruiting budgets and coaches who dont make enough effort to find athletes the upshot a ripe opportunity for aspiring teen athletes and their families there are now a substantial number of roster openings even scholarships but families may have to be unusually proactive in searching them out "there are so many scholarship dollars out there for women to pursue "says terry crawford head track and field coach at cal poly san luis obispo john bellos year old golfer daughter

bello paid about &# for a package of statistics and video to send out to colleges in the two months since alex has received letters and emails from about schools some like the university of virginia in the top in the country in response many coaches say they have been stepping up their recruiting game significantly in recent years some are turning to companies that scour high schools for even marginal talent while others are paying for more high school athletes to visit their campus ray looze the head swimming coach at indiana university says two years ago the womens swim team had people while the men had since then he has doubled the number of "official visits" by female recruits to as many as a year and increased the womens team to swimmers "weve closed the gap but we still have more work to do " he says many schools are also starting to look abroad for athletes in the last few years college prospects of america an athlete marketing service based in ohio has opened offices in

passed participation in the ncaa by women has jumped to from fewer than and college sports like softball and womens soccer owe their popularity in large part to the law despite these gains at some schools there remains a gap in participation between the men and women of more than percentage points groups like the college sports council say tens of thousands of roster spots go unfilled each year on the other side of the debate groups including the womens sports foundation say the figure is actually significantly lower of course the very top schools in each sport can fill their rosters with the cream of the crop relatively easily but plenty of colleges including many in division i struggle particularly in swimming track and field tennis and golf dick gould director of tennis at stanford university says that in northern california there are half as many qualified female high school players as men but nearly twice as many scholarships to give them there are several ways that a school can comply with title ix but many do it by making sure that the number of male and female athletes are proportional to the overall student body to balance out big roster mens sports like football schools often add equivalent womens sports or cut mens sports that dont generate revenue mostly for that reason womens crew with some teams exceeding is one of the fastest growing college sports many
