business insight a special report global business seven myths about outsourcing no we can have it all in recent years theres been a seemingly endless boom in offshore outsourcing but companies that think handing off an operation to an overseas provider is easy can get a rude awakening the transition often proves to be much more costly and complicated than expected and companies often find that their high hopes about cost savings and greater efficiency dont pan out to get a better understanding of the problems and solutions we conducted a survey of senior executives at of the largest financial services firms in the u s and europe arguably this industry is the deepest repository of leading edge practices in outsourcing and offshoring we also conducted approximately interviews with outsourcing clients and vendors from financial services as well as other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and the media we found seven common myths that vendors and clients cling to about offshore outsourcing false assumptions about how the process should work they range from unrealistic expectations to poor ideas about how to structure contracts to mistaken views of risk these ideas can prove deadly to the success of outsourcing projects and even to an organizations overall services sourcing strategy heres a look at those destructive myths and how to overcome them  we can have it all in our survey the executives told us their top criteria for judging the success of an outsourcing project were efficiency or cost reductions effectiveness or improvement in service and flexibility or the ability to increase and decrease production rapidly each in itself is a perfectly valid objective the problem is that many clients expect and indeed many vendors promise all three in the same outsourcing project the fact is achieving one objective means making a trade off in another area lets say a company wants to boost effectiveness by adding more features to its outsourced products or services even under the most efficient conditions costs will increase for instance a company with an outsourced call center might set a new goal for effectiveness answering of calls within a minute rather than in most cases that means the call center must have more employees on hand especially at peak periods theres also a very prosaic reason why mixed motives are dangerous if people inside the client company have different expectations about the outsourcing project its in political trouble before it begins it is important to prioritize outsourcing objectives and communicate them widely within the organization  outsourcing services is like buying commodities many companies think outsourcing is a "frictionless market " with no transaction costs or other restraints a senior operations manager at one of europes largest financial services companies told us "youll be surprised at how many of our people thought that outsourcing back office operations is fundamentally like procuring stationery " on the contrary outsourcing carries significant transaction costs starting with finding a vendor and negotiating a contract then theres the expense of moving the operation from one location to another and subsequently keeping it in sync with the rest of the company an offshoring manager from a large financial services company said "we still have a significant number of key people on our outsourcing partners sites in india but we are very reluctant to bring them home as we still lack confidence in our partners ability to deliver if they are not there this was not envisioned at the start and has caused numerous issues and unexpected costs when we went into the deal to reduce cost "  we need an ironclad contract outsourcing is not a one time transaction but an exchange that evolves over time as competitive conditions and technology change so many executives try to write complex contracts that protect them in a host of possible circumstances but thats usually a waste of time as many of our respondents discovered it is impossible to take all contingencies into account instead companies should write a contract that ensures that all parties understand their roles and responsibilities and then put in place a process for negotiating changes the risks of writing an overly complex contract are significant in some cases we learned that a protracted and contentious contract negotiation process can sour relations between vendor and client even before the beginning of the outsourcing project moreover sometimes deals are so inflexible that customers must sign a fresh contract to handle any unexpected changes such as new industry regulations or a change in business strategy the "simple" act of negotiating and writing a contract also brings high legal fees and it may lead to productivity losses as middle managers hold up a job until a new agreement is in place sometimes contracts are so long and convoluted that nobody involved has the time or patience to read or understand them managers end up working off rules of thumb making the contract provisions irrelevant rory graham a partner in the technology and outsourcing practice of global law firm morgan lewis related a revealing anecdote a large u k government department that outsourced information technology services thought it wasnt getting the best out of its contract so it engaged mr graham who was then at another firm to study the contract and other documentation to identify possible noncompliance or breach of contract that it could use as leverage in renegotiating the deal mr graham walked into a meeting and was confronted with a document that was pages long aghast he asked why it was so long "so we can control the vendor " was the response "well clearly that isnt happening now or i wouldnt be here " he countered  contracts dont matter on the other hand sometimes companies try to rush into an outsourcing deal without a contract they draft a memorandum of understanding or letter of intent informal documents that set out grand visions of the client vendor relationship rather than focus on nitty gritty details as a contract does these documents are useful in setting the joint vision of the relationship but they are not substitutes for contracts since they are usually vague on critical operational details they may be hard to enforce in court lead to different interpretations by different managers and ultimately undermine trust in the client vendor relationship moreover negotiating these agreements sometimes isnt as easy as it looks in some lawyers experience managers negotiate and agonize over a memorandum of understanding for such a long time that they could have negotiated a contract instead for instance a large u k based insurance company negotiated an outsourcing memorandum for over days it was in place for less than a month before the contract negotiations kicked in and changed the terms of the deal another version of this myth holds that companies dont need a contract because the deal with the service provider is much more than a simple procurement relationship the client would rather regard the vendor as a partner or another division of the company this is a good goal for the relationship but not something that can be assumed on day one since the client and the service provider will not always have identical interests and aspirations for example the vendor might want to bid for a contract with the clients competitor but the client might object to the deal fearing its trade secrets might be disclosed a contract can help head off those tensions the process of negotiating a contract will enable the client and vendor to understand the risks rewards and interests for both sides that in turn will make it clear what should be on and off the table in the relationship  vendors are insurance companies the sharing of risk between clients and vendors is one of the most contentious issues in outsourcing leading to acrimonious negotiations and poor relationships there is a very common and reasonable perception that vendors should bear greater liability for failure than regular in house employees who do a job however client executives shouldnt take an exaggerated view of risk or believe that they can outsource risk entirely the client can specify standards that the vendor must meet and penalties for falling short however it is unrealistic for the client to ask the vendor to take on unlimited liabilities or unlimited indemnities for failure lets say an auto maker outsources the manufacture of its seat belt system it remains the auto makers responsibility to ensure that the seat belts meet quality standards before selling the final product an automobile to customers outsourcing doesnt make the auto maker less responsible for the ultimate quality of its product for instance ford motor co faced numerous lawsuits arising from the defects found in firestone tires used in ford vehicles similarly when pharmaceutical companies outsource clinical research the responsibility for the integrity of the research still rests with the pharmaceutical companies rather than spending inordinate time negotiating unrealistic contractual clauses in case of failure clients and vendors should concentrate on understanding the process as it operates they should identify acceptable rates of error based on real data and jointly invest in understanding and eliminating the problems  its not our headache anymore similarly sometimes companies think once they outsource a process they can wash their hands of it "the biggest obstacle to a satisfactory partnership is that one party sees itself as relieved of all responsibility and abdicates control to the other " in the words of one senior executive from a client firm outsourcing does not mean that the process is not your headache anymore though it is one would hope less of a headache sean egan former head of offshoring for aviva plc the u k s largest insurance firm holds that the key to avivas success in its offshoring efforts in india has been the high level of engagement of his senior management team the team visits offshore locations two or three times a year and when there they make a habit of giving informal talks to employees in order to build a greater sense of identification with aviva the senior managers also work with offshore managers on process improvement plans and the senior managers ensure that the offshore managers are treated as part of their extended team and conduct joint management development and training activities such efforts are "what makes this a partnership and a very successful one at that " says p v kannan the ceo of customer inc one of avivas offshore partners besides building a partnership there are other strategic reasons why clients cant afford to "fire and forget " when outsourcing an operation the client firm should retain the knowledge underlying the process and how it fits with the overall organization if the client firm simply abandons the process to the vendor it can compromise its ability to produce future innovations for example auto makers still carry out r&amp d in parts they stopped making years ago and often collaborate with parts suppliers in these efforts this allows the auto makers to keep up with changing market trends and technology it also allows them to figure out how to integrate those new technologies into their existing processes another problem with losing all knowledge related to a process is that the vendor holds all the cards and could easily take advantage of the client it also puts the client in a difficult position if it wants to end the relationship the client may no longer have the competence to evaluate other vendors negotiate suitable contracts or even lay out how the job should be done  our first failure should be our last attempt very few companies report great success with their very first outsourcing project but that doesnt mean they should give up there is evidence of significant learning on the part of both the client and the vendor in such relationships with time partners learn to communicate better leading to more efficient coordination and fewer mistakes clients and vendors learn about each others needs and are able to negotiate better contracts focusing on value creation our survey indicates that companies with greater experience have greater success implementing more complicated models and face fewer problems in their outsourced and offshored activities dr puranam is an assistant
