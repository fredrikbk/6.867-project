pursuits books five best these works are essential to appreciating american literature of the s says scholar jeffrey hart  the shores of light by edmund wilson farrar straus this is the best introduction to the literature of the s and one of the best of edmund wilsons many books its exciting to see him consider important writers as they first appear for example in he noticed the emergence of ernest hemingway with the private publication in paris of two small pamphlets "three stories and ten poems" and "in our time " dismissing the poems wilson understood that hemingways prose was "of the first distinction at its best as a limpid shaft into deep waters " wilson concludes "the shores of light" with a page remembrance of edna st vincent millay recalling her as she was when she came down from vassar college to greenwich village "running around the corner of macdougal street flushed and laughing like a nymph " in millays poetry collection "a few figs from thistles" "second fig" is only a couplet but it epitomizes her independence and brilliance playing off a new testament verse "safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand come and see my shining palace built upon the sand " the twenties had arrived  this side of paradise by f scott fitzgerald scribner though everyone reads "the great gatsby " f scott fitzgeralds "this side of paradise" is largely forgotten lionel trilling once told me that when he read it he thought "thats the way to go to college " he compared the novel with goethes "sorrows of young werther " both evoke the special intensity and pain of first love and each was written when the author was very young when werther loses lotte to a clod he kills himself but when amory fitzgeralds hero loses his golden girl rosalind connage he merely drowns himself in a bottle in this first fitzgerald novel we see the emergence of his elegiac lyrical style with its dying fall rhythm amorys mother beatrice "absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again "  an american tragedy by theodore dreiser boni &amp liveright ezra pound impresario of modernism demanded that writers "make it new " but theodore dreiser stayed with the older naturalism of balzac and others even as he portrayed a rapidly changing country a prose poet of the city and money dreiser could also create a sense of urban loneliness in "an american tragedy " a naive young man from kansas city the tragic clyde griffiths his first name suggests celluloid collars and sleeve garters is dazzled by the "society" he finds in the fictional lycurgus n y he has gone to work there as the foreman of a factory owned by a wealthy uncle even as clyde begins an affair with factory girl roberta alden he is entranced by socialite sondra finchley and longs to join her rarefied world when roberta becomes pregnant and she presses clyde to marry her his desperate ambition plays itself out in a famous scene of lake borne murder it is clydes ordinariness that evokes pity and fear his "democratic" tragedy that powerfully engages us  winesburg ohio by sherwood anderson b w huebsch "winesburg ohio" stands at the gateway to the s and foreshadows a great deal that is important hardly anyone reads sherwood anderson now but the cycle of stories that constitute "winesburg ohio" deserves serious re consideration writing with the voice of a natural storyteller anderson relates a series of episodes but the book is hardly episodic instead it is tied together and strengthened by a common theme the difficulty that people have communicating with one another except for moments of profound understanding epiphanies in the sense that james joyce used the term gertrude steins "three lives" showed anderson the uses of simplicity speech rhythms and repetition and he skillfully deployed them all in this minor masterpiece  a farewell to arms by ernest hemingway scribner in my opinion this is hemingways best novel written with a style and lyrical force that is apparent from the famous opening "in the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees " catherine barkley hemingways greatest heroine is an english nurses aid in italy during world war i her fiance a british officer has been killed on the somme blown to bits then a wounded man an american ambulance driver named frederic henry is brought into the hospital where catherine works and they find a certain solace in each other as she later lies dying in childbirth and frederic tries to comfort her with empty words she passes the british officers discipline on to him "im going to die she said then waited and said i hate it " her resolution in the face of death she "holds her line under the maximum exposure " as hemingway put it elsewhere reflected the writers own stylistic and moral imperative mr hart an emeritus professor of english at dartmouth college is the author of "smiling through the cultural catastrophe" and "the making of the american conservative mind"
