pursuits travel summer trips a baltic time warp estonia juggles its high tech hub and pre soviet roots wi fi on the bus reeds on the roofs muhu island estonia estonians like to brag that theirs is the most wired country in the world they can pay for parking taxis and many purchases in shops by dialing a number on their mobile phones trains and intercity buses are equipped with wireless internet but here on muhu island just two hours from the capital tallinn you could easily think you were in another century many of the wood and stone houses which date as far back as the th century have roofs made from woven reeds harvested at the shoreline some elderly residents still have outhouses the juxtaposition between tallinn and muhu island illustrates a great advantage of traveling in the baltics this trio of tiny countries lithuania latvia and estonia achieved independence from the soviet union years ago and towns untouched by progress are only now starting to open up in one day you can go back centuries in time from a capital city with international restaurants and the latest technology to villages that reflect another era these villages arent unchanged because theyve been preserved as showpieces for tourists they were left to stagnate for decades under soviet occupation the inhabitants of muhu island for instance are mostly fishermen and farmers just as theyve always been the last russian troops didnt leave estonia until and the animosity between estonians and russians still hasnt faded only last month when the democratic estonian government relocated a soviet war memorial from the center of tallinn to a cemetery ethnic russians rioted on the streets in russia government officials called for a boycott of estonian goods and some rail and road links to estonia were briefly cut off estonians still shudder at their memories of soviet occupation "i remember a time when people were fighting for washing powder in a store " says kristiina ojamaa destination marketing consultant for the estonian tourist board "there were lines for bread lines for eggs lines for everything we couldnt celebrate christmas because kgb agents were standing outside the churches making note of who went in " when the soviets left the economies of the baltic countries were in shambles by the s with tourism around the world booming governments decided that the wisest approach was to restore the old buildings and not to demolish them figures speak dramatically of what has happened to tourism in the years of soviet occupation estonia drew two million tourists over that whole period now more than two million come every year each summer more than cruise ships call at tallinn alone development capital has poured into tallinn and high tech companies such as skype which was founded in estonia have helped give the country the nickname "e stonia " estonians attribute their countrys technology advances to a president who was an internet fanatic and to the fact that the economy was so destroyed during soviet times that it had to be rebuilt from scratch skipping decades to jump into the computer age recent landmarks in estonia include what could be the worlds first election this march allowing voting over the internet and a "virtual" government and parliament where meetings and votes are conducted via the internet there are still challenges however thirty percent of estonias million people are ethnic russians and as the recent rioting over the removal of the soviet era statue showed the loyalties of some of them still lie toward moscow rather than tallinn outside tallinn the government is still trying to rebuild the countrys shattered infrastructure from the days of soviet occupation muhu island provides a prime example of the development lag in rural areas in the soviet era tourists werent even allowed on the island unless they had gotten a permit from soviet authorities since the island housed a military base today although the buildings of a th century manor have been converted into a lovely hotel called padaste manor it only has rooms and can only be reached by driving three miles down a bumpy dirt road on the rest of the island there are a few houses that have been turned into bed and breakfasts in short muhu island is a tourists paradise its particularly attractive because so few tourists get here the foreigners who come to muhu each year are mostly from finland which lies just across the water from estonia and from the neighboring baltic countries the island is flat the traffic sparse and the terrain a scenic mix of forests and old houses the loudest noise i heard was the sound of birds chirping this is in dramatic contrast to tallinn which has come a long way from soviet times the cobblestone streets of the old town some of them forbidden to cars are crowded with people both locals and tourists jammed into many restaurants bars and boutique shops that have sprung up with finland just across the baltic sea the estonians shared nordic roots are reflected in their blond hair and tall stature english is widely spoken and although estonians are friendly enough when you start a conversation theyre so reclusive otherwise that they make the finnish who have a reputation for reclusiveness seem gregarious one night at a restaurant with a largely european menu i found a perfect tom yum goong the thai spicy shrimp soup when i asked the waiter how this came to be he looked at me startled rather than try to answer my question he turned his eyes to the ground and shuffled away trip planner estonia getting there you can fly to tallinn from many major european capitals or from the u s fly to helsinki finland and take a minute ferry ride to tallinn reaching muhu island is easy by renting a car in tallinn driving minutes then
