poll figures on gays in military are yet another combat zone in his attack on the militarys "dont ask dont tell" policy "dont ask who cares " editorial page june former congressman bob barr says "three quarters of returning iraq and afghanistan vets said in a december zogby poll that they are personally comfortable interacting with gay people " but he conveniently fails to mention that the same service members were significantly less likely to agree than disagree with "allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military" see http www zogby com cssmm report final pdf mr barr says "a majority of those who knew someone gay in their unit said the persons presence had no negative impact on unit morale " but more than a fourth said the gay persons presence negatively impacted both unit morale and their own personal morale soldiers endure enough stress without worrying about compromised personal privacy in close quarters same sex sexual harassment subcultures based on sexual orientation and the possibility of contracting aids or other sexually transmitted diseases in combat situations where troops are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids mr barr claims "the ban on gays openly serving in our armed forces is hurting a military that is stretched thin " but if the ban were lifted recruitment gains among homosexuals might not even offset losses among heterosexuals disturbed by the new policy indeed of the zogby poll respondents said they definitely or probably would not have joined the military if gays and lesbians had been allowed to serve openly another expressed reservations about joining if "americans are quick to sniff out pandering and expediency " as mr barr maintains theyll immediately detect his expedient use of selective poll results to advance a politically correct not to say militarily correct agenda the military should maintain policies that serve its best interests not the whims of commentators far removed from combat charles d eden atlanta mr barr makes a solid case against "dont ask dont tell " that he now opposes that policy is evidence that once a member of congress leaves that highly politicized institution he begins to think rationally on issues it is against conservative principles as mr barr states and "unconscionable" for military personnel to investigate the private lives of service members and discharge them for being gay or lesbian the american taxpayer gets a bad deal when a gay or lesbian service member with a college degree and specialized skills are discharged and replaced with a "hodgepodge that includes ex cons drug abusers and high school dropouts " not only is "dont ask dont tell" discriminatory it is bad economics mr barrs fellow republicans in congress would be wise to heed his advice and end this disastrous policy james patterson san francisco although i am heartened by bob barrs reversal of opinion regarding the service of gays in the military i was surprised that among his good reasons for allowing gays to serve openly cost recruitment retention individual privacy and the readiness of americas forces was not the very simple and best reason the right of all americans to fight and die for their country john dewis los angeles
