pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink scotch terms scotched say goodbye to "vatted malt" whiskies it is admittedly a small category of scotch defined as a whisky made up of multiple single malts but it has caused an outsize fuss in the world of whisky in the past couple of years the category will remain but the terms long used to describe it are getting the heave ho the fracas got its start in when the giant drinks conglomerate diageo started to run out of the venerable single malt cardhu the brand had taken off in spain one of the largest scotch markets in the world keeping up with demand for a newly popular product is a challenge for any manufacturer but scotch whisky has to sit in casks for a minimum of three years and there is an expectation that a premium brand will have at least a decade in dunnage diageo tried to fill the orders by fudging what was in the bottle combining surplus malt whiskies from other distilleries with the waning stocks from cardhu a single malt is scotch whisky made at an individual distillery pot distilled from a mash of malted barley and water combine one or more single malts with a base of industrially produced grain whisky and you get a blended whisky such as dewars johnnie walker cutty sark or chivas regal but what if you take several prime single malts and mix them together without any of the grain whisky filler traditionally such whiskies have been called "vatted malts " diageo might have put that term on the label of the reformulated cardhu but it chose another traditional phrase for such stuff "pure malt " which not only seemed to blur the line between a single malt and a blend but perhaps even suggested that the new cardhu was better more "pure" than the old single malt version scotlands representative at the european parliament neil maccormick accused diageo of "sharp practice " leading the charge for diageos competitors was tony hunt of william grant &amp sons maker of the single malt glenfiddich painting a target on diageos johnnie walker j&amp b and white horse mr hunt asked what adulterations might be happening in blended scotch "if you cant trust their single malt any more " facing a public relations fiasco diageo backed down ultimately agreeing in to pull the cardhu "pure malt" from the market and reintroduce the single malt version the company also got behind a new set of definitions proposed by the scotch whisky association rules that not only aim to do away with the term "pure malt" but with the phrase "vatted malt" as well a combination of malt whiskies is now to be called a "blended malt scotch whisky " and the whisky association is lobbying to have the change codified in scottish law jim murray author of the "whisky bible " hates the new terminology calling the rules "completely nuts " his complaint is twofold first is an argument from tradition the term "vatted malt" has been used for decades and is "perfectly suitable" once folks learn what it means the second is that putting the words "blended malt" on the label can only confuse consumers who will now have to winkle out the difference between "blended scotch whisky" and "blended malt scotch whisky " but the most heartfelt objection comes from those whisky vatters who worry that "blend" has come to be synonymous with "inferior" in the minds of scotch drinkers "the marketing machinery of the scotch whisky industry has drilled everyone to believe that single means good and blended means bad " says compass box boss john glaser given that only about of scotch sold world wide is single malt mr glaser suggests that companies have been undermining their overall market "it is ironic that the industry has gotten itself into this pickle " compass box makes a range of blended whiskies that includes a number of different blended malts as well as malt grain blends and even a soft sweet blend made up exclusively of grain whiskies i tried a bottle of its eleuthera a blended malt with a coherent combination of brine smoke and a whiff of anti acne astringents perhaps the most widely available blended malt is diageos johnnie walker green label before the cardhu fiasco green was promoted as "the art of pure malt " but now the label hews to the scotch whisky associations new wording i wasnt exactly overwhelmed with green it struck me as strangely one dimensional for a whisky made up of more than a dozen distinctive malts it didnt help that that particular dimension was a medicinal one at least i liked it better than a fairly recent entry to the blended malt market called hogshead pure malt someones going to have to change their label soon which was shallow and thin far more satisfying were the blended malt whiskies i tried from the famous grouse a house making something of a specialty of vatted malts yes there is still the basic famous grouse a mainstream blended whisky that is the most popular brand in scotland but now the grouse has a range of malt blends aged to years it doesnt hurt that the brand belongs to the edrington group which owns two of the most celebrated distilleries in scotland the macallan and highland park and uses whisky from both in its blended malts in my blind tasting the year old famous grouse malt was one my favorites well rounded and admirably structured and at about &# a bottle it is a terrific bargain but the standout of the bunch was the year old famous grouse blended malt deeply honeyed sweet with raisins and dates the whisky tastes as though they used some of the most sherry rich casks from the macallan warehouse a gorgeous whisky the famous grouse shows why blending malts can be worth all the definitional bother it has the smooth balance of a traditional blend but with layers of complexity one would expect from the best single malts lucky is the dad who finds a bottle of it under the fathers day tree sunday morning email me at eric felten wsj com a sampling of whiskey very good the famous grouse year old blended malt scotch whisky &# a deeply mellow honeyed whisky with complex well knit layers of malt raisins and sherry oak good very good the famous grouse year old blended malt scotch whisky &# well rounded and admirably structured a bargain compass box "eleuthera " &# a coherent if astringent combination of smoke and brine good johnnie walker green label &# not bad but disappointingly one dimensional
