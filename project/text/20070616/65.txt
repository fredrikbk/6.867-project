pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece men are mars women are venus a botticelli paintings timeless lessons on male female relationships and the differences between the sexes anatomy of a classic the th century italian renaissance painter sandro botticelli may be best known for his "birth of venus " but it is his "venus and mars" that really speaks to us today brilliant not only in its artistic virtuosity and beauty but in the way it ingeniously renders in a single frame a vital message using mythological figures botticellis painting is a parable of the balance of power between the sexes venus gazes at a sleeping mars after a romantic interlude she is draped in a flowing white gown her curly locks cascading gently over her delicate bosom her body resting casually against a soft apricot colored pillow the goddess of love reigns supreme she has subdued the god of war grinning satyrs play impishly with the spoils of conquest one has donned the war gods helmet wrapping his arms around the handle of the gods mighty spear another glances back at venus to gauge her reaction to the sport a third mischievously puffs a deafening blast through a large conch into the insensible gods ear and the fourth at the bottom has crawled saucily into the warriors discarded armor mars slumbers deeply in the sylvan glade surrendered of heart depleted of strength his magnificent masculinity subjugated by the power of love botticellis lighthearted scene evokes the perennial tug of war between men and women in a manner that brings to mind a modern sitcom mars his physical needs gratified wants simply to sleep venus still wide awake yearns for tender conversation for some indication that his interest in her is more than sexual her ambivalent expression reflects a mixture of fulfillment and wistfulness along with just a touch perhaps of smug satisfaction that her charms have reduced the fearsome god of war to a lump of inert snoring flesh the painter delivers a vivid and emphatic warning no matter how great the passion moments of blissful union are fleeting in botticellis vision of the power struggle between the sexes woman is stronger than man on the playing field of love she has stamina and strength the exhausted man slumbers but emotionally the womans needs are greater so the man oblivious to the finer feelings has more leverage the leering satyrs suggest the artists sympathy for the woman involved with a man whose only interest is carnal when will venus become bored with the war gods surfeit of testosterone for how long will the delights of sexual congress be enough to sustain the relationship venus certainly doesnt seem to care if the prankish satyrs succeed in disturbing her lovers slumber to the right of the sleeping gods head botticelli has painted a wasps nest a poignant touch suggesting the potential for a painful outcome to this relationship ironically in roman mythology among the offspring of venus and mars were a daughter harmonia the goddess of concord and two sons phobos and deimos the gods of fear and panic and there is an even darker subtext the liaison of the goddess of beauty and the god of war was an adulterous one vulcan the ugly and misshapen god of the blacksmiths forge maker of weapons of war was venuss husband and the brother of her paramour mars the cuckolded deity would ultimately take his revenge trapping the faithless pair in flagrante in a net and dragging them to the top of mount olympus to shame them before the other gods the florentine painters artistic jewel strikes a chord in us today because it is a candid honest and witty reflection of the romantic aspirations interactions and realities that we all learn the hard way a droll visualization of the vicissitudes of passion it distills loves exaltations and nadirs its accords and confrontations its pleasures and fragility into a single engaging image aesthetically botticellis genius is manifest not only in his elegant technical rendering of the delicate details of wispy garments and seminaked bodies but in how he composed the intersecting legs drooping arms and sloping bodies in languorous lines to convey the postcoital mood painted about botticellis romantic masterpiece which now hangs at the national gallery in london uncannily prefigures modern psychobabble concerning the differences between the sexes john gray in his best selling "men are from mars women are from venus " codified as symbols of the idiosyncratic behavior of male and female humans the two planets that bear the deities names today countless books and articles echo the paintings themes as well as its rich nuances it is a dear abby column on canvas enlightening us about the tensions inherent in the union of opposites as current now as it was half a millennium earlier when botticelli created it little is known about botticellis love life what experiences or impulses drove him to depict this scene on canvas did he like mars ever shed his armor and shield and helplessly succumb to the overpowering enticements of love did the fate of the god of war ever befall him the artist who painted religious subjects allegories and mythologies was about years old when he portrayed the roman deities the circumstances for which botticelli painted "venus and mars" are not known although it may have been as an adornment for the bedroom of a patron but if botticellis fable of rapture and its aftermath was a commissioned work who was the patron a man who was psychologically secure enough to enjoy the reminder of womens power over men a woman who wanted to warn her lovers that she was not to be treated as a plaything to be used and tossed aside or did botticelli in a puckish mood present his unsuspecting benefactor with a subtle commentary on the patrons own skirmishes with the opposite sex one thing is for sure as long as humans get caught up in affairs of the heart botticellis "venus and mars" will resonate with romantics and art lovers alike mr rachlin
