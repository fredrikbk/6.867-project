the buyout backlash debt and the corporate tax base wave of buyouts is seen eroding u s revenue original sin of code as congress looks at raising taxes on some publicly traded private partnerships there is growing scrutiny from politicians and others of a possible erosion to the corporate tax base as companies go private one unintended consequence of the buyout boom kicking into high gear is that more companies will be able to lower their tax bills by deducting the hefty interest costs arising from their huge debt loads it is much like a homeowner who buys an expensive house saddles it with a ton of debt and reduces his tax burden by deducting the interest costs from his taxable income robert willens a tax expert at lehman brothers inc estimates that if buyouts run at current levels the corporate tax base will be eroded by more than or as much as &# billion each year "the wave of buyouts is going to erode the corporate tax base in a very meaningful way " says mr willens whose firm helps private equity firms take companies private it is an issue that is taxing congress and others in washington a senate finance committee staffer said friday that this is one of the many issues the panel is looking at as it reviews tax policy in this area the treasury department hasnt looked at this particular issue yet but said it is examining all issues surrounding partnership taxation according to a spokesman the scrutiny comes at a pivotal point and raises a broader question are buyouts "just a tax game " says josh lerner a harvard business school professor specializing in private equity or are private equity investors "increasing the efficiency of companies so the gains in terms of improved economic dynamism could make up for the loss in tax revenue " mr lerner says the answer isnt clear though private equity firms are quick to point out that when they take companies private they boost profits ultimately raising the amount of taxable income produced they also argue that they pay capital gains taxes on sales of assets over the past few years corporate tax receipts have been surging amid a boom in profits yet there has been a raging debate about erosion to the corporate tax base besides the growing use of debt by private equity firms the corporate tax base is getting hit on other fronts the growth of tax shelters and the "deferral" of taxation on foreign earned income until it is repatriated to the u s jason furman senior fellow at the brookings institution says the u s has the second highest corporate tax rate among the countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development but ranks fourth lowest in terms of corporate tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product in large part because of the tax benefits afforded to debt financing the focus comes as buyouts are booming with announced u s deals this year of &# billion already poised to eclipse last years heady levels of &# billion for all of according to thomson financial companies typically pay taxes on their profits which run at about when federal and state taxes are combined in the u s but when private equity firms take companies public they tend to load them up with debt often financing the deals by borrowing as much as and investing the interest payments on this debt are tax deductible often the payments are so large they completely wipe out profits triggering losses for a company "there is an artificial preference for issuing debt over equity which is the tax codes original sin " says edward kleinbard a lawyer at cleary gottlieb steen &amp hamilton llp law firm in new york as part of tpg capital and gs capital partners &# billion buyout of wireless company alltel corp alltel is borrowing a little more than &# billion in additional debt if alltel borrows the money at an interest rate of it will have about &# billion in incremental tax deductible interest estimates lehmans mr willens that would wipe out the &# billion in pretax income alltel had last year mr willens says and create a net operating loss that can be carried forward to future years to offset pretax income in those years for tpg previous buyouts such as continental airlines inc oxford health plans and burger king holdings inc "have resulted in companies paying significantly greater taxes over time " says a spokesman who adds todays successful buyouts "have much less to do with financial engineering and everything to do with growing earnings and therefore taxes " similarly to finance its &# billion acquisition of first data corp a processor of electronic payments kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co has said it is borrowing as much as &# billion in incremental debt to finance the acquisition if first data borrows money at it would have &# billion in additional tax deductible interest wiping out its pretax income of a little over &# billion and creating a loss for future years mr willens says to be sure any drop in corporate taxes because of bigger debt burdens will be offset somewhat by capital gains taxes paid by shareholders who sell their companies and taxes on interest income but long term capital gains tax rates are far lower than corporate tax rates and a larger share of debt is in the hands of tax exempt investors today than it was in the late s during the last buyout binge so far the erosion in the corporate tax base isnt noticeable revenue from corporate income taxes rose from of gross domestic product in fiscal to in fiscal the highest level since according to the congressional budget office roughly two thirds of that gain is attributable to increases in corporate profits the tax implications of buyouts have been fiercely debated ever since these deals blazed onto the financial landscape in the s back then some academics argued that the loss in revenue from higher debt levels were offset by gains elsewhere including taxes when investors exited investments and on interest income held by taxable investors but that mightnt be as powerful a force now drawing on data from the bureau of economic analysis the share of personal interest income that is exempt from tax rose to in from in says len burman director of the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution in washington also todays buyout wave is different because "even more investors are tax exempt than in the s so the capital gains from exiting deals dont actually generate much revenue for the treasury " says victor fleischer a university of illinois college of law associate professor
