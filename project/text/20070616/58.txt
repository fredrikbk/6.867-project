pursuits fashion a sons first suit its the rare shopping trip a man will embrace one dads tale of a coming of age tradition even in a hip hop world there comes a time when every boy needs a suit like most year olds my son ben usually wears jeans and a t shirt occasionally alternating with basketball warm up pants and a t shirt or for summer occasions shorts and a t shirt but suits still make the young man whether the occasion is a confirmation a wedding or a high school graduation and when it comes to buying that first suit its often dads who supervise the buying i may not know what makes a sneaker cool or the names of the rock bands on the t shirts of bens friends but i still know how to buy a suit ben needed a suit for his bar mitzvah i began my hunt by sending out emails to several dads i know asking for advice on where to shop my parameters were simple i wanted ben to look good but i didnt want to break the bank since he would probably outgrow anything i bought him by the fall the responses surprised me along with recommendations was a surge of fatherly emotion one friend said "dont let barb my wife handle this you should go yourself you and ben its a special experience buying your son his first suit " another friend emailed me the name of a store near where we live in boston it was "where i got my suit many years ago for my bar mitzvah " he wrote "the fact that my parents took me to a very nice clothing store to buy my first suit was truly memorable " in a follow up email he warned me off discount stores "it should be something special for both of you " i remembered my father taking me to buy clothes for my bar mitzvah my father now was a madison avenue advertising executive one of his accounts brought him frequently to barneys in manhattan which back then was more a mainstream mens store than the fashion powerhouse it later became i asked him recently about that day "i met you after school " he said "your mom and i had agreed that we would get you a suit or a blue blazer and gray slacks whichever looked better when we got to barneys i turned you over to louie the tailor the first time he showed me you in the outfit he said to me so why are you crying " i vaguely remembered my dad crying in the middle of barneys why were you crying i asked him "it was the pants the pants matching the jacket this is the first inkling you get of your son as a grown up " he said but my dad hadnt bought me a suit instead he decided i looked better in a blue blazer and gray slacks i asked him why that was he said something about fashion at the time favoring blazers but then he blurted out the real answer "to me you were too young for a suit if i gave you a suit you would have been too grown up " what i remembered most about that afternoon were the ministrations of louie the tailor the way he pulled and tugged at my jacket sleeves and pants sticking in pins making chalk marks peppering me with questions i didnt have a clue how to answer cuff or no cuffs high rise or low rise it was like i was being indoctrinated into a secret society for ben i settled on syms a discount chain but one at which a friend of mine said he had bought several suits and at which he said the salesmen were friendly by the time our saturday shopping trip came around i was more nervous than my son ben headed next to a little league game was wearing his bright red baseball uniform complete with cleats we walked in and headed for mens suits a salesman eyeballed ben and steered us to the racks of suits in his size ben pulled out a beautiful dark blue suit i looked at the price tag joseph abboud &# "lets think about this one " i mumbled ben got the message "here are some cheaper ones " he said he tried on a ralph lauren blue suit but the salesman declared the fit wasnt quite right we moved up a size but the only blue suits were double breasted which neither ben nor i liked i began to think we would be heading for the blue blazer and gray slacks then ben pulled out a black suit with subtle black stripes "not black " i said "blue " "no dad " said ben "this looks good i want to try it on " i waited on a bench outside the dressing room while ben put it on then he stepped out the tousled boy in the red baseball uniform suddenly looked like he could run a board meeting or give me legal advice the suit made him look taller and older maybe the salesman clucked his approval "white shirt red tie hell look great " the salesman said pins in his mouth chalk scratching across bens pants and jacket the tailor began the same litany of questions i had first heard when i was "cuffs or no cuffs how high a rise do you want them " ben looked at me with the same questioning eyes i had once turned on my father i still felt black was a risk i turned to the only other woman i saw in the store a woman sitting on the bench next to me waiting for her boyfriend to come out of the dressing room she was about and was chewing gum "what do you think " i asked gesturing at ben in his suit "he looks sharp " she replied sold on the day of his bar mitzvah ben did a great job every time someone came up to compliment me i responded "yes and didnt he look great in his suit " i wont necessarily be there for all the other places his suits will take him to job interviews and dinner parties and dates but ill always know one thing ill know hell look good later i told a colleague about our shopping trip the father of two grown boys nodded "thats nothing " he said "wait until you help him get his first tuxedo for the prom "
