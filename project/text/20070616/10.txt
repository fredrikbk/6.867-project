business insight a special report innovation making change it isnt easy to disturb the status quo it isnt easy to manage change thats true whether it be a change in a companys business the way an organization is structured peoples responsibilities or compensation or anything else that disturbs the status quo among other things an effective "change manager" has to know how to set up informal networks and delegate responsibilities empowering people throughout the organization the position requires not only commitment and energy but also the ability to inspire those qualities in others to keep things moving and to overcome resistance a practical approach and the ability to adapt quickly to new situations are crucial but perhaps the first step in managing change is to eliminate some common assumptions about the way change works what follows are several of those assumptions and recommendations on steps companies should take to more effectively manage change dont assume that individuals have a natural aptitude to adapt resistance to change is inevitable given the doubts that change creates in the minds of employees will i be good enough where will i fit in who will i be in the new organization dont expect everyone to accept change or to cope without help identify those who find it difficult to adapt and offer help in the form of a training program or individual coaching dont assume that individuals will function rationally theres the most rational way to achieve a business objective and then theres the way most people in an organization tend to work they act in their own best interests the person responsible for managing change needs to be able to decipher the motivations behind peoples actions that understanding can help reduce opposition to change dont assume that change is automatic change doesnt just happen because an announcement is made it depends on clear and effective communication of common goals right from the start and throughout the process such communication helps reassure those who may find the change obscure or unsettling and keeping everyone focused on the main objective is one way to overcome any power struggles within the organization dont assume that organizations are naturally dynamic organizations reflect the people who constitute them as a whole they are inclined to inertia in part this reflects the fragmented nature of organizations at every level and in every division managers are making decisions that they believe only they are qualified to make for change to take place they must all accept that there are viable visions other than their own to achieve this the change manager must effectively relay information between the different levels in the organization to break down the barriers between them so that they can pursue a common goal along the way the change manager needs to be not just a boss but also at times a coach and trainer and an example to everyone by remaining open to the opinions of others dont assume that company culture is easy to change company culture is also inclined to inertia it wont simply change because that is what would be best for the organizations new objectives the change manager needs to be able to recognize behavior that reflects company culture and that threatens to pose a barrier to change and then to make a conscious effort to change that behavior dont assume that every aspect of the project will work out exactly as planned the diplomacy of the change manager is essential in motivating staff the change manager must be willing to listen to the people involved and be prepared to judge whether certain elements of the status quo need to stay so that the projected broader change can happen dont assume the change manager can be effective without explicit authority the change manager must be given the authority to exercise his or her influence throughout the organization the person in this position should enjoy a status identical to that of department managers and be directly responsible to the board of directors the change managers authority should be backed up by a letter that assigns him or her as the leader of the project dont assume that anyone can improvise being a change manager too often a project that involves significant change is assigned to a manager without any regard to that persons ability to manage change managing change requires particular skills to keep people motivated and focused and to overcome their resistance to create and work within a network that transcends the traditional organizational hierarchy it is important for the change manager to be a leader someone with the charisma to inspire optimism and enthusiasm in the people working on a project projects that involve change should be run by an experienced change manager failing that the project manager should be supported by someone with experience in the field dr remoussenard is senior professor in human resources and change management at
