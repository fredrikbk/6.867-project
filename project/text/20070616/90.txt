the weekend interview with vaclav havel bohemian rhapsody prague vaclav havel sits on a bench in the garden of the czernin palace sporting dark shades and a black velvet blazer it is eleven oclock in the morning the weather is warm and sunny and the former president of the czech republic is having a beer seated next to him is fellow ex dissident and former israeli deputy prime minister natan sharansky the two have just posed for a group photo taken with a dozen or so dissidents from sudan china iran egypt syria belarus and russia among other places they are all guests of honor at a conference that seeks to harness the power of their dissent into a global force for freedom or what mr havel called in a essay "an international community of the shaken " he and mr sharansky are chairmen of the event living proof that in the long struggle between conscience and tyranny conscience occasionally wins given that mr havel is widely regarded as a living saint in the west not quite nelson mandela but close i arrive at the interview half expecting to find one but mr havel is determined to live that expectation down and as i take mr sharanskys place on the garden bench he proceeds to do a partially convincing job of it "first of all if everyone liked what i say id be suspicious " he says speaking in czech through an interpreter but his english is good enough to understand most of my questions without translation although what he wryly calls his "sojourn in the political world" lasted more than years and involved nearly all the great political questions of the day including the dissolution of the warsaw pact the division of czechoslovakia into two states and the eastward expansion of nato and the european union mr havel goes out of his way to stress how little he knows how unsure he is of his own opinions i ask if the czech republic should host a u s antiballistic missile and radar installation the great question roiling his country as well as the rest of europe at the moment he says it would be "a good thing " though in a tone that suggests he isnt quite sure he really believes it i ask whether the west ought to diplomatically engage regimes like iran that routinely jail and murder dissidents he recalls that french president francois mitterrand used to make a point of meeting with dissidents on his state visits to communist czechoslovakia and doesnt see why "an american envoy negotiating with iran cant in the same day receive publicly all the iranian student leaders " but he adds "im no expert someone like former u s secretary of state madeleine albright can judge it " then there is the question of the war in iraq and mr havels support or rather apparent support for it in january mr havel along with the prime ministers of britain portugal italy spain denmark hungary and poland put his name to an op ed in this newspaper calling on the u n security council to enforce its resolutions against iraq titled "united we stand " the article made note of "american bravery generosity and farsightedness " which "set europe free from the two forms of tyranny that devastated our continent in the th century " it went on to say that "we must remain united in insisting that saddams regime be disarmed" and that the security council "must maintain its credibility by ensuring full compliance with its resolutions " today however mr havel seems to sing from a different hymnal the argument for war based on saddams weapons of mass destruction "did not play well with me " he says the rationale for war was "not well articulated" and the "timing of the attack was questionable you could ask why it wasnt done five years earlier or five years later " the absence of international support for the war was also problematic he says and he warns the u s with a nod to sen william fulbrights book "the arrogance of power " an early favorite of his about the dangers of setting oneself up as the worlds policeman still mr havel defends what he calls "the idea that the world could not be indifferent forever to a murderer like saddam hussein " this too is a longstanding theme of his earlier in the day he had warned the other dissidents at the conference that while "a big danger of our world today is obsession an even bigger danger is indifference " such indifference he believes is particularly acute in modern western societies what in october he described in his great essay on "the power of the powerless " as the "general unwillingness of consumption oriented people to sacrifice some material certainties for the sake of their own spiritual and moral integrity " allow that mentality to fester mr havel warns and "it would be suicide for the world" the indifference to the freedom of others ultimately becoming indifference to freedom for ourselves this suggests something of a paradox for mr havel brought home by a rabidly anti american protest the day before in the square just outside the palace "if we had staged such a demonstration back then you would have ended up in prison immediately for several years " he says adding "its proof that something has changed " does the overabundance of freedom therefore lead to the cheapening of its currency mr havel believes "there is an ethic" in the protest because the demonstrators are if nothing else "interested in the state of the world and in change by nonviolent means " once again he sounds less than convinced as he says it i ask whether the quality of art in the west hasnt in fact suffered in conditions of almost unfettered liberty "i wouldnt declare it as a rule " he ventures "but lets say that semi democratic conditions are inspirational and that art plays a more important role because it assumes the place of politics " at the same time he strongly disavows my characterization of him as a political playwright "i am just a playwright " he says "the fact that my plays are based on my experiences of the world is not the result of a program to be a politician a sociologist could have found himself in this position remember that in what was then the communist world there were no alternative political elites lech walesa was an electrician " this raises the question of what the appropriate attitude is for statesmen artists and ordinary citizens alike for living moral dignified lives under any political circumstances mr havels famous answer also from "the power of the powerless " is contained in the concept of "living in truth" a notion that generated as much resentment as it did admiration within czech intellectual circles in the communist era mr havel saw "living in truth" as the act of refusing to participate in the everyday lies that were the cornerstones of totalitarian rule sham elections hypocritical expressions of solidarity for the oppressed patently fraudulent statistics on the economic progress of the socialist bloc and so on in the essays most memorable passage mr havel ruminated on the phenomenon of the greengrocer who places marxs slogan calling on the workers of the world to unite "among the onions and the carrots " why does he do it not out of any serious conviction mr havel argued but simply to "get along in life" and "to conceal from himself" by means of a high sounding slogan "the low foundations of his obedience " to some of his critics the idea of living in truth smacked of moral posturing by a man who being the childless and bohemian playwright he was mistook drama for life and failed to appreciate that in the face of dictatorship "getting along in life" was hardly an ignoble or degrading objective mr havel shrugs the criticism off "i was never a priest preaching how people should behave or a moralist bullying others to be this way or that " he says "i simply thought about the behavior of the majority as well as that of the minority and tried to analyze it " still mr havel plainly believes in the universal validity of his analysis "it is not true that there are some places in the world where only authoritarianism is possible " he says "we have people at this conference from china from iran all these people who are connected by their desire to lead a dignified life by democracy we can understand the conditions that respect this desire " living in truth also underpins mr havels attitude toward the global campaign for human rights and democracy "i think we can talk to every ruler but first of all it is necessary to tell the truth " turning his attention to russias president whom mr havel rather gleefully calls "ras putin " picking up on a joke made earlier in the conference by an iranian dissident he says "with me he gets more and more suspicious we have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior former president boris yeltsin was what he was but he wasnt rasputin " what about the dissidents at the conference what is his advice to them to me mr havel says simply that they deserve "absolute support " to them he says "we can only reach our happy end if we dont count on it and if we have faith that what were doing makes sense " its useful advice mr havels life as a dissident concluded with his fairy tale ascent to the presidency but that probably wont be the case for most of the people in the room and some of them realistically speaking might not live out the rest of the decade they must draw on some deeper wells of inspiration to carry on in the face of their respective tyrannies here again he is returning to territory he has traversed before in his lengthy interview with czech journalist karel hvizdala published as the book "disturbing the peace " mr havel observes that hope "is not the same thing as joy that things are going well or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for early success but rather an ability to work for something because it is good the more unpropitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope the deeper that hope is " my interpreter signals that the interview must now come to an end a final question the cover of mr havels latest volume of autobiography "to the castle and back " has a picture of him as a younger man smoking a cigarette i ask him if he misses it he looks at me as if to say that i have at last managed a half way intelligent question "i smoked for years " he says gravely "i have not had a cigarette for years but i am by no means a fanatical nonsmoker and i would not like to spread the idea of nonsmoking around myself if my doctors told me i could smoke again well then i would light up this very day " mr stephens writes "global view " the wall street journals foreign affairs column
