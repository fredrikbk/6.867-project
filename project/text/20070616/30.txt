how to hedge wisely amid higher volatility investors seek shelter in options new etfs the stock markets wild swings in recent weeks a new record one day and a big drop the next has some investors looking at how to protect themselves against unexpected losses the notion was far from their thoughts just a few weeks ago when stocks seemed to have nowhere to go but up now even with the dow jones industrial average up this year the ugly drop from its record on june to a monthly low on june makes a more cautious approach look appealing citigroup strategist tobias levkovich for one still believes the broad trend is for the market to rise as the strong rally in the past two trading sessions demonstrates but in the short term he says the market could remain "choppy" amid extreme reactions to both upbeat and downbeat news "theres no middle ground " mr levkovich says "were obviously having renewed volatility and some people are getting shaken out of the market as they lose confidence " for a stock investor hedging against losses may involve any of several strategies in which he essentially bets against himself using options contracts and other instruments while some of these are quite complex exchange traded funds and even buying treasury securities offer other possibilities historically many bullish wall street pros have shunned hedging viewing it mostly as a way to leave money on the table if stocks rally "i dont know why people are so resistant to the idea of buying downside protection " lehman brothers portfolio manager aaron gurwitz told reporters recently "if you buy fire insurance for your house youre not disappointed at the end of the year if your house doesnt burn down " mr gurwitz has been keeping a close eye lately on the chicago board options exchanges volatility index which tracks options prices as a gauge of how much market turbulence investors expect in the months ahead the index known as the vix is up nearly this year at signaling that investors have increasingly been buying options as a safeguard against losses in their stock holdings but the index also is about below its highs in early march which mr gurwitz interprets as a signal that options are still relatively cheap hence his firms portfolio advisors have been steering clients lately to buy options on the stocks they own each options contract traded on a public exchange like cboe conveys the right to buy or sell shares of the underlying stock at a fixed price before a certain expiration date an investor who wants to hedge the risk of holding say shares of a hypothetical company xyz inc purchased at &# a share might buy five bearish options contracts called "puts" conveying the right to sell xyz stock at &# a share if the stock goes up the options will expire worthless but the investor will pocket the profit on his shares if the options didnt cost much the price of the insurance was minimal and if the stock price goes down the put options go up in value making up for the decreased value of the investors shares hedging strategies with options work best for investors who are expecting something close to a decline in stocks says jim bianco president of bianco research referring to the traditional definition of a correction that removes speculative excess to allow a bull market to continue mr bianco doesnt believe that such a full blown correction is under way in recent years wall street has introduced an array of other products that individual investors can use such as electronically traded futures contracts on indexes like the standard &amp poors futures are similar to options except that they convey an obligation not just a right to buy or sell the underlying asset upon contract expiration exchange traded funds like the ultrashort qqq proshares listed on the american stock exchange move inversely to the technology focused nasdaq index for every dollar that an investor invests in the index via a separate etf cents worth of the ultrashort shares would provide downside protection according to regulatory filings such offerings seem best suited for active traders who want to guard against losses in a position they are going to hold for a day or two says paul mazzilli an etf analyst at morgan stanley over longer periods the risks of racking up big trading costs or having the etfs performance diverge from that of the underlying index begin to pile up he says "all these things are useful in some way in the marketplace " says mr mazzilli "it just depends on your level of trading experience and the strategy that youre using " meanwhile the recent run up in treasury yields to more than means that treasurys have gotten cheaper for investors who simply want to move money out of riskier stocks holding these bonds until maturity provides a guaranteed return lehmans mr gurwitz says his portfolio advisory team is currently doing a midyear reassessment of its recommendations to clients and may end up increasing the allocation to bonds "its definitely something we have to take a hard look at the longer that yields stay in this ballpark " he says
