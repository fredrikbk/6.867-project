pursuits books sounding the nazi alarm a free lance diplomat tried to warn the world he also kept a diary advocate for the doomed edited by richard breitman barbara mcdonald stewart and severin hochberg indiana pages &# james g mcdonald was an american ahead of his time in an era the s when diplomacy was typically conducted between the official elites of nation states he jumped into the fray as a kind of free lance ambassador of what we would now call human rights and he did so because he had the foresight to recognize the disaster about to befall europes jews mcdonald did not seem like the sort of person to take on such a role in the early s he was widely seen as pro german having argued in many speeches that the reparations demanded by the versailles treaty were weakening germany those views and his "aryan" looks this son of a methodist mother and catholic father was tall and strikingly blond misled as well the nazi leaders he had met in his travels as refugee commissioner for the league of nations and head of a nonprofit group called the foreign policy association the germans assumed he was one of them or at least sympathetic to their outlook in fact mcdonald was shocked by the nazis rise to power and felt an immediate horror at the prospect of the nazis carrying out the policies implied by their annihilationist rhetoric at the time not a few foreign observers were arguing that the partys anti semitic pronouncements were a kind of populist election ploy not a guide to how they would govern he knew such rhetoric firsthand at a meeting with adolf hitler on april at the new chancellors office hitler told him "i will do the thing that the rest of the world would like to do it doesnt know how to get rid of the jews i will show them " the organizations mcdonald represented although private gave him astonishing access to public officials and to use a modern term pundits thus he shared his worries with the future pope pius xii president roosevelt french prime minister edouard daladier jewish leaders in britain and the u s and even the influential syndicated columnist walter lippmann with whom he lunched regularly his words of warning were met variously with indifference disbelief sympathy and concern suffice it to say that those who were in a position to do the most on behalf of the jews did not do as much as they might have often they did very little indeed luckily mcdonald was a fanatical diarist he dictated entries to stenographers and typists as he traveled the world summarizing his conversations observing his surroundings and drawing portraits of the people he met for years an important section of the diaries was lost delaying publication then three years ago the key segment was discovered and donated to the holocaust memorial museum in washington now they have been edited by the historian richard breitman along with mcdonalds daughter barbara mcdonald stewart and the scholar severin hochberg the result "advocate for the doomed the diaries and papers of james g mcdonald " is a compelling look at one mans efforts to do something about a looming catastrophe at times the book is inspiring mcdonalds prescience and energy are simply amazing but because we know what is soon to happen to europes jews we share his frustration that no one seems to be listening we feel what it was to be an advocate for the doomed the book is made all the more accessible by its sporadic character sketches mcdonald speaks with the german jewish banker max warburg who in late is both very worried and compellingly philosophical telling mcdonald that "the only basis for a feeling of oneness among jews is religious " henry goldman of goldman sachs a longtime defender of germany until he returned to berlin in and was badly treated by the new regime is "a broken old man" by april of that year very different mcdonald writes "from the vibrant confident person i had talked to in new york two months before " felix frankfurter in his own notes on a conversation with mcdonald says that mcdonalds efforts to seek "mitigation for the jews" through hjalmar schact a nazi economics adviser "was like trying to ram his head through a concrete wall" in short it wouldnt work mcdonald came to agree after lunching with albert einstein at the harvard club in mcdonald describes him as "a man of great charm of personality of considerable natural acuteness in worldly matters and of great breadth of human sympathy " an interesting subplot in the diaries is a change in mcdonalds own thinking he had hoped that fdr would make him ambassador to berlin in when he was passed over he found himself participating in a quiet unofficial diplomacy preferring off the record conversations with roosevelt and journalists like lippmann hoping that they could use their sway to get the u s to take a tougher line toward the nazi regime only in the mid s did he change his mind and work openly to get jews out of germany among other things employing his personal contacts to try to open to no avail restrictive immigration laws in the u s and elsewhere it should be noted that "advocate for the damned " for all its heft it comes to pages is merely the first volume of three the next volume will offer among much else evidence for a startling exculpatory claim based on papers unearthed by mr breitman in the national archives and reviewed by the journal the book will show that international business machines the american based company with extensive foreign dealings in the s was not contrary to previous claims indifferent to the looming genocide edwin black in his "ibm and the holocaust" alleged that the company had unusually close business relations with hitlers germany and that its card punch machines made it possible for nazi bureaucrats to identify and track down jews some historians have already faulted the book arguing that ibm had close business ties with many countries at the time and that the perpetrators of the holocaust did not depend on card punch machines but the charges have stuck mcdonald was apparently in contact with ibm chief executive thomas j watson who in turn lobbied on behalf of jewish refugees even urging secretary of state cordell hull in to set up a jewish homeland the next installment of mcdonalds diaries will no doubt offer crucial details of this controversy and a great deal more about this fascinating important and minutely recorded life mr johnson is a journal reporter now on a nieman fellowship at harvard university
