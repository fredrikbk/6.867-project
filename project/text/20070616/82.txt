the buyout backlash narrow effort wont hit partnerships in other fields the congressional move to close down a tax advantage enjoyed by some publicly traded private equity partnerships wont likely result in collateral damage for partnerships in other industries that enjoy the same tax break thats good news for investors in these partnerships namely in the natural resources arena such as firms set up to manage timber or oil and gas assets the change proposed this week by the democratic and republican leaders of the senate finance committee "wouldnt affect them " said robert willens tax analyst at lehman brothers instead the congressional push is "narrowly tailored" to go after partnerships in the asset management and investment advisory industries mr willens added this means the biggest losers even if they enjoy a proposed five year grandfather period before the changes take place are among private equity players namely fortress investment group llc and blackstone group which is looking to soon complete a public offering most other publicly traded asset management or investment advisory companies are structured as corporations so wouldnt be affected by the proposed change one exception alliancebernstein holdings lp the publicly traded fund manager and investment advisory company that is structured as a limited partnership according to securities filings a company spokesman declined to comment still theres always a risk that congress could look to scrap the tax benefit entirely for publicly traded partnerships even if thats not whats currently proposed "i dont believe that this particular proposal would affect any partnerships beyond those firms that it seems to target " said linda carlisle a partner specializing in partnership law at white &amp case llp "but this is just the first volley and any time someone starts to look at the tax code you dont know what will happen " as it stands now certain partnerships can hold onto the tax advantage they enjoy by being a partnership even if they sell shares to the public the tax advantage is that the firm itself doesnt pay corporate tax rather the individual limited partners pay tax on the firms gains which are distributed to them in the form of dividends dividends though are typically taxed at a rate while corporate tax averages about real estate investment trusts or reits a type of investment vehicle that also enjoys significant tax advantages are a different type of structure and so wouldnt be affected by the changes currently being discussed in congress a spokesman for the national association of reits said the industry group doesnt expect congress to undertake any moves that would threaten their tax status only a handful of industries can maintain their partnership status for tax purposes if they go public among them natural resources concerns such as oil and gas or timber concerns asset management and investment advisory firms and some real estate concerns all these firms though must generate at least of their gross income from specific types of activities defined in the tax code to qualify for the tax break additionally asset management or investment advisory firms that must register under the investment company act of dont qualify congress gave these particular industries a tax benefit in terms of partnerships in legislation enacted in at the time numerous companies including the boston celtics basketball team were transforming themselves into partnerships mr willens said that threatened to undermine the corporate tax base and so congress looked to close off that approach although it exempted some industries that had historically used the partnership structure he added
