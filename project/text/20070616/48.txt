politics &amp economics hamas run gaza state poses raft of new problems the emergence of a heavily armed state in gaza under the complete control of the militant islamist group hamas further undermines stability in the region while deepening a humanitarian crisis in the palestinian territory hamas fighters consolidated their control of the gaza strip amid sporadic fighting friday a day after the groups archrival palestinian president mahmoud abbas declared a state of emergency and moved to dissolve the palestinian authority government that hamas has dominated hamass takeover of the square mile area home to million palestinians left israeli u s and european officials struggling to formulate a response almost five years after laying out his personal vision for the creation of a palestinian state president bush had planned to deliver a major policy speech next week with palestinians now split between the largely secular leadership of mr abbas and his fatah movement in the west bank and hamas in gaza that vision appears to be in peril hamass military victory also could also ripple across the region the bush administration has asserted that progress on a palestinian state is an important part of its strategy to win arab support for containing syrian and iranian influence in places like lebanon and iraq but with that aim now in tatters the u s could face steeper challenges in its larger quest to thwart the growing clout of iran in the region since hamas was elected in u s backed elections early last year mr bushs strategy has been to confront the group first by boycotting it and then by bolstering an army loyal to the fatah leader and mr abbas but the strategy has backfired as the internationally shunned hamas used its military superiority with help from iran and syria to rout a larger fatah force in bloody clashes ending midnight friday how washington and israel respond to the hamas takeover in gaza will be high on the agenda when mr bush receives israeli prime minister ehud olmert at the white house monday said mark regev spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry "were still trying to dissect what happened here " mr regev said friday adding that israeli officials had concluded little beyond "this is a new reality " in washington state department officials said the administration will likely attempt to further isolate the hamas led enclave in gaza while simultaneously trying to build up mr abbass strength and prestige in the west bank in hopes he can mobilize a critical mass of moderate palestinians the european union also reiterated its support for mr abbas and said it would continue to distribute humanitarian aid to the palestinians without supplying or supporting hamas yet it remains unclear how moves to bolster mr abbas in the wake of a devastating defeat might repair the rift between the two palestinian territories only a relative handful of palestinians are free to move between them and hamas has remained politically popular despite international efforts to diminish it "all this certainly makes it very difficult to conceive of a two state solution now " said emanuele otolenghi executive director of the transatlantic institute an american jewish think tank and lobby group in brussels u s officials were expected to abandon any hope that fatahs military capabilities could be rebuilt in gaza a key fatah strongman and longtime u s ally in the coastal strip mohammed dahlan was still in the west bank friday after being in egypt and jordan during the fighting as he recovered from a reported surgery although hamas military leaders publicly granted amnesty to fatah fighters and commanders in gaza they have said privately that mr dahlans life would be endangered if he tried to return aaron miller a former adviser on middle east strategy to three u s administrations said washington appears to have lost what little ability it had left to influence palestinian politics "we have no choice but to take a deep breath and figure out whats going on " mr miller said "our options beyond that are virtually nil right now " bush administration critics renewed questions over whether hamas could have been drawn into a political dialogue were it not shunned after the election but administration officials said they pursued the only possible course given hamass refusal to openly renounce violence and recognize israel now nearly all observers said the situation had moved beyond the point of political dialogue on all sides israeli officials worry openly about hamass growing strength they fear the militants might attempt to obtain or develop powerful weapons that could pose additional threats to the southern coastal populations in the jewish state hamas already employs crude qassam rockets each of which consists of a six foot long slender tube packed with up to pounds of explosives and fitted on its bottom with fins and a rocket engine although these barrages of missiles such as over the last month routinely terrify israeli civilians they have no guidance systems but more sophisticated missiles could wreak havoc across southern israel the lebanese militia group hezbollah which received missiles and other weaponry from syria and iran used them to nearly bring northern israel to a standstill during last summers day war the conflict was widely viewed in israel and the arab world alike as dealing a substantial blow to israels once mythical ability to deter attacks creating a hezbollah style threat along israels southern border "is something thats very dangerous " mr regev said adding that israel might be forced to invade gaza if such a threat became real because of those fears significant pressure is expected to build in the coming days on egypts government to better police its border with the coastal strip tunnels burrowed below the town of rafah which spans both egypt and gaza are a crucial link to the outside world for palestinian factions and arms smugglers ferrying weapons below a wall about feet high separating the two sides on the egyptian side of that border friday there were few signs anything had changed local officials said there was no increased egyptian presence on the border despite press reports to the contrary the area is difficult for egypt to control in part because it is officially demilitarized meaning the government is banned under international agreements from building up a military presence there following israels withdrawal in of its permanently based settlers and military forces from gaza egypt was allowed to deploy only military personnel to assist the local police force the crisis born this week out of the hamas military victory might also add to the existing humanitarian crisis in gaza where of residents are now dependent upon united nations food aid according to the world body until now fatahs nominal control of the palestinian security services had served as a sort of cardboard cutout it made it easier for international organizations to maintain their presence in gaza without creating the appearance that they were coordinating efforts with a designated foreign terrorist group john ging director of the gaza field office of the united nations relief and works agency for palestinian refugees said discontinuing aid "is not an option " because the closure of gazas borders means "palestinians cannot escape they have nowhere to go " mr ging said israel had pledged support and that negotiations over reopening gaza for humanitarian convoys were underway marc champion in brussels
