pow romance comics court girls inspired by japanese manga major american publishers aim for new female fans the next wave of heroes in the comic book business may look more like "plain janes" than x men industry heavyweights including time warner inc s dc comics and marvel entertainment inc are betting that girls represent a big growth opportunity for the traditionally male dominated medium its part of a renewed push in recent years by the two biggest comic book companies to court a new audience with products aimed squarely at teenage girls the new titles are inspired in part by the fast growth of translated japanese comics called manga while gory and violent themes aimed at boys are staples of manga fantasy and romantic storylines meant to appeal to girls have helped manga capture the attention of female readers an audience comic publishers have long struggled to attract last month dc comics launched a line of original books dubbed minx which include "the plain janes " about a band of suburban outcasts who form a "secret art gang " other minx graphic novels include "re gifters " about a korean american girl and martial arts enthusiast who falls for a surfer boy who gives a present she buys him to someone else and "clubbing " which follows charlotte "lottie" brook a london girl sent to live at her grandparents dowdy country club after being caught with a fake id at a chic west end nightspot the publishers are following the lead of upstart manga publishers such as los angeles tokyopop and san franciscos viz media both closely held that have managed to draw female readers with a mix of girl friendly content and distribution to both comic book shops and mainstream bookstores trade publication icv puts the total comics and graphic novel market at about &# million last year in the u s and canada with manga accounting for about &# million of that figure the manga category is expanding quickly total sales of manga books jumped to million units in from million a year earlier according to nielsen bookscan which collects point of sale information from retail locations across the country including those operated by borders group inc and barnes &amp noble inc the manga category in accounted for about two thirds of all graphic novels sold in u s bookstores up from slightly more than half in according to nielsen bookscan the figures dont include comic book stores that fast growth helped convince dc that the time is right to cultivate a significant customer base of teenage girls "we were looking at the success of manga as a great sign that teenage girls were actually reading comics again " said karen berger a senior vice president at dc comics who oversees the minx line "girls tend to read more than boys historically and the fact that there hasnt been that much material in the comic and graphic novel form aimed for young girls before this just leaves the area wide open " reading manga can be an unusual experience for the uninitiated the paperback books usually translated from japanese are read top right to bottom left and are priced around &# in some books the first pages remind readers to start at the back manga also has a different pace and story telling style than traditional comics for instance instead of action driven storylines punctuated with frequent fight scenes manga titles especially those aimed at girls often dedicate significant space to awkward silences embarrassing moments and close ups of tear filled eyes friendships and romance tend to figure prominently even against fantastical backdrops that include robots ninjas and vampires viz medias "vampire knight" tracks the adventures of yuki cross who attends a boarding school loaded with vampires its pages feature their fair share of gun play and neck bites but even in this setting a complicated relationship quickly emerges between yuki and zero kiryu who both are responsible for protecting regular students from the vampire contingent and a tall dark dashing vampire named kaname kuran the artistic conventions and techniques of manga can differ markedly from u s comics for example female characters in manga tend to be less voluptuous than the superwomen in u s comics such curvaceous characters can be tough for young women to relate to says nicole lewis a year old manga reader who is going into her sophomore year at the university of massachusetts at amherst "its a little off putting " ms lewis says of some female superheroes in american comics "especially to young women who dont look like that at all " ms lewis says she likes the fact that the female stars of manga are often girls without any special powers who wear normal clothes attend high school and are trying to resolve some life problems "they dont need to be bit by a spider or be from another planet " ms lewis said dc comics has an existing manga imprint called cmx which is translated from japanese the new minx series will mimic the general look and price point of manga but ms berger stresses that the books are designed with american readers in mind they read in the standard left to right manner and theyre written in english not translated meanwhile dcs archrival marvel has also been gunning for female readers although its strategy differs instead of starting a separate line dedicated to the demographic the company has been hiring writers known for their established female following in format these comics are more like traditional superhero periodicals but the companys strategy also involves repackaging the material in hardcover and graphic novel formats last year marvel launched its "anita blake vampire hunter" series of comic books based on the swift selling novels by laurell k hamilton the title character in the series tracks criminals through the sometimes seedy vampire underground of st louis the series has proven popular with women and brought a range of new shoppers into carol &amp johns comic book shop in cleveland says co owner john dudas "they came out of nowhere " mr dudas says marvel has brought in other writers popular with women before in marvel began publishing a miniseries on the character storm a female mutant member of the x men that was written by romance novelist eric jerome dickey before that marvel hired joss whedon the creator of cult television series "buffy the vampire slayer " to write marvels "astonishing x men" title in part because of his track record attracting women readers such moves have been part of a push by marvel over the last three years to try new strategies to bring readers to marvel titles says david gabriel senior vice president of sales and circulation at marvels publishing unit "before that the thought was if you do she hulk that will attract girls " he says the moves to attract female readers come as the comic book industry is at its healthiest point in recent memory in dollar sales from dominant distributor diamond comics to specialty comic shops rose the biggest jump since comic and hobby trade publication icv began tracking figures in last year marvel entertainments publishing segment revenue which includes sales to booksellers and comic shops rose to &# million time warner doesnt break out dcs numbers barnes &amp nobles graphic novel buyer jim killen says sales of manga books are roughly split between the sexes but thats a far cry from traditional comic book audience dominated by male buyers "we want all of our customers to realize this isnt an exclusive club just for college age males " said cliff biggers who owns dr nos comics &amp games in marietta ga "theres material for everyone thats what we keep stressing "
