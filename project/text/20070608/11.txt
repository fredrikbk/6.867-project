canadas pension funds go on the prowl talks on takeover of bce show growing ambition acting like private equity canadas biggest pension funds traditionally a conservative crowd are playing a starring role in what may be the countrys biggest ever buyout deal part of their transformation into bold investors with ambition traditionally pension funds stick their cash into stocks and bonds and shy away from the limelight now however a few of the largest canadian funds are acting more like private equity or infrastructure investors they are scoping out deals sending in teams to scour the paperwork looking for possible trouble spots and then investing directly in a company or project such moves havent gone unnoticed in the u s in the infrastructure arena the canadian pension funds are "ahead of us and were learning from them " says russell read chief investment officer of california public employees retirement system or calpers the latest target of the large canadian funds demonstrates their growing ambition together with u s buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co two canadian pension funds the canada pension plan investment board and caisse de depot &amp placement du quebec are in talks to take over telecom operator bce inc the company has a market value of about &# billion so taking it private would represent the biggest buyout in canadian history now a battle is brewing among the canadian pension funds themselves the ontario teachers pension plan the most active of the big canadian funds officially became a rival bidder for bce on tuesday it currently holds a stake in the company "the name of the game is about value for shareholders and we are the largest shareholder " said jim leech head of the private equity and infrastructure division at ontario teachers back in the early phases of the talks "in that context we are examining all of our options " in may ontario teachers announced that it was making its first infrastructure investments in latin america by acquiring majority stakes in two chilean water distribution companies that together represent of the market until recently canadian pension funds werent even free to invest their portfolios globally thanks to a rule that required them to keep or more of their assets in canada as recently as the s several of the largest plans still stuck to investing only in bonds and stock index funds that all began to change as they sought ways to address looming shortfalls based on their obligations to future retirees to increase long term returns they turned to investments such as private equity and infrastructure these funds need to "create value and its very hard to do that as a passive investor " says janet rabovsky head of the investment consulting practice at watson wyatt in toronto some u s pension plans have reached a similar conclusion but the large canadian plans have elevated the process to a different level rather than simply giving money to a private equity fund such as kkr to manage for them and paying high money management fees in the process they decided they could do as good a job by themselves so they began taking direct stakes in deals often alongside buyout specialists "we now have the capacity to do deals on our own " says henri paul rousseau chief executive of caisse de depot which has &# billion in assets last year caisse de depots private equity investments returned american pension funds also invest in private equity but in a more indirect and limited way as of the end of february calpers the countrys largest pension fund had invested &# billion of its roughly &# billion portfolio in private equity nearly all of it in limited partnerships managed by others by contrast ontario teachers has put about &# billion of its &# billion in private equity and infrastructure the majority of those investments are direct said mr leech and only about &# billion is in canada the pension fund owns stakes in hockeys toronto maple leafs samsonite corp the maker of serta mattresses and cable operators in spain and germany recently mr leech sent a team to new zealand for three months to conduct fact finding or "due diligence " on a potential deal the end result a &# billion transaction where ontario teachers took a stake in the new zealand yellow pages the remaining is owned by ccmp asia a hong kong private equity firm another area where canadian pension funds have charged ahead is infrastructure such projects are particularly attractive to pension funds because they generate steady long term cash flows and can raise their rates to keep pace with inflation late last year ontario teachers reached an agreement to buy four container terminals in canada and the u s from orient overseas international ltd for &# billion the canadian pension funds say they are just getting started when it comes to private equity deals "we would have an appetite for those kinds of investments and expect to do more of them " says ian dale a senior vice president at the canada pension plan investment board
