tribes invoke gods to block wastewater snowmaking faced with one of its worst ski seasons in years amid an ongoing drought operators of the arizona snowbowl pitched a plan five years ago to make man made snow by using treated wastewater from the nearby city of flagstaff "in todays world it is impossible to run a ski area depending on natural snowfall " says eric borowsky general partner of the snowbowl resort but in march a three judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals killed the scheme the reason the mountaintops are sacred to the navajo and other tribes even though the land is not part of their reservations the tribes regard the mountains as living deities that would be offended by man made snowmaking especially if it used treated wastewater that the tribes contend would contaminate plants and spring water used in religious ceremonies the court compared spraying snow made from treated wastewater on the peaks to requiring christians to use reclaimed water for baptisms that ruling has given new hope to similar challenges from indian tribes across the west at issue is the interpretation of the religious freedom restoration act or rfra which congress passed in with almost unanimous support after the supreme court upheld a government decision to deny unemployment benefits to two native americans fired for using illegal drugs in a religious ceremony in the past courts denied that the first amendments religious freedom protections extend to american indians who challenge federal land use decisions rfra changed that by requiring the government to demonstrate a compelling interest when considering any action that would substantially burden a religious practice the snowbowl case is the first to successfully apply the law to a sacred site says howard shanker the flagstaff attorney who represented several of the tribes before the court the u s forest service which leases the land to snowbowl signed off on the plan despite its recognition that the san francisco peaks are sacred to the hopi and navajo who lost similar legal challenges when the resort expanded in "tribes have been saying since the foreigners first arrived that they hold their land sacred this is not a new argument " says george hardeen a navajo spokesman "now we have this new yardstick " but developers worry that will limit the doctrine that allows for multiple uses of federal land especially in the west where tensions between development and conservation mount as the population expands "every federal project is now going to be held hostage to any native american saying boy that area is significant to me " says mr borowsky the defendants last week filed a petition for the full ninth circuit to rehear the case since the march ruling the quechan tribe in yuma ariz has sued to stop a public land swap for a new oil refinery the first to be constructed in the u s in more than years the tribe says the land is culturally significant the ruling could also boost the snoqualmie tribes long standing bid to block the permit renewal for puget sound energys year old hydroelectric power plant at the snoqualmie falls the tribes most sacred site vincent e randall a cultural preservation officer for the yavapai apache a plaintiff in the snowbowl case rejects the idea that "were going to run out and claim every mountain to be holy " he says that the case has been complicated by the difficulty in translating the tribes beliefs for a western audience "this is our way of life and if we dont do it right we have consequences from our almighty " while most u s ski resorts make snow snowbowl would have been the first to do so only with reclaimed water which is used across the parched southwest on golf courses and parks under state law the resort would have had to post signs warning skiers not to eat any snow snowbowl one of arizonas two most popular ski areas stayed open for days this year down from an average of using treated wastewater would allow the resort to stay open from thanksgiving until mid april says mr borowsky at acres the footprint of the resort takes up less than of the peaks the case has riled flagstaff a northern arizona city of and the largest economic center for several indian reservations while running for re election flagstaff mayor joseph donaldson left a candidate forum where he had spoken in support of the snowbowl plan and found a urine filled toilet atop his car which was covered in toilet paper printed on the commode "how would you like it joe " flagstaffs business community which relies heavily on tourism has rallied around the resort local businesses have posted "support snowmaking" signs in storefronts "this is not really about reclaimed water " says joe galli of the citys chamber of commerce "this is about whether they want snowbowl to exist at all whether they want recreation to exist at all" on the mountain others suggest a double standard as some of the tribes that seek to curb snowbowl develop their own lands snowbowls chief competitor sunrise park resort located three hours from flagstaff uses artificial snow and is operated by the white mountain apache a plaintiff in the case the tribe called on the government to remove the entire snowbowl resort and says snowmaking there would impair the tribes ability to perform religious ceremonies in court sunrises operators testified that their resort isnt on sacred ground and that its artificial snow comes from a lake downstream from a creek bed where treated wastewater from two lodges is discharged a spokesman for the tribe says it only uses spring water to make snow another plaintiff the hualapai tribe recently opened grand canyon west a acre tourist development that includes the skywalk a u shaped glass structure that juts out over the canyon rim it has drawn criticism from some hualapai sheri yellowhawk chief executive of grand canyon resort corp the tribal outfit that runs the attraction rejects comparisons to snowbowl and says tourism will provide much needed economic growth she says that some tribal elders had said "yes it is sacred but we need to do something for the future " to mr borowsky "its the height of hypocrisy " gordon watkins who runs a bed and breakfast in flagstaff is even blunter "the indians have desecrated their lands for economic purposes for decades " those attitudes have sparked fears of a backlash "theres been a lot of silly stuff being thrown out there and some of it is borderline racist " says mr shanker who touts his legal win as part of his campaign for congress as a democrat "some people have the perception that these tribes all have gaming and that theyre all wealthy they have no or little economic activity " and tribal leaders say development on reservations is dwarfed by government development of public lands "its just a hollow argument " says the navajos mr hardeen "go to the south rim of the grand canyon on the fourth of july its like coney island "
