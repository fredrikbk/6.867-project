weekend journal tastings viogniers popularity problem winemakers love it buyers arent so sure a debate about age at malones wines &amp liquors his wine store in the kew gardens section of queens n y chi christopher luu stocks a wine called viognier and really likes it but he says not a single customer not one has ever walked into his store and asked for a viognier across the country in santa barbara county calif gary newman co president of th century fox television and therefore a man who should understand popular tastes started a winery called jorian hill a couple of years ago and immediately produced a viognier "i found after loving chardonnay for a long time that they were a little overpowering " mr newman told us "i found viognier such a fantastic alternative in terms of its varietal characteristics " if anything ever summed up one of the wine worlds more interesting disconnects at the moment there you have it viognier is an unusual grape from the rhone valley of france that has grown in popularity among american winemakers in the past decade as part of a general interest in rhone varietals and a specific interest in alternatives to chardonnay at its best viognier can have the cleanliness of riesling the juiciness of sauvignon blanc and the orange blossom charm of muscat it tends to taste of peaches apricots and mango and sometimes has a bit of weight back in when we first wrote a column about viognier we thought it might be the next big thing and americas vintners agreed the amount of viognier crushed in california soared almost fold between and look closely and youll find viognier from all sorts of wineries from penner ash in oregon to stags leap and beaulieu in california to virginias horton vineyards which even makes a sparkling viognier but mr luus experience is telling consumers havent really warmed to viognier mr luu says that when he can get people to try it he especially recommends cline cellars customers like it but so few people look for the wine that it remains a hard sell indeed one of the pioneers of viognier joseph phelps now makes very little of it phelps viognier has been one of our favorites over the years and we were surprised that we didnt see it this time so we called the winery damian parker the vice president of production told us that the winery cut its viognier acreage as it reorganized its holdings so now it makes just a few hundred cases a year he also conceded that viognier was never an easy sell now its only sold at the winery and through the wine club some wineries and wine store owners think that maybe the pronunciation is the issue some wines even have a pronunciation guide on the label cline suggests "vee oh nyay " clay station suggests "vee oh nyay " and sobon estate suggests "vee ohn yea " all of which seem a ok with us in any event its an interesting situation and one that certainly demanded a broad blind tasting to check out the current state of viognier we bought more than from retail stores in four states and tasted them over several nights one of the problems with american viognier is that there is no benchmark some are oaky and some are made entirely with stainless steel some have a charming lightness about them while others are so heavy they can taste like the syrup in a can of fruit cocktail which is not a good thing in a wine there are even some terrific late harvest viogniers we had one recently from the ojai vineyard roll ranch &# for a half bottle that was absolutely luscious and worth every penny viognier in any style does tend to reflect somebodys vision the wines are generally made in such small quantities that they get extraordinary personal attention as a result overall we enjoyed the wines though we often found them more interesting than tasty our best value was the same wine mr luu recommends cline cellars mr newmans jorian hill was outstanding his wife and partner jeanne newman herself a prominent entertainment lawyer says they made cases that were distributed in california and new york but they plan to expand soon into las vegas texas and florida the viognier was already planted when they bought the property she told us but they quickly became fans "i could barely pour it for people i was so anxious for them to like it " she said our best of tasting truly showed what viognier can be with just the right grapes picked at just the right time it was called incognito from michael david winery and it was a beauty with pure focused tastes co owner david phillips told us that the winery made cases of the wine its ninth vintage of viognier which it distributed nationwide the wine includes two other rhone varietals roussanne and marsanne "none of it sees any oak and we let the grapes get really ripe " he told us "we do a whole cluster press and it goes through a slow cold fermentation that helps retain that fruit that makes it shine keeping it floral " interestingly both of our top favorites and our best value received no oak in fact when we called cline cellars to confirm this charlie tsegeletos the director of winemaking told us "not so much as a toothpick of oak " by the way some of our longtime favorites including alban calera r h phillips and zaca mesa were not among our best in this tasting but they were good and still worth a try if those are the ones you see since each winery has been making good viognier for some time now there is some debate about the best age for viognier these days most people who are passionate about american viognier seem to prefer it young when its especially fresh and floral and we tend to agree during our tasting we happened to see a failla jordan viognier from on a wine list at a restaurant with a terrific cellar wed tasted the in late and loved it we described it as "exotic with tastes of vanilla pineapple mango and passion fruit nice earth elegant and big like white velvet " the was clearly aged with almost sherry like tastes a crisp clean finish and a terrific underpinning of earth dottie felt it was a wine of stature and said it reminded her of an old condrieu thats the classic viognier wine from france john liked it better younger when it was livelier and smoother dottie was having hers with grilled pork chops with peaches which might have made a big difference since it was a beautiful pairing so what is the future of viognier mr newman is upbeat he sees its popularity increasing "i really do i see it happening ever since we got into the business we peruse wine lists everywhere and were seeing it on lists " he told us mr phillips is optimistic too "its happening for us " he says the winery started with just cases of it "we really havent had any trouble selling it " he says "there is definitely a place for it chefs are really behind it waitstaff has to be trained to introduce it " personally having been wrong before were not so sure we think mr luus experience is pretty powerful so heres our advice while there are still plenty of viogniers out there many of them produced with real passion by vintners who believe in the grape try one its not quite like anything else and thats fun you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones viognier index in a broad blind tasting of american viognier these were our favorites youth is usually a virtue for viognier these pair well with fried oysters and other
