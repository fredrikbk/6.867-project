weekend journal the wealth report from wall street to walker evans ditching careers some turn a longtime passion into a profitable new life after launching a successful natural gas and electricity brokerage firm on wall street in the s bruce silverstein was making a seven figure income by his mid s but while he enjoyed building the business the trading world left him miserable "i couldnt convert any of the money into happiness " he says though not yet financially secure enough to retire mr silverstein amassed enough of a cushion to take a risk with a business that tapped into his real passion in life photography he quit trading and in april opened a small gallery in a square foot studio on the first floor of a townhouse on west nd street in new york today silverstein photography is in a space times that size a few blocks away on the hottest block in the sizzling chelsea art district selling works from iconographic photographers like the late hungarian born andre kertesz alongside edgy emerging artists ditching the corporate life to pursue a personal passion is a dream for many executives and entrepreneurs whether they make a windfall on wall street take a golden parachute or sell their start up and if that passion can translate into more financial success all the better of all the passions to cash in on the art market seems a potent place to make a second fortune these days a flood of new collectors and a weak u s dollar have driven prices to new highs photography prices though not in the same stratosphere as paintings are setting records especially for the vintage prints in which mr silverstein specializes some fine art photographs that sold for a few thousand dollars in the s can now fetch &# million or more but as mr silverstein and others who have jumped into the art business can attest it takes deep pockets patience and plenty of determination to break into the famously clubby art world and higher prices are translating into more competitive scrambles for salable works finding and nurturing new artists whose work can sell at prices high enough to justify mounting their shows is tough and outside major cities luring buyers is a challenge just ask ben gall who left a career heading smaller high technology companies and at age started holland art house in in west chester pa a historic city miles southwest of philadelphia born in the netherlands he wanted to sell works of the contemporary dutch artists he collected including abstract landscape painter luc leestemaker but it was a tough slog in a competitive market where galleries that started in recent years have been whittled to three mr gall closed his gallery in and is now trying his luck with a venue called the arts scene which he opened a few miles out of town it includes lower priced emerging artists a frame shop a cafe and musical events says mr gall "if you want to do something for artists and promote more progressive art outside big cities dont ever expect to make money or do more than break even " laura grenning a former wall street analyst has had better luck with the gallery she opened a decade ago at age in sag harbor n y close to the fashionable hamptons she specializes in contemporary artists including paul rafferty walter us and nelson h white who paint in a classic style with prices ranging from &# to &# she lost money the first three years and has had good and bad years since but she is now able to contemplate buying a larger building and diversifying into sculpture "the last two years have been great " she says allowing her to work on her won paintings some of which she has sold mr silverstein who turns monday had an early influence his father larry silver was a commercial photographer whose award winning artistic and documentary works appear in museums mr silverstein started collecting in when he began earning money from brokering natural gas contracts spending his spare time exploring the history of photography his timing was perfect vintage prints by famous photographers such as walker evans who documented the depression and harry callahans intimate portraits and streetscapes could be had for as little as &# he couldnt afford a big inventory at first so he started his gallery with works on consignment from other dealers including the lesser known early works of aaron siskind a documentary photographer who made the transition to abstract expressionism and he struck a deal to represent the estate of mr kertesz whose still lifes portraits and street scenes of budapest paris and new york from about until his death in are in leading museums he was the sole employee designing his web site doing framing sending out invitations hanging his own shows and mopping the floors "i worked as hard as i could and immediately saw the benefits and mistakes " he says "it was great " he now has four other employees mr silverstein also made some astute purchases paying &# at auction for a work by eccentric boston photographer f holland day in which he depicts himself as the dying christ in seven portraits though he was a bit nervous no one was bidding against him he got his validation when the whitney museum of american art borrowed the series as the centerpiece of a show last march titled "photography and the self the legacy of f holland day " though mr silverstein wont estimate what he thinks he could sell the picture for now he smiles and says "it could be worth considerably more " collectors who buy regularly from mr silverstein say the business skills he honed on wall street have served him well gary sokol an avid san francisco collector who sold his investment firm to a german bank met mr silverstein when both were haunting photography auctions mr silverstein worked the relationship sending him champagne and chocolates and studying his interests "bruce does know his clients and he really goes out and finds things for you " mr sokol says "the art market approaches a new buyer as just another sales prospect rather than someone they can cultivate as a long term collector which is what bruce does " mr silverstein says he hasnt made a fortune yet but he is making a living and looks forward to opening the gallery doors every morning he recently had a successful show of his fathers works and currently is mounting an exhibit by a new photographer zoe strauss whose depictions of downtrodden city dwellers and remnants of urban decay offer an interesting contrast to the vintage kertesz prints in the back room "theres still so much for me to learn " he says "but im so happy i took the leap "
