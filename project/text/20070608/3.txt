bush greens just call him george w bush star international diplomat dont snicker dont spit out your coffee instead read over the final document on climate change released yesterday by the group of eight yes its a major shift in how the world will address the supposed threat of global warming its also largely the vision put forth years ago by none other than george w bush that international cowboy even if few european politicians will admit it dont expect anyone to admit it when mr bush unveiled his new climate framework last week calling on the worlds powers to reduce greenhouse emissions it was portrayed as a capitulation hed removed the last "obstacle" to world unity on this issue and seen the error of his ways at this weeks democratic presidential debate every candidate vowed to fix the damage mr bush had done to americas international reputation his kyoto failure the obvious example theres been a capitulation on global warming but it hasnt happened in the oval office the kyoto cheerleaders at the united nations and the european union are realizing their government run experiment in climate control is a mess one thats incidentally failed to reduce carbon emissions theyve also understood that if they want the biggest players on board the u s china india they need an approach that balances economic growth with feel good environmentalism yesterdays g agreement acknowledged those realities and tolled kyotos death knell mr bush sanctimonious greens not that the presidents handling of the climate issue has been stellar the science of global warming is still unsettled yet mr bush in caved and laid out a voluntary emissions reduction program instead of getting credit hes spent the ensuing years getting shellacked for not doing more this has laid the groundwork for todays calls for mandatory curbs that would harm the economy its also given washington an excuse to re micromanage the energy sector think ethanol but compared to kyoto mr bushs vision has been sublime the basic kyoto philosophy is this set ever lower mandatory targets ratcheting down energy use and by extension economic growth the program was viewed by environmentalists and politicians as a convenient excuse for getting rid of unpopular fossil fuels such as coal in kyoto world governments exist to create draconian rules even if those dictates are disguised by "market" mechanisms such as cap and trade president bushs approach is opposite allow economies to grow along the way inspiring new technologies and new forms of energy that lower c emissions implicit is that c control technologies should focus on energy sources we use today including fossil fuels in bush world the government is there to incentivize industry coordinate with it and set broad goals take your pick under the vaunted kyoto from to europe managed to increase its emissions by percentage points over to only two countries are on track to meet targets theres rampant cheating and endless stories of how select players are self enriching off the government "market" in c credits meanwhile in the u s under the presidents oh so unserious plan u s emissions from to were eight percentage points lower than in the prior period europeans may be slow but they arent silly and theyve quietly come around to some of mr bushs views tony blair has been a leader here and give him credit for caring enough about his signature issue to evolve he began picking up mr bushs pro tech themes years ago as it became clear just how much damage a kyoto would do to his countrys competitiveness by the end of he admitted at a conference in new york that kyoto was a problem "i would say probably im changing my thinking about this in the past two or three years " he said "the truth is no country is going to cut its growth or consumption substantially in the light of a long term environmental problem " he doubted there would be successor to kyoto which expires in and said an alternative might be "incentives" for businesses mr bush couldnt have said it better or consider nuclear plants president bush has pushed hard for more nuclear with its bountiful energy at zero c cost this was long anathema to british and german politicians whose populations are virulently anti nuke and who balked at any official recognition of nuclear benefits as kyoto has ratcheted down other energy sources nuclear has looked better by the g document out of gleneagles contained an explicit acknowledgment that nuclear energy mattered the eus energy pact signed earlier this year also contained a nod to nuclear europe has also gone from trying to banish coal to using tech to make it cleaner then theres mr bushs insistence that any "global" program must include big emitters such as china and india kyoto doesnt though it received little press the u s in started the asia pacific partnership a voluntary climate pact between it and australia japan south korea china and india unlike kyoto in which a government sets a national target for emissions and then forces a few unlucky industries to make cuts the partnership gets industry execs from every sector across the table from relevant government ministers and devises practical approaches to reductions this parallel diplomatic approach has proved far more acceptable to countries like china and played a role in that countrys own recently released climate plan pride is pride and the europeans havent entirely given up on kyoto principles german chancellor angela merkel who has spearheaded these climate talks went into this g meeting in heiligendamm advocating binding reductions yet she admitted earlier this week that her plan was off the table as the u s held firm yesterdays declaration far from mandatory targets instead sets a "global goal" of halving emissions by it invites the "major emerging economies" to join in this endeavor it acknowledges that different approaches across the world can "coordinate rather than compete " it reports that "technology is a key to mastering climate change" and lauds government "incentives " it admits that "over the next years fossil fuels will remain the worlds dominant source of energy " and talks up the "peaceful use of nuclear energy " it even explains that any program "must be undertaken in a way that supports growth in developing emerging and industrialized economies " close your eyes and you might think this was president bush in the rose garden will congressional democrats prove as pragmatic even as europeans have wised up the left has been pushing for a kyoto here should democrats start to stumble on the difficulties they could always ask mr bush that new international climate ambassador for some advice
