the evening wrap no selloff sequel online edition from "spider man " to the latest "pirates of the caribbean" to "hostel ii " its clear that summer is sequel season but after a stock and bond selloff terrified audiences yesterday todays trading offered up no bloody second acts bonds fared better today than they did a day earlier though that may have been attributable to the fact that following the thrashing treasurys were subjected to yesterday the market simply had no teeth left to be knocked out the key yield on the year treasury note ended the session at as prices were mostly flat analysts said mortgage investors who ran off screaming yesterday climbed back in today earlier in the day the year yield climbed as high as territory it hadnt seen in a year and comparable foreign bonds took a beating some analysts expected the selloff to continue to feed on itself for a while and help drive yields even higher but at least for today the sight of yields holding relatively stable helped to

forced to raise borrowing costs and that investors fear could lead to all sorts of scary consequences the easy financing that has helped drive the private equity buyout binge could become much more scarce and private investors who snapped up any asset that wasnt nailed down in recent years could have a very hard time unloading their holdings back into a bleak equities market higher mortgage

securities wrote that the new data reflects weaker spending and that if that became a sustained trend slower growth here "would be transmitted to the rest of the world " he said that "the second decline in capital goods exports in the last three months suggests a slowdown in global capital spending may be developing " but others think the economy will gather itself stephen stanley of rbs greenwich capital thinks spending will pick up and housing will be less of a drag in the second half and here investors rattled by higher rates may wish to avert their eyes mr stanley thinks such a rebound "will in our view force the fed to hike rates by late or early " new chief for the joint chiefs defense secretary robert gates announced this afternoon that after consulting with lawmakers
