politics &amp economics putins radar offer may soothe tensions heiligendamm germany in a theatrical swing from cold war style threats to an offer of unprecedented military cooperation russian president vladimir putin proposed that the u s use radar in azerbaijan in its planned missile shield rather than build a facility in the czech republic meeting president bush one on one at the annual summit of the group of eight leading nations mr putin said he would withdraw threats he made last week to retarget russian missiles at europe if the u s would accept his offer and demonstrate that the europe based missile defense system wouldnt be directed at russia the more statesmanlike tone appeared to have immediate effect it may have been a factor in drawing support for a russian priority under discussion yesterday evening to delay a vote in the united nations security council on a u s backed plan to offer independence for kosovo the serbian province under u n control since russia opposes kosovo independence u s officials welcomed mr putins surprise radar offer but it puts them in a potentially awkward position according to u s officials mr putin made it clear that the radar station in azerbaijan should replace the one washington is negotiating to build in the czech republic that would leave u s missile defense reliant on russian owned aging equipment the u s says it needs the system which as currently planned would locate interceptors in poland and a radar station in the czech republic to knock down any attack on europe or the u s by iran or other rogue states russia has protested that the system poses a threat to its own nuclear deterrence european leaders have pressured the u s to find ways to assuage those concerns mr putins offer comes after months in which he has fiercely criticized u s foreign policy he has threatened to pull out of arms treaties veto the independence plan for kosovo and retarget russian missiles on europe that backdrop made it unclear whether mr putin was looking for a way to compromise over the missile shield or to gain support to block it u s officials said mr putins offer showed a willingness to cool heated rhetoric and to engage with u s suggestions that russia could take part in u s missile defense plans mr bush termed the idea "interesting " adding "its much better to work together than it is to create tensions " the two leaders body language after their meeting was friendly with mr putin playfully jostling mr bush at one point during an eight minute joint appearance mr bushs national security adviser stephen hadley described the russian offer as "a walking back from the threat that putin suggested in his interviews at the end of last week " however mr putins latest proposal presents washington with a challenge the russian leader made it clear to mr bush that the azerbaijani radar should replace the facility the u s is negotiating to build south of prague according to u s officials russian officials fear the czech radar could be used to monitor russian air space mr hadley hinted the u s could agree if the azerbaijani station supplements rather than replaces the czech republic one the leaders pledged negotiations among their top military and diplomatic officials as well as direct talks on the issue when mr putin visits the bush family home in kennebunkport maine in early july the proposal to share the radar in azerbaijan which russia leases from the ex soviet republic follows u s offers for moscow to take part in the missile defense program however russian officials werent interested in initial u s proposals which they said gave them no control "ballistic missile defense cannot be coordinated you cannot have a dual key " due to the hair trigger responses required said sergei rogov director of the institute of usa and canada studies in moscow and a leading russian arms control expert mr rogov said russian experts were exploring ways of developing a sectoral or layered system in which the u s would control some elements and russia others offering the azerbaijani radar system would appear to fit that model u s secretary of state condoleezza rice has dismissed as "ridiculous" russian concerns that the interceptors planned for stationing in poland and czech radar are a threat to moscows nuclear deterrence which consists of thousands of ballistic missiles mr rogov said russia isnt worried by the u s plans or technology as they are but by what they might amount to in years he noted the high level of u s spending on missile defense technology aimed at building much faster systems that would be capable of intercepting russian missiles as they launch "we dont have enough money" to compete with such research mr rogov said marc champion contributed to this article
