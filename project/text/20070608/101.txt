weekend journal review theater the lady vanishes crazy mary playwrights horizons w nd st new york &# closes june rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead studio theatre th st nw washington &# &# extended through july new york comparisons between playwrights and novelists are almost always misleading but id say its more or less accurate to think of a r gurney as the john p marquand of american drama like marquand mr gurney writes about wasps and their discontents and his ruefully funny studies of a ruling class in decline are too often dismissed as trivial by critics who take no interest in the inner lives of the insufficiently underprivileged also like marquand he is prolific to a fault and his work is as unevenly inspired as it is unfailingly professional ive reviewed several of his plays in this space always with pleasure i like his best work very much but rarely with outright enthusiasm thus im glad to report that "crazy mary " mr gurneys new portrait of life among the white bread set is a highly impressive piece of work a serious comedy that succeeds in wringing honest laughs out of an awkward subject the mary in question is a middle aged manic depressive kristine nielsen who has spent the past three decades stashed away in a high priced boston sanitarium to which her late father consigned her after she made the fatal mistake of sleeping with the gardener in addition to being crazy mary is loaded she inherited all her fathers money and when lydia sigourney weaver marys second cousin once removed becomes her legal guardian after a death in the family well you figure it out if you can every twist in the plot of "crazy mary" took me by surprise and none of them disappointed me in the slightest what impressed me most about "crazy mary" is that mr gurney walks with unerring skill along the knife edge that separates comedy from pathos in truth theres nothing remotely funny about marys situation much less her condition and we laugh at her plight precisely because it is so pitiful nor does mr gurney let any of his characters off the hook least of all lydia who has spent her own life walking on tiptoe through a world of tight lipped propriety in which the most important things are left unsaid "this is the way our family has always dealt with uncomfortable issues we toss money at it if we have any then we turn our backs and walk away wasnt there didnt happen period end of story " mr gurney has soft pedaled marys illness more than a little bit i cant imagine a real life mental patient recovering quite so suddenly or completely after so many years but ms nielsen plays her so well that you buy her just as is and michael esper is equally fine as skip lydias rebellious son im sorry to say though that ms weaver is no good at all her flat overemphatic acting comes close to sinking the play its a tribute to the quality of mr gurneys script that it manages to survive so unsatisfactory a performance washington im spending the first part of the summer checking out regional productions of the plays of tom stoppard whose "the coast of utopia" took new york by storm this past season my most recent trip was to the studio theatre which is putting on "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" as its contribution to "shakespeare in washington " the city wide season long celebration of the bard currently under way in the nations capital ive been hearing good things about the studio theatre for the past couple of years and this revival confirmed them all its the best "rosencrantz and guildenstern" ive ever seen on stage "r &amp g" as mr stoppards play is known to aficionados takes two minor characters from "hamlet " places them at center stage and invites the audience to envision what they might have been up to while the melancholy dane was busy figuring out who killed his father as always mr stoppards witty dialogue streaks through the air like skyrockets in flight but he never allows you to forget that his two hapless clowns both wonderfully well played by raymond bokhour and liam craig are hurtling toward the same dark encounter that awaits us all "the bad end unhappily the good unluckily that is what tragedy means " kirk jackson and daniel conway the director and designer have given us a production that looks like a magritte painting come to life the first thing you see is a pair of bowler hatted vaudevillians poking their heads out of a pair of trap doors and plays like a speeded up version of "waiting for godot " i liked everything about it and everyone in it i also liked what mr jackson says about the play in the program notes "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" allows us to contemplate death reminds people of their mortality while simultaneously evoking the most valuable experience in life laughter " so it does and so does this wholly admirable staging mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
