immigration bill might be dead after failing pivotal senate test barring white house push political climate may halt overhaul effort for now washington landmark immigration legislation stumbled badly in the senate as majority leader harry reid pulled the bill from the floor after twice failing to get the votes needed to cut off debate the nevada democrat said he still hoped the measure could be called back up at a later date but no timetable was given for doing that given the hostile political atmosphere in the house and opposition from conservatives the defeat could prove fatal absent a major commitment by president bush to salvage the initiative the setback followed a roller coaster day in which the leadership had worked with the white house and homeland security secretary michael chertoff to overcome attacks from the left and right with amendments that could unravel the compromise package after a late night phone conversation with mr chertoff wednesday mr reid renewed his efforts to negotiate a settlement to end debate "we need to complete this marathon " mr reid said and outwardly mr chertoff was still upbeat arriving in the capitol last evening "i am still optimistic we will get a bill " the secretary said "im not sure when " republicans wanted to offer more amendments and said they wouldnt be rushed into closing debate on a large complicated issue they said they had offered mr reid a deal that could have avoided the defeat if the democratic leader had allowed more time minority leader trent lott r miss while clearly sympathetic with efforts to end debate warned that mr reid had pressed too hard for what became a "dumb vote " only seven republicans ultimately supported cloture while all but democrats supported the motion on the roll call "the headlines are going to be president fails again " mr reid warned yet like the president the nevada democrat faces pressure to show progress on immigration and walking away after two weeks of difficult votes wont be easy for either party the diversity on both sides was striking democrats voting against ending debate ran from california liberal sen barbara boxer to sen jim webb a populist moderate from virginia republicans who supported cloture included sen john mccain the arizona conservative as well as sen arlen specter a pennsylvania moderate "no bill at all is not a solution " said sen edward kennedy d mass "you can see the finish line from where we are at " said sen lindsey graham r s c as drafted the measure promises to legalize millions of undocumented workers in the u s while tightening border security and beefing up enforcement steps that werent taken after the last big immigration bill in borders would be secured over the next two years and employers subjected to much tougher worker verification rules and a business backed program allowing foreign guest workers into the country every year is considered vital since it would reduce the workload on border agents who can then pursue smugglers and potential terrorists mr chertoff played a lead role in the talks that shaped the senate bill and with president bush in europe this week he has come to the fore his background as a prosecutor and federal judge has been helpful and he plays the compassionate cop promising law and order to conservatives but also a dose of hope for immigrants "i understand there is an elegance to the proposition that when you break the law you should not benefit from it " the secretary said "but i also recognize in real life there are degrees to breaking the law its important to solve the problem as opposed to holding out for a purity of resolution that doesnt exist in the real world " in forcing the cloture votes mr reid appeared intent on getting the senate to focus on the measure at hand but also put pressure on mr bush to become more involved in an issue he has staked as one of his top legislative priorities this year "i want to finish this bill but i cant do it alone we did more than our share here tonight on the cloture vote but we need some support and i hope the president understands that theres only about months until there is an election and a new president " said mr reid "it will come back when the president calls harry reid and says we can get some more votes for you " said sen charles schumer d n y on wednesday night there were telltale switches among conservatives who joined labor democrats on a vote to end the guest worker program after five years in hopes of weakening the larger bill "ive been trying to kill the bill since the beginning" said sen jim bunning r ky amid the rancor high tech companies remain hopeful that they would see some improvements in provisions surrounding the h b visas they use to bring skilled immigrant workers to the u s this optimism followed what was described as a positive meeting wednesday afternoon between microsoft chief executive steve ballmer and sen jon kyl the arizonan shepherding the bill on the republican side companies have said a new merit based point system in the bill wrests away their control over retaining specific foreign workers and that the bill wouldnt allow enough high skilled workers to become permanent residents
