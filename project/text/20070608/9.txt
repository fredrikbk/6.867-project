brazils bull draws fans market wins over skeptics with newfound stability economist robert shiller explained the stock market slide before it happened he also gave an early warning about a retreat in u s home prices but there is one hot market he still likes brazil this year has seen mixed performances in the stock markets of several emerging giants china looks increasingly like a speculators game indias returns have been lukewarm and russias benchmark index has lost ground meantime sao paulos bovespa index has climbed this year and gained since brazilian markets were closed yesterday for the corpus christi holiday brazils economy has long been one of booms and busts but the country recently has made big strides to distance itself from its past the government has reduced its foreign debt and built up dollar reserves exports have surged brazil has tamed inflation and unlike many nations is cutting interest rates on wednesday the central bank lowered interest rates by half a percentage point to the th rate reduction in the past months brazilian stocks are doing so well that mr shiller a yale university economist whose book "irrational exuberance" laid out a theory of how speculative market bubbles happen recently took a closer look his conclusion the enthusiasm seems to be merited "things are really looking good inflation is stable the currency is strong" and there is wide popular support for the government says mr shiller who loaded up on stocks here a few years ago "people see this as a stable place to invest " like other emerging markets brazil has benefited from a global economic environment that has encouraged investors to roam widely in search of returns any sign that u s or european investors might lose their appetites for riskier investments abroad would hurt brazilian stocks still many investors remain optimistic that brazils economy is on the right course global investment banks such as citigroup merrill lynch and ubs are recommending that investors be "overweight" in brazilian shares in other words that they invest more money in the countrys stocks than the amount suggested by the emerging market benchmark index "bringing inflation and the budget under control has always been a problem for brazil " says mark gordon james a portfolio manager at aberdeen asset management which has &# billion invested in emerging markets mr gordon james says his firm is investing in smaller brazilian companies like localiza a car rental company lately there is another benefit for foreign investors the strengthening of the brazilian real since the start of the year the real has gained against the dollar that increase boosts returns for foreign investors because every brazilian real earned can then buy more dollars it is also good news for some brazilian companies such as airlines gol and tam because their main cost fuel is denominated in dollars making it cheaper for them in local currency terms foreigners are also keen on brazilian bonds "its one of our largest holdings " says michael gomez co head of emerging markets at bond giant pacific investment management co last month standard &amp poors elevated brazils foreign currency bonds to one step away from investment grade a benchmark mr gomez says he expects brazil to reach in the next year many in brazil are convinced things have changed this time for good in may brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said the economy was living a "magic moment " the international monetary fund expects the brazilian economy to grow this year and in strong by latin american standards though not near rivaling asian giants of course skeptics say brazil has seen good economic times before only to enter a crisis and precisely such "new era" thinking the belief that market fundamentals have somehow changed and that the old rules dont apply nearly always accompanies a market bubble according to mr shiller the yale economist does worry that investors in brazil may not be prepared for a slowdown in corporate earnings according to his analysis brazilian stock prices have enthusiastically tracked record earnings by contrast in the u s stock prices havent kept pace something the economist credits to investors fresh memory of the internet stock bubble "when you see rapid earnings growth you should be skeptical " says mr shiller also co founder of boutique investment bank macromarkets llc "and brazil is not skeptical at this moment " rapid economic growth in china has been driving demand for key brazilian exports such as iron ore alternative fuel and soybeans which have in turn swelled corporate profits "the external situation particularly in asia is important to brazil " says thierry weizman an emerging markets analyst at bear stearns some investors are already betting on a retreat for commodities former brazilian central bank director ilan goldfajn says ciano investimentos a rio de janeiro based hedge fund he opened in december with &# million in assets is buying bank stocks and local retailers but betting the bovespa index will fall its "a way to bet against commodities " he says because companies that sell oil minerals or other exports account for a hefty chunk of brazils stock market if brazils shares do begin a retreat the countrys newfound global popularity could add to the problem roughly to of stocks are owned by foreigners estimates geoffrey dennis an analyst at citigroup not all of them specialize in emerging markets he says so "once things start to go wrong we have a lot of people who might get out fast " locally though the markets strong run is starting to draw more individual investors although individuals own less than of shares traded on brazils market the influx of novices is a signal to some investors it may soon be time to sell jairo silva a broker at the sao paulo exchange says his maid recently asked him how to buy stock "i told her it wasnt a good time to buy " he says
