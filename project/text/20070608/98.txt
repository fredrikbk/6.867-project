weekend journal review books getting to know her a woman in charge by carl bernstein knopf pages &# her way by jeff gerth and don van natta jr little brown pages &# after all these years its hard to believe that there is much new to learn about sen hillary rodham clinton this is a woman who has been under intense scrutiny for a long time from the press from her political enemies and from prosecutors with subpoena power now however come two books promising fresh information and insight "her way the hopes and ambitions of hillary rodham clinton " by the new york times duo of jeff gerth and don van natta and "a woman in charge " by the watergate veteran carl bernstein and darned if there isnt a lot we didnt know about hillary clinton alas much of it is unflattering inconveniently so for the democratic presidential frontrunner for example most of us did not know that during her husbands run for president in mrs clinton headed something called the defense team basically a black ops version of the campaigns war room defense teamers under mrs clintons direction dealt even more aggressively than their war room colleagues with bimbo eruptions draft dodging revelations and whitewater leaks how aggressively messrs gerth and van natta report that defense teamers employed what we might today call warrantless wiretapping mrs clinton "listened to a secretly recorded audiotape" of her husbands opponents discussing an alleged gubernatorial paramour "bills supporters " the authors write "monitored frequencies used by cell phones and the tape was made during one of those monitoring sessions " we also didnt know at least until we read reports based on "her way" that mrs clinton didnt read the page national intelligence estimate on iraqi weapons of mass destruction before casting her pro war vote in early she says now that its no big deal she was fully briefed in any case but the antiwar forces in her party are seizing on this detail with a vengeance saying that it shows an alarming willingness to defer to president bush and a failure to perform the normal skeptical role of the political opposition and most of us didnt know that mrs clinton had a hand in founding a liberal watchdog group called citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington it took the lead in attacking tom delay helping to publicize the mark foley scandal and going after other prominent congressional republicans messrs gerth and van natta report that mrs clinton helped to raise funds for the group and contributed staff time to its efforts while keeping her name out of it "her way" offers nuggets of such information without pretending to give the hillary story much narrative sweep sometimes it should be said the nuggets are pretty small messrs gerth and van natta criticize mrs clinton never a big environmentalist for not buying energy efficient appliances for her house in washington go to the footnotes and youll see that they checked district of columbia building permit b and found that hillary installed air conditioning units with a seasonal energy efficiency rating of when she herself supported a government required rating of at least well well the authors also show little interest in mrs clintons early years there are footnotes in the books first two chapters the ones that take mrs clinton from birth through college ninety four of them refer to mrs clintons often truth dodging memoir "living history " or to gail sheehys biography "hillarys choice " perhaps messrs gerth and van natta should have just started their account in washington carl bernstein by contrast spent years digging deeply into mrs clintons life from the beginning and his research makes "a woman in charge" a remarkably revealing portrait without breaking much new ground mr bernstein makes us feel for the young hillary rodham he shows how her home life was painfully unhappy at times her father could be a real sob and how she emerged from it in her own adolescent self description a "compassionate misanthrope " but the real value of "a woman in charge" comes when mr bernstein shows us what happens when a compassionate misanthrope ends up in the white house after her husband was elected in in no small part thanks to his wifes skill at procuring false affidavits eavesdropping and otherwise squelching those bimbo eruptions mrs clinton was ready for power mr bernstein describes her wondering which job to take attorney general white house chief of staff chief domestic adviser she ended up of course heading her husbands signature initiative health care reform and making a mess of it the striking thing about mr bernsteins account is how hard she worked to alienate the people on her own side top clinton officials lloyd bentsen donna shalala leon panetta and alice rivlin all thought that it was an awful idea for hillary to head the health care task force "mostly these people thought the idea the whole system hillary was setting up was crazy " ms shalala told mr bernstein bill bradley the former democratic senator positively unloads on mrs clinton mr bernstein describes an april meeting in which mr bradley suggested that mrs clinton might have to make some changes in her health care plan get lost she told him vowing to "demonize" any lawmakers who got in her way "that was it for me in terms of hillary clinton " mr bradley says "you dont tell members of the senate you are going to demonize them it was obviously so basic to who she is the arrogance the assumption that people with questions are enemies the disdain the hypocrisy " even loyalists like rahm emanuel had their doubts he told mr bernstein about an old sally quinn column in the washington post in which ms quinn advised mrs clinton to remember that she wasnt elected president bill clinton was angry about the column but mr emanuels own reaction he tells mr bernstein was "god bless sally for being honest " such doubts point up a nagging suspicion that is almost a theme of "a woman in charge" that hillary rodham clinton is a seriously overrated political figure "there was too much mythology about hillary that stretched the facts " ms shalala is quoted saying mr bernstein reports that ms shalala "had always been made uncomfortable by hyperbolic statements from friends and acolytes of hillary who put forth the notion that had she pursued her own political career and not deferred to bill clintons she would have been a governor or a senator in her own right by " it would never have been that easy ms shalala notes no matter what hillarys fans said to take just one example of such hyperbole remember the stories about how hillary rodham clinton was one of the top lawyers in america both books point out that she failed the district of columbia bar exam when she took it fresh out of yale law school and never tried again mr bernstein reports that out of people who took the exam that year thats passed "most from law schools less prestigious than yale " that mrs clinton failed is not a scoop she revealed it in a little noticed passage in "living history" but it will get new attention now mrs clinton was also it is clear unimpressive in the courtroom mr bernstein reports that her rose law firm partners "began steering her practice toward nonjury work " in the end both "her way" and "a woman in charge" leave the reader with the impression that hillary clinton has two crowning achievements to her credit one came in when she fought off allegations about her husbands womanizing and helped to get him elected the other came in when she fought off allegations about her husbands womanizing and helped to keep him in office and the rest its a mixed bag at best "with the notable exception of her husbands libidinous carelessness " mr bernstein writes "the most egregious errors strategic and tactical of the bill clinton presidency particularly in its infancy were traceable to hillary " he lists not only the health care project but also the lackluster white house staff the loss of congress travelgate the mysteriously lucky venture into commodity trading and yes whitewater the unanswered question is whether mrs clintons judgment has improved since then you tell me mr york is white house correspondent for national review and a columnist for the hill
