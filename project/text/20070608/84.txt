the speechmaker how bill gates got ready for harvard warren buffett offered tips on delivery and tone a dropout gets a degree cambridge mass bill gates started writing his harvard commencement speech last december but it was in late march while waiting to see condoleezza rice at the state department that he found his muse to explain mr gates sprang from his chair in his office in redmond wash earlier this week faced a wall and pantomimed the outlines of a large rectangle "i was just sitting there waiting and in their lobby they have this one document thats completely framed and lit and its beautiful " he said "its the text of george marshalls speech " the speech delivered at harvards commencement on june outlined the marshall plan the bold economic relief program that lifted europe from the ashes of world war ii to mr gates the general was describing the challenges facing postwar europe in terms similar to how the software billionaire sees his own st century crusade using philanthropy to reduce global inequities in health wealth and education that was the central theme as mr gates delivered his own message yesterday afternoon to graduates and attendees seated under sunny skies in harvard yard "humanitys greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity " mr gates declared "whether through democracy strong public education quality health care or broad economic opportunity reducing inequity is the highest human achievement " mr gates thus took another big step in his growing effort to use his business celebrity status to capture attention to global philanthropy much as his friend bono the rock musician uses his own star status to promote causes mr gates in had publicly warned governors of americas "obsolete" high school system and earlier this year he warned lawmakers of the "economic peril" the countrys immigration policies pose for american competitiveness long known for becoming wealthy by building microsoft corp into the worlds largest software maker mr gates last year said that in june he will focus on philanthropy full time at the &# billion bill &amp melinda gates foundation which he runs with his wife he came to harvard yesterday to pick up an honorary degree from the university he dropped out of in in his speech he recalled his undergraduate life as "the leader of the antisocial group" in his dorm on the radcliffe quad away from the center of campus "there were more women up there and most of the guys were science math types " he recalled "that combination offered me the best odds if you know what i mean this is where i learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesnt guarantee success " when he started working on the speech in december he used as a sounding board a gates foundation staff member who had written for slate the online magazine started by microsoft the two traded outlines and drafts of the speech by the end mr gates and his staff had met six times for brainstorming sessions completed six drafts and traded many long emails mr gates wrote some of the longest ones himself mr gates says he read nobel prize acceptance speeches of albert einstein marie curie enrico fermi and bacteriologist robert koch among others he studied commencement speeches delivered by bill clinton and bono both of whom have spoken at harvard then he saw the framed copy of the marshall speech he had read it before but mr gates said it was while staring at the state department copy that he noticed mr marshall had told his harvard audience how the "enormous complexity" of the problems facing postwar europe makes it "exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation " the word complexity struck him mr gates said because he had been talking with his friend the billionaire investor warren buffett about how the complexity of certain things in society the tax system and the federal budget for instance hinders people from fully grasping them and ultimately impedes change in spreading the word about inequalities and what to do about them mr gates found that time and again among friends and in groups he found people who wanted to get more involved helping but didnt understand how to do something about a complicated disease or poverty in distant lands mr gates had been mulling the idea and in a january email to the staff people helping him with the speech he introduced the idea that complexity was keeping people from acting he sent around a january new yorker article by malcolm gladwell that addressed the role complexity played in the enron scandal now here it was again in marshalls words he says he thought about how in the years since george marshall and the years since he left harvard a host of technological advances have helped erase those complexities the internet for instance allows the best minds in an area to work together on common problems in ways they couldnt do before soon mr gates and his staff incorporated points from gen marshalls speech into his own in late may mr gates tapped mr buffett again he wanted to press graduates to become more aware and active in helping solve global inequities but was worried about sounding "overly preachy " mr gates went to omaha neb for the annual shareholders meeting of berkshire hathaway mr buffetts company on which mr gates serves as a board member after the meeting mr buffett gave mr gates some tips on delivery and tone "warren is the best at kind of inspiring people to do something without preaching " mr gates said "warren helped me feel like really telling the students to do something was ok if you did it the right way " last weekend while some of his staff wrote up suggestions for the speech mr gates flew to california for a bridge tournament by sunday mr gates was back at his pc editing the speech fine tuning the language on monday he ran through it for the first time at a podium at his office and by tuesday he had emailed a copy to mr buffett wednesday he read the speech aloud to his wife on the private plane ride to boston yesterday he finally got his harvard degree doctor of laws "it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume " he said in his speech he noted that the student newspaper the crimson had called him "harvards most successful dropout " and said "i guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class i did the best of everyone who failed but he quickly changed tone telling his audience that he had dropped out of harvard well educated in economics politics and the sciences but still with "one big regret " "i left harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequalities in the world the appalling disparities of health and wealth and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of poverty disease and despair " he said in the analytical style for which he became famous in high tech circles mr gates recommended a four point plan for attacking a complex problem determine a goal find the "highest leverage approach " discover the ideal technology for that approach "and in the meantime make the smartest application of the technology that you already have " he continued "the aids epidemic offers an example the broad goal of course is to end the disease the highest leverage approach is prevention the ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives lifetime immunity with a single dose so governments drug companies and foundations fund vaccine research but their work is likely to take more than a decade so in the meantime we have to work with what we have in hand and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior" a goal that requires its own four point plan he exhorted the graduates each to take on an issue and "become a specialist on it" even if they devote just a few hours every week thats the hook for him he explained in conversation before the speech "its fun to do this the day to day experience of learning about it seeing it " he said "obviously in my case fascinating enough that im reapportioning my time from what has been one of the worlds most interesting and exciting jobs "
