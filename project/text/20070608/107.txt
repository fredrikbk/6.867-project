weekend journal the drivers seat hyundai veracruz hyundais long drive to respectability hyundai has a problem a complicated one thats unlikely to go away anytime soon though it has been years since its cars were mocked on late night television popular opinion clings to the notion that they are cheap despite the korean companys generous warranties its dramatic improvements on quality surveys and the across the board competitiveness of its vehicles the stigma lingers since hyundai entered the u s market in with its excel at &# it has primarily offered inexpensive vehicles and always sold on price hyundai has done well by this tactic growing at an enviable pace for much of this decade its u s sales climbed to in from in but sales stagnated last year even as hyundai management became clearer about their vision of continuing to push the brand into higher priced segments indeed the newest hyundai the veracruz sport utility vehicle is its most expensive yet in the u s in top of the line "limited" trim the veracruz carries a suggested price of &# when equipped with all wheel drive a base model with front wheel drive starts at &# while selling pricier vehicles means higher profit margins and entering new segments is a surefire way to generate more volume this has been one of the keys to hyundais growth it will require a fundamental repositioning of the brand thats where things are going to get difficult for the auto maker as the more cash people are willing to part with for a vehicle the more cachet they expect in return hyundais stock with image conscious buyers is currently nil which puts it at even more of a disadvantage than volkswagen the most recent auto maker that tried to "stretch the brand " vw failed and unless hyundai makes some fundamental changes in how it develops and markets cars it will too the veracruz for example is a thoroughly good vehicle something you could call "uncriticizable" with a straight face in that regard its not unlike vws failed flagship the phaeton just as the vw luxury sedan matched bmw and mercedes on their own terms and failed to find buyers at least in the u s the veracruz is similarly flawed it does nothing to raise the bar for three row suvs and ultimately its main selling point is bound to be its price a large car based suv the veracruz resembles its midsize brother the santa fe which in turn resembles the compact tucson while the veracruz has perhaps the most attractive design of the trio its still as utterly generic as its siblings while this is probably better than sticking out like a sore thumb a design philosophy hyundai employed a few years ago the veracruzs styling ranks as a trifle granted seven passenger suvs arent exactly a segment where youd expect trend setting exterior styling to its credit the veracruz has a powerful liter v engine and a good complement of features and safety equipment including standard stability control and side curtain airbags i could complain that the suspension is too soft and steering vague and slightly over boosted but this is a feel that most americans seem to equate with luxury the veracruz has comfortable seats and its third row is large enough to be useful the interior is decently designed though an overabundance of crude plastic buttons and knobs will keep you from mistaking it for a more expensive vehicle the miles a gallon overall that i observed while driving a front wheel drive veracruz is no more no less than would be expected hyundai has once again closely studied the specifications of its competition and effectively matched them while identifying a few areas where it could excel if youre the type who values a line by line spreadsheet comparison more than a test drive youll likely find the veracruz more impressive than i did anyone who falls for hyundais public relations claim that the veracruz is every bit the vehicle that the lexus rx is but for &# less has likely not driven the lexus while this type of imitation has long been enough for hyundai to conquer sales from more established proletarian brands its going to take a lot more to establish a bulwark in the luxury field perhaps its unfair to accuse hyundai of breaking no ground with the veracruz but thats exactly what the car maker needs to do to supplant its "cheap car" image hyundai also needs to revamp its marketing case in point a commercial running during this years nba playoffs proclaims its fleet better than all manner of hondas toyotas and bmws thats a start and a stretch but for all the bravado the ad ends with a declaration that again reminds everyone the sole reason to consider a hyundai "less money " hopefully the ad agency hyundai hired this spring will understand that part of the perception of a luxury good comes from how much youve paid for it how hyundais big move plays out will likely be determined after the model year when a rear wheel drive sedan based on a concept car hyundai calls genesis reaches showrooms hyundai says the car will compete with the usual suspects in the "premium" sedan field good luck with that hyundai from the looks of the veracruz youll need it contact me at jeff
