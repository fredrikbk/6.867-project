mit scientists pave the way for wireless battery charging cambridge mass a watt light bulb that glows even though it isnt wired to a power source could pave the way for wireless recharging of cellphone and laptop batteries and the operation of mobile robots without batteries scientists reported a team of researchers at massachusetts institute of technology reported in the online publication of the journal science that they had demonstrated wireless transmission of electric power by magnetically coupled resonators they dubbed their technology "witricity" for wireless electricity marin soljacic the physics professor who led the team said the technology is sufficiently proved and that "now is a good time to start thinking about commercializing it " he said that while further development is needed to improve efficiency he thinks commercial products could be on sale in "a few years if you started working very seriously " he said mit would handle licensing of the technology prof soljacic said that over short distances wireless transmission appears to be about as efficient as wired transmission the resonant devices interact with each other without interfering with either biological processes or other electrical devices prof soljacic also noted that electricity pioneer nicola tesla worked on similar methods for wireless transmission in the early th century but dropped the idea because it didnt work over long distances while wireless transmission of electricity over radio waves is well known its very inefficient because most of the power is dissipated in directions other than the device that needs the power prof soljacics team theorized that two copper coils tuned to resonate in identical magnetic fields would assure the power would go only where it was needed resonant objects interact only with objects of the same resonance for example if an opera singer holds a high note in a room of wine glasses filled to different levels only one glass which resonates with that note is likely to shatter the researchers technology uses a copper coil attached to a power outlet to transmit electromagnetic waves at set frequencies a receiving coil attached to the base of the light bulb can receive the power for a distance up to seven feet making it appropriate for rooms prof soljacic a year old who joined mit from croatia said he thinks manufacturers could include such coils in battery powered devices such as laptop computers to make automated wireless recharging possible he said he started considering the problem several years ago because he was often awakened at night by the sound of his cellphone beeping because its battery was getting low and he had forgotten to put it on its charger the technology doesnt work over long distances but it functions well within average sized rooms in homes he said that might make it possible to build wireless devices that dont require batteries he noted that many devices such as robot vacuum cleaners and laptop computers run on less energy than the light bulb his team lit up
