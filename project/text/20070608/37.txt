is irans threat bluster better have plan b in regard to "the weekend interview with benjamin netanyahu dealing with iran" by james taranto editorial page may the divestment plan being touted by likud leader and former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is certainly worth a try as part of a coordinated effort to stall the iranian nuclear threat so are multiparty talks although they have had no efficacy save for making the talk at any cost crowd feel virtuous but as these likely to prove futile efforts proceed we must also work on plan b a military strike holding it in reserve as a last resort while some may regard the iranian threat to wipe israel from the map as mere bluster others accept it as more than rodomontade more than theocratic theatrics from islamic tatterdemalions for those of us in the latter category plan b must remain a viable option paul bloustein cincinnati mr netanyahu makes a statement that describes adequately the present paralysis in the israeli government despite the diminished if not nonexistent support not only for ehud olmert but also his kadima party there is no practical method for removing him from office other than criminal charges this anomaly is created by the need to obtain a nonconfidence vote in the knesset for the present government forcing its resignation and leading to a general election with possibly as many as of the current members of the knesset slated for defeat in a new general election these individuals want to hold on to the trappings of office as mentioned by benjamin netanyahu and will not vote themselves out of office by failing to give a vote of confidence to the present administration again personal aggrandizement overcomes love of country even in israel nelson marans silver spring md
