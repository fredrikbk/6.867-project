weekend journal taste compliments out of context have you caught the "sensational action " in the recent nicolas cage sci fi flick "next" in newspaper ads this description of the movie about a las vegas magician who can see two minutes into the future is attributed to veteran critic jack mathews of the new york tabloid the daily news heres the sentence in his review that included the phrase "tamahori attempts to cover the ludicrousness of the story with a wickedly fast pace and sensational action set pieces " in the same review mr mathews dubs "next" "a routine action film" and "a sci fi laugher" while awarding it just two stars out of four mr mathewss colleague elizabeth weitzman reviewed the crime thriller "fracture" and deemed it again according to ads " a must see " well sort of consider these passages from her review "as directed by gregory hoblit fracture is the kind of thriller weve seen a thousand times before fortunately nobody told his leads ryan gosling and anthony hopkins both of whom devoutly believe theyre in another better movie together these two turn a mediocre movie into a must see " audiences dont seem to be fooled "next" mustered a risible &# million in its opening weekend at the box office the th best showing of the year and what moviegoer wouldnt smell a crocodile of disapproval lurking in that moat of ellipses around "must see" every day in dim cool screening rooms sun deprived film critics we bleary cultural draculas chat about such matters with less outrage than amusement publicists usually obtain our consent before they extract our kindest words pepper them with exclamation points which by the way none of us ever use except sarcastically and plunk them into the ads if critics didnt derive a tiny thrill out of seeing our names in print wed have gotten real jobs besides we understand the showmans imperative to make every routine actioner appear to be the next no holds barred high octane nail biter or each comedy the kind that makes people "laugh out loud" rather than silently the broadway theater producer david merrick once made a conceptual leap by taking the names of the critics out of context raiding the phone book merrick found seven otherwise unknown citizens a shoe salesman a mailman who shared their names with the major broadway critics then coaxed from them quotations such as "the best musical of the century" to promote his production "subways are for sleeping " the new york herald tribune ran the resulting ad in one edition before killing it creating a scandal that kept the show on the boards for months who doesnt marvel at such max bialystockmanship especially considering that merrick had plotted the ruse long before but had to await the retirement of the singularly named new york times critic brooks atkinson anyone who has ever wielded a red pen can pinpoint the blurbologists use of slender praise see mr mathewss example or chasm sized loophole ms weitzmans other blandishments are of questionable objectivity celebrity interviewers such as larry king reflexively praise the work of anyone who might warm the guests chair or authority such as those plucked from fan web sites across the atlantic however the subject is being taken seriously under the authority of the unfair commercial practices directive the european union will in december bar advertising claims that include "false information " sony pictures found in that even in the u s tolerance for blurbological gymnastics can be limited the studio was forced to admit that it was sprinkling its ads for such duds as "a knights tale" with fabricated quotations from a nonexistent critic in the resulting class action suit sony agreed to refund &# of the ticket price to supposedly outraged filmgoers the resulting suit cost sony &# in payments to the few movie lovers who demanded refunds and an additional &# in administrative costs and payments to the plaintiffs bar but in the eu far grayer areas would be under scrutiny the law would proscribe any ad that "deceives or is likely to deceive the consumer" so that it "is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise " an eu spokeswoman said that the law "should apply to misleading advertising right across the board from airline tickets to theater tickets " the london press mostly applauded it was just last year that my onetime employer the times of london solemnly intoned with a righteous flourish of investigative journalese "more than one third of west end theatres have been found to use highly selective quotations from the optimistic to the downright misleading " it was an expose that laid bare a shocking truth that after years of cutbacks in jobs for journalists there are still too many of us since virtually every publishing house theater producer and movie studio rips quotations out of context one wonders whether even the eu can generate enough bureaucrats to handle the potential caseload what standards will apply if i am generally ecstatic about a film but detect one or two small problems will a word blurb be required to set aside five words for my quibbles will four words suffice a new specialist in parsing such distinctions will arise the blurbocrat selective communication though is not only the brick and mortar of arts and leisure its built into our lives you have been as guilty as the studio that made "next" on many occasions when discussing bad dates "she said she had a really interesting time with you at the hustler club" or lifes greatest miracle "shes going to grow up to be as beautiful as her mother" politicians do it too of course the perpetual amusement of spot the loophole would wither if pols started saying things like "i have never broken the laws of my country but i smoked more pot than crosby stills and nash combined when i was at oxford " being quoted out of context is a problem worthy of einstein and as it happens he may be the most famous victim of the practice einsteins remark that "he does not play dice" seemed to indicate belief in the almighty but the atheist christopher hitchens recruits einstein for his side in his recent book "god is not great " mr hitchens quotes an einstein letter "it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but expressed it clearly " but as walter isaacson notes in his book "einstein his life and universe " einstein once answered a question by saying "everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly superior to that of man and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble in this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort " einstein also said "im not an atheist " in the absence of testimony from einstein or god how will the eu rule on the question of which author is quoting out of context maybe it will split the difference as bostons cardinal william henry oconnell put it "i very seriously doubt that einstein himself really knows what he is driving at " mr smith is a novelist and a film critic for the new york post he blogs at kylesmithonline com
