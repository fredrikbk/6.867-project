boom aside not all lbos look so hot not everyones making money hand over fist doing leveraged buyouts lately even as the buyout boom rolls on a number of recent high profile deals are already showing signs of strain among them the &# billion purchase of retailer linens n things inc by a group led by apollo management lp avista capital partners &# million buyout of the star tribune newspaper in minneapolis and the &# billion deal for freescale semiconductor holdings by several buyout specialists apollos &# billion purchase of realogy corp also is raising questions among some investors for now those deals are the exceptions most of the recent private equity buyouts have held up nicely or are at stages where it is too early to judge them analysts and traders say "i think these are one off problems and not a signal of problems to come " says victor consoli co head of corporate credit strategy at bear stearns "the economy is still fairly strong the dollar is weak which makes our exports more attractive and the consumer is employed and still spending " but others are more cautious noting that recent lbos have included heavy dollops of debt potentially causing problems as bond yields climb and the u s economy runs into new obstacles companies that have gone private in buyouts are generating cash that exceeds their debt interest payments by just times versus times last year and times in according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data the ratio is at a year low and shows how the margin for error for companies is shrinking as their profit growth is slowing still it is striking how quickly a few of the deals have run into problems the stumbles from lbo firms with impressive track records are a reminder that these deals can be challenging especially when they take place in cyclical or struggling industries where cash flows arent very stable "our concern is if there is more of a slowdown in the economy in the second half " more companies that have been taken private will run into trouble because of the significant debt they have taken on as part of the deals says jeffrey rosenberg head of credit strategy at banc of america securities this week investors who purchased loans backing avistas buyout of the star tribune newspaper learned that the companys cash flow already is running as much as below avistas original financial projections for the deal which closed just three months ago according to someone close to the matter full year results also are expected to come in below projections some of the loans earlier this week dropped to around cents on the dollar before rebounding to around yesterday according to data from s&amp p lcd such levels indicate investors are worried about the newspapers ability to repay its debt avista has cut about jobs at the paper and is hopeful the move will give it enough breathing space as it pursues growth areas such as advertising over the internet according to someone close to the firm a spokesman for avista declined to comment at retailer linens n things which was bought by apollo in february two consecutive quarters of poor results have sent prices of its bonds down since late february to around cents on the dollar in an april report moodys investors service said the home furnishing retailers cash flow in its fiscal year was only &# million well below expectations of &# million robert dinicola chief executive of the clifton n j retailer that is now part of linens holding co called first quarter results "disappointing " "linens is arguably showing some struggle but it was marketed to lenders as a turnaround story so the jury is still out " bear stearnss mr consoli says a person close to apollo said it viewed linens as a longer term turnaround and the firm made sure the debt for the deal had no covenants making it unlikely borrowers could force the company to pay off its debt early that gives apollo more flexibility to improve operations over time an apollo spokesman declined to comment some traders are raising questions about realogy a residential real estate broker that was taken private by apollo in april and is battling a slumping housing market realogy which doesnt disclose its results publicly likely went through a challenging first quarter with weaker sales and rising inventories said debt research firm creditsights a recent "alarming rise in existing home inventories" points to lower revenue and margins for realogy creditsights analysts said yields on some of realogys newly issued bonds have climbed to from when they were issued in april as prices of the bonds have slipped according to s&amp p lcd freescale meanwhile reported weaker than expected results for its first quarter as the semiconductor maker experienced lower demand from its largest customer motorola inc freescale suffered a drop in sales and cash flow which prompted moodys to cut its outlook on the company to negative from stable saying it expects freescales cash flow this year to be weaker than anticipated which would delay its debt reduction some investors however say the recent weakness may present a buying opportunity arguing that the private equity firms backing the deals are skilled and shrewd enough to turn things around "we think there will be some blowups but a lot of these deals are backed by smart investors who have written big checks "
