permit" to buy alcohol but as india opened up to world trade in the past decade and its economy boomed a new urban generation began to embrace partying travel and free spending mr mallyas flashy image became an asset that helped turn his empire into a commercial giant protecting it meanwhile were import duties of up to on foreign liquor now the same liberalizing forces that changed india and

bagpiper brand goes for about &# a bottle far less than any imported one he thinks the gap will keep his consumers loyal "the combined annual sales of all of the multinationals operating in india is less than the incremental growth that ive got each year " mr mallya says "thats how much of a dent theyre making " but mr mallya is also working hard to shore up his position he is applying some of the foreigners marketing tricks such as holding tastings at bars and he is pressuring his distributors around india to shun foreign brands mr mallyas business empire is the worlds third largest seller

kingfisher beer in the summer and in the monsoon season he switches to mcdowell whisky also from mr mallyas companies whisky has a long tradition in india it arrived in colonial times and remained the drink of the countrys high society after independence in it also retained the british spelling the liquor is called whiskey in the u s when the british left mr mallyas father bought up some british owned alcohol companies alongside this tradition was mahatma gandhis ascetic vision of an alcohol and tobacco free india as recently as india tried to implement nationwide prohibition and alcohol is still banned in gandhis home state of gujarat mr mallyas father added to his business by acquiring distressed local sellers of spirits his death in left the business to vijay then a year old party boy whom many expected to fritter it away instead he hired professional management unusual for a family run indian company he steadily snapped up more local competitors launched new brands and expanded the company as the stigma attached to drinking faded two years ago companies mr mallya controlled bought their main indian competitor shaw wallace &amp co that gave them about half of the indian spirits market to go with their of the indian beer market the deal also gave mallya companies great influence with indias thousands of small shops his more than brands represent as much as of many liquor store owners profits the more than companies in the ub group five of which are publicly held also have stakes in other businesses from software to soccer clubs to u s microbreweries their annual revenue totals more than &# billion the biggest company called united spirits reported net profit of &# million on &# billion of revenue in the fiscal year ended march mr mallya and his family

president and chief financial officer of the overall ub group says he tries to keep mr mallya from taking on too much "he is an acquisitory animal by nature and he doesnt like to sell things " the finance chief says when mr mallya came to him with plans to start the airline that became kingfisher mr nedungadi says he told his boss he needed to sell some minority stakes in other firms to lighten the debt load the airline grew quickly and has aspirations to fly internationally it has ordered airbus planes and local papers say it is soon to announce further orders worth more than &# billion a kingfisher airlines spokeswoman wouldnt comment on the reports similarly named products are useful in marketing alcohol in india the nation bars beer and liquor advertising in almost every medium but makers can get the names before the public by having like named products that dont face ad restrictions kingfisher airlines smirnoff cds one ub group whisky royal challenge advertises golf accessories with that name the first foreign challenge to mr mallya came from pernod ricard it saw that many indians wanted to trade up from local whisky brands costing only &# to &# but couldnt afford imported scotch so a few years ago pernod revamped a whisky made in india put it in an impressive new bottle and priced it at &# to &# "it was bloody attractive " mr mallya acknowledges he began changing the look of his own products hiring a london design firm to provide fancier bottles and packaging he also beefed up promotions in bars a technique long common in the west but not much used in india until recently pernod has seen sales of its indian whiskies grow at as much as a year although on a relatively small base now it has enough of a distribution network that if import tariffs fall it can import and aggressively promote its premium scotches such as chivas regal and ballantines pernods success has attracted others diageo which had abandoned india several years ago is getting back in a study diageo did two years ago concluded that if indias liquor duties fell by half indian consumers would buy two million to three million cases of imported scotch a year topping china which now imports about million cases of scotch annually in the longer run india could become the worlds biggest market for scotch according to the research last august diageo linked up with mr mallyas largest indian rival radico khaitan ltd to produce new indian made whiskies priced at about &# a bottle at that price they would have to taste better than local blends indian whiskies are usually made of sugar cane molasses and can be bitter western whisky is made of grains this is largely barley in the case of scotch whisky which to bear that name must be made in scotland and aged in oak for at least three years indian molasses whiskies are rarely aged at all in february diageo launched an indian made whisky called masterstroke like pernods indian made entry in a fancy bottle masterstroke is distilled from indian grown grains made by a master blender brought in from scotland "its mellower and smoother it doesnt taste like petrol " says the head of the u k companys indian operations asif adil a united spirits executive says its wrong to say molasses based whisky doesnt taste as good that what matters is the "the quality of the distillation process " it does makes some whisky with grain and may make more because sugar cane has grown more expensive diageos operation in india also imports some liquor such as captain morgan rum the company is holding sampling evenings for indian bartenders at these it sometimes pairs different blends of its johnnie walker scotch with various indian dishes mr mallya is trying to make life difficult for these foreigners he has required some of his distributors to sign exclusivity agreements that bar them from carrying competitors products the move is legal "we have the largest clout in terms of distribution and we intend to use it " he says mr mallyas ub group has long since sewn up many key sports and entertainment sponsorships diageo tried to wrest away sponsorship of a major mumbai horse race by offering more than a mallya company was paying race organizers declined to drop ub citing a long relationship a few weeks ago the ub groups united spirits paid &# billion for whyte &amp mackay the fourth largest scotch producer which also is the largest supplier of private label whiskies for retailers he plans to use the firm several ways import its best brands by the bottle relaunch some of its defunct names in india at lower prices and bring in barrels of its scotch to blend with indian made whisky to improve the taste as he battles back the imports the king of good timess persona seems to be an advantage in todays india "people aspire to be like him because they see him as a global icon " says mr frederick the club owner "his brutally blatant aggressive display of wealth is kind of vulgar but it works today "
