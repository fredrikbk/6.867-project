weekend journal taste houses of worship a liberal mix of religion and politics in a recent issue of the rhode island catholic a diocesan newspaper bishop thomas tobin condemned rudy giulianis position on abortion "as catholics we are called indeed required to be pro life to cherish and protect human life as a precious gift of god from the moment of conception until the time of natural death as a leader as a public official rudy giuliani has a special obligation in that regard " the issue of how the catholic hierarchy in the u s should deal with the problem of pro choice catholic politicians came up last during the presidential election some bishops warned sen john kerry the democratic nominee that he should not take communion in their dioceses because of his support for legalized abortion but this problem has been discussed for decades most bishops have resisted calls to excommunicate such politicians or even to impose lesser sanctions including denying them communion the very idea of these actions appalls most liberals both inside and outside the church they consider ecclesiastical punishment undemocratic an attack on personal conscience and a violation of the separation of church and state "i believe the church has a role in guiding parishioners and people in public life but i dont believe the church should be using the sacrament of communion as a political weapon " rep rosa delauro d conn a pro choice catholic recently told the connecticut post there was a time however when most liberals applauded the bishops for disciplining catholics including politicians who opposed the churchs teachings in march archbishop joseph rummel of new orleans announced that all catholic schools in the archdiocese would be integrated starting that fall at the time eight years after brown v board of education public and private schools throughout louisiana were segregated rummel who condemned racial segregation as a sin in found that his plan met organized resistance among catholic parents the opposition was led by leander perez the president of the plaquemines parish council and one of the most powerful political bosses in the state jackson ricau the executive director of the south louisiana citizens council which opposed all integration efforts and b j "una" gaillot the president of save our nation an organization that asserted that the bible mandated racial segregation on march the archbishop sent letters to messrs perez and ricau and mrs gaillot warning that if they continued to oppose his efforts "through word or deed " he would excommunicate them mrs gaillot made the ailing year old prelates letter public on april rummel carried out his threat and announced the excommunication of all three they objected of course making arguments that seem familiar today mr perez invoked democratic principles stating that "the vast majority of catholic parents" supported racial segregation he also saw rummels action exclusively in political terms saying "we cannot recognize any threat of excommunication by any temporary officers of the church on matters especially which have nothing to do with religion but which are used as threats to impose forced racial integration or communistic regimentation of our children " mr ricau insisted he was simply following his conscience "i have done nothing but fight for racial integrity as is my prerogative under the constitution " he said "and to tell the truth about the controversial compulsory integration movement " finally mrs gaillot argued that the excommunication was unjustified because rummel never "refuted that god demands segregation of the races in his scriptures " rummel and archbishop joseph ritter of st louis had previously used the threat of excommunication to suppress lay catholic opposition to civil rights in rummel warned catholic lawmakers in the state legislature that they would face excommunication if they voted to mandate the segregation of all private schools including catholic ones in the same year he forced the association of catholic laymen which was established to oppose his initial desegregation efforts to disband by threatening its members with excommunication in when "separate but equal" was still the law of the land ritter threatened to excommunicate any catholic who took legal action to block his plan to desegregate catholic schools in st louis how did liberals react to rummels actions "we salute the catholic archbishop " the new york times editorialized "he has set an example founded on religious principle and response to the social conscience of our times " an editorial in the nation applauded rummels initial excommunication threat and cited ritters action in as a precedent certainly it seems liberals dont really mind mixing religion with politics as long as its their political agenda being promoted rep delauro mr giuliani and other catholic politicians may choose to see ecclesiastical punishments as blunt political weapons used to club them into submission on a controversial issue for the bishops however such punishments are imposed as a last effort to be taken against those who in their judgment are publicly flouting the laws
