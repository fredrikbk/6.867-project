weekend journal the oldest crop big name collectors million dollar fossils angry scientists and ranchers with pickaxes kelly crow on a new western shootout a decade long drought has scorched a swath of the plains from montana to minnesota down to texas forcing ranchers to sell off their herds and farmers to take shifts at factories and oil companies but other ranchers and farmers are turning to a lucrative new crop wielding pickaxes backhoes and duct tape they are unearthing the remains of triceratops velociraptors and tyrannosaurus rexes and selling the skeletons to museums and private collectors one rancher sells t rex teeth on ebay helping drive the big dig is the soaring price of prehistoric fossils the going rate for a triceratops skull is &# up from &# a decade ago and a full t rex skeleton with all its teeth can fetch anywhere from &# million to &# million serious fossil enthusiasts include actor nicolas cage and nathan myhrvold microsofts former chief technology officer interior designers are incorporating fossil fish and fossil palm fronds as decor and in europe art collectors who formerly fell for damien hirsts pickled animals are circling natural history auctions looking to buy dusty bones as sculptures larry tuss a lifelong farmer who manages acres near winifred mont close to the center of the state plans to quit planting wheat and barley and focus more on his backyard expeditions in the past six years mr tuss has found five dinosaurs on his property including a triceratops like certopian a duck billed hadrasaur and two long necked sea lizards called plesiosaurs all are being readied for sale by a fossil company "ranching isnt cutting it anymore " he says "im into fossil farming now " but the amateur dinosaur hunters have angered academia and paleontologists complain that the ranchers and farmers and the handful of fossil companies they usually hire to do the prospecting are destroying valuable specimens with clumsy handling they say the practice is putting new and rare species into the hands of private collectors rather than researchers and inspiring bone poachers to raid federal parks landowners dismiss such claims as misplaced snobbery but the tension has boiled over in the past couple years as scientists ostracize ranchers at paleontology conventions and curators refuse to allow them behind the scenes at museums for fear they will glean secret locations of new digs tad rust a commercial fossil hunter in hill city s d says hes no longer allowed to visit a mosasaur a prehistoric marine lizard he donated to his alma mater the university of alabama the last time he tried to visit he says a school researcher threatened to call police to escort him off campus "i was desperately hurt " he says a university spokesman says the public including past donors arent routinely allowed to mill around research areas jack horner a paleontologist at montana state university who was the inspiration for the scientist in michael crichtons "jurassic park " says some new hunters dig up specimens too fast without taking proper field notes about the bones locations or soil surroundings which can be valuable for science "anybody can sell fossils " dr horner says "some are honest but some are just seeing a market and jumping at it " among those who dont care about the supporting sedimentary data are the growing number of collectors who want to mount mammoth skeletons in their living rooms on april in paris christies sold &# million worth of paleontology objects doubling its presale estimate the sale included a &# dinosaur egg a &# woolly rhinoceros skeleton and a &# siberian mammoth nicknamed "president" after boris yeltsin which had been estimated to sell for up to &# these top lots among others were bought by european contemporary art collectors who liked their shapes and "amusing yellow color " says francois curiel president of christies europe in los angeles bonhams &amp butterfields expects to bring in &# million with three natural history sales this year up from none five years ago "i love looking at things that have been around for millions of years " says john babiarz a collector who runs a nursery in phoenix he picked up the hobby after a customer invited him to a fossil dig in since then hes collected at least species of saber toothed tiger and paid under &# for pieces of a t rex now on loan to arizona state university "i dont care where the bones come from so long as theyre legal " american private property laws make it easy to buy and sell the bones whats excavated from private sites on u s soil can be sold at will unlike in other bone rich countries like china italy peru or argentina which discourage or forbid commercial excavation of ancient objects and have been caught up in cultural patrimony lawsuits lately bucky derflinger a year old rancher from faith s d population stumbled into the industry nine years ago when he happened upon a pair of t rexes jutting out of crumbling hillsides on his fathers land "i found this cheekbone with teeth in it and they were big old honking teeth " he says "i seriously did a flip right there all by myself " he says his german and irish ancestors like other local homesteaders in the early s kept quiet about any fossils they found because they worried the government might reclaim their land when mr derflinger found the dinosaurs he used his hands to pick up a few bones but eventually hired a commercial fossil company to excavate the rest the first dig for a teenage t rex nicknamed "bucky " involved using a payloader to scoop a foot tall wall of dirt from a bone bed the length of a football field three years ago he and his father sold "bucky" to the childrens museum of indianapolis for just over &# million splitting the profits evenly with the fossil company black hills institute of geological research in hill city s d mr derflinger used his cut to make a down payment on his own acre ranch near his fathers bones from the other t rex are still being cleaned but in the meantime mr derflinger has unearthed and sold a duck billed hadrasaur for &# plus hes started selling &# bundles of fossil crocodile teeth and petrified wood on ebay "there are some people at the museums around here who dont like me because i find these dinosaurs " he adds "but ive never met an academic who can dig as good as i can " fossils can be found in of the earths surface but paleontologists and hobbyists gravitate to areas where vegetation has eroded bettering their odds of finding bones geological maps help pinpoint exposed prehistoric rock often in undeveloped parts of the west scientists may get permits to dig on the nations million acres of public land but self taught diggers must gain access to private land typically landowners can lease "digging rights" to outsiders in exchange for to of the value or profits of any major finds fetching the highest prices carnivore remains with claws and jaws not all fossils yield big paydays one weekend in late april a few fossil hunting friends set out for a ranch in eastern wyoming two of the hunters mr rust and jared hudson another fossil hunter from hill city s d had won permission from the ranch owner to dig in exchange for a one third cut of any profitable finds the group drove past gnarled cottonwood trees and stopped beside an expanse of eroding hillside made of oligocene rock roughly million years old prime time for mammals like saber toothed tigers and dog sized horses fanning out with pickaxes in hand they scoured the rock for anomalies within half an hour mr rust made a discovery a rhino skull he did the initial excavation by hand pulling away the crumbly rock with his hands and his field knife until the lower jaw poked out he coated the bones with a clear glue called paleo bond to keep any from splintering and then the others helped hack away the nearby rock leaving the skull poised as though on a pedestal mr hudson stepped in detaching the skull and wrapping it in aluminum foil and duct tape less than minutes after the discovery another group member carried it back to the truck like a pound silver turkey breast its value up to &# "cool " says mr rust but not uncommon "like finding a dali print " after eight hours of hunting the skull was the days only substantial find paleontologists complain that commercial digs can be disastrous with self taught hunters accidentally backing over bones with bulldozers or crumbling specimens by excavating too quickly dr horner at montana state says its fine to wrap a rhino skull in glue and foil but he says studying and excavating most specimens should take days or months not hours hes spent as long as three years studying a dinosaur in the ground before it was excavated ranchers and hunters insist they take precautions but say they sometimes need to remove a protruding bone immediately to stave off further erosion fossil dealer henry galiano who owns a new york fossil store called maxilla &amp mandible says he has turned down offers to buy ranchers dinosaur skeletons after learning they "yanked it out of the ground" without first checking for tiny but crucial bones lying nearby mr galiano says "theyll tell me oh i couldnt get the rest out and i have to tell them well you just ruined it " theres some disagreement over which kinds of dinosaur bones and fossils should be studied but never sold some paleontologists treat every specimen as research not commercial objects others like mark norell who studies dinosaurs at the american museum of natural history in new york do not mind the selling of small plentiful fossils like crab like ammonites or fish but draw a line at big dinosaurs and under represented species like fossil bats and spiders whats more scientists have praised some private diggers for uncovering new species but then complained after the relics were sold to collectors because universities could not afford to buy them "its painful because too many really important species never get to see a scientist " says catherine badgley a research scientist at the university of michigan and president of the society of vertebrate paleontology "they wind up over a mantel " dino provenance is also growing problem buyers and sellers of picassos paintings keep detailed ownership histories of his works to prove their value but sellers of fossils rarely do the same instead they focus on the specimens age rarity and quality of preservation at fossil trade shows items are rarely sourced beyond the country or county where they were found outright fakes including some ammonites from morocco and dino eggs from mongolia abound especially online scientists can weed out imposter bones using isotope tests and cat scans unlike average collectors the two cultures even clash over nomenclature anyone who finds a new species gets to name it and scientists traditionally include their name in the latin classification dr horner discovered the maiasaura peeblesorum hornermakela a few years ago year old wesley linster discovered a new turkey sized genus of velociraptor on his familys montana land and christened it "bambiraptor " that dinosaur now belongs to the american museum of natural history where the linster family likes to say its sitting on the desk of its star paleontologist dr norell but dr norell says the raptor is packed into his office cabinet marked by its specimen number amnh dvpfarb "i dont call it bambi " he says some hunters have taken extra steps to polish their reputations mr hudson consults gps systems to avoid treading on restricted federal or state land which may not have clearly marked borders japheth boyce of rapid city s d says a majority of what he sells comes from his own land and he turns down lease offers from out of towners to appease academics and cut down on costs he has started selling larger specimens still in the ground to universities so that professors and graduate students can study and dig out the bones themselves others hope the public will pay to dig at their ranches with at least six ranches doubling as tourist destinations arlene zerbst rapp who has dubbed her wyoming cattle range "paleo park " found a pair of triceratops a few years ago and sold them to museums in texas and indiana about people visited her ranch last year even though the nearest town is miles away but ms zerbst rapp has one bone yard rule that doesnt always go over well with outsiders paleo park gets first dibs whenever tourists find anything "amazing " she says two years ago she had to tell a boy scout from iowa that he couldnt keep a t rex tooth hed found on her land "we made sure he got lots of badges " she says elsewhere private partnerships among ranches have grown complex the countrys dozen heavyweight fossil companies each claim between and land leases for hundreds of thousands of acres across several states the industrys biggest rivals black hills institute of geological research and triebold paleontology in woodland park colo started more than years ago as small operations by ranching and farming families today both send crews to dig on leased land from may to october leaving other employees to churn out polyurethane replicas of their prize finds &# can get you an exhibit hall sized t rex charles lieberman a chief investment officer at advisors capital management in paramus n j has found other inspiration in fossils he keeps an &# foot long herbivore called a psittacosaurus mounted in his reception area and at home he displays megalodon teeth ammonites and other ancient reptiles lately hes considered digging a bit in his own backyard but he says "my wife would kill me for messing up the grass "
