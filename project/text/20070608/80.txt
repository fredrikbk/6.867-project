also expects to revise his second quarter forecast saying he now thinks the expansion may press ahead at around a clip after coming into the day with a forecast he said that much of the strength during the second quarter will come in trade and inventories key weak spots during the first quarter but not in domestic demand indeed the decline in imports seen in todays report could be a signal

that became a sustained trend slower growth here "would be transmitted to the rest of the world " he said that "the second decline in capital goods exports in the last three months suggests a slowdown in global capital spending may be developing " but others think that the economy will gather itself in coming months mr stanley said that growth is looking much better than it did three months ago and that "a pickup in real consumer spending and a waning of the housing drag in the second half of the year will in our view force the fed to hike rates by late or early " higher rates of course left
