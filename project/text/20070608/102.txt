weekend journal sports by the numbers a king size battle in years basketball fans are likely to look at this years nba finals regardless of who wins as the beginning of the lebron james era but even though this years championship will obviously offer a high profile stage to the man who promises to be the nbas next superstar itll also feature a few of the most underrated figures in nba history the first is tim duncan can a player whos won back to back mvp awards be underrated the stats tell part of the story in player efficiency rating a stat developed by basketball analyst john hollinger players are rated by balancing their positive contributions scoring assists and rebounding against their negative ones turnovers missed shots by this measure mr duncan ranks sixth all time and second among active players trailing only shaquille oneal but the other part of the story is winning championships if the san antonio spurs win mr duncan will have four and hes been pivotal in racking up the three titles he already has under his belt nba history reveals that it almost always takes two great players to win a title between and all but two championship teams had at least one player that made the nbas greatest list and only four other champs the bill walton led trail blazers the and pistons with isiah thomas at the helm and the hakeem olajuwons houston rockets squad had just one all timer in the lineups among recent championship squads the kobe bryant shaquille oneal lakers and dwyane wade shaquille oneal heat would fit in that two superstar mold with the pistons a likely exception during their first championship season the spurs had two stars mr duncan and david robinson but by the year old mr robinson contributed only points per game during the playoffs when the spurs won the title two years ago mr robinson was gone and while current spurs tony parker and manu ginobili have three all star team nods between them theyre hardly all timers the other underrated contributors coach gregg popovich and general manager r c buford if he wins this year mr popovich will trail only three modern legends in total championships phil jackson red auerbach and pat riley furthermore his playoff winning percentage is higher than any coach except mr jackson despite this impressive body of work mr popovich has been named coach of the year only once mr popovich is also unusual in that he served until as the teams general manager but its the current spurs gm the reclusive mr buford who may actually be the most underappreciated of the three he figured out that defense wins titles putting together a team that has been dominant at the opponents end of the floor leading the league in fewest points allowed per possessions in seven of the past nine years building around mr duncan mr buford and mr popovich found complementary players like mr ginobili and mr parker defensive specialist bruce bowen and such former stars as robert horry and michael finley without high draft picks or lucrative trading chips so while mr james may get the most camera time during the finals dont be surprised if mr popovich dominates from the bench while mr duncan with the help of mr bufords role players make the bigger move toward pro basketballs pantheon
