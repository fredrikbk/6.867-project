weekend journal review film la vie en rose is stark passionate edith piaf biopic spot on portrayal a hilarity free oceans thirteen in the spirit of edith piafs signature song i regret nothing about "la vie en rose" not the narrative confusion not the sketchy details not the lack of historical context or the music video editing olivier dahans phantasmagorical biopic gives us a brilliant performance by marion cotillard as the passionate tortured piaf and ms cotillard gives us something new in a show business portrait a sense of what the song does to the singer the process reveals itself early in the time hopping film when piaf stands on stage to sing her imperishable "milord " a mini drama that progresses from jaunty to tender to frightening its clear that the passage of time has already taken a terrible toll frances premiere chanteuse looks empty spent a weary soul waiting for the fix that only music can provide then the orchestra starts to play she opens her mouth and a song she has sung countless times restores her to life as it flows through her flows through her and then out into the auditorium with the intensity of a cyclotron beam anyone who has known piafs voice can recognize it from a single syllable the film sees her passion as the product of a wretched sickly childhood abandoned by her alcoholic parents raised by her grandmother among prostitutes in a brothel from the age of nine she sang songs for sous on the streets of paris when little edith lets loose with "la marseillaise" its enough to send bourgeois passersby to the barricades as a young woman she had unerring taste in music and disastrous taste in men at the age of wracked by illness and addiction she looked like a harridan before turning she was dead "la vie en rose " photographed superbly by tetsuo nagata honors piafs life by refusing to sentimentalize it the film is long and sometimes harrowing but also enthralling and the script declines to bother with such events as world war ii which slips by unnoticed it took me a while to realize this wasnt negligence but a reflection of piafs point of view her life was only about singing and searching for love and always the songs oceans thirteen youve got to hand it to the people who made "oceans thirteen" and youll help hand it to them by buying tickets the director steven soderbergh and his large cheerful cast have managed to make the least possible movie that still resembles a movie as opposed to "oceans twelve " which resembled nothing more than a ramble through european scenery this new one has a plot and as in the original las vegas scenery danny ocean george clooney rusty ryan brad pitt and their cohorts are back in the wests best answer to abu dhabi because their mentor reuben elliott gould has been cheated out of a partnership in a new hotel called the bank by a ruthless vegas operator named willy bank hes played by al pacino to take their revenge oceans crew decides to sabotage the hotels opening and break the banks supposedly impregnable bank in one of films unmerrier pranks carl reiners saul bloom impersonates a food critic cum michelin or mobil style inspector while the real ratings guy suffers insults and discomforts that include swarms of bedbugs its a reworking of the hilarious episode gbp of "fawlty towers " but like all of "oceans thirteen " hilarity free showbusiness the road to broadway there was a time believe it or not when no one outside the movie industry talked about movie budgets the same goes for broadway theater goers didnt know or care how much "the glass menagerie " "death of a salesman" or "the sound of music" cost they cared about the event now everything and everyone on broadway dances to the sound of money producing a musical entails immense risk and producing a straight play entails insane risk what with soul busting budgets tickets at &# plus and a usually ruinous dependence on opening night reviews yet producers continue to produce and performers continue to perform for a variety of reasons that include unquenchable love of the living stage dori berinsteins fine documentary "showbusiness the road to broadway" evokes this love the filmmaker clearly stands on the side of artistic aspiration of hope in the face of preposterous odds yet she is equally clear about the impediments to success as she tracks four entries in one of broadways recent destructo derby seasons the season is that of the entries are "taboo " the musical by and about boy george that rosie odonnell produced at huge personal expense and with epic backstage turbulence "avenue q " a quirky little show with grown up puppets and a spiritual debt to "sesame street" "caroline or change " the tony kushner play with a bravura performance by tonya pinkins and "wicked " a &# million musical about the wicked witch of the west from "the wizard of oz " with cameras rolling behind the scenes of all four productions "showbusiness" tracks the eventual winners and losers the spectacle can be chilling so many pitfalls plus some pratfalls plus a ghastly gaggle of theater critics speculating with unseemly glee about which shows will fail or prevail and a film that properly decries broadways make or break structure buys into the drama of the tony awards by which broadway shows live or die along the way though dori berinsteins cameras catch gallant theater people doing what theyve done since sophocles was a pup rehearsing revising worrying learning stretching struggling to bump things up from good to wonderful and constantly fervently hoping dvd tip edith piafs voice was inimitable and "la vie en rose" wisely uses it instead of trying to imitate it the same strategy was followed in "the jolson story " but not in "lady sings the blues" a purported biography of billie holiday who was piafs contemporary starring diana ross the film directed by sidney j furie misrepresents billies life while diana ross misrepresents her voice but with her own bedazzlement which is why the movie has so many loyal fans
