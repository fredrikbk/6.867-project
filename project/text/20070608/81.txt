the daily fix lebron falters in finals debut while spurs old hands step up online edition lebron james made his nba finals debut last night but tim duncan and tony parker stole the show the san antonio spurs teammates combined for points rebounds eight assists four steals and five blocks while shooting mr james meanwhile hit just four of shots and committed six turnovers as his cleveland cavaliers lost game of the finals mr james is and attempting to lead an uneven cleveland team to a championship mr parker was barely the first time he played in the finals helping a more talented spurs team featuring mr duncan to the title "the transformation from being a nice complementary piece to becoming integral has come full circle " john p lopez writes of mr parker in the houston chronicle "in duncan barely knew the athletic french guard to the point that both admit they hardly spoke off the court now the two are close friends off the floor to the point that the only place they do not talk now in fact is on the floor they have that special rapport an unspoken relationship a wink a raised eyebrow " mr james meanwhile was foiled by the leagues best defense which spoke to him not with a wink but with raised elbows and a stifling scheme "the spurs put bruce bowen their best defender on james and played what amounted to a zone with everyone else " bill livingston writes in the cleveland plain dealer "it is called a box and one a junk defense out of the days when the opponents for james were wrestling with how a bill becomes a law in high school civics class but this junk defense was recycled through duncan who has long arms keen reflexes and a deep aversion to foolish fouls " the fix will ignore the ample coverage today bemoaning mr jamess flop his conference finals debut a couple of weeks ago wasnt so memorable either and it sparked criticism of his decision to pass instead of taking a last second shot then the cavs won the last four to defeat the detroit pistons including a game you might remember san antonio express news columnist buck harvey has a nice handle on the flip flopping sports commentariat "days after the american media tried to figure out if the global icon had played the best game in playoff history now they will try to figure out if this was the worst by a great player since dirk nowitzki was last seen in public " major league baseball tried to spice up yesterdays draft by televising it and adopting some of the conventions that have made the nba and nfl drafts broadcast success stories such as announcing teams are on the clock and having the commissioner read the picks tampa tribune columnist joey johnston attended the proceedings in lake buena vista and was astounded to find actual "draftniks" for the tampa bay devil rays who used the no pick on pitcher david price "several hundred fans were in the stands at the milk house normally a basketball arena and some were curiosity seekers who happened upon the proceedings by accident " mr johnston writes "but the rays were well represented " the mlb draft is a long way from mainstream appeal though about as far as most drafted players are from both name recognition and from a berth on their new big league clubs "darryl strawberry the no overall pick in by the new york mets was in class at crenshaw high in los angeles" when he learned of his selection mr johnston writes " the principal came to get me and took me to the office strawberry said i was thinking "what kind of trouble am i in " but it was good news after all the initial excitement wore off it was back to reality the minor leagues " after the excitement of the draft wore off it was back to the reality that the baseball season is under way the other leagues generate attention and false hope by drafting in the offseason when any minor team news can be inflated perhaps its the nationals record that makes washington post columnist thomas boswell skeptical of the local clubs spin about the draft "every team falls in love with its own picks and thinks its rankings are smarter than anybody elses " mr boswell writes "but by nightfall the nats front office practically needed sedation " mr boswell adds "a more candid view of the draft would probably rank it right next to the ring toss and three card monte as a con job it looks easy but in reality its brutally hard one fact sums it up since only three of the sports no overall draft picks are currently worthy of cooperstown griffey chipper jones and alex rodriguez roughly half of all no overall picks were close to worthless " miami dolphins players are publicly fretting that their teams first round pick in aprils nfl draft ted ginn jr may be a bust sports illustrateds mike silver on the receiving end of some candid skepticism writes of new coach cam cameron and general manager randy mueller "by picking ginn so high when most teams had him ranked far less favorably the two men riled a fan base that was inclined after nick saban had lied his way out of dodge to give the new regime the benefit of the doubt that all disappeared a half hour after the ginn pick when cameron entered the bubble and basically got booed off the stage " the power of the free market isnt forcing los angeles teams to shape up or cut prices "p t barnum should have owned a team in this town " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "its general manager could have been fagan its nickname could have been the grifters only in los angeles can major professional sports teams have awful seasons and hopeless futures and still raise ticket prices only in los angeles will the fans whine and gripe then secretly hope the guy sitting in front of them will give up his seats so they can sit closer " booted from the england national team then brought back for a euro cup qualifier against estonia david beckham shined with two assists "the great tragedy of beckhams life is that he is only a multimillionaire " simon barnes writes in the times of london "that was only ever the second of his professional ambitions his first was to be the best footballer in the world and here he has fallen short he got respectably close but not close enough above all he never led his country to glory like pele beckenbauer maradona zidane he was never in that class but beckham is in the highest class when it comes to dealing with rejection with disappointment with vilification it is not too much to say that rejection and disappointment have shaped his life certainly they have brought out the best in him " lamentably institutions often act as if they are prisoners to their own rulebooks when in fact they have the power of better judgment the nba claimed to be bound by its own rules when suspending two phoenix suns players on dubious grounds on a smaller stage the connecticut interscholastic athletic conference has twice recently disqualified teen aged athletes for forgivable offenses before thinking better of it windham high senior amanda nappi let slip a profanity indicating general disgust at her own performance in the javelin toss at a recent meet the judge heard it and ms nappi got suspended " and so once again a young person has fallen victim to another rules are rules are rules worm whose black and white world has no room for words such as flagrance or intent " mike dimauro writes in the day of new london "amanda nappi received the same suspension for a slip of the tongue as she would have for telling the judge he was full of the word in question and showing the judge a particular finger " hartford courant columnist jeff jacobs criticizes the nappi decision and another recent one worthy of the no fun league stripping a boys sprint relay team of a title because their spandex didnt match "when the punishment doesnt fit the crime ultimately it is the punishers who must look within themselves and examine what the hell oops dont want to be banned from ciac events what the heck theyre doing " mr jacobs writes found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily
