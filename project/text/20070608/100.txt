weekend journal review telvision unsettled spirits hbos new drama "john from cincinnati" is an unsettling mix of the possibly sacred and the profoundly profane sunday p m et after the "sopranos" finale its set in a coastal california town whose most famous residents are the yosts a three generational family of surfers who are going through mostly self inflicted hell into their midst comes the john of the title the actor who plays him austin nichols looks like a young chris isaak the surfing rock musician but any similarity between john and a real human being stops there although he walks and talks most of his conversation consists of repeating back to others what he has heard them say forget cincinnati obviously not his city of origin what galaxy is he from or maybe home is even farther away hes given to occasional utterances like "the end is near " and "feel god " and at one point he causes some of the townspeople to experience a burning sensation when a surfer girl complains that this made her body piercings feel like they were in a furnace john explains "they were in a furnace thats what its like " all the inmates viewers may get their very own taste of hell throughout the first episode which is something like being confined by mistake to a mental institution in a "snake pit" scenario where all the inmates are screaming obscenities and bouncing off the proverbial walls this includes brooding grandpa mitch yost bruce greenwood a surfing legend whos always in a bad mood since his career was cut short by a knee injury tormented grandma yost rebecca de mornay who goes wacko in a supermarket and their son butchie brian van holt a surf champion turned heroin addict who thrashes in a perpetual rage around his ratty hotel room the only sane one of the bunch seems to be butchies year old son shaun greyson fletcher a laid back rising star on the surfing scene revolving around the yosts is a constellation of other characters including the sinister promoter linc played soothingly compared to many in the cast by luke perry of "" fame the eccentric ex cop bill ed oneill with his beloved bird zippy and a dippy lawyer willie garson also in the mix are some bumbling drug dealers and a doctor who sees miracles when everybody around him is too busy being nuts or talking about their bowels to pay attention to the otherworldly goings on mitch for instance has begun levitating a few inches off the ground and a kiss from zippys beak brings back the near dead in the three episodes hbo made available to reviewers however the only moment of transcendence for the viewer occurs when some of the characters take to the sea on their boards and ride the waves in an "endless summer" moment that comes as a blessed relief after the inexplicable chaos of what precedes it and is over too soon with the belmont stakes almost upon us tis the season for movies about outstanding thoroughbreds even if in both cases this week the stories have a heart wrenching ending first up is hbos "barbaro " a documentary about last years kentucky derby winner who suffered a terrible leg injury at the preakness and the eight month struggle to save his life today p m saturday a m and many other times on various hbo channels check local listings then theres abcs "ruffian" saturday p m a movie about the filly whose beauty and speed broke records from until her career too was cut short by a leg injury sam shepard plays trainer frank whitely but the shining star is ruffian herself the only thoroughbred ever accorded the honor of a burial at belmont shes played by another horse here of course but old footage at the movies end of the real ruffian in all her glory could make you sob for what might have been in the press release for "state legislature" a german film critic rhapsodizes that this frederick wiseman documentary about the idaho state legislature offers "mind boggling insights into the machinery of american democracy " pbs wednesday p m but check local listings i wouldnt go that far although this fly on the wall glimpse into a year in the life of law making does have its moments idaho is a state of "citizen legislators " a senator points out meaning that during the nine months when the legislature is not in session its members are living and working like ordinary folk and experiencing for better or worse the results of the laws they have passed or failed to its also notable that during debates on various proposed bills one hears more than in some other states or in washington from lawmakers determined to protect individual freedom not everything is as contentious as the argument here over compelling parents to send their kids to kindergarten however even in idaho you get the sense that most everyone will be happy to give government the power to prosecute "upskirters" who position tiny phone cameras and the like under ladies dresses on the streets of boise along with universally familiar issues such as proposed smoking bans lawmakers also take up questions such as whether to help track mad cow disease by requiring farmers to brand imported cattle on the hip with a letter for their country of origin compared to todays staged "reality" shows this trademark style wiseman film is as real as it gets except that its subjects are aware that the camera is on which is perhaps why we dont see any horse trading of the "ill vote against my better instincts and support your bill if youll do the same for mine " kind "napoleon dynamite" country this may be but is it possible that these citizen legislators can resist the temptation to practice politics as usual oh happy thought
