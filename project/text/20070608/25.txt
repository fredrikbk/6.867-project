forty years after six day war obdurate hatred of israel persists in regard to bret stephenss june global view column "no pyrrhic victory" without a victory in the six day war israel simply would not be there the cheering crowds of cairo and damascus would have fulfilled nassers dream of wiping out all the jews of the holy land tragically years on attitudes have not changed much while there is a cold peace with jordan and egypt there is precious little acceptance of israel as a permanent entity across the arab world hamas hezbollah and ahmadinejad are openly sworn to israels destruction the government controlled media and schools in egypt and elsewhere create a climate for future wars the hatred inculcated against the west and israel has invariably spilled into attacks on fellow arabs and muslims stifling development in the arab world the core issue in the middle east remains indoctrination most arabs do not know that millions of israelis are descendants of jewish refugees from arab lands most do not know that there were as many such jewish refugees as arab refugees caused by the arab initiated wars until the arab world starts educating for peace and starts accepting responsibility just as israel has begun to do there is no hope of peace doron lubinsky atlanta im glad that mr stephens is reminding the world that the palestinians attacked israel repeatedly before the "six day war " i graduated from high school in and i remember the decade preceding the war recalling my horror at the repeated attacks not just on adult civilians but specifically targeting young children nowadays the media story is that attacks on israeli civilians are the direct result of the "occupation " thats a nice myth refuted by the fact that similar attacks were common before there was an occupation the current conflict is intractable the condition of both palestinians and israelis is tragic the prospects are grim but lets not pretend that none of this would be happening if only israel had not defended itself in or had handed back the ground all around it from which attacks had been mounted for nearly years and from which attacks would have continued without interruption in the years since sue abercrombie portland maine mr stephens argues that one could have known as of sept that the policy of appeasement brought war to europe but that it is a mistake to term the israeli victory of years ago as pyrhhic that determination surely lies in the future mr stephens contends that israel safe in the protection of its alliance with the u s can retain portions of the west bank and perhaps the golan heights the squandering of hundreds of millions of american taxpayer dollars on military adventures in the middle east in an effort to enable israel to retain some of its gains from the six day war cannot address the inexorable problem posed by high birth rates for muslim women in gaza the west bank and in israel proper inside the green line surely the only true security for the citizens and other residents of israel is that arising from the economic security of the citizens and other residents of the west bank and gaza king abdullah of saudi arabia has put his prestige on the line offering to guarantee israeli security if israel withdraws from the west bank and the golan heights spurning this offer could well risk creating the pyrrhic victory mr stephens contends did not result from the war years ago james canning seattle
