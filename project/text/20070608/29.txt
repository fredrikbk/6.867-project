for fans of european beer imports a dry spell at rosie mccanns irish pub &amp restaurant an upscale tavern in san jose calif patrons frequently request stella artois a belgian lager whose origins go back to the th century but for nearly all of last month the stella tap was dry "people were frustrated " says bartender fee bakhtiar "wed say oops were out theres a nationwide shortage it was embarrassing " at the start of prime beer selling season bars and retailers are facing low inventories of stella one of the nations fastest growing imports as well as bass becks and other european beers made by inbev sa the worlds largest brewer based in leuven belgium the reason anheuser busch cos has run into distribution problems since becoming the exclusive u s importer of of inbevs european brands in february at the root of the supply problem are the complicated rules of the u s beer business under a u s law dating to the end of prohibition in the s brewers generally must sell their beers through wholesalers who distribute to bars restaurants and retailers anheuser a giant that had net sales after excise taxes of &# billion and nearly half of the u s beer market is known for its vast network of distributors many working exclusively for anheuser this was attractive to inbev which previously imported its european beers into the u s under a unit called inbev usa anheuser busch and inbev havent revealed financial terms of their relationship although anheuser acquired the right to import inbev beers which companies would distribute them in the u s remained to be nailed down previously few of anheusers wholesalers handled beers made by inbev now in many states distributors who work for anheuser have a legal right to take on distribution of inbev beers but that typically means paying the previous distributor for the contract these transitions have played a part in disrupting deliveries of inbev beers some wholesalers preparing to sell their contracts curtailed orders for inbev beers while new distributors had to wait to place orders inbev chief executive carlos brito told analysts last month theres "also lead time involved in shipping product across the ocean " he added an inbev spokeswoman said yesterday that the company is "resolving this short term issue to ensure we can meet the very high consumer demand " and expects "conditions to improve " anheuser and inbev are working closely "to accelerate deliveries" to the u s "and have taken multiple steps to relieve the delays as quickly as possible " dave peacock anheusers vice president of business operations said yesterday in a number of cases anheuser has filed lawsuits against distributors reluctant to give up the highly profitable class of beers several cases are still pending however more than of the inbev beer imported to the u s is now distributed by wholesalers who also handle other anheuser products better than the brewer expected at this point mr peacock said however much of the remaining inbev beer is distributed by wholesalers that also handle beers from miller brewing co and molson coors brewing co fierce rivals of anheuser the inbev deal is key for st louis based anheuser because the companys domestic beer business is growing slowly and imports are hot in a time of increased wealth and brand awareness many american beer drinkers are showing a willingness to pay more for flavor or the cachet of a foreign brand led by corona extra and heineken imports accounted for of the u s beer market last year up from in according to adams beverage group a market research and publishing firm in norwalk conn while many european beer drinkers consider stella artois a standard brew its popularity in the u s is rising especially on the east and west coasts the brand typically selling for &# to &# more than domestic six packs in stores and about &# more per draft pour in bars jumped to in the highly fragmented u s imports market last year up from in according to beer marketers insights newsletter the shortages of stella and other inbev brands are frustrating anheusers distributors though on the whole they are happy to see the company make an imports deal with inbev as domestic beers including anheusers budweiser have lost market share inbevs labatt blue made in canada and the companys best seller in the u s isnt included in the anheuser agreement "theres nothing worse than an empty tap handle " says fred dana owner of dana distributing inc a goshen n y wholesaler for anheuser products "if the shortages continue were going to lose accounts " mr dana who distributes beer in three new york counties says he has been having a hard time getting his hands on stella and other inbev beers since march when he bought the wholesale contract from a rival for a price in the millions of dollars hes angry because he paid a premium based on the high rates of growth of stella and certain other beers "now we dont have the product to recoup our investment " he says donnie kruse co owner of bbs a brasserie style chicago bar known for serving inbev beers stella hoegaarden and leffe on wednesday learned that his distributor is out of stella his top seller mr kruse worries his five remaining kegs of stella will run out by the end of the weekend and that he might have to offer it in bottles "i only like stella on draft " says kelly arst a year old advertising executive who stopped by bbs for a stella the same night if its unavailable she says she prefers another brand on draft to a bottle another chicago bar the pepper canister has experienced routine shortages of inbevs hoegaarden a belgian wheat beer because of that last month the bar switched to blue moon a molson coors brand "we couldnt afford to be out of one of our draft beers we only have eight taps " explains bartender rebecca martin "were coming into summertime and we needed a weissbier on tap "
