ideas &amp innovators looking past corn in quest for ethanol scientist nancy ho helped lead way to a breakthrough when nancy ho was growing up near nanjing china with her sister some of her neighbors didnt think education was as important for girls as it was for boys but things were different in her household "my parents not only were very supportive for their childrens education but also were very serious about our education " she says dr ho years old has put her schooling to good use shortly before the communist takeover of china in her family moved to taiwan where she enrolled in college she later relocated to the u s and earned a ph d in molecular biology from purdue university she now heads the molecular genetics group at purdues laboratory of renewable resources engineering lorre where her research has focused on innovative ways to produce ethanol once obscure her area of expertise is now on the national agenda leading democratic and republican presidential candidates and president bush have backed increased use of ethanol dr hos research will likely play a role in any future increase ethanol is typically produced from corn dr ho thought there had to be a better way to generate it without relying on edible crops she and her team at purdue developed a kind of yeast that can convert waste plant material such as wood chips or straw into whats known as cellulosic ethanol which is identical to ethanol except for its source it took more than a decade for dr hos work to produce results in she began to lead a team at purdue seeking to genetically engineer a common type of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce ethanol several other groups around the world were pursuing similar projects it had been thought theoretically possible that saccharomyces cerevisiae could be made to ferment xylose a sugar found in wood straw and other kinds of plant material into ethanol by cloning two genes into the yeast from another strain of yeast and thus changing its properties by the late s however none of the groups including dr hos had succeeded many scientists eventually concluded it was impossible other researchers suggested trying another microorganism like bacteria but dr ho was determined to stick with yeast "its the same kind of yeast thats been used in baking bread and making wine for thousands of years " she says "i thought it was important to use something that had been proven to be safe " dr ho held out hope in dr ho and her team were finally successful she believed that yeast could be made to ferment xylose by cloning into it a third gene the resulting genetically engineered yeast was able to ferment xylose as well as glucose into ethanol allowing it to produce high yields of ethanol from non food items like straw dr ho and her colleagues hold a patent relating to the innovation brent erickson executive vice president at the biotechnology industry organization a trade group says a number of researchers are working on developing microorganisms that can ferment ethanol and dr hos research was a "big breakthrough" for the field "the ability to make ethanol not just from corn but also from cellulosic agricultural residues is critical to reducing our dependence on foreign sources of petroleum " says mr erickson the work dr ho helped pioneer is having an impact beyond the lab in iogen corp a closely held canadian biotechnology firm announced that it had licensed technology developed by dr hos team to help produce cellulosic ethanol for commercial use the company currently uses the technology to generate cellulosic ethanol at its demonstration facility in ottawa canada using straw residue from farms colleagues say dr ho has high standards and sharp focus "i usually critically review my approaches and make sure that i have not overlooked anything " she says "even during the process of carrying out the approaches based on my ideas i continue to question myself " she also drew on her experiences growing up "i give my parents a lot of credit " dr ho says "they never showed any signs they were displeased they had only girls i think this gave me a freedom in my thinking of not saying i can not do this i can not do that thats the freedom i feel in my mind " early this year dr ho was invited to sit in the first ladys box during the state of the union address "dr ho is clearly a visionary researcher " said a white house spokeswoman explaining dr hos inclusion today dr ho says one of her biggest hurdles is making cellulosic ethanol widely available her team is working on developing strains of yeast that they hope will make ethanol with greater speed and bigger yields this year purdue was awarded a &# million grant from the department of energy to help fund her work "i believe most scientific problems could be solved if we press harder " says dr ho
