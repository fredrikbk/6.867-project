on the stump in kansas democrats turn to the right to keep seat freshman rep boyda faces gop onslaught a fight for spots topeka kan freshman rep nancy boyda of kansas recently joined republican lawmakers signing a letter attacking amnesty for illegal immigrants she remains opposed to gun control even in the wake of the virginia tech shootings and she touts her credentials as a decades long republican today the year old ms boyda is a democrat but you often wouldnt know it as she gears up to run for re election in november with republicans aggressively attacking her and two republicans already seeking her seat she is positioning herself as independent she plans to keep the word "democrat" off her yard signs and rejects assistance from the democrats national congressional campaign committee next years battle for congress is well under way even as presidential politics are getting most of the attention ms boydas success will help determine whether the democratic party can keep control of congress and show how firmly it has planted new roots in conservative corners of the country where it made surprising gains last fall places like kansas indiana kentucky and texas in these places the democrats are often barely distinguishable from republicans on many issues such as gun control ms boyda and other candidates won by painting the republicans into a corner and portraying the republican party as the party of corporate interests and the iraq war they hope to win re election the same way rep chris van hollen a maryland democrat overseeing his partys campaign strategy for the house says its fine with him if candidates highlight their independence "they are making it clear that they put the interests of their constituents before the interests of the party " he says ms boydas campaigning style has also drawn attention she focuses on newspaper ads not television travels doggedly around the district and prefers to draw up her own messages rather than relying on a template from party headquarters about democratic freshmen are seeking re election in republican leaning districts republicans could regain control of the house by picking up seats assuming they didnt lose any aware that the benefits of incumbency accumulate over time the republican party is targeting many of these freshmen believing that the presidential election will draw a bigger turnout from core republican voters in recent days the national republican congressional committee paid for radio attacks in the districts of freshmen democrats "these so called conservative democrats have compiled voting records identical to san francisco speaker nancy pelosi due in large part to getting strong armed by the speaker and her lieutenants daily " says a web site of the republican committee which also has started blogs critical of democratic freshmen ms boyda who is targeted by both radio ads and blogs achieved one of the biggest political upsets nationally when she beat five term republican rep jim ryun last november she had fallen short of mr ryun in the previous race in for her first years ms boyda stayed out of politics after studying chemistry at a baptist college in missouri she was a manager at the pharmaceutical company marion merrell dow now absorbed into sanofi aventis sa she raised two children as a divorced mother in a republican leaning suburb of kansas city when the u s invaded iraq in the former registered republican crossed the aisle and joined her new husband steve boyda who for nearly years had been chairman of the democratic party in rural marshall county mr boyda is a lawyer who carved out a lucrative niche suing railroads on behalf of victims of poorly marked crossings ms boydas first challenge of mr ryun in was an expensive failure she hired sutters mill a washington d c consulting firm that she says devoted nearly every campaign dollar to second television messages attacking the republican "the campaign gave voters no sense of who i was " says ms boyda she lost to mr ryun to robert doyle head of the consulting firm praised ms boydas victory and said the race might have "set the table" for her later success following the defeat ms boyda felt called to join the ministry but after talking with her pastor and the methodist bishop of kansas she concluded that god was calling her instead to make another run for congress in she asked her husband to manage her campaign which they ran out of their house he decided to leave "democrat" off all campaign literature "in a state as republican as kansas you dont want to be stereotyped " says mr boyda mr ryun again jumped out to a big lead in a poll a conservative born again christian he once showered glory on his home state by breaking the world record for the mile at age and winning a silver medal in the olympics ms boyda raised less than half as much money as she had in but while mr ryun ran what he acknowledges was a lackluster race ms boyda campaigned zealously driving for hours to meet with as few as people the consultant had argued that "yard signs dont vote " say the boydas they disagreed and in they planted five times as many as they had in ms boyda produced her own television spots which by all accounts looked homemade the campaign made local newspapers its primary mass media vehicle using their home computer the boydas created a page newsletter filled with family photographs and articles outlining the candidates positions then they paid mostly rural newspapers to carry it as an insert in weekday editions to avoid the clutter of sunday papers the cost just &# "anybody who thinks that people dont read newspapers anymore doesnt live in a small town " says mr boyda the inserts prompted howard mossberg and his wife both republicans to vote for ms boyda "the insert was well written and it spoke to us " says dr mossberg a retired dean of the university of kansas pharmacy school in lawrence when ms boyda showed up at small town newspapers to deliver the inserts some papers took the opportunity to interview and publish a story about her "nancy boyda candidate for congress and her husband steve came by the kansas chief on friday afternoon " said an article in the circulation chief in wathena above the article was a large photograph of the boydas the u s struggles in iraq helped tighten the race and in the final week the democratic congressional campaign committee blitzed the local airwaves with anti ryun commercials that followed scripts the committee was using nationally attacking republicans for supporting pay raises for themselves while voting against a proposed combat bonus for u s troops ms boyda pulled out a come from behind victory to ms boyda now contends that the national committees ads hurt her striking a pose as an independent she says shell tell the washington crew to stay out of her race this time "i dont want the dccc running any television advertisements in my district " she says the political struggle in the district over the next year is likely to center on the war in iraq ms boyda has described the invasion of iraq as colossally misguided "diverting resources from afghanistan and invading iraq may be one of the most dangerous decisions this country has ever made " rep boyda said in a speech on the floor of the house this spring at an april meeting with constituents in topeka many raised concerns about the lack of progress in iraq the issue worked against mr ryun in the vote at one point he earned some skepticism in the local media by arguing that violence in iraq showed the u s was succeeding in overhauling the country mr ryun invited president bush and vice president cheney to campaign for him in the last week of the race mr ryun "absolutely pinned his campaign to support for the iraq war and for the bush cheney administration " says dan garrity a lawyer in atchison and lifelong republican who has tended to vote democratic recently "for those of us who opposed the war for those of us who still believe in the republican core values of fiscal responsibility and limited government its pretty hard to sign on with what the republican party stands for today " he says the republican campaign against rep boyda seeks to paint her as a peacenik whose views put national security at risk typically accompanying this argument are photographs of ms boyda participating in organized protests against the iraq war in on the social issues side kansas has long been a battleground for those who want science classes to reflect the view that the universe was designed by a creator also known as "intelligent design " the states board of education has seesawed on the issue over the past decade drawing national attention and sometimes ridicule this year by a to vote it repealed guidelines that questioned evolution a glance at the kansas democratic party shows how divisive these battles have been the states democratic lieutenant governor used to be chairman of the state republican party the attorney general another republican turned democrat won office last year by soundly defeating the republican incumbent who had made national news by providing legal support to movements that oppose abortion and support teaching intelligent design emerson lynn an editor and owner of the iola register who has followed kansas politics for years says mr ryuns "intense focus on moral issues is why we endorsed boyda " mr lynn a republican also made a &# campaign donation to her according to the center for responsive politics unlike ms boyda mr ryun is opposed to federal funding for embryonic stem cell research "his positions reflect the values of the district " a campaign spokesman says yet division within in the state party is reflected in the behind the scenes decision of some republicans to persuade lynn jenkins the moderate on social issues state treasurer to challenge mr ryun for the republican nomination next year rep boyda says she doesnt wear her religion on her sleeve and doesnt believe god ordained her to win just to run she says she believes that inserting religion into government or vice versa hurts both institutions rep boyda is a passionate speaker at times more passionate than precise in a national television appearance in january she said she would support any request from president bush for iraq funding a statement that seemingly contradicted her opposition to the war "i stumbled " rep boyda says of that interview she has faced some bare knuckled attacks as republicans try to undermine her in february press releases from various kansas republicans accused the democratic led congress and rep boyda in particular of eliminating funding for capital expenditures at two military bases in kansas the accusation prompted newspapers across the state to write editorials attacking the democratic led congress often singling out rep boyda for criticism "losing this money would have a dramatic impact not only on the bases at fort riley and fort leavenworth but on the states economy " said a feb editorial in the topeka capital journal in fact the new congress did approve base spending and the kansas forts started receiving it this spring rep boyda won a corrective editorial in the capital journal "turns out those republican charges were wrong not to mention deceptive " said the paper whose editorial board had endorsed mr ryun in a spokesman for the kansas republican party notes that the amount of money headed to the forts is somewhat less than what the republican congress of last year had proposed though never authorized mr ryun is fighting hard to recapture his seat and believes he has a good shot in a district where only of registered voters are democrats in april he disclosed a campaign war chest that was larger than rep boydas "people are stopping me on the street and saying congressman what can i do to help you " says mr ryun the state republican party has vowed to defeat rep boyda and distributed thousands of fliers portraying her as a tax and spend liberal by working hard she has already authored four bills made a trip to iraq and visited her district every weekend except two ms boyda is hoping to follow in the footsteps of rep dennis moore a democrat who has won five consecutive terms in the district adjoining ms boydas a member of a conservative coalition called the blue dog democrats rep moore says he recently complained to president bush about "the debt that were passing on to our grandchildren " on the hustings mr ryun is touting the few occasions when he declined to support the bush administration for instance his vote against the no child left behind act while he still opposes setting a deadline for withdrawal from iraq he says "i have some questions about the war " and taking a page from ms boyda he is calling his effort a "grass roots" campaign
