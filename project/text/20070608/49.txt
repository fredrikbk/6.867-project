market pressures test resilience of buyout boom higher interest rates raise financing costs signs of fatigue appear with interest rates moving higher and the stock market suddenly hitting a losing streak the private equity firms that have been the driving force behind a historic merger boom now face a crucial test higher rates could drive up the costs of the heavy borrowing that big buyers have relied on to finance deals buyout firms and companies are planning to raise more than &# billion via junk bonds and loans in the coming months to fund deals according to data from standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data and lehman brothers that is about enough money to buy all the stock outstanding of wal mart stores inc or citigroup inc two of the largest listed companies and most widely held stocks at the same time an inhospitable stock market could make it trickier for private equity firms to cash out of investments they have already made yesterday the dow jones industrial average fell points the third consecutive day of decline after strong gains earlier in the year more significantly though bonds got hammered with the yields on year treasury notes rising to their highest level in months because all other debt issues are priced off treasurys there is widespread fear that their continued rise would push up borrowing costs across the board deals structured around the availability of cheap easy money including high profile buyouts of chrysler group student lender sallie mae and utility txu corp could suddenly turn more expensive than anticipated ironically it was low rates that initially fueled the boom many investors in recent years have poured ever more cash into buyout firms in search of outsized returns in a world of low yields in turn with bulging coffers those firms have trolled the globe in search of acquisitions borrowing at record low rates to pay for their targets interest rates arent the only drag on the action though some of the pension funds that often invest alongside private equity funds are showing signs of buyout fatigue in addition many takeover targets shareholders are growing more demanding in several recent cases they have won out on demands that private equity firms pay a higher purchase price for their stock the most recent example is biomet inc an indiana based producer of replacement hips knees and shoulders after its shareholders balked at a &# billion takeover offer from four private equity powerhouses blackstone group goldman sachs capital partners kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and tpg the buyout funds yesterday upped their offer by &# million and the company delayed a shareholder vote on the proposed deal adding to the drama blackstone one of the biggest buyout firms plans to list on the new york stock exchange possibly as soon as the end of this month the &# billion issue is sure to be the years most closely watched initial public offering and likely the biggest in the u s approaching just as the stock market may be losing its footing after a strong rally "investors right now cant imagine how the lbo leveraged buyout boom would end " said richard bernstein a merrill lynch stock strategist in a note to clients earlier this week the combination of rising interest rates and a stock market that has grown more expensive in the past few months he said "could do the trick " the buyout boom and the private equity funds behind it have blown through plenty of tests already from worries about the subprime mortgage meltdown to periods of rising interest rates at every turn the firms havent had problems attracting piles of new money indeed many bankers still say they arent worried about raising all the funds needed for deals now on tap private equity funds make acquisitions by borrowing large sums to purchase companies whether public or private hoping to sell them later at a profit these acquisitions have been like rocket fuel for the stock market as rich buyers bid up the shares for listed companies in an effort to take them private and other investors pile in making bets on potential takeover plays many companies also have turned to mimicking buyout fund tactics borrowing money themselves and using it to repurchase their own shares or pay special dividends to shareholders observers warn the stakes for bond and stock investors have never been higher more than &# billion of debt related to buyouts done in the past five years is currently held by investors and banks around the world according to data from standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data "when the music stops it wont be a question of one chair short but of many " says michael ryan a lawyer at cleary gottlieb steen &amp hamilton who leads that firms private equity practice restive stockholders in buyout targets include big mutual funds such as fidelity investments which last month pushed thomas h lee partners lp and bain capital llc to raise their offer for clear channel communications inc hedge funds are also playing an increasing role in pushing buyout shops to pay more for their prey for example in the case of clear channel fidelity was joined by highfields capital management a boston hedge fund in the case of biomet bankers said the big buyout shops could afford to raise the offer price because they still had access to cheap debt to fund their offer the &# billion bid for the company last week was challenged by shareholder advisory firm institutional shareholder services which urged biomet investors to vote against the consortium of firms bidding for the company for weeks the buyers had resisted raising the offer they called the price "full" and dwelled on biomets mounting business problems according to people familiar with the matter but by last sunday they recognized they werent going to get the necessary vote and decided to push up the price from &# a share to &# pension funds meanwhile expect a stream of income from their private equity investments and often recycle that money into new deals but lately the money going into new investments has been about three times greater than the money coming back from dividends sales and new listings in this arena says john coyle head of the financial sponsors group at j p morgan chase "as we reach the halfway point of what has been a very successful year it will be interesting to see if markets become more cautious in order not to jeopardize their returns " he says "nobody wants to risk what so far has been a very good year " moreover some of these pension fund investors say they have reached the limits of how much exposure they are willing to take with any one buyout firm the debt markets are a potentially bigger threat though not clearly an immediate one investors have a huge appetite for corporate debt in part because default rates are historically low and are willing to accept relatively skimpy returns for it in recent weeks the additional interest that even the riskiest corporate bonds pay over treasurys has fallen to a record low this so called spread which is a proxy for investors appetite for risk is currently around percentage points according to merrill lynch data it was at percentage points at the start of this year while in it stood at more than percentage points "for the last three to four years every month every new deal seemingly has been more favorable" to the companies issuing debt in buyouts says jonathan weiss head of the financial sponsors group at wachovia not only have interest rates been low he says but buyout firms have been able to persuade many lenders to drop protections attached to their loans many bankers say they wont have a problem distributing the deluge of debt that is about to hit the market "the market has shown a tremendous ability to absorb debt every time someone sets the bar of what may be too much the deal gets done " says todd kesselman managing director of precision capital an investment advisory firm he adds that most companies issuing debt to fund buyouts are large and well run "and investors seem to find that combination attractive " but worries about inflation could alter the formula because it eats away at bondholders fixed returns they sell when inflation fears set in which in turn pushes up interest rates yields on long term treasury bonds have jumped half a percentage point in the past month a significant move for such a short time frame analysts say the sharp rise in yields could make investors less willing to finance corporate bond deals until the market stabilizes even before the latest rise in treasury yields investors were showing glimpses of heightened sensitivity to what they were buying one example was an effort by tribune co to raise money through bank loans last month it encountered significant resistance from investors who were doubtful of the companys growth prospects in the weakening newspaper business tribune ended up committing to higher interest rates on much of its debt and agreed to pay a chunk of it down much sooner than planned potentially creating problems for itself down the road if investors are more antsy about lending large sums to weaker companies that could prove a challenge for chryslers impending fund raising the ailing auto maker is expected to raise around &# billion through new loans in the next month or two to fund its business under new owner cerberus capital management which is buying an stake in the auto maker from daimler "were concerned about the fact that many companies are now barely generating enough cash to cover their interest payments and have really little room for error " says geoffrey gwin principal of group g capital partners a new york credit hedge fund the commercial real estate market may be a harbinger of tougher conditions to come in the corporate credit arena real estate loans show signs of softening in the wake of blackstones &# billion purchase of equity office properties earlier this year today bankers say blackstone couldnt finance the mammoth deal on the attractive terms it received four months ago "there has been a lot of turbulence in the market for commercial real estate " says joe
