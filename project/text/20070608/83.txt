business day sign up for the e mail here the push to overhaul u s immigration policy an effort co championed by president bush and democratic congressional leaders has failed to make it out of the senate and stands little chance of revival anytime soon the compromise heralded as a breakthrough three weeks ago would have allowed millions of illegal immigrants to stay temporarily if they could pay steep fines and pass a background check put some immigrants on the path to citizenship created a new temporary worker program and made policy less family oriented with greater emphasis on filling jobs for some industries but this alienated some critics on the left and many on the right the senate bill put to a cloture vote last night after days of legislative maneuvering couldnt even muster a majority let alone the votes needed to move it forward all but democrats voted to end debate and they were joined by only seven republicans "we are finished with this for the time being " majority leader harry reid democrat of nevada said adding that the critics of his move to close debate were just stalling since the more than amendments had already been considered and roll call votes held as the new york times reports mr reid said the measure could still return but he gave no timetable for bringing it back and "given the hostile political atmosphere in the house and opposition from conservatives the defeat could prove fatal absent a major commitment by president bush to salvage the initiative " the wall street journal notes conservatives and most republicans in and out of office vigorously opposed the bill and what they considered its "amnesty" for illegal immigrants one opponent republican sen jim demint called the failure "a victory for sanity in our country " another opponent from across the political spectrum sen barbara boxer said she couldnt support a temporary worker program that could exploit immigrants and push down the wages of american workers competing with them as the los angeles times reports mr reid and republican proponents of the bill seemed jointly ready to blame mr bush for its demise with minority whip trent lott suggesting the president concentrate on the group of eight summit because "his comments last week were not helpful " mr bush had strongly criticized republicans who called the bill "amnesty " as the hill points out while the collapse could be seen as a setback for mr bush democratic leaders and the moderate senators from both parties who forged the compromise the washington post calls it a "scathing indictment of the political culture of washington " the defeat "can be laid at the doorstep of opponents on the right and left on congressional leaders who couldnt move their troops and on an increasingly weakened president and his white house team " the post says "but together it added up to another example of a polarized political system in which the center could not hold " ailing bush wraps up a stressful summit president bush missed a good chunk of the g summits closing sessions this morning after falling ill with an unidentified stomach ailment but by the early afternoon after spending the morning cloistered in his room mr bush was feeling well enough to continue white house aide dan bartlett said in his bedroom mr bush was still able to hold a scheduled bilateral meeting with the newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy and at an apparently rapid pace mr bartlett said that during their hour together the pair had substantive talks on iran syria lebanon iraq afghanistan darfur trade and missile defense in addition to any niceties that might have been expressed about mr bushs health by any measure the summit has appeared to be a stressful one though mr bush and his fellow world leaders yesterday appeared to resolve the two biggest points of contention with smiles and avowed cooperation russian president vladimir putin told mr bush he would have no objection to the missile defense systems that has so irked the kremlin if the functions of a radar station planned for the czech republic are instead taken by a russian installation in azerbaijan mr bush didnt immediately reject the idea and the two demonstrated a strong handshake in front of assembled reporters and cameras still experts tell the new york times there are many hurdles to mr putins proposal even if the u s decides to take it seriously including the fact that the azerbaijani radar set up in question is an early warning system that doesnt use the x band radar needed to guide the still experimental antimissile interceptors moreover the wall street journal points out it would leave the u s missile shield dependent on russian operated aging equipment the g leaders also trumpeted their agreement to work together toward the "substantial" reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of halving global emissions by but they left out any mention of concrete limits on emissions or global temperature increases and since european leaders including german host and chancellor angela merkel had insisted on hard targets ahead of the summit it seemed they had done a lot more compromising than mr bush the president if hes feeling well enough will travel to poland this afternoon and then to italy albania and bulgaria but the stress of the trip may not be over the associated press reports that with italian u s relations currently cooling prime minister romano prodi had to ask cabinet members to refrain from joining in public protests against the american leader state disparities raise doubts about education policy fourth graders who passed a reading proficiency test in mississippi or tennessee would be judged far less proficient by tests in massachusetts and south carolina because academic standards differ so drastically from state to state according to a u s education department study reported by the new york times the report offers what the times calls the first "common yardstick" for test results against the gold standard of testing the national assessment of educational progress and as such it gives support to critics of president bushs signature education initiative which requires that all students be proficient in math and reading by but leaves such judgments to the states also of note wall street journal with interest rates moving higher
