brothers in arms sheik backs u s sibling is suspect to clear family name mr shammari fights insurgents for a fee iskandariyah iraq last month rockets hit a u s military base near here wounding several soldiers the americans quickly snatched a local shiite chieftain on suspicion of organizing the attack two weeks later the arrested mans brother had a different encounter with u s troops in exchange for &# sheik munim al shammari promised to raise a tribal force to fight the same militants his brother stands accused of supporting "the militia will be our first enemy " mr shammari dressed in flowing robes and a black and white headdress assured u s officers gathered in a cramped trailer he pleaded for his brothers freedom and hugged an american colonel the shammari case is part of a new thrust in the u s counterinsurgency strategy in iraq cajoling shiite tribal leaders to fight extremists the experiment is modeled on promising efforts in some sunni dominated territory like the onetime insurgency hotbed of anbar province west of baghdad president bush and others have pointed to anbar as a sign of progress in the four year war here mr bush met with several leading sunni sheiks in his surprise visit to anbar last week yesterday one of the men sheik abdul sattar abu reshah was killed by a roadside bomb u s commanders are now trying to export the anbar tactic to shiite and mixed shiite sunni lands where tribal loyalties and sectarian rivalries can be much more difficult to sort out here in babylon province south of baghdad commanders are making deals with these mercurial shiite chieftains and navigating a tangled knot of allegiances and motivations one lesson the americans appear to have learned money talks amid the palm groves and canals of this agricultural area sunni arabs are fighting shiite arabs elements of both branches of islam are also still fighting american troops with u s prodding some sunnis are now fighting other sunnis most recently shiites have turned on other shiites the result is a hazy battlefield of shifting alliances in may u s soldiers killed an armed villager riding a motorbike mistaking him for an anti american insurgent in fact the rider was part of a ragtag militia assembled by a local shiite sheik to fight sunni extremists encroaching from the north the americans apologized for the mistake and signed an alliance with the sheik they confirm "thank god we only lost one person we avoided a big battle " sheik taleb said in his village reception hall one day recently it was a good day for the sheik on a plastic stool in front of him lay &# in several wads held together by yellow rubber bands it was the first payment from the americans as part of a security deal in which the sheik pledged his fighters to battle anti american insurgents the fighters now wear reflective armbands to avoid the fate of their slain comrade word has gotten out here that theres money to be made by pledging allegiance to the americans late last month another shiite sheik arrived on the u s base here and begged for money talking up his own influence in the tribe "my tribe is very obedient " sheik sadiq al ghanimi told capt eric lawless "if i tell them to sleep they sleep if i tell them to wake up they wake up " the sheik asked for agricultural help and for a school and as he put it for a "present from the american people " in return he promised to fight extreme shiite militias "this guy is trying to get anything he can out of me " capt lawless said later the sheik left without a deal capt lawless says a most perplexing alliance here for american commanders involves the two shiite brothers they hail from a sparsely populated area of farmland lakes and canals their father is the grand sheik of a large shiite tribe and a disciple of grand ayatollah ali al sistani iraqs most revered shiite cleric and a voice for moderation munim al shammari helped his father manage the tribe the shammari villages remained relatively peaceful and were rarely patrolled by u s troops that changed on aug when rockets hit a u s base seven miles to the east the americans quickly found the launch site in the shammari area some rockets designed to launch on a timer were propped up on metal racks and failed to launch they were in perfect condition and twice as big as the rockets usually found in iraq their markings which were partially sanded off suggested they were manufactured in iran in u s officers say information from three separate iraqi sources pointed american troops to munims brother as the likely leader of the rocket cell mutab al shammari held the rank of general in the ministry of interior the government department that fields the countrys police force and is widely believed to be infiltrated by shiite extremist militias american soldiers took him away in a night raid at his house a few days after the generals arrest his brother munim went to see col mohammed salman abbas the police chief in the nearby town of musayyib "because we arrested his brother he was ready to do anything for us just to get his brother released " recalls col abbas "he came here because we twisted his arm " col abbas has helped the americans arrest leaders of local shiite militias and he likes to wear a camouflaged baseball hat with the word hunter printed on the front mr al shammari told the colonel that his brother is innocent moreover he cant control everything that goes on in his village "if you tell the americans you are unable to secure your area they will attack your village with artillery " col abbas recalls telling the distressed sheik the americans had already fired on the area damaging some houses so mr al shammari made contact their initial meetings got off to a rocky start u s soldiers walking through his village shot a particularly aggressive dog in the face in late august mr al shammari came to a u s base for talks on how to keep his villages free from militants across the table from him sat u s army lt col robert balcavage commander of the st battalion of the st infantry regiment stationed here "i have all this pressure from my tribe to obtain my brothers freedom " mr al shammari told col balcavage "my tribesmen are sure he didnt do anything against the americans " "right now hes a suspect " col balcavage replied "im not going to make any false promises to you because theres a lot of evidence against him " mr al shammari pointed out that his tribe supported grand ayatollah al sistani and not the younger radical cleric moqtada al sadr the inspiration behind much of anti american shiite extremism mr al shammari then signed a security deal with the americans under its terms he will be held accountable for any attacks launched from his area and the americans will stop firing on his villages he has pledged to have armed guards manning checkpoints in a three month deal worth about &# in the two weeks since the area has been quiet the arrested general is locked up in an american jail near the baghdad airport hes still under investigation and no formal charges have been brought against him back in the trailer and out of mr al shammaris earshot u s officers wondered about his motivations for cooperating with them was he trying to win his brothers freedom could he really not have known who was launching rockets from his village was he in it just for the money "if the mortar attacks shut off i dont really care " says capt lawless
