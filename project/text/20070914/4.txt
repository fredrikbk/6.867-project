agency com searches for answers co founder suh returns as ceo seeking to restore luster to digital pioneer with a name like agency com the interactive ad agency should be one of the pre eminent digital marketing concerns instead the veteran digital agency owned by ad holding giant omnicom group has struggled to cope with a rash of executive departures and major client defections over the past months recently the company has embarked on a turnaround effort in may agency coms co founder chan suh a publishing industry veteran who gave up day to day management and became chairman in returned as chief executive he has brought in a new management team replacing the chiefs of agency coms offices in new york san francisco and chicago as well as hiring new senior creative talent the firm has failed to publicly announce any new business wins since then although existing clients ask com and ebay inc give it favorable reviews the agency com name is seldom heard among pitches for new clients marketing consultants say "advertisers are looking for a sense of momentum " says russel wohlwerth principal at ark advisors a marketing consulting concern "it is one of those great pulses of the health of an agency " mr suh started agency com in the early days of the internet focused on designing web sites for big corporations thats still a big part of agency coms business along with online ad placement but building web sites and placing ads are now low margin businesses offered by a range of companies as a result mr suh is trying to move agency com out of those areas in favor of making the agency an "idea" company that creates marketing strategies for advertising in a number of forms from the web to television says harley manning an analyst with forrester research cambridge mass who recently spoke with mr suh about his direction for the company some observers wonder whether agency com has enough bounce left to muster a rebound "usually you dont bring back the old ceo unless the current ceo is not seen as getting the job done " says mr manning "they are trying to tell a back to the future or revitalization story they have stood the test of time but i wonder if thats enough " agency com declined to comment for this article omnicom referred questions to tbwa worldwide the division to which agency com reports tbwa wrote in a statement "we are extremely pleased with the recent results from agency com they are doing great work for their existing clients and are winning new business which we expect to be announced in the coming weeks " agency coms path shows the difficulties facing big ad holding companies like omnicom the parent of numerous digital and traditional ad agencies in adapting to fast changing areas like digital marketing many of the big ad conglomerates have struggled to decide whether to keep their digital units separate from traditional ones while marketers want ad campaigns with strong digital focus merging digital companies into older agencies can diffuse the web centric culture of the newer businesses agency coms troubles followed omnicoms decision in to align several of its digital units with various of its traditional ad agencies omnicoms organic digital unit was put under the oversight of traditional ad agency bbdo while agency com reports to another omnicom traditional ad agency tbwa worldwide although the operations remain separate while the organic bbdo partnership appears to have gone more smoothly the tbwa agency com alignment triggered some internal tension it led to the departure of agency coms then ceo don scales in early several midlevel executives including the managing partners of the new york and san francisco offices and some creative directors departed as well at least a half dozen major clients also defected including visa miller brewing cnn com and discovery communications "theyve had an enormous amount of upheaval " says sarah fay ceo of both carat and isobar us ad companies owned by aegis group that compete in the same niche as agency com "to survive requires not just having a story of what the company wants to be but why that is a position for the future and is that backed up in reality is the company prepared to invest " one of mr suhs priorities is to bring in new blood he has told people including mr manning that agency com didnt have the right people in place to accomplish its goals mr suh has his work cut out for him recruiting digital talent is difficult at a time when the ad industry is struggling to cope with a dearth of digital marketing expertise to change the mix of the agencys work could mean a loss of revenue while agency com makes the transition as agency com tries to get back on track a new crop of smaller agencies has emerged as the industrys digital darlings these concerns with names like crayon and poke new york are creating marketing campaigns using technologies that didnt exist a decade ago such as web video and virtual worlds meanwhile omnicom is still trying to figure out how best to manage the relationship between its digital and traditional agencies the realignment is still in place mr suh reports to tbwa worldwide president tom carroll the two companies share some clients and are housed in the same building in new york but they have separate offices and computer systems because of client conflicts people familiar with the situation say the bulk of agency coms business is independent of tbwa for instance agency com works with british airways plc while tbwa and its digital arm tequila work together on singapore airlines ltd whether omnicom keeps agency com as a standalone unit is an open question particularly if mr suh cant turn around the business omnicom executives have recently signaled their view that historic distinctions between digital and traditional are no longer appropriate "everything today and everything increasingly in the future is going to have a digital component to it " omnicom ceo john wren told analysts on a recent conference call
