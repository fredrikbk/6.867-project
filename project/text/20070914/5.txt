ann taylors loftier goal a more upscale shopper one block east of new yorks central park a parade of designer boutiques giorgio armani donna karan and ralph lauren among others marches up madison avenue now ann taylor home to sensible business wear for women on that same strip is dressing itself up to catch the eye of the high end shoppers passing by "we know theres a client there who has an appetite for more upscale expensive product " says adrienne lazarus president of the ann taylor brand a division of anntaylor stores corp in some of the top selling ann taylor locations around the country she says "were sitting next to neimans prada gucci " even as chains offering more expensive goods are thriving ann taylor and other midlevel womens apparel retailers have been struggling to grab more affluent working women who arent feeling pinched in the pocketbook the company is introducing a line in its ann taylor stores thats a big step up more expensive than its usual merchandise the line called collection includes about items and its built around the work appropriate suits and dresses that created ann taylors reputation suit jackets will sell for &# to &# and pants for &# to &# collection also includes silk tops for &# to &# &# cashmere sweaters and handbags priced from &# to &# most of the fabrics used in collection such as loro piana cashmere come from italy and some are used in high end designer lines next week anntaylor will put the line in of its top stores in such locations as chicagos michigan avenue and new yorks madison avenue the company says it doesnt plan to roll out the collection at all of its roughly ann taylor stores but the line will be available on its web site in late september or early october the company has reason to think theres a market for the new line ms lazarus says "when we put in even slightly higher priced merchandise" recently at the top stores customers snapped up the items but ann taylor isnt the only specialty retailer trying to make the move j crew group inc began offering higher priced limited edition items about a year and a half ago last fall it gave the merchandise its own name also collection company spokeswoman margot brunelle says j crews collection is a small but popular part of the business thats meant to complement the rest of the product line and collection has been so successful that the goods which include &# jeweled ballet flats and a &# navy cashmere jacket got their own section on the brands web site in the spring the company plans to open a collection store on madison avenue in april coach inc meanwhile has been expanding its line of handbags that cost &# or more the higher priced bags accounted for more than of sales in coachs north american retail stores in the fiscal quarter ended june so far in the companys current fiscal quarter they have provided more than of those sites sales kim roffey a retail strategist with consulting firm kurt salmon associates says specialty retails move higher is "an effort to capture some of that dollar thats going to luxury " but she says its unclear whether moderately priced retailers will persuade their regular customers to trade up amid a difficult economy ms roffey says customers at midlevel stores will probably be willing to spend &# on a special item but if prices soar above &# she says "thats where the middle market consumer really does get nervous " certainly customers arent used to seeing such high prices in ann taylor stores pants normally sell for &# to &# suit jackets are &# to &# and work and cocktail dresses are &# to &# as a result the brand is taking steps to set collection apart the collection products will have their own department with black lacquer hangers and black signs with pale writing sales associates have already been trained to point out collections more expensive fabrics and buttons special linings and stitching inside waistbands and the custom metal tag an "at" inside a circle that dangles from purses purchases will be tucked into a garment bag rather than stuffed in a paper shopping bag one obstacle midlevel retailers face in moving up is that their stores dont have the cachet of designer labels shops katherine martini a year old business school student who wore a suit every day in a previous job says she would be interested in buying higher quality clothes at ann taylor even though she does a lot of her shopping at nordstrom and from an upscale womens clothing line called etcetera thats sold through consultants but ms martini who lives in charlottesville va says she wouldnt want to display an obvious ann taylor logo instead shed want to pass off an expensive purchase as something from a designer brand "i would maybe not want people to know it was from ann taylor " she says many womens retailers have been having a tough time since christmas anntaylor has been hurt by what it sees as a tough economy and at times by drab color choices that customers have shunned same store sales dropped during the companys fiscal second quarter and net income fell last week the company said the trend of its august sales showed improvement though its stores arent attracting as many customers as usual and competitors are slashing prices in and under current chief executive kay krill anntaylor worked to turn around both its ann taylor brand and its loft chain which sells lower priced more casual merchandise as sales began to recover the ann taylor brand added new products such as its celebrations line of wedding and bridesmaid dresses it will introduce a beauty line for the holidays anntaylors move toward higher end merchandise is a variation on the trend of mass retailers borrowing high fashion designers to create a lower priced line for their stores target corp has been very successful in attracting more fashion minded shoppers kohls corp launched its vera wang designed line this week hoping customers will buy trendy items like a &# short sleeved coat with mall traffic down ann taylor may not have as many shoppers passing its windows as it would during a booming economy to draw attention to collection sales associates some of whom sell more than &# million of merchandise a year are calling their best customers the company is also sending out email messages that it hopes will be forwarded by its usual customers to people who arent regular ann taylor shoppers in addition each store selling collection will display some merchandise in its windows to catch the attention of passersby the retailer already knows what missteps are possible when a brand strays from its roots three years ago an effort to upgrade ann taylor merchandise bombed to mark its th anniversary ann taylor had created a high end line that included a dress with a stiff crinoline lining and a &# rabbit fur jacket but customers balked complaining that they didnt know how to mix the trendy pieces with other items in their closets as a result the retailer had to take huge markdowns that ruined its fall season after that debacle a new design and management team studied the results of customer focus groups and unlike the th anniversary line which ms lazarus says "really tried to be something else " collection will focus on classic styles especially work friendly items the goal she says is to create a deluxe version of items ann taylor shoppers traditionally buy when customers walk into the store she says "theyre not going to say what brand is this "
