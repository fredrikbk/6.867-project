china cheers private equity home teams local competition grows for the likes of kkr bad memory of the s china is quietly cultivating a home grown private equity industry that could soon mean fresh competition for high powered foreign investors like tpg carlyle group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co which are going after the countrys prime assets this week chinas securities regulator cleared two of the countrys strongest domestic investment banks china international capital corp and citic securities co to make direct equity investments that approval lifts a ban on private equity style investing by securities firms that had been in place since april they now join bohai industrial investment fund management co which at the end of last year became the first yuan denominated private equity fund in china to adopt the same model as western rivals "all these international funds are pouring into china " says au ngai the year old chief executive of bohai fund "its only reasonable to think that somebody will make the connection and say why couldnt we " private equity firms raise money from large investors to buy up companies aiming to fix them up and eventually sell them again at a profit china "isnt short of capital and it isnt short of deal flows " notes mr au in an interview at the funds office in the northeast port city of tianjin until recently unfavorable tax laws hampered the development of a domestic yuan denominated private equity industry yuan funds had to pay income taxes and their shareholders also paid income tax on their returns that changed june when china established a law allowing for a private equity structure that eliminates the double taxation the management company earns its gains tax free but individuals are still responsible for income taxes chinas financial system remains flush with liquidity despite the global credit crunch brought on by problems in the u s housing market some chinese officials have grown wary of turning over control of state assets to foreigners domestic private equity funds may represent a key tool for the government to counterbalance an influx of foreign capital but turning to local institutions to restructure chinese companies could be hazardous when chinese securities firms made unregulated investments in the late s including private equity type deals beijing dipped into its foreign exchange reserves to bail out many of them and closed others in the past chinese banks and state run investment funds have come under pressure from local government officials to bankroll pet projects that fail to produce healthy investment returns investors such as gao xiqing are well aware of the risk a duke university trained lawyer mr gao manages investments for the countrys &# billion national social security fund which is an investor in bohai "we were concerned that this was very much government controlled " mr gao says "at least for the near term i feel positive very positive about it " mr gao told an investor conference earlier this year for bohai which is owned by bank of china ltd and its investment banking arm an industry veteran like mr au could make a difference in he worked on tpgs landmark purchase of a controlling stake in shenzhen development bank co which remains the only chinese bank controlled by foreigners he remains a director at the chinese bank about a year ago bank of

bohai funds ambitions which are modest by international standards the fund is sitting on a war chest of billion yuan about &# million raised last year from investors including a number of big players with state ties such as china life insurance co the countrys biggest life insurer and china development bank outside of china some private equity deals have unraveled as banks have demanded higher interest rates to finance leveraged buyouts but within china private equity is usually an all cash affair mr au who says chinas economy is "sealed off from the shock" reverberating through global credit markets adds that rising interest rates in china could make direct financing like private equity more attractive than bank borrowing mr au says the fund which will shoot for investments worth more than million yuan is "cranking on deals" and hopes to close its first in the near future the bohai fund founded in part to stimulate economic growth in chinas northeast is required to invest at
