fcc sale rules draw appeal verizon wireless says access requirement exceeds authority verizon wireless appealed the federal communications commissions rules for a coming radio spectrum auction charging the agency with exceeding its authority in requiring carriers to open their networks to any devices and cellphone applications in a filing to the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia the company a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc said the rules are "arbitrary capricious unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law " fcc commissioners decided to attach conditions on a large chunk of the spectrum being sold in a bid to encourage a new entrant into the wireless broadband market wireless providers need radio spectrum so they can deliver voice and data signals over the public airwaves the agencys rules which apply to about one third of the spectrum on the block would require the winning bidder to allow any handset to work on its cellular network and let customers download any software applications to their phones that would be a major change for wireless carriers such as verizon that normally control what phones and applications consumers can use on their networks public interest groups and high tech companies like google inc and ebay inc s internet phone unit skype aggressively pushed the fcc to adopt the conditions legal challenges to fcc rules like the kind verizon is filing are rarely successful according to philip verveer a communications lawyer with the washington d c office of wilkie farr &amp gallagher courts typically presume that the fccs rules are correct he said "i dont know what basis one would have for launching a challenge of this matter " said mr verveer before the fcc finalized the auction rules verizon signaled that it might be willing to accept a requirement that it allow all mobile devices on its network but it wanted to retain the right to screen what applications users can buy and use the fcc went further implementing the condition regarding applications as well which is one reason the final rules werent acceptable to verizon a person familiar with the matter said challenging fcc rules could be a risky tactic for a phone company which has deals with the agency on numerous matters but it could give verizon a leverage point in its private discussions with google which has been shopping plans to offer google powered phones to various cellphone companies including verizon verizon declined to comment beyond its filing a spokesman for the fcc declined to comment on pending litigation
