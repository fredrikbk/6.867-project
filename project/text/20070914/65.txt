north korea and syria a nuclear armed north korea is dangerous enough a north korea that shares its nuclear technology with other bad actors is worse especially if the partner state is known to be cozy with terrorists the potential nexus between wmd and terrorism is the biggest threat to the security of the u s and its allies so reports this week in the new york times and elsewhere that north korea may be cooperating with syria on some sort of nuclear facility are worth taking seriously syria has close ties with iran and provides sanctuary within its borders for hezbollah a group that the national intelligence estimate released in july warns may be prepared to launch terrorist attacks against the u s pyongyang has a long well documented history of sharing missile technology with syria and it is all too believable that sharing nuclear knowhow could be next israel is said to be the primary source of the intelligence on a north korean syrian nuclear connection but neither israel nor the bush administration has commented officially on this or another mysterious event israels flyover and apparent raid last week on targets inside syria given the administrations experience with prewar intelligence on wmd in iraq its understandable that it would want to have solid evidence before going public meanwhile however the six party talks on the dismantling of north koreas nuclear program have picked up steam with pyongyang promising to dismantle its facilities by the end of the year and the u s pledging to consider such goodies as fuel aid and removing north korea from its list of terror sponsoring states u s russian and chinese inspectors turned up at the yongbyon nuclear facility this week if north korea is moving its nuclear facilities to syria or "merely" proliferating it would undermine everything at the heart of that agreement as well as cross a long stated american red line that pyongyang not proliferate even if it is unsure of the full implications of the intelligence the administration has an obligation not to proceed with a nuclear deal until pyongyang and damascus come clean
