president sees enduring role for u s in iraq president bush set the stage for a reduced but continuing u s engagement in iraq opening a debate over whether the u s is making an essentially open ended commitment there in a prime time address from the oval office mr bush endorsed recommendations from his military commanders to begin troop withdrawals from iraq which has been wracked by sectarian and political violence since soon after the u s led invasion in he also opened the door to further reductions next year as security conditions improve bu he said the u s would "begin building" an "enduring" security and political relationship with iraqs government that is likely to extend beyond his term in office as a result the debate of the nations commitment to iraq is likely to continue even after arguments about the current troop surge subside democrats starting with their presidential candidates already are criticizing the prospect in his speech mr bush held out the hope that supporters and opponents of the iraq conflict could agree on his "vision for a reduced american presence " "now because of the measure of success we are seeing in iraq we can begin seeing troops come home " mr bush said "the way forward makes it possible for the first time in years for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together " but the administrations latest plans already were drawing challenges from congressional democrats who said mr bush was essentially repackaging what they called his old discredited strategy "once again the president failed to provide either a plan to successfully end the war or a convincing rationale to continue it " sen jack reed of rhode island a former army ranger said in the democrats response "the president rightfully invoked the valor of our troops in his speech but his plan does not amount to real change " critics suggested the white house was being forced into the withdrawals because the troop rotation calendar already required the military to send personnel home the white house disputed the assertion saying the two werent connected though the president was talking to the nation as well as iraqis and other middle eastern allies his most important audience was much narrower it consisted of moderate congressional republicans particularly a handful in the senate they hold the key to the next phase of debate on iraq which will turn on whether lawmakers can force the president to withdraw troops faster than he proposes or change their mission the political reality is that mr bush needs to hold the support of only senators the number required to sustain a presidential veto of any unwanted mandates to woo them mr bush last night stressed that at least some forces starting with about marines stationed in iraqs anbar province will be coming home almost immediately as recommended this week by gen david petraeus the top u s commander in iraq that will be followed by the return of an army brigade of about before the end of the year the moves answer the call of republican sen john warner of virginia to send some troops home by christmas mr bush also reached out to moderate republicans by insisting that like them the administration now wants an approach in iraq that will have appeal in the political center "whatever political party you belong to whatever your position on iraq we should be able to agree that america has a vital interest in preventing chaos and providing hope in the middle east " he said recent polling including a new wall street journal nbc news poll gave mr bush a bit more support in making that argument reflecting that public support for his policies has edged up in recent weeks the immediate drawdowns will be followed by removal of four more army brigades and two marine battalions by next summer those combat units probably total about personnel withdrawal of support personnel could increase that number to or more although white house officials wouldnt give detailed numbers and its possible that troop levels still could be slightly higher than before the surge following the drawdown the drop of about would bring the personnel level in iraq to about or roughly pre surge levels a senior administration official said the reductions could grow after gen petraeus and ryan crocker the u s ambassador to iraq testify again in march "we expect at that point in march to hear about additional forces coming home " one official said at a press briefing yesterday afternoon "the principle guiding my decisions on troop levels in iraq is return on success " mr bush explained "the more successful we are the more american troops can return home " the white house is being forced to acknowledge less success in achieving political reconciliation in baghdad the latest administration assessment of iraqs progress on political benchmarks expected to be released today will show that compared with the last report in july just one more category reflects satisfactory progress an administration official confirmed the effort to let former members of saddam husseins baath party take part in political life the speech caps an aggressive push by the administration to shore up its troubled war effort on the public relations front back home as well as on the ground in iraq despite skepticism the white house generally has succeeded in recent weeks in defining the surge as a military success that has halted for now a once worrisome spate of defections among republicans one big question remains can mr bush sustain the momentum militarily the u s will be attempting to do a lot with a shrinking force it will continue to protect the population as well as pursue al qaeda while gradually ramping up its training of regular iraqi forces insurgents are sure to continue striking as they did yesterday when they assassinated sheik abdul sattar abu reshah an important tribal leader with whom mr bush met during his recent trip to iraq to highlight progress in anbar province from a political standpoint the president likely will be under heavy and growing pressure from republicans to speed up withdrawals and redeployments giving a message of progress to take to voters in november despite a recent uptick in mr bushs approval rating for his handling of the war according to the wall street journal nbc poll of americans still disapprove down from in july the idea of a long term security arrangement with iraq was already drawing criticism "its clear that president bush intends to drag this process out month after month year after year so that he can hand his iraqi policy off to the next president " said sen edward kennedy of massachusetts on the plus side if mr bush can continue to deliver on reductions in violence and troop withdrawals and make at least some progress toward political reconciliation at the national government level he might be able to build on the public opinion bump that hes already received democrats frustrated in their efforts this summer to pass troop withdrawal timelines already are planning a new round of amendments to defense bills aimed more at redefining the mission yesterday white house aides appeared to be anticipating that saying there would be a gradual shift in mission toward training equipping and overseeing the iraqis again though without timelines even as mr bush sought to highlight the huge advances in anbar province as proof that iraq could be stabilized the president also had to acknowledge a significant setback in sheik sattars assassination outside his home in ramadi the provincial capital of anbar he was killed by a roadside bomb the young sheik who was the first of the tribal leaders in anbar province to cooperate with u s forces to fight al qaeda was the leader of the anbar awakening movement an alliance of clans backing the iraqi government and u s forces it recently was renamed the iraq awakening movement as it spread to other parts of the country its unlikely that his murder will cause the tribes in anbar to stop working with u s forces to drive out the remnants of al qaeda from the province al qaedas brutality over the last three years and adherence to a strict interpretation of koranic law had made it deeply unpopular among most anbaris still the young sheiks death is a big setback for the u s the sheik first reached out to u s troops last fall after al qaeda in iraq extremists killed both his father and his elder brother some u s officials had high hopes that the sheiks charisma could help turn his movement into a forum that could advance national reconciliation throughout iraq over the course of the summer sheik sattar traveled regularly to other sunni arab provinces such as salahaddin diyala and ninewah to try to enlist the help of other tribes in recent months the sheiks tribe which also includes some shiites had started to reach out to other shiite tribes to win their support in battling both shiite and sunni extremists sheik sattar who was a sunni muslim also had shown a willingness to work with prime minister nouri al maliki and his shiite dominated government in baghdad "sheik sattar will be remembered for his commitment to peace and security in anbar " said a statement released by lt gen raymond odierno the top general in the country right now "he had the courage to build unity in the face of relentless violence "
