uaw taps gm as lead negotiator role may put auto maker in better position to forge deal on health care costs general motors corp is in the drivers seat in tackling the core issue of detroits labor negotiations the united auto workers late yesterday chose the no u s auto maker by output as lead negotiator on a new four year contract meanwhile gm rivals ford motor co and chrysler llc agreed with the union to extend indefinitely the current contract which was to expire today gm as lead negotiator didnt receive an extension and has until about midnight today to reach an agreement according to people familiar with the matter at that point it can either ask for an extension or the union could strike a move considered unlikely by industry observers despite being the target of pressure to reach a deal gm won a victory in taking the top role in the talks gm is detroits leading proponent of creating a union controlled trust that would lift much of the burden of retiree benefit obligations from the auto makers books the auto makers are trying to close the labor cost gap between themselves and asian rivals much of which is caused by medical expenses owed to uaw retirees and their families shares of the auto maker surged yesterday to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading after the news that uaw president ron gettelfinger had signaled to his bargaining team that he is open in principle to creating a union controlled benefits trust such a trust known as a veba for voluntary employees beneficiary association would allow gm ford and chrysler to unload billions in retiree health care obligations now gm which has been fund raising for two years in order to restructure health care benefits may be in an ideal position to see its demands for revisions on medical expenses become a reality a person close to the negotiations said gm was picked as the target because the auto maker said more things that mr gettelfinger and the uaw wanted to hear specifically the auto maker addressed the goal of a "steady stream of money to keep a veba solvent " among the fears the uaw had in agreeing to the veba was that the money would eventually run out because of the rapid inflation associated with health care or that the funds investments wouldnt return as much as projected because of the progress on the veba issue the uaw and the auto makers are now beginning to include other issues in the negotiations including wages job security pensions and active employee health care this person said one of managements requests is a shift to a defined contribution health care plan from a defined benefit plan for active workers under a defined contribution plan which is seen as less expensive the company would have more certainty over health care expenses no one is making as big a bet on success as gm which has amassed a considerable pile of liquidity that could be used for purposes ranging from research and development for new vehicles and technologies to share buybacks or special dividends gm has held on to much of its money in an effort to fund an overhaul of health care liability as an important part of its turnaround plan gms obligation adds up to an estimated &# billion of the big threes combined &# billion in liabilities "this is a huge opportunity for general motors " said keybanc capital markets inc auto analyst brett hoselton "they need to do something or they could be waiting a long time to be in this position again i think shareholders will be extremely disappointed if they dont get this deal done " gm has several levers it can pull to forge a creative solution people close to the negotiations say including a pension account overfunded by &# billion for example gm could potentially tap the pension fund which is separate from the health care benefits fund as a way to offset health care benefit cuts that may be needed if a veba is formed said citigroup auto analyst itay michaeli for gm the road to a veba has been a strategically plotted course that gained considerable traction in at that time the company turned up the volume on the need for an overhaul insisting it was unable to indefinitely carry the weight of an annual tab on medical expenses that would reach &# billion in early in the company went public with demands on the uaw for health care cost concessions it eventually won a compromise with the union gaining &# billion in cash savings and a &# billion cut to its long term liabilities for uaw retiree medical expenses it was considered a historic concession on several fronts during those negotiations the uaw suggested gm and the union consider setting up a veba that the union would run according to people familiar with the talks gm declined to pull the trigger because the uaw wasnt willing to give gm a generous enough discount on its liability at the time gm had about &# billion in available liquidity since that time gm has been in fund raising mode making a big divestiture in when it sold of gmac financial for more than &# billion gm followed that up with moves that more directly raised cash including pledging the remaining stake in gmac to obtain a &# billion line of credit and selling its allison transmission unit for &# billion now the auto maker could be in a position to have &# billion in cash at the end of september according to citigroup gm will need the additional &# billion it raised in the past two years and then some to fund the veba the uaw is expected to demand about &# billion from gm in total for the trust and citigroup estimates &# billion will need to come from cash
