alcatel lucents shares sink woes mount paris a revenue warning from alcatel lucent sa the third missed target in nine months signaled growing problems for one of the biggest trans atlantic mergers ever shares in the telecommunications equipment maker dropped nearly raising questions about the future of chief executive patricia russo the stock is down about from its recent high at the beginning of this year the &# billion combination of frances alcatel with new jersey based lucent technologies last december brought together two powers in the business ms russo hoped bulking up would help alcatel lucent cut costs and battle low cost chinese rivals instead alcatel lucent has been falling behind competitors especially in cellphone equipment which accounts for about one third of its revenue as its customers consolidate alcatel lucent has lost some price leverage ms russo said the troubles this quarter stemmed from weak sales to north american wireless customers and dismissed the notion that the merger was to blame "let me be clear this merger makes sense we are absolutely committed to executing on it successfully " she said in an interview "we are doing it in an industry that is not easy and its a large and complex merger " some people in the industry blame poor execution for alcatel lucents troubles the company has been slow to deliver on gear for at&amp t inc s "third generation" high speed cellphone network according to a person familiar with the matter at&amp t is currently the most aggressive spender on wireless equipment in the u s alcatel lucent has been losing share of the project to swedens telefon ab l m ericsson another person familiar with the matter said ms russo denied alcatel lucent is losing market share in north america and said the latest troubles arent "an execution issue " a company spokeswoman declined to comment on alcatel lucents relationship with at&amp t and at&amp t declined to comment alcatel and lucent had long talked about a combination because of their complementary strengths and need to achieve economies of scale alcatel was strong in europe and asia and held an edge in broadband and fixed lines lucent was stronger in sales of cellphone equipment in the u s the merger was also a cultural milestone alcatel is one of the most prominent companies in france and its longtime chief executive serge tchuruk engineered the deal as his swan song lucent was the home of the fabled bell labs originally the research arm of old at&amp t corp which lists achievements such as the development of the microchip mr tchuruk handed the reins of the merged multinational to ms russo a longtime at&amp t and lucent executive in the u s early this decade she left lucent to be chief operating officer at eastman kodak co after challenging lucents growth targets as overly aggressive according to people familiar with the matter she turned out to be right lucent was embroiled in an accounting scandal a new chief executive lured ms russo back to lucent when the merger was announced at a packed news conference in paris last year ms russo dusted off her high school french to greet the crowd and pledged to take language lessons later she said in an interview it wasnt necessary because the combined company derives of its revenue outside of france and uses english as its main language the difficulties started quickly both on the business and cultural fronts french unions complained loudly about job cuts in research and development centers arguing against replacing local jobs with cheaper engineering and technical staff overseas the protests never seriously imperiled the cost cuts from the merger but attracted attention to the company during the french presidential elections ms russo was even summoned to the prime ministers office to discuss the companys future in france according to a government statement in mid july alcatel lucent has been struggling to streamline its product portfolio and cut costs while competing against the chinese companies as well as established giants such as ericsson yesterday alcatel lucent said it still expects to achieve about &# million of cost cuts from the merger this year part of its planned total of &# billion in pretax savings within three years but ms russo said she did not rule out another round of job cuts after the announced in february the company said it now expects revenue growth in to be flat or slightly up at a constant euro dollar exchange rate down from a previous estimate of growth in the mid single digits it also said it expects operating profit in the third quarter to be "around break even " "this has without question been a very difficult year and im disappointed just like everyone else is disappointed " ms russo said while acknowledging that morale at the company has dipped she denied that the problems could endanger her job "i dont think this is an issue with management although some will speculate that " ms russo said equipment vendors in the u s market are facing some troubling trends consolidation in recent years has given the two biggest telecom operators at&amp t and verizon communications inc increased pricing leverage as they purchase gear for high speed internet access and cellphone networks some wireless carriers that are completing one round of investment for mobile internet networks may have a lull in spending before further upgrades analysts say analyst richard windsor of nomura securities said verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications and vodafone group plc and sprint nextel corp have both delayed planned purchases of equipment for certain wireless networks until "alcatel lucents real problem is in wireless infrastructure " mr windsor said verizon and sprint declined to say whether spending on alcatel lucent equipment is down dionne searcey and sara silver contributed to this article
