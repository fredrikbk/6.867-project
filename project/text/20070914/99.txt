weekend journal review film mortensen thrills in rich complex eastern promises banality sinks war epic valley of elah ira and aby is a madcap gem eastern promises" stars viggo mortensen as nikolai luzhin a driver for a russian criminal brotherhood in london his performance is flat out brilliant and this relentlessly dramatic thriller represents a mid life growth spurt for its director david cronenberg over the past quarter century mr cronenberg a specialist in horror sci fi and the bizarre has earned a loyal following with such features as "scanners " "videodrome " "the dead zone " "dead ringers" and "crash " two years ago he reached a wider audience with "a history of violence " in which mr mortensen played a man with a secret life that was exposed for me overexposed in the second half of the story here again his star plays a man with secrets but the deeper mysteries of personality are preserved nikolai is a memorable character in a marvelous film that conjures up a violent world of bottomless evil yet holds out the possibility of doing good the instrument of goodness is anna a midwife at a london hospital shes played with lovely urgency by naomi watts when a desperate teenage russian immigrant dies in childbirth anna whose father was russian is moved to search for any relatives who might take the baby the plot device is straightforward but suspenseful in the hands of steven knight who wrote the superb densely detailed script he also wrote "dirty pretty things " annas quest leads inexorably to londons heart of slavic darkness think "chinatown" with blinis and vodka and to her dangerous involvement with nikolai "im just a driver " he insists though hes clearly something more mr mortensens mercurial portrayal makes it equally plausible that nikolai is a guardian angel with dirty wings or a suave thug with surface sanctity hes definitely a man who meets brutality with brute force and i dont want to play down the intensity of the violence this is not a film for the faint of heart but its a film for those who value rich atmosphere moral complexity and confident technique peter suschitzky did the elegant cinematography and the supporting casts work amounts to a festival of fine acting armin mueller stahls malign crime boss semyon vincent cassel as kirill semyons psycho buffoon son sinead cusacks helen annas mother and jerzy skolimowski a notable filmmaker in his own right as stepan annas uncle in russian prisons a policeman says "a life story is written on a body in tattoos " in "eastern promises " life stories are written on terrified or terrifying faces the brave one jodie foster and terrence howard the co stars of "the brave one " are fine actors too theyve given themselves over with intelligence and passion to a paranoid thriller about urban violence that is shockingly brutal as it intends to be and provocative to say the least in showing how violence can transform its victims yet the drama is repetitive rather than resonant an over calculated under ventilated studio production even paranoid thrillers need to breathe whose plot machinery grinds grim and coarse the ostensible subject is vigilantism ms fosters erica bain is the host of a manhattan public radio show call "street walk " after surviving a ghastly nighttime attack in central park she buys a gun to protect herself and shortly thereafter shoots a low life marauder in self defense soon by degrees erica turns into the embodiment of her fears an avenging vigilante who consciously or not keeps putting herself in harms way so she can shoot her way out of it "the brave one " directed by neil jordan from a patchy script credited to three writers makes psychological sense the subtexts are displaced rage and revenge while raising the question of whether we can truly know ourselves until her fateful night in central park erica would not have believed herself capable of rage let alone murderous violence and the pairing of jodie foster and terrence howard makes dramatic sense her remarkable intensity finds its complement in the combination of earnestness and tough mindedness that he brings to the role of sean mercer the nypd detective on the trail of the killer shes become yet the writing is shallow the long arm of coincidence repeatedly reaches into the frame and mr jordans direction is manipulative as if he isnt sure well grasp the concept of menace whats more the movie ultimately suggests that ericas actions arent vigilantism at all but a kind of modern day jekyll and hydeism thats not just working both sides of the streets as movies like this usually do its slouching off to the dark side in the valley of elah a strange thing happened after seeing and for a while being caught up by paul haggiss "in the valley of elah " the more i thought about it the less i liked what it turned out to be a vague promise unkept the promise implicit but unavoidable was that the film would have something interesting to say about the war in iraq tommy lee jones is hank a veteran of earlier wars whose soldier son has disappeared after returning home from an iraq tour the story begins as a police procedural thwarted in his search for the boy hank was a military policeman the father teams up with a local detective emily charlize theron and the story ends as a police procedural it is merely a murder mystery with a banal explanation a facile and contentious resolution having to do with the crumbling esprit of a rotting corps and the unexceptional message that war takes a terrible toll on young warriors that said mr jones does a good spit and polish version of his patented world weariness while ms theron takes the opposite tack shes full of life and a pleasure to watch not just because of her beauty which she keeps under control but because she is incontestably by now a terrific actress ira and abby the nicest surprise of the week not just nice but amazing is a comedy called "ira and abby " the film was directed by robert cary from a stunningly funny script by jennifer westfeldt who plays abby to chris messinas ira she co wrote and played the title role in "kissing jessica stein " to do rough justice to this special treat in not much space let me first stipulate that it evokes any number of woody allen films thanks to its therapy centric characters and its upper west side milieu but it also evokes the precision and panache of feydeau farces and the giddiness of the classic screwball genre thanks to ira and abbys roundelays of marriage and divorce in a madcap relationship marked by skittering skepticism about the wisdom of marriage and the nature of love the top notch ensemble cast includes fred willard frances conroy robert klein judith light and jason alexander harlan bosmajian did the radiant cinematography who says modest budgets must mean murky images and ray klugas production design makes the movie look like the scintillating bauble that it is dvd tip for an older better version of "in the valley of elah " see "wholl stop the rain" a harrowing but powerful adaptation of robert stones novel "dog soldiers" that was written by judith rascoe and mr stone and directed by karel reisz nick nolte stars commandingly as ray hicks a merchant marine sailor caught up in the drug trade flowing from the vietnam war
