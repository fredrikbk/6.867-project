paddles arent toys recently a respected art collector in portland ore walked into a local gallery the owners greeted her warmly and ushered her to the back room to show off their latest acquisitions after politely declining several works the collector chose a &# porcelain sculpture shaped like a basket and covered in tiny platinum elephants "she has such a great eye for art " gushed the gallerys co owner maryann deffenbaugh the collector dakota king is in a collision of the art boom the wealth boom and the baby einstein approach to parenting galleries and auction houses around the country report that children who arent old enough to drive are building collections that include works by jasper johns andy warhol camille pissarro and rembrandt at sothebys in new york an year old boy with blond ringlets waved a paddle last fall and successfully bid &# for a jeff koons sculpture of a silver gnome some teenagers are flipping art for quick profits a few grade schoolers are even loaning works to major museums including houstons museum of fine arts a coup for a collector of any age the &# billion plus global art market has more than doubled in four years thanks to the growing number of wealthy patrons and an influx of new collectors from russia and asia now children are emerging as one more niche collectors such as bil ehrlich a new york real estate developer and peter brant a los angeles based film producer and magazine publisher pay for their kids to collect works from name brand artists all but the youngest of mr brants nine children collect art other kids receive art allowances a &# cap per piece is typical or buy art with their birthday bar mitzvah or even tooth fairy money dakota king started amassing contemporary art in at age her great grandfather collected old masters and her father internet and software entrepreneur ray king and mother deneen collect minimalists so far dakota says she has focused her piece collection on works featuring animals and "happy colors" such as pink and yellow an early buy hanging above her tea party table is an andy warhol panda from his series on endangered species her dealer spotted it at a gallery in los angeles "panda is darling and chubby and cute and at night he protects me " dakota says some dealers worry about entrusting masterworks to occasionally grubby hands new york dealer sara tecchia says she wont sell to minors "a work of art is a projection of the artists soul " ms tecchia says and she doesnt "want a year old buying it as if it were a videogame " neither does new york dealer rachel lehmann who says she would feel "uncomfortable" selling a piece to a child unless his or her parents supplied art history lessons on the side "part of collecting is experience " ms lehmann says "but how much do you really have at " theres also the risk of damage though dealers admit adults can be clumsy too last year casino developer steve wynn accidentally shoved his elbow through a picasso he owned halting his plan to sell it privately for as much as &# million but there are upsides to mixing kids and fine art families can reap potential tax benefits by putting art in a trust set up for their children the move can sidestep a federal estate tax of up to of the arts value if children had instead inherited it after their parents die there are several disadvantages to trusts if a piece of art is valued at &# million or more parents may be taxed when they move the work into the trust the strategy also could hinder parents from selling or loaning a work still such art trusts are finding fans mr ehrlich the new york developer says he met with a lawyer just this week to set up one for his children "it stops them from precipitously selling everything upon your death " he says and by turning children into art lovers parents hope their own collections will remain intact as their legacy mr ehrlich whose year old son ace is a collector says having his children buy art is a way to encourage them to spend money in lasting ways "we want our kids to feel the same way we do about art but we also want to keep them grounded and thats tricky " he says parents also admit theres a cocktail party cachet to raising a child who can advise guests on buying a basquiat "vanity does come into it " says new york real estate developer aby rosen whose sons are collectors "people never used to show off their boats and cars and houses and art but now we can and thats great its nice to show off that my son likes art " in houston the museum of fine arts is exhibiting asian art collected by year old holland chaney and her parents robert and jereann chaney director peter marzio says holland brought friends and classmates along during the exhibits planning and he hopes her involvement appeals to children attending the show "the art is heavy its not childs play but because hollands parents let her talk about it she has a confidence thats really impressive " mr marzio says "she doesnt look at the floor and shuffle her feet " all this is a departure from a generation ago when hugh hildesley sothebys executive vice president joined the firm in "children were unheard of at sales and we wouldve discouraged their presence " he recalls so far this year mr hildesley says as many as a dozen children at a time have been seen and heard as spectators or bidders at auction previews and sales but children under cant bid without a parent present and no disruptions such as crying are allowed "even if outbid " he adds the same rules apply at christies says general counsel jo laird charlie rosen is an auction regular by he was accustomed to tagging along when his father aby visited art fairs galleries and the studios of artists richard prince and jeff koons charlie and his year old brother gabriel started collecting by asking their parents to buy them graffiti art and anime charlie next decorated his bedroom with airplane drawings by warhol but he wanted more so last november he took a coveted seat beside his father at sothebys glittery evening sale of contemporary art when the koons gnome came up his father let him bid "after he got the koons he was so excited he wanted to bid on everything sometimes just to bid the price up " says mr rosen "i had to calm him down " four years ago at age  brahm wachter took his nearly &# in bar mitzvah money with him to the european fine art fair in the netherlands he told his father george wachter who is director of the old masters department at sothebys in new york that he hoped to buy a warhol but after the first day of shopping brahm concluded all the art on offer was "out of my range " so his dad doubled his money and told him to scour the booths again and thats how brahm bought an "awesome" rembrandt etching of christ in the garden of gethsemane now his collection includes a pissarro sketch of a nude and a picasso lithograph of a matador but brahm says his artistic tastes are still evolving he got a david hockney print of a parrot three years ago but hes decided to sell it at auction this fall for up to &# "i just hate it now " shammiel fleischer amoros a year old new yorker has been collecting art since she was and her mint green bedroom brims with sculptures of miniature trees and playing card sized paintings of dogs birds and rabbits mostly bought from brooklyn n y galleries shammiel says she knows from attending major art fairs with her mother artist grimanesa amoros that vip collectors show up early and buy big but she prefers to buy on the fairs final day and stick to petite pieces "so i dont have to lug it around " she also leverages her kid appeal when negotiating deals at last years scope art fair in the hamptons she spent three days haggling with dealer don carroll before he agreed to knock about &# off a &# plastic sculpture by nao matsumoto of a block of cheese topped by two toy soldiers mr carroll says that bargaining with shammiel then was "pretty awkward at first i mean shes just a little girl " but eventually he relented "on the last day she came up and said im really scared but daddy told me i have to negotiate " mr carroll says "i told her she was already doing a good job " deal done shammiel paid for a portion of the work with money saved from allowances and tooth fairy visits "i wanted that cheese so badly " she says "the soldiers on top made me think dont give up and also dont mess with little people " children tend to focus on art that mirrors their interests which is why animals are a popular theme as are flowers cars graffiti and the cartoon like characters found in works by takashi murakami and yoshimoto nara for the most part young children sidestep art containing nudity extreme violence or irony dealers say a few kids say their parents had censored art choices because they showed "bad words " parents have devised strategies to get their kids interested in art stephanie french a wealth adviser for an investment firm in manhattan initially took her son taylor houghton to galleries that served him sodas or let him play on their computers until he began to enjoy the art instead taylor now decided at age that he wanted to collect art revolving around his favorite food candy with a flexible budget of under &# per piece the pair first bought a trio of "ring pop" photographs by matt gray followed by an al souza collage of overlapping puzzle pieces depicting jellybeans and candy wrappers a year later taylor learned how to "trade up" his souza for a similar piece nearly twice its size by word had spread around the art world that candy art had a new patron and his mother started fielding tips from dealers their latest acquisition and the one he says makes him the hungriest is a &# image of a spanish cathedral painted by vik muniz with chocolate syrup all told taylor and his mom have spent about &# on his art john fornengo president of a commodities firm in chicago teaches his three youngsters about collecting decorative art by taking them to antiques shops a secret weapon he dresses the children in blazers and skirts so shopkeepers treat them with more respect "my kids know their marquetry from their parquetry " he says hicham aboutaam an antiquities dealer in new york started buying his sons greek and roman coins because the boys like the "monsters" such as griffins and chimeras found on the ancient currency soliman aboutaam now and his year old brother alexander have since learned a thing or two about caring for their collection they know to hold their year old coins along the rim "so the front doesnt erase " soliman says dakota king meantime monitors pillow fights during her slumber parties and keeps a shade drawn "so panda warhol wont fade away " and taylor houghton says his friends are often tempted to break into his jan albers wall art which consists of real candy bars lined up behind a piece of plexiglass "i have to remind them the candy was made like eight years ago " he says "nobody likes old candy " kid specific insurance claims for art are rare but insurers swap stories about a child who once practiced karate on an antique chest and another who chipped a painting at auction by running a finger across its surface says leconte moore a managing director and fine arts specialist at new york insurer dewitt stern group theres another risk dealers may need to be wary of selling big ticket pieces to kids because minors can legally void contracts when they come of age typically at placing economic risk on sellers says new york art lawyer thomas danziger parents usually alleviate such concerns by signing the sales agreement themselves twelve year old andrew reed says he never felt any pressure from his parents to collect art but as his mother stefanie who works for an art fair and father evan a wealth adviser filled their miami home with photographs of nudes by thomas ruff and other edgy artists andrew grew up wishing he could live with a painting he personally liked then almost two years ago he saw it in the back of fredric snitzers miami gallery a &# michael vasquez portrait of a "thug" named smurf who has gold teeth and a red bandana and was portrayed flashing a gang sign and a wad of &# bills "wow i really like this painting " he thought "the brushstrokes have a bunch of colors in them and the light is flashing on him " he carried the price list over to his parents and asked if they would make a present of the painting they agreed almost immediately the larger art world zoomed in on the painting as well that same night at the gallery don rubell miamis reigning collector tried to buy the work but was told the painting had just been sold a few months later the museum of contemporary art in north miami wrote "mr andrew reed" asking to exhibit the work unaware its owner was a child at first andrew didnt want to give up his painting but his parents explained how the museum could help the artists career and andrew was pleased when he toured the museum and found a "little sign" beside his vasquez crediting it to his collection mr vasquez says he sometimes wonders how the child is able to relate to the work which is part of a series he painted to honor neighborhood gang members he once looked up to as father figures "its kind of weird but hes a great kid and maybe this is a way to access a lifestyle thats so far away from him " mr vasquez says but kid collectors say most of their friends couldnt care less about the art they are bringing home brahm wachter hasnt told his buddies about his rembrandt because theyre "more into skateboarding " and andrew reed says his playmates dont say much about his prized vasquez "they really like my baseball cards " reading writing and rembrandt some parents have discovered ways to get their children interested in art whether or not they collect here are some tips visit art galleries kids are welcome at most galleries if you want extra inducements call ahead to see if they offer free sodas or art books to rifle through join a museum kids get in free at many museums including the los angeles county museum of art and the museum of modern art in new york offer financial incentives peter brant of los angeles devised a game to teach his nine children about art he held up flashcards of famous works and promised &# to the child who could identify the artist watch a live auction tickets generally arent necessary to simply watch a sale at most auction houses around the country
