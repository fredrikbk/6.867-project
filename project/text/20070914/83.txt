the daily fix trail blazers are left reeling after oden is lost for the year online edition the portland trail blazers took ohio states greg oden with the top pick in the nba draft and then things started going wrong the year old mr oden looked awful in the nba summer league he dropped out of the olympic tryouts citing exhaustion and now mr oden will have microfracture surgery on his right knee hes out for the year and after that who knows microfracture surgery is an uncertain business players such as jason kidd john stockton and amare stoudemire came back but it takes time and players such as allan houston and penny hardaway were never the same for a franchise that drafted sam bowie ahead of michael jordan got stuck with the tag jail blazers and endured a fair amount of second guessing for not taking texass kevin durant its a cruel blow "if theres a positive it is that perhaps the trail blazers again will get a high lottery pick and a shot at talented young wing players expected to be in the draft such as derrick rose o j mayo eric gordon and chase budinger " writes sam smith in the chicago tribune after surveying the supposed curse of bill walton "waltons trail blazers missed the playoffs when he played just games his rookie season but then were able to draft lionel hollins a key player in their title run " espn coms bill simmons always thought portland should have taken mr durant after the draft he kept looking for indications he was right or wrong which leads him to july when he got a long awaited chance to scout messrs durant and oden by watching them in street clothes "when you see basketball players dressed in normal clothes its mesmerizing to watch them walk for two reasons theyre always much bigger in person but they move so effortlessly that its always strangely discombobulating to watch them walk like they belong to another species or something " he writes "for instance we all know one or two exceptionally tall people who dont play sports they always move gingerly and their posture usually isnt that good and everything about them says i wish i wasnt this tall the best athletes in the nba dont carry themselves like this they glide everything moves effortlessly as they walk and its impossible to fully explain unless youve seen it even someone like shaq glides across the room like hes the size of steve nash they dont move like normal tall people " and indeed mr simmons describes mr durant as "looking like he was put on earth to play sports for a living " mr oden that was different terry ryan who built the minnesota twins into an american league powerhouse despite limited financial means is stepping down as general manager after years yielding the job to longtime assistant bill smith "ryan was tired of agents tired of endless obligations tired of meetings and the sense of helplessness he felt when he found contracts and trades impossible to consummate " writes jim souhan in the minneapolis star tribune adding "ryan should be remembered for four division championships in five years for brilliant trades for refusing to leave when the twins faced contraction without ryan and his lieutenants the twins could very well be the pittsburgh pirates or kansas city royals inert rust belt franchises desperate for a winning season not to mention a winning decade " in the st paul pioneer press tom powers praises mr ryans finest hour after the season with the twins targeted for contraction the gm was approached by the toronto blue jays with their future uncertain the twins gave their gm and everybody else in the organization permission to seek new jobs as assistant gm rob antony tells mr powers his boss turned the blue jays down cold "he said weve got people here who dont know whats happening with their jobs and im going to jump off the boat and grab a life raft i cant do that " a year later the twins were in the playoffs the new england patriots cheating ways will cost the team &# and a draft pick or picks next year depending on whether the team makes the playoffs coach bill belichick was fined &# the maximum the nfl allows the general feeling out in columnist land is that mr belichick should have been suspended commissioner roger "goodell should have sat belichick for a game should have flexed like he has with the players and dished out a punishment that would serve as a deterrent " michael wilbon writes in the washington post "this isnt and its disappointing in the context of his get tough commissionership " particularly given the wealth of tales of new england skullduggery and mr goodells warnings that teams had to stop signal stealing "the big problem is that the nfl declared this kind of espionage against the leagues rules and goodell warned teams about it " mr wilbon writes "the patriots had previously been caught doing the same thing to the packers so in essence belichick went right ahead with his video spying he knowingly violated a league rule both in spirit and letter so belichick needed to go down and go down hard " in the boston herald whose reader poll had of respondents calling the penalties either "just right" or "too lenient" karen guregian writes that "the far greater sentence imposed on belichick has been the black mark placed on his legacy fair or not its in the many questions now posed about his integrity the labelling of him as a cheater and the shine thats been taken off the three super bowl titles hes won with the patriots and worse this camera gate scandal not only has left him tarnished and embarrassed but by implication its left his players in a very difficult position now tom brady tedy bruschi larry izzo ty warren kevin faulk mike vrabel et al have to defend what they rightfully earned on the field no coach wants to live with that but thats a punishment he brought on himself thats the ultimate penalty he has to live with " &# and draft picks is a rounding error compared with the penalty paid by formula ones mclaren team for copying secret technical documents belonging to ferrari &# million the team was also stripped of its construction points for the season though drivers will keep their individual points in the belfast telegraph david tremayne examines the scandal from the supposed class war between fia president max mosley and mclaren team principal ron dennis to more basic questions of fairness "stripping mclaren of all of their world championship points is excessively harsh given that the period in which their car may or may not have benefited from the ferrari information effectively ran from march to august " mr tremayne writes "and given that teams habitually copy one another it is common for all of them to employ photographers to take images of rivals cars on the starting grid it is thus very difficult to determine whether developments have arisen because of industrial espionage or due to such diligence " never mind wholl survive the shame bowl between notre dame and michigan what about saturdays
