media is half the battle during his testimony monday u s ambassador to iraq ryan crocker was asked by rep john boozman r ark "can you tell us a little bit about what were trying to do to get the hearts and minds through the media " mr crocker replied "we still have a way to go both in iraq and the region " as chairman of the agency that directs the u s governments international broadcasting effort radio television and the internet i agree in a powerful report on jihadist exploitation of the web daniel kimmage a researcher for radio free europe radio liberty rfe rl quoted a terrorist group saying "media is half the battle " that may be lowballing the situation media is critical were making progress but we have a way to go most americans know little about what we do today in part because a law called the smith mundt act limits our communications at home but some of our institutions such as radio free europe and the voice of america are household names they helped win the cold war and with several new organizations are deeply engaged in the war on terror not through spreading propaganda but by advancing freedom through disseminating news and public affairs programs in a professional accurate way in fact u s international broadcasting the unwieldy name attached to the functions of our agency the broadcasting board of governors or bbg has been thriving in recent years especially in nations crucial to our national security including iraq afghanistan and iran for example when agence france presse reported on the response of the iraqi people to mondays congressional hearings included was a quote from a teacher who was "watching the hearing live on alhurra television at his friends general store in an inner baghdad neighborhood " alhurra is our arabic language satellite television broadcaster which beams programming to countries in the middle east as well as to europe in iraq alone of adults tune in each week to alhurra and radio sawa both broadcasting hours a day before neither of these networks existed radio sawa which took over in where the voice of americas arabic radio broadcasts left off uses an approach that mixes a well researched music format with news and public affairs to appeal to the vast younger audiences in a region where two thirds of the people are under years old alhurra has been running stories that jihadist leaning media like al jazeera often ignore or distort when president bush spoke at the national islamic center in washington alhurra covered it live recently alhurra has reported on freedom of the press in yemen and allegations of torture of suspects by the egyptian police it has also held televised town hall meetings in washington and cairo examining the impact of terrorism throughout the world across the middle east alhurra and radio sawa reach a combined estimated audience of more than million people not bad for broadcasters that have been in business for only a few years theres no doubt that alhurra which started in has had growing pains but its new arabic speaking news director daniel nassif who has a ph d from the university of michigan has raised professional standards and expanded reporting from the region and the u s in addition a separate all news arabic language radio radio free iraq reaches over one fifth of the adults in that country this is dangerous work two of our correspondents in iraq were killed this spring khamail muhsin khalaf and nazar abdulwahid al radhi largely because of their association with the network meanwhile the voice of america with a global audience of million who listen or watch in languages has been broadcasting television programming by satellite six hours a day to iran in the persian language watching our broadcasts is illegal in iran and the people there take great risks to see programs that offer a stark contrast to state run iranian tv in august i was a guest on voas persian language tv show "roundtable with you" a popular call in program there was time for about two dozen calls many of them poignant expressions of a desire for freedom most of the callers also said that they watch and listen to our broadcasts one calling from tehran told me "you tell the truth to the iranian people because you use experts in all fields political military cultural and sociological i need to repeat again that voice of america is the only hope that the iranian people have so please let voice of america go to all the peoples homes " currently one in four iranians tune in to our broadcasts at least once a week iranian authorities know it too otherwise they wouldnt take space in hard line newspapers to try to refute analyses of domestic political developments aired on our persian language radio farda or keep parnaz azima one of its journalists in their country for months as a virtual hostage in afghanistan ashna radio from voa and radio azadi from rfe rl each broadcast hours daily of vital news and information reaching around of this long isolated population voa started tv broadcasts to afghanistan a year ago there is a great deal of good news about u s international broadcasting we are reaching people in their homes and in their languages in iraq and across the region with reliable news and information they are not getting elsewhere as i told those callers from iran last month the day will come when they too will live in freedom until that happens i assured them our broadcasts will be there for them day after day as a source of comfort and hope the same lifeline that served millions in poland bulgaria and other communist countries during the darkest days of the cold war ambassador crocker was right we do have a way to go but thanks to support from president bush and congress and funding from american taxpayers this nonpartisan effort is on the right track producing what i like to call "journalism with purpose" in languages every day in a world in which media is half the battle at least mr glassman is the chairman of the broadcasting board of governors the independent federal agency that overseas all u s government funded non military international broadcasting see related letter "letters to the editor knockdown drag outs help revive broadcasts" wsj sept
