greener postures ges environment push hits business realities ceos quest to reduce emissions irks clients the battle of the bulbs two years ago general electric co chairman jeffrey immelt vowed to make ge a corporate leader in addressing climate change since then mr immelt says hes heard a refrain from some big ge customers "cant you just shut up and sell us stuff that would be a paraphrase maybe with a few blanks in between " customer grumbling isnt the only hurdle facing the effort to bring earth friendly policies to a &# billion a year conglomerate that sells everything from airplane engines to light bulbs some of mr immelts underlings have questioned whether carbon dioxide emissions are a proven cause of climate change and he himself is willing to push ge only so far "i dont want to change the economic flow of the company " mr immelt says so ge continues to sell coal fired steam turbines and is delving deeper into oil and gas production meanwhile its finance unit seeks out coal related investments including power plants which are a leading cause of carbon dioxide emissions in the u s yet these limitations havent stopped ge from making a big marketing to do of its commitment to the environment indeed the primary focus of the conglomerates marketing efforts these days is a &# million a year campaign to publicize its search for "innovative solutions to environmental challenges " ge has dubbed its campaign "ecomagination " and mr immelt calls it a success ge is on track to sell &# billion of its self described environmentally friendly products this year and projects the total will grow more than annually through ge says it reduced its own greenhouse gas emissions by between and even as revenue grew in january mr immelt backed a proposal to cap industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the u s a government imposed cap would likely limit co emissions by big manufacturers and power plants both of which are important ge customers his own lieutenants acknowledge that mr immelt is creating friction "is there a tension there of course there is " says lorraine bolsinger who runs the ecomagination program "this is a big tough issue the whole world is moving in a new direction weve got to try to keep pace " ge is "looking toward the future but they are not yet giving up all of the past " says dan bakal director of electric power programs for ceres a coalition of investors and environmental groups mr immelts environmental outlook was shaped in part by ges long struggle with regulators and advocacy groups over new yorks hudson river where ge had legally discharged toxic polychlorinated biphenyls in the s and s mr immelt also dealt with environmental rules while at ges plastics division in the s and s shortly after taking over as ge chairman in mr immelt agreed with the u s environmental protection agency to develop a cleanup plan for the hudson another big environmental issue arose quickly in religious groups submitted a shareholder proposal asking ge to count its emissions of global warming gases ge opposed the resolution which won a surprisingly strong of shareholder votes the following year mr immelt surprised the shareholder activists by pledging at the annual meeting to count ges global warming emissions mr immelt says several factors contributed to his decision ge had a growing roster of technologies including wind turbines and a fuel efficient airplane engine that could be marketed as environmentally friendly ges factories in places like europe and japan faced limits on their carbon dioxide emissions mr immelt also says a national academy of sciences report had convinced him that global warming was a "technical fact " mr immelt wanted ge to help draft government rules on climate change instead of playing defense as it had with the hudson river "we are much better as a company getting ahead of climate change policy than we are pretending like it doesnt exist " he says mr immelt says global warming isnt a moral issue for him "i never put it in right versus wrong " he says rather he believes that making changes to address potential climate change is a political necessity as ge officials set out to count the companys emissions mr immelt consulted executives who had launched environmental programs including dupont co chairman and ceo charles holliday jr mr holliday whose company had attacked carbon dioxide emissions in the early s advised mr immelt to repair ges old environmental problems and to consult with customers on product ideas to avoid leaping too far ahead "you have to get that balance right " mr holliday says inside ge some of mr immelts top aides cautioned him to move slowly others were skeptical about the science of climate change mr immelt says he initially had few supporters within the company the skeptics included ges lead regulatory lawyer steve ramsey whom mr immelt had put in charge of developing the emissions inventory mr ramsey suggested his staff lawyers read a speech by novelist michael crichton in which the author compared belief in global warming to religious fanaticism a former epa lawyer mr ramsey says "im not a scientist im an english major and a lawyer " nonetheless mr ramsey says it made sense for ge to count its emissions because other companies were doing so and some countries required it "the science didnt make much difference " says mr ramsey who adds that ""we know enough today to act on climate change " counting the emissions was a big challenge for a company with more than facilities in countries one nettlesome question how should ge count emissions from power plants in which its financing arm owned a stake executives from the finance unit argued against counting the emissions according to people familiar with the matter the executives worried that counting the emissions could limit their investments and force them to cut emissions under mr immelts initiative the executives argued that ge shouldnt count these emissions because it didnt operate many of the plants for the moment these executives prevailed ges first official inventory estimated its emissions of global warming gases at million metric tons roughly equal to the emissions from two million cars it did not include emissions from ges power plant investments an unknown but unquestionably significant amount in july mr immelt gathered several dozen utility executives at ges corporate training center in crotonville n y many were big customers of ges energy unit which has annual sales of about &# billion power plants emit about billion tons of carbon dioxide a year roughly one third of the u s total attendees included the ceos of southern co american electric power co duke energy corp and txu corp many of whom mr immelt was meeting for the first time he invited economist jeffrey sachs director of columbia universitys earth institute to discuss climate change and potential regulatory responses the executives peppered mr sachs with questions michael morris recently named aeps chairman and ceo challenged mr sachs on why he was so certain that the climate was changing and asked about opposing science mr sachs said the science appeared compelling mr immelt standing in the rear of the theater style room agreed with mr sachs that the u s government would someday limit carbon dioxide emissions mr immelt advised the ceos that they would be better off if they participated in crafting those rules at the time most utility executives opposed mandatory carbon dioxide limits duke energy chairman and ceo james rogers who backed carbon dioxide limits before the ge meeting says mr immelt was direct "thats a tough thing to do in front of people who are your customers " he says "generally you want to say what your customers want to hear " soon after mr morris proposed building a new coal fired plant using technology that makes it easier to capture and store co he now supports mandatory co limits of course a growing number of industries is now embracing the idea of carbon caps although every wants to be spared the tightest limits mr immelt launched his campaign in may in a speech at george washington university he said ge would "develop and drive the technologies of the future that will protect and clean our environment " mr immelt pledged to double investments in energy efficient technologies to &# billion by and projected &# billion in annual sales of products like solar panels wind turbines and lower emission locomotives ge works with greenorder an environmentally focused marketing consulting firm to "certify" the products environmental benefits then wraps them in its ecomagination label greenorder also advises bps americas unit and office depot inc how much credibility a greenorder certification carries with environmental groups isnt clear many of ges ecomagination products such as fuel efficient aircraft engines locomotives and gas turbines were already on the market or in the lab before the campaign but mr immelt pushes managers to develop others he sped development of a hybrid locomotive for example he also backs investments in projects such as solar energy farms but he stresses that the projects must make economic sense "we invest in the basic strategies that we think are going to fit into the program but make money for our investors at the same time " mr immelt says to cut energy use ge has launched more than "energy hunts " which mr immelt says have saved ge &# million a year at its erie pa locomotive operations ge switched to natural gas fired power from oil saving money and cutting emissions in the manufacture of locomotive engines ge has installed solar panels on many buildings including its headquarters and energy efficient light bulbs in many factories mr immelt says hes so pleased with the results that hes considering tougher targets for product sales and emission reductions ms bolsinger told mr immelt to first hit his original targets mr immelt had tapped her for the ecomagination program in september with instructions to make it "part of the fabric of what we do everyday " the year old biomechanical engineer prods managers to pursue environmentally friendly products ms bolsinger a veteran ge employee who once sold gas turbines was head of marketing at ges aircraft engines when mr immelt told her he was "looking for one part marketer one part salesman and one part technician" to lead the campaign now she finds herself scouting for climate related business opportunities from china to brazil and touring the globe with public events touting ges mission she has regular calls with mr immelt to update him on ecomagination progress still she says business leaders decide how hard to push ecomagination in each unit in some cases thats meant deeper ge ties to coal in september the same month ms bolsinger took her post ges energy financing unit hired a coal industry veteran and said it hoped to finance more coal fired plants "we have targeted coal as a growth area " matthew siegel the units managing director for strategic services said in a statement at the time in ges energy unit agreed to sell &# million in steam turbines to txu which planned to quickly build new coal fired power plants "at the end of the day if customers want to buy supercritical steam turbines ge is going to sell them supercritical steam turbines " ms bolsinger says in january not long after the txu deal mr immelt was among nine ceos to join environmentalists in asking the u s government to limit carbon dioxide emissions mr immelt has since helped recruit several ceos to the group including chevron corp s david oreilly and deere &amp co s robert lane the initiative won mr immelt praise from environmentalists including some old critics environmental defense president fred krupp says the campaign "changed the political landscape" of climate change in the u s others were unhappy soon after mr immelt fielded a call from an angry john wilder txu chairman who was worried about the potential impact of carbon limits on the proposed coal fired plants mr wilder also circulated a letter among utility executives questioning mr immelts position and sent it to ge mr wilder through a spokeswoman called it a "productive phone call" but declined to elaborate mr immelt says "it was a robust conversation " he also declines to elaborate following that exchange txu agreed to be acquired by a consortium of private interests but under pressure from environmentalists the purchasers agreed to cancel or delay eight of the proposed new plants which would have emitted more than million tons of co in may ge issued a new emissions inventory including some from its partially owned power plants the change added roughly million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions bringing ges total to more than million metric tons ge executives say that whether and how to count these emissions is a complex process that is still evolving ge still did not include emissions from other power plants in which it owns a stake but are leased to utilities one such pennsylvania plant homer city owned by ge emits almost million metric tons of co a year more than all of ges industrial operations a ge spokesman says the company is still studying how to count emissions from these plants one issue is ensuring that the emissions are not counted twice by ge and the plants operators if such counts are required now the energy financing group is devising guidelines for investing in coal fired plants to include the potential costs of carbon emissions by the financing group plans to own &# billion in renewable energy assets the business now has about &# billion in total assets most in natural gas and coal fired power plants mr immelt says ge will continue to invest in coal fired plants when the economics make sense "i dont want to say no coal " he says in fact ge is investing millions in developing technology to capture co emissions from coal burning plants likewise the environmental campaign does not dictate how ge treats its diverse set of businesses earlier this year ge was looking to sell a unit that made equipment for generating hydropower which does not emit carbon dioxide soon after it bought vetco gray which makes drilling equipment for oil and gas fields earlier this month ge agreed to acquire another oil and gas equipment maker sondex plc for &# million mr immelt says oil and gas "are going to be big parts of the future world we live in " mr immelts environmental campaign poses new public relations quandaries especially troublesome are proposals in several countries and california to ban incandescent light bulbs the technology that made ge founder thomas edison a household name backers of a ban favor fluorescent lights which use far less energy ge makes fluorescent bulbs but scrambled to protect its much larger incandescent business lobbyists sought to shift the debate to efficiency standards for lighting rather than a bulbs technology ge also announced several years ahead of schedule plans for an advanced incandescent bulb that would use half as much energy but that met with a mixed reaction as some advocates accused ge of trying to thwart a move to fluorescents lloyd alter a columnist at environmental web site treehugger com labeled ges new technology a "vaporbulb" and accused the company of trying to "knock the wind" out of the movement to ban incandescents mr alter later tempered his criticism after meeting with several ge officials the jolt helped prompted ms bolsinger to better coordinate ges business regulatory and eco marketing goals this month she mr ramsey and ges top legislative leaders will begin regular conference calls to discuss hot button environmental issues ms bolsinger says the calls are "long overdue "
