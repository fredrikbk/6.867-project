drug coated stents from j&amp j superior analysis concludes drug coated stents made by johnson &amp johnson have an edge over devices from close rival boston scientific corp according to an article released by the lancet medical journal the analysis pooling data from more than three dozen prior studies and thousands of patients revealed a lower heart attack risk for patients whose arteries were propped open with j&amp js cypher drug coated stent versus patients who received boston scientifics taxus stent or a bare metal device coated stents use medication to combat renarrowing that can lead to repeat stent procedures the study is the first to include all direct and indirect evidence from all randomized controlled studies that pit the stents against each other or against bare metal devices boston scientific disputed the research basing its objections in part on the use of studies in which cypher and taxus stents were matched against different bare metal devices with different performance characteristics this created distortions for the later cypher to taxus comparison according to donald baim boston scientifics chief medical and scientific officer he also noted an array of prior evidence that showed comparable patterns for taxus and cypher stents when it comes to avoiding dangerous problems and the need for retreatment nevertheless the new analysis which also determined that coated and bare metal stents present similar mortality risks concluded that j&amp js coated stents "seem to be clinically better" than taxus or bare metal stents the study was led by doctors at the institute of social and preventative medicine at the university of bern in switzerland an accompanying comment in the lancet from mark webster and john ormiston doctors at the auckland city hospital in new zealand called the analysis "the best current comparison of the two drug eluting stents " christoph stettler one of the studys authors said in an interview via email that "we do expect our findings to have an important impact on clinical practice " he added that more analysis is needed to see if the findings are related to specific subgroups of patients the study was funded by the swiss national science foundation doctors involved in the study have various relationships with a host of device and drug companies drs webster and ormiston have relationships with the companies at issue and competitors the new analysis had a follow up period of as long as four years and included data from trials contributed by stent makers and researchers together they showed that j&amp j stents were associated with a lower heart attack risk than bare metal stents and a lower risk than boston scientific stents there was a substantial margin of error the study concluded that implanting cypher stents instead of taxus in patients would prevent one heart attack over four years taxus stents were also more likely than bare stents or cypher stents in the study to raise the risk of late developing clots there was no increased late clotting risk seen with cypher devices meanwhile although prior studies indicated an elevated risk with both coated stents david kandzari chief medical officer at j&amp js stent making cordis subsidiary wrote in a statement that the "compelling data clearly demonstrate the benefits" of coated stents verses bare metal stents and they provide more clarity on the differences between cypher and taxus safety issues have contributed to substantial sales declines for the boston scientific and j&amp j devices recent declines have also been sparked by a study released this year that questioned whether stents were needed in certain stable patients j&amp js coated stents posted &# million in overall sales in the second quarter down about from a year earlier boston scientifics coated stent sales fell in the quarter to &# million despite the purported cypher benefits in the new analysis the j&amp j device didnt save lives when compared with the other stents according to gregg stone who chairs the cardiovascular research foundation in new york and who conducted the taxus trials for boston scientific the lack of difference in mortality risk is the studys biggest finding keith winstein contributed to this article
