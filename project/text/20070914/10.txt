banks flock to discount window borrowing surge comes as reduction is expected in feds overnight rate borrowing from the federal reserves discount window soared in recent days which some analysts said may have been the result of the feds efforts to restore overnight interest rates to the feds target level discount borrowing under the feds primary credit program for banks surged to more than &# billion outstanding as of wednesday up from about &# billion a week earlier the central bank said yesterday it was the highest level since the day after the sept terrorist attacks in august as liquidity concerns mounted the fed injected money into the nations banking system in a bid to ease problems in some credit markets as a result the federal funds rate the amount banks charge each other on overnight loans regularly fell well below the target rate of the fed also lowered the discount rate the rate at which institutions borrow directly from the central bank by a half percentage point to in a bid to encourage banks to borrow directly from the fed but the fed had little success in spurring discount window borrowing banks typically are reluctant to borrow from the discount window because they view it as a source of funding for distressed institutions in addition they have been able to borrow funds more cheaply from each other at the federal funds rate a two week maintenance period in which banks needed money to meet minimum reserve requirements ended wednesday analysts say tightening by the fed part of recent efforts to get the federal funds rate close to its target led banks to take loans directly from the central banks discount window "if the carrot doesnt work use the stick " said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap "the fed left the system so short of reserves at the end of the maintenance period that the only way the banks could meet reserve requirements was by borrowing" at the discount window the surge in discount borrowing comes ahead of the feds next policy meeting tuesday fed officials are expected to cut the federal funds rate for the first time in four years markets widely expect at least a quarter point cut to though some analysts say a half point cut is possible the smaller cut might have less effect on financial markets because it would simply bring the new target down to where interest rates had been in recent weeks "they have a target and one could reasonably ask whether it makes sense to be that far below target for that long " said peter hooper chief economist at deutsche bank "at the same time its been probably a particularly difficult period during which to hit the target " the fed in its weekly release said average daily borrowing through wednesday rose to &# billion an increase of &# billion from a week earlier
