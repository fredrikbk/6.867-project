weekend journal taste a wrinkle ages gracefully was i the only sixth grader who didnt love "a wrinkle in time" the recent death of madeleine lengle who wrote the newbery medal winner has evinced so many adulatory remembrances from other ex sixth graders that its brought back memories of having felt like an oddball for not warming to the books oddball protagonist meg murry we even shared a first name yet i somehow couldnt work up much affection for ms lengles awkward glasses wearing heroine despite how brave and clever she turned out to be heroines it seemed to me ought to be dashing and pretty and if possible drive roadsters "a wrinkle in time " you may recall tells the story of how meg her brilliant little brother charles wallace and a high school boy named calvin are helped by three magical beings mrs whatsit mrs which and mrs who to rescue megs scientist father from it a pulsing disembodied brain on a distant planet that is in league with a sinister black cloud seeking to devour the universe there are no boarding schools no plucky orphans no princesses certainly no roadsters none of the comforting tropes of childrens fiction yet once youd read it you couldnt rid yourself of it "a wrinkle in time" was like a bit of grit in the oyster a narrative irritant that you kept trying to digest of course i wasnt the only reader to find ms lengles work of science fantasy initially disconcerting famously publishers rebuffed the manuscript before the author found a benefactor in farrar straus &amp giroux in winning the newbery a year later secured the books place in the pantheon of childrens literature and since then innumerable schoolchildren have experienced the dazzling weirdness of a story that starts with quantum physics and ends with a childs love overcoming vast powers of evil "it was simply a book i had to write i had no choice " ms lengle said in her newbery acceptance speech "and it was only after it was written that i realized what some of it meant " coming back to the book years later its striking how true the same process is for the reader a child is inclined to take away very different lessons from a novel than is an adult for one thing "a wrinkle in time" is infused with christian faith to such a degree that were it newly published today it would probably be relegated to the religious section of the bookstore as a heathen child i missed entirely the biblical references the significant mention of jesus and the way a loving gods sovereignty over the universe is understood even as the characters battle an expanding force of pure evil megs father at one point urges her to be courageous in confronting it "we were sent here for something " he tells her echoing romans "and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose " clearly american society wasnt as twitchy about judeo christian content odd years ago in fact over the decades "a wrinkle in time" has been criticized as insufficiently christian a claim that pained its episcopalian author the novel is ranked nd on the american library associations list of the "most frequently challenged" books that agitators seek to ban the complaints will sound familiar to anyone who has overheard the controversy about the harry potter series itself no on the alas list in ms lengles most famous work some have objected to an apparent witch a clairvoyant and the manner in which jesus is referred to as merely one of earths great fighters against darkness not the light in strict religious families these elements may well interfere with childrens religious formation but subversion works both ways for children raised in nonreligious households as i was ms lengles narrative grit could it seems produce years later a kind of pearl re reading the book recently i was amazed at the familiar resonance of the passages whose religious import i had thought eluded me as a child it will be interesting to see whether harry potter leaves a similar spiritual comet trail in the millions of children whove read his story now that with the final book in the series j k rowling has revealed the wizarding world to be unquestionably christian though maybe its not possible to test the long term effects of literature the way you can say fluoride every book is a product of its time and so is the way its read ms lengle wrote "a wrinkle in time" in the depths of the cold war and the horror of totalitarianism is there in her depiction of its planet where megs father is imprisoned in the story the three children arrive on camazotz to see endless rows of identical houses before each of which a small boy stands and bounces a ball in exactly the same rhythm as every other boy but one child keeps getting it wrong and when his ball bounces off into the street hes rushed into the house by his terrified mother some of my friends were convinced that lengles target was conformist suburbia there was a lot of scornful talk of that in but to me megs eventual triumph over it meant that free people would surely someday be able to push back the creeping menace of communism a sixth grader picking up the book today will presumably take away another message altogether like madeleine lengle who was as surprised as anyone at the content of her own novel c s lewis didnt start out to write a christian fable when he began "the lion the witch and the wardrobe " but as he proceeded he explained to a friend he "saw how stories of this kind could steal past a certain inhibition which had paralysed much of my own religion in childhood " not long ago my two eldest children were obliged to read "a wrinkle in time" for school neither liked it much "meg was such a nerd " said my daughter "i didnt get all the tesseract and time travel stuff " complained my son it doesnt matter madeleine lengle may have departed this world but in the children who continue to read her best known novel she keeps depositing those little bits of grit mrs gurdon reviews childrens books for the wall street journal
