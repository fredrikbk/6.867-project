detroit auto makers try some new tricks the big three improve cars but then find it hard to get buyers to notice just about every month cnw market research meets with a group of would be car buyers and plays a trick on them sometimes the company which specializes in auto sales trends takes a toyota camry removes any identifying logos and tells them its a new model from one of the u s based auto makers or it takes a domestic car and tells them its a toyota or another import make either way the result is the same "if they think its an american car the perception of the vehicle falls dramatically " said art spinella vice president of the bandon ore based firm "detroit really gets a bum rap in the u s " those negative impressions are now souring efforts by ford motor co general motors corp and chrysler llc to halt their long slide in u s market share and for these detroit auto makers persuading import buyers to even consider a u s car is becoming the new battleground the issue of public perception is coming into sharper focus now because experts say the big three after years of concentrating on trucks and all but ignoring cars have markedly improved the quality and look of their sedans and compacts so in recent months detroit auto makers have been increasingly willing to experiment with aggressive marketing tactics to trumpet those changes in the most recent example ford was behind a ruse involving about people around the country in the past several weeks in new york miami los angeles and dallas its advertising agency jwt had workers pretend to be from a fake market research firm track down owners of cars made by toyota motor corp honda motor co and other competitors and ask them to drive new ford models for a supposedly impartial weeklong test in taped interviews almost all gushed about the fords they drove jwt is using the comments in fords new "swap your ride" ad campaign at the dallas test or so fake market researchers actually jwt staffers set up operations at a convention center and donned green polo shirts with "in home test drive experience" embroidered in gold outside a small brick building they set up camera teams to interview drivers returning their ford test vehicles inside the account team sat in front of four flat screen monitors watching live interviews and listening for the choicest comments a few came from derek campos a year old student the owner of a nissan sentra said he liked the focuss flashy look and appreciated the synch entertainment system that allowed him to use his cell phone and apple ipod while driving synch uses microsoft corp technology and is making its debut in the focus smiling into the camera he said "im probably going to get a new car soon and ill definitely look at the focus " reached yesterday mr campos was surprised to learn in home test drive experience isnt a real company and was linked to ford "i had no idea " he said he added it doesnt change his high opinion of the focus but that it would be better for the company to be "more straight forward " big three executives acknowledge it will take more than clever advertising to win over significant numbers of "import intenders" the industrys term for people who buy foreign brands without even looking at detroits models ford gm and chryslers combined share of u s light vehicle sales so far this year is down from at the same point in and down from just four years ago inferior cars that detroit churned out in the past are still hurting the industrys image in addition detroit auto makers still tend to push sales using big discounts a tactic that undermines both brand image and the resale value that customers get when they trade in or sell their old car "building a better car and assuming people will buy it doesnt work " gm chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner told reporters at this weeks frankfurt auto show gm he said "can do a better job" marketing its vehicles many in detroit are convinced they can convert import buyers if they can just get them into their vehicles for a test drive for the past couple of years ford gm and chrysler have organized test drive events around the country where hundreds are invited take a spin in their vehicles around a parking lot those events however are expensive and only reach a limited number of consumers more importantly they tend to draw people who are already willing to consider domestic vehicles not the import intenders "were not on a lot of peoples collective radar screens for vehicles beyond trucks and suvs " said barry engle vice president of marketing for the ford division in the auto industry "consideration" is a term that describes the degree to which car buyers look at a model or brand when they shop if a car gets little consideration that means few customers go into dealerships and look into buying the vehicle ford chief executive alan mulally has expressed frustration with fords recent tendency to abandon well known vehicle names and familiar advertising campaigns effectively squandering years of effort to build customer awareness mr mulally said hes lobbying his subordinates to bring back a classic ford advertising line that speaks directly to the issue of consideration "have you driven a ford lately " while the big three still dominate in trucks import loyalists make up more than half of the people who buy cars according to research by j d power &amp associates a market research firm well known for its auto quality studies just under a quarter shop only for domestic cars and consider both imports and domestics said j d power researcher chris denove the main reason import intenders stay away from domestic cars mr denove said is that "todays consumer doesnt yet believe the big three have improved quality to the point where they are on par with the japanese manufacturers " that drives ford gm and chrysler executives crazy independent quality studies show theyve narrowed the gap with toyota just a few weeks ago j d powers long term dependability study reported that gms buick brand had tied toyotas lexus which had stood alone on top for the past years a toyota spokesman acknowledged the quality of detroits vehicles is closer to toyotas but added that toyota continues to improve its quality as well "our problems per vehicle is still going down its continuous improvement " the spokesman said "and thats all good for the consumer " new sedans from detroit auto makers like the fusion and gms saturn aura have won rave reviews in the automotive press often beating out the honda accord and camry in head to head comparisons new detroit crossover wagons such as the gmc acadia and ford edge have gained traction in a segment previously dominated by japanese models the trouble is most of these models are bought by people who are already driving domestic vehicles and only a tiny fraction are sold to people trading in toyotas and hondas according to data from j d power of the cars customers traded in for new chevys this year were gm vehicles the firms trade in research shows the figure for toyota is just gm for its part has been trying to use the well received aura to steal customers from its main foreign rivals this summer in a bid to shake up the market gm put a camry and an accord in each of its saturn dealerships around the country and encouraged car buyers to test drive the vehicles side by side the move had little impact on aura sales and gm has now ended the effort it has also scrapped a plan to have chevy dealers keep camrys and accords on hand to compare against the new malibu sedan that arrives later this year at the frankfurt auto show gm vice chairman bob lutz said his companys own focus groups also find consumers instinctively rate gm vehicles below toyotas or hondas but he said gms scores are getting closer chrysler is also looking for a little more consideration a few weeks ago the company began offering a lifetime warranty on its vehicles engines and transmissions an industry first so far its unclear if it is helping sales but it may be another tactic that import buyers just ignore stan breon a real estate investor in lawrenceville ga who has been driving camrys since said chryslers warranty wouldnt sway him to consider buying one "lifes too short to keep going back to the dealer even if its free " he said corrections &amp amplifications barry engle is general manager of ford division marketing a marketplace article friday incorrectly gave his title as vice president of marketing for the ford
