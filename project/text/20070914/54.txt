is where companies commonly fund their short term capital needs investors have been shifting funds out of the asset backed cp sector over the last month because of fears that this part of the market had been infected by troubled subprime loans however given the short maturities of commercial paper averaging about days much of the holdings perceived to be problematic already have been purged from the system "what people were worried about six weeks ago has worked its way out through this downsizing " with little left outstanding that is backed by subprime home loans said deborah cunningham chief investment officer at federated investors in pittsburgh "what they own now like credit card and auto receivables seem to be performing well " ms cunningham said she believes the market is about "three fourths of the way through the downsizing " domestic nonfinancial firms issued a net &# billion in commercial paper the first increase in two weeks foreign financial firms issued another &#
