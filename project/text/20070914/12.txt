borking mr olson not content with having run attorney general alberto gonzales out of town the democratic posse on capitol hill is already gunning for his replacement even before hes nominated more preposterous still theyre disguising this pre emptive borking as a plea for a "consensus" choice the breadth of this proposed condominium appears to be on the narrow side however running from harry reid to pat leahy and perhaps stretching all the way to chuck schumer revealingly this "consensus" doesnt seem to have room for ted olson the former solicitor general who is merely one of americas finest lawyers "ted olson will not be confirmed " declares senate majority leader reid "hes a partisan and the last thing we need as an attorney general is a partisan " that standard could certainly stand some fleshing out as "partisans" go mr olson doesnt come close to bobby kennedy the brother of jfk or griffin bell close friend of jimmy carter and a fine ag or for that matter janet renos justice department which was run for years not by ms reno but behind the scenes by close friend of hillary clinton and hyper partisan jamie gorelick is mr reid saying that a republican president cant nominate any republican as attorney general or does he mean that president bush can only nominate a certain kind of republican namely one who agrees with the senate democratic agenda or short of that one who can be easily rolled that the latter is the real democratic game was given away by none other than mr leahy whose own "partisanship" is so raw he cant disguise it number two on mr leahys helpful "checklist for choosing the next attorney general" is this "a proven track record of independence to ensure that he or she will act as an independent check on this administrations expansive claims of virtually unlimited executive power " this idea of an "independent" attorney general would have been laughable to the founders who rejected a bifurcated executive branch mr olson understands that very well having served not only as solicitor general who argues cases before the supreme court but also as head of the office of legal counsel during the reagan administration both shops are known as the most professional in justice and olc issues advisory opinions about the legality of executive branch actions facing a congress intent on weakening the presidency and limiting his war powers mr olson is precisely the kind of legal advisor mr bush needs in his last months democrats also gave mr olson a hard time when he was nominated as solicitor general in in part as payback because he had argued bush v gore before the supreme court but mr olson went on to serve three years as sg in an honorable and entirely nonpartisan fashion he sometimes argued cases such as on campaign finance and racial preferences that he personally disagreed with arguing client cases before the high court is what mr olson does in private practice does mr leahy believe that laurence tribe should not have represented al gore in that case as mr tribe put it at the time mr olsons "briefs and arguments have treated the applicable law and the underlying facts honestly and forthrightly not disingenuously or deceptively " if mr olson is nominated you can also expect democrats to reprise the so called "arkansas project" involving reporting by the american spectator magazine on bill and hillary clinton the magazine received a few hundred thousand dollars from the scaife foundation to do investigative journalism while mr olson was on the board of the american spectator foundation mr olson says he knew little about the scaife funding though of course he and everyone else knew about the journalism ultimately the spectator board voted to shut down the project and in any case committing journalism is not a crime the arkansas project was never accused of breaking any laws although the clinton justice department did investigate the magazine over the campaign which strikes us as a much creepier sort of partisanship than exercising ones first amendment rights mr olson later represented david hale one of the witnesses for the prosecution in the whitewater trial but having clients is what lawyers do hes also represented this newspaper as well as newsday reporter timothy phelps when he was pressed to reveal his sources on the anita hill story but dont expect mr leahy to give him any credit on that score whats really going on here is an attempt to intimidate mr bush into nominating a candidate democrats favor this makes it all the more disappointing that republican senators have failed to speak up for mr olson with some joining the "consensus" chorus we hope it isnt because one or more of them are angling for the attorney general job voters didnt elect them to act as an echo of the democrats and theyre likely to stay in the minority for a long time and deserve to if they wont stand up for the prerogatives of a president from their own party mr bush needs an ag hes comfortable with and we can support nearly every name on the list of potential nominees that has been bandied about in the press this week but facing a hostile congress mr bush also needs to show democrats that he isnt as lame as they want him to be if he thinks mr olson is the best man for the job he shouldnt reject him merely because harry reid orders him to come to think it thats a very good reason for choosing him see related letter "letters to the editor democrats power play" wsj september
