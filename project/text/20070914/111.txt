weekend journal the wealth report potholes on luxury lane the recent boom in conspicuous consumption may have reached its peak with financial markets increasingly volatile and consumer credit increasingly tight spending on everything from ferraris and gulfstreams to art wine and mansions could be at a turning point granted the rich are still living large with luxury retailers and other purveyors to the wealthy reporting strong profits and few expect the high end economy to crash anytime soon because the wealthy tend to be more insulated from economic shocks yet a look at three auctions held over the past week one for racehorses another for art and a third for wine offers some early hints of a slowdown horses every year keeneland association inc in lexington ky holds its september yearling sale where the most prized thoroughbreds under a year old are sold to buyers from around the world the first two days of the sale are usually the biggest featuring the top horses this years sale was more subdued total sales at the auction were &# million by the end of second day tuesday down from last year and the average sale price for the two days was down compared with last year the top selling horse this year was a colt that sold for &# million that compares with last years top horse which went for &# million nick nicholson keenelands president said the lower prices were an anomaly because a major middle eastern buyer who pays among the top prices bought fewer horses this year the buyer sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum spent about &# million this year compared with about &# million last year mr nicholson said the median price during the first two days of the auction was &# flat with last year this is the first year the median price remained flat since "i dont see prices or demand really falling " he said "but its more a flattening out we still see a lot of buyers but just not the big prices at the top " wine the aulden cellars sothebys wine auction last weekend showed continued strong demand for "trophy wines " like the chateau petrus the chateau lafite and the chateau latour which each fetched more than &# a case the auctions total of &# million topped the high estimate for the sale of &# million to &# million still jamie ritchie head of sothebys wine department in north america said prices arent rising as rapidly as they have in the past few years for instance the average price for a bottle of latour soared to &# in may from &# in february but leveled off at &# last weekend "as long as the economic situation doesnt deteriorate we expect to see a stabilization of the market " he said he added that a more global buying population including from russia china and the middle east is helping to support prices still he said the wine business all too well remembers the early s when an ailing economy and falling financial markets caused prices to drop and customers to pull out of auctions "that was a terrible time for wine " he said "but were not hearing anything like that at the moment certainly not in the short term " art sothebys midseason contemporary art sale wednesday afternoon posted strong results yet art experts say its not a good barometer for the current art market psychology because the auction featured lesser known artists and prices mostly in the tens of thousands of dollars compared with the tens of millions of dollars fetched at the big evening sales of contemporary art in the spring and fall wednesdays auction total &# million was higher than the companys high end estimate of &# million like earnings estimates on wall street auction house estimates are often designed to be exceeded sothebys said of the pieces up for auction didnt sell although it sold of the pieces by value jennifer roth head of sothebys fine arts department said the sale results were "consistent with the steady growth we have witnessed over the past few seasons and showed continued strength in this segment of the art market " still some art experts said the market may be topping out richard l feigen a longtime new york art dealer and owner of the richard l feigen gallery said he expects art prices to soften in the next year or so because of the stock market swings and credit crunch he said some of the recent run up in prices and demand has been from speculators buying works to quickly flip them rather than to collect for the long term "theres a lot of speculation in this market right now " he says "once the speculators see that prices arent going up they pull out its very flighty money " he added that in the early s prices fell the most for the most hyped contemporary artists such as david salle and julian schnabel contemporary art has seen a similar run up over the past five years and may be due for a correction he said "people are buying whats trendy " he said "thats always a reason to be cautious "
