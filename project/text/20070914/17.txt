barclayss abn bid is ripe to spoil rbs consortium likely to become top suitor dead in the water as the battle to acquire dutch bank abn amro holding nv enters its final skirmish an interloper looks increasingly likely to take the prize from barclays plc the bidder that started it all even as barclays shareholders meet today to approve the british banks bid for what promises to be the largest bank deal ever all indicators suggest that victory will go to a rival consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc the consortium still faces at least one significant obstacle raising the money for the bulk of its billion euro &# billion cash bid in a difficult market but people familiar with the matter say the consortium has virtually cleared two other hurdles getting a nod of cooperation from abn amro and gaining approval from the dutch finance ministry a win for the consortium would represent a serious setback for barclayss international expansion plans leaving chief executive john varley with the task of playing down the loss and preventing the bank from becoming a takeover target itself barclayss offer "is dead in the water " says antony broadbent a bank analyst at sanford bernstein in london "except if the consortium falls apart " representatives for the consortium banks declined to comment a barclays spokesman said he expects todays meeting to be routine the fight for abn is in its sixth month what began as a deal between barclays and abn in april turned into a bidding war that ultimately included bank of america corp in the u s and investors in china and singapore the rbs consortium which includes dutch belgian bank fortis nv and spains banco santander sa took the lead last month with a nearly all cash bid valued at billion euros or euros a share since then barclays has seen the value of its bid which consists mostly of stock sink along with its share price at euros a share the bid is valued at about billion euros less than the consortiums offer abn stock closed yesterday at euros a share a level that reflects significant doubts among investors that the consortium will be able to complete the deal on its current terms meanwhile the consortium has been maneuvering to clinch the deal with noticeable success as early as today abn will post on its web site a "reasoned opinion" on the competing bids in which it will come closer to endorsing the consortiums offer than at any point in the six month saga according to people who reviewed a draft of the opinion the consortiums banks which plan to break up abn and divide it among themselves have held numerous meetings with abn management in recent weeks an effort that both sides say has improved relations significantly between the two camps another milestone will come monday when the dutch finance minister is expected to give his approval for the consortiums deal according to people familiar with the matter also the european commission said yesterday that fortis made certain "commitments" to remedy antitrust concerns and that the commission extended its competition review of fortiss role in the consortium bid until oct people close to the matter said the extension suggests approval is near the first closing date for abn shareholders to tender their shares for the consortiums offer is oct one day after the first closing date for the barclays offer the biggest wild card in the consortiums bid and probably barclayss last hope is that financing could fall through a crucial test will come in the next several days when fortis considered the weakest link in the consortium will attempt to sell billion euros in new shares to existing shareholders the largest such offering in european history the deal known as a rights offering is the only part of the three banks financing that they told regulators would get done before the acquisition is completed merrill lynch &amp co has agreed to underwrite the rights offer meaning that it will take the shares if other buyers dont bite people involved in the matter say fortis also has signed up a number of friendly partners other banks insurers and securities firms to help merrill shoulder the burden to finance the rest of the bid the three banks plan a complex combination of asset sales borrowings bond issues and sales of hybrid securities which trade like corporate debt but have some characteristics of stocks banco santander for example has taken the unusual step of offering loans to customers so they can buy convertible bonds that the bank is issuing to raise its share of the money some analysts are skeptical that the whole package can work in a market shying away from all kinds of risk "it is still not a done deal " said simon adamson an analyst in london at creditsights a research firm "i guess that they werent thinking that this whole liquidity crisis would continue this long " still bankers working on the deal say they have enough time and flexibility to raise the needed funds fortis and santander for example wouldnt take abn assets on to their balance sheets until barring any last minute reprieves mr varley could start having to pitch barclayss next step as soon as todays meeting with barclays shareholders he is likely to begin laying the groundwork to make the case that the bank remained disciplined in its bid for abn that said analysts and people familiar with the situation could allow mr varley to save face and avoid a takeover of a bank whose history dates to the late s "i dont think they come out with huge egg on their face " said mr broadbent the bernstein analyst "they go back to plan a which is internal growth selectively acquiring in attractive markets to expand overseas "
