cancer killers last week the american cancer society announced it will no longer run ads about the dangers of smoking and other cancer causing behaviors and the benefits of regular screenings instead the society will devote this years entire advertising budget to a campaign for universal health coverage john seffrin the societys chief executive said "if we dont fix the health care system lack of access will be a bigger cancer killer than tobacco " sadly these ads will waste money that should be used to continue the societys educational campaign about prevention and detection the evidence shows that universal health coverage does not improve survival rates for cancer patients despite the large number of uninsured cancer patients in the u s are most likely to be screened regularly have the fastest access to treatment once they are diagnosed with the disease and can get new effective drugs long before theyre available in most other countries last month the largest ever international survey of cancer survival rates showed that in the u s women have a chance of living at least five years after diagnosis and men have a chance the highest survival rates in the world these figures reflect the care available to all americans not just those with private health coverage in great britain which has had a government run universal health care system for half a century the figures were for women and for men near the bottom of the countries surveyed a study in the journal respiratory medicine showed that lung cancer patients in the u s have the best chance of surviving five years about patients in austria and france fare almost as well and patients in the united kingdom do much worse with only living five years a report released in may from the commonwealth fund showed that women in the u s are more likely to get a pap test every two years than women in australia canada new zealand and the u k where health insurance is guaranteed by the government in the u s of women ages have regular pap smears compared with in the u k the same is true for mammograms in the u s of women ages get them regularly a higher percentage than in australia canada or new zealand and far higher than the of women in the u k the high rate of screening in the u s reflects access as well as educational efforts by the american cancer society and others early diagnosis is important but survival also depends on getting effective treatment quickly in the spring of year old valerie thorpe from kent england went through the anguish of being diagnosed with cancer and then was told she would have to wait four months before beginning radiation therapy her plight was reported in the newspaper because she appealed to her representative in parliament but her problem is not unusual a study by the royal college of radiologists published this june showed that such waits are typical and of patients who need radiation never get it due to shortages of equipment and staff long waits for treatment are "common devices used to restrict access to care in countries with universal health insurance " according to a report in health affairs july august the british national health service has set a target for reducing waits the goal is that patients will not have to wait more than weeks between the time their general practitioner refers them to a specialist and they actually begin treatment access to new better drugs also explains differences in survival rates in may a report in the annals of oncology by two swedish scientists found that cancer patients have the most access to new drugs in france the u s switzerland and austria for example erlotinib a new lung cancer therapy was times more likely to be prescribed for a patient in the u s than in europe one of the reports authors dr nils wilking from the karolinska institute in stockholm explained that nearly half the improvement in survival rates in the u s in the s was due to "the introduction of new oncology drugs " and he urged other countries to make new drugs available faster international comparisons establish that the current method of financing health care in the u s is not a bigger killer than tobacco what is deadly are delays in treatment and lack of access to the most effective drugs problems encountered by some uninsured cancer patients in the u s but by a far larger proportion of cancer patients in the u k and europe cancer patients do well in a few small countries with national health insurance such as sweden and finland but they do better in the u s than anywhere else on the globe with a track record like that the american cancer society should continue its lifesaving messages about prevention and screening instead of switching to a political agenda the goal should be to ensure that all cancer patients receive the timely care our current system provides not to radically overhaul the system ms mccaughey a former lieutenant governor of new york is chairman of the committee to reduce
