weekend journal taste houses of worship ah yes i remember them well i have always loved the rituals of the jewish high holidays hearing the wail of the shofar or rams horn chanting the ancient hymns taking part in the festive meal punctuated by honey and sweet jam to mark the new year still it is the brief sober service known as yizkor literally "may god remember" that has come to affect me most recited on yom kippur which begins next friday at sundown yizkor is the memorial prayer for the dead but unlike the kaddish recited daily by a mourner which never mentions the person who has passed yizkor is an explicit expression of yearning for the person lost and must include his name "yizkor is a personal time when we reflect on our relationship with our loved one " remarks rabbi rafael konikov of southampton n y while recalling ones parents is mandatory it is also possible to pray for a grandparent a favored aunt a long dead sibling these days many synagogues use yizkor to mourn the millions of jews who perished in the holocaust though the names of large groups of people dont all need to be said recently some rabbis have also been praying for victims of this year some will pray for soldiers killed in iraq my own growing fascination with this minute prayer coincides with the burgeoning list of loved ones whose names i have come to invoke yizkor was never a part of my upbringing it is a european jewish tradition absent from my egyptian jewish childhood yizkor dates back to the crusades when thousands of jews were massacred in europe there were so many dead that jewish communities began keeping books listing the names of the victims according to lawrence hoffman a professor of liturgy at hebrew union college in new york yizkor evolved into multiple prayers and became more important as the persecution of european jews continued these days some congregations showcase a separate yizkor service while others fold yizkor into the day of atonement prayers the reform movement which often shortens prayers made yizkor longer minutes rabbi hoffman says yizkor is said on other holidays passover for example but it is a hallmark of yom kippur where questions of life and death are paramount as synagogue attendance in america has dwindled yizkor has become perhaps the last sure fire way to draw a crowd some synagogues like the forest hills jewish center in new york hold regular holiday services and yizkor in the main sanctuary for those with tickets and rolling yizkor prayers in a small chapel for anyone walking off the street there are lots of jews who wont attend even high holiday services but yizkor still draws them "theyre too alienated but they have a nagging feeling they have to recite yizkor " says rabbi gerald skolnik of forest hills "it is about guilt i can choose not to go to shul but miss yizkor i wont be able to live with myself " he explains when i joined an ashkenazi synagogue in southampton n y a few years ago i was taken aback on that first yom kippur when i was handed a big laminated card to help me follow the yizkor service it was a fill in the blank affair containing blessings in both hebrew and english the card indicated precisely when and where to insert a remembered persons name as the rabbi chanted the blessings i said only the blessings in memory of my parents that year during yizkor the following year my eyes drifted to the other relations on the laminated card who could also be remembered the only grandparent of mine who was alive by the time i was born was my maternal grandmother alexandra she left egypt for israel when i was a baby and passed away a few years later alone and lost in her new home i never met her but through my mothers wistful stories alexandra of alexandria came alive an enchanting tragic woman born to great wealth yet so cosseted that she was helpless unable to cook or clean or keep house "why she couldnt comb her own hair " my mom loved to tell me as she brushed mine alexandra possessed one talent she could play the piano beautifully as beds were left unmade my grandmother played and played i had rarely thought of her as an adult but during yizkor a few years ago i decided to invoke her name "may god remember the soul of my grandmother alexandra who has gone on to her world because without making a vow i shall give charity on her behalf " i prayed there had also been her polar opposite my syrian grandmother zarifa truth be told my mom hadnt really liked her stern mother in law very much my father had adored her putting off marriage until he was zarifa was a wizard in the kitchen her secret was apricots which she stuffed in rice in meats in chicken so that every dish had a sweetly tart flavor who prayed for zarifa now and so during another yizkor i thought of apricots and added her name to my retinue another time i glanced at the laminated card and stopped at the word "sister " that is when i remembered baby alexandra the sister i had never known she lived all of eight days but my older siblings had described her magnificent blue eyes her fuzz of light brown hair how she had smiled before succumbing to typhoid fever baby alexandra joined my roster of yizkor names when my rabbi brought up the holocaust i thought of aunt bahia my fathers sister deported to auschwitz with her husband and daughter and prayed seated in the sanctuary clutching my laminated card i named them i remembered them and i felt as if they were with me ms lagnado a journal reporter is the author of the new memoir "the man in the white sharkskin suit my familys exodus
