fear of men is driving the good guys away jeffrey zaslows "moving on" column "avoiding kids how men cope with being cast as predators" personal journal sept confirmed that foolish prejudice and hysteria have combined to demonize men in our culture with the result that men themselves feel less able to help others for fear of being unfairly cast as predators it is a terrible thing to see honorable courageous and virtuous men being suspected of unspeakable wrongs merely on the basis of their gender it is worse yet to consider how these fears and suspicions prevent men from serving as a force for good as mentors volunteers teachers etc because of the concern that a simple misunderstanding could end their career or ruin lives and worst of all is looking at the innocent hope and enthusiasm with which young boys throw themselves into life knowing that it will only be a matter of years before they pass from overprotected potential victims to shunned potential predators as the director of boys and schools an organization dedicated to helping improve boys health education and well being i see again and again the evidence that strong positive male role models are a vital part of helping young men succeed and yet we are pushing these very role models out of boys lives where they are most needed and teaching both boys and men that theres something "wrong" with them how can we help boys do better in an atmosphere defined by fear and distrust of men malia blom director boys and schools a project of the mens health network washington ten of the most anxious minutes ive spent recently occurred outside the mens room in new yorks grand central station as i waited for my year old "special needs" son to emerge i found myself profiling the men waiting in the extra long line to enter the restroom which one could i safely ask to see if my son was ok the tall guy with the impressive dreds the older man in the impeccable suit carrying a smart briefcase the pair in coveralls conversing in a language i couldnt place standing there undoubtedly telegraphing my anxiety to everyone near me i came to the realization that at least half the men in line were probably dads and that all of them probably just needed to use the restroom for its intended purpose i reflected on the many times id waited for my son outside mens rooms ever since he grew too old to smuggle into the ladies room once at a restaurant i had to enter an otherwise unoccupied mens room to help my son of course several men came in all of them merely laughed at finding a woman and calmly went to stalls as i whisked my son away from the hand drier and out the door i hoped the father of a special needs daughter would garner as much good humored sympathy if the situation were reversed so to all the good guys out there who instead of taking unseemly advantage of my boy politely look the other way when he exposes too much in front of the urinal or help him with an unfamiliar faucet or the maddening motion sensitive towel dispenser or even wait a bit after youve finished to make sure no other guy threatens him thanks you make the world ok for us jean scott branford conn
