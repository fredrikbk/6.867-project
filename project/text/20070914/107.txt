weekend journal tastings at wineries small is beautiful can you give me any recommendations of the best wineries to visit in the willamette valley finger lakes north fork santa barbara anderson valley new mexico do you have any recommendations for wineries that we must see in italy can you offer guidance to visitors to australia with limited time to visit wine regions what wineries would you visit in zurich salzburg berchtesgaden and malta several times every week we receive the same question i am going to a wine region what wineries should i visit each question above came from real letters and we could quote hundreds more from readers asking about regions as varied as north carolina and turkey were delighted about this because visiting wineries anywhere in the world is a joy and excites many people into a lifetime love affair with wine the regions are so beautiful the people are so nice the wine and food are so special it really brings home the whole idea of wine as a lifestyle not just a liquid all that said the advice we give to everyone no matter where on earth theyre visiting is the same visit the small winery youve never heard of you will not be disappointed that is what we have done all over the world and we pretty much always have a great time chatting with winemakers even when we dont speak the same language tasting wine and enjoying the sights and smells when people ask us about visiting wineries we think theyre simply looking for someone to meet with intimate knowledge of the wines some interesting wines to taste and a welcoming environment in which to taste them this is all most likely to happen at that little winery with the unfamiliar name for a copy of our column with some tips on how to make the most of any winery visit drop us a note at wine wsj com most recently we visited the santa cruz mountains south of san francisco as part of a brief family vacation its important to do a little bit of homework on your wine region before you go so you can find a concentration of wineries wine regions all over the world which are eager to welcome tourists generally have information online in our case we searched online for santa cruz mountain wineries and found the web site of the santa cruz mountains winegrowers association there was a handy listing of wineries in the region and a map to download from the site at www scmwa com for an easier to use and more detailed version of the map we went to the "contact us" page of the web site and entered our mailing information to receive a printed version this map became our best friend on the trip because it not only had easy to follow driving directions but a list of every winery and whether each was open to the public and if so when if you are going overseas in addition to whatever official information you can find from the region wed urge you to buy a wine book that specializes in the wines of that region or country if we were going to italy for instance wed be sure to take along "vino italiano" by joseph bastianich and david lynch even though it is hefty there are thousands of wineries all over the world that youve never heard of theyre small family run and charming those are the ones we target while some of the santa cruz wineries are well known most are more obscure from heart o the mountain to clos tita our goal was simply to identify some of these that were open to the public and drop in many wineries are open by appointment only often because they are small and cant handle many visitors we prefer to be spontaneous so we rarely visit those but they can be quite a bit of fun too of course our first stop was thomas fogarty winery &amp vineyards which is larger and fancier than most in a gorgeous mountain setting and a name we know well it happened to be along our route so we dropped in there were two tasting menus a standard tasting for &# and a premium tasting for &# we chose the former and split one tasting we almost always do this since we mostly smell and spit anyway we do not identify ourselves as wine writers and we were not recognized at most wineries we find that our enthusiasm inevitably leads to an extra pour of something behind the counter in this case the extra pour turned out to be the star of the show a barbera that was stunning with surprising structure and tremendous balance we loved it so much that we bought a bottle and loved it all over again back at our hotel in any wine region there are wineries all over the place if you look closely for them or have a good map the beauregard vineyards tasting room is right on the wharf of santa cruz sea lions were yelping below us and a sad confused sea gull actually walked into the tasting room and couldnt find his way out storrs winery is located in a little row of shops in the middle of santa cruz the joint tasting room for fleming jenkins vineyards &amp winery and clos lachance is smack in the middle of los gatos thats peggy fleming the figure skater weve written before about her exceptional rose our own favorite visits however are the ones where were surrounded by the vineyards and the tanks at burrell school vineyards &amp winery for instance we tasted a chardonnay made from vines that were growing quite literally outside the window of the tasting room thats our kind of winery small quirky friendly and passionate about wine hallcrest vineyards was hard to find but it couldnt have been a more relaxing more pleasant stop with a knowledgeable young woman behind the counter who was happy to talk about wine all day she suggested we take a mountain road to bonny doon it was quite a little drive but as we would have guessed the tasting room of this well known winery was busy and no one had time to talk with us although they were pouring some very interesting wines although testarossa vineyards is not an obscure winery aficionados prize its pinot noir and chardonnay its an interesting stop in los gatos because its the site of a very old winery and the tasting room is inside a giant cave theres always something new even at better known wineries and that was the case here where we tried testarossas syrah for the first time it turned out to be our favorite wine of the tasting there most big wineries now charge for tasting and many small ones do too but the smaller wineries are more likely to refund the tasting fee with a purchase or just forget about the fee if youre nice at testarossa where the tasting fee was &# for five wines but where the unusually well trained and friendly pourer also let us taste a pinot which wasnt on the tasting menu against the pinots on the tasting list we bought a bottle and she waived the tasting fee heres the point all of the wineries weve mentioned here were chosen randomly because they happened to be open and along our route were sure we would have had an equally good and interesting time at any of the smaller wineries on the map there is a story behind every winery in every part of the world just stop in what winery would we recommend during your visit the one we could never recommend because weve never heard of it melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com a bumper crop of wine events this is the perfect time to visit wineries because its harvest time here are some of the many harvest events around the country we have chosen these simply to show that theyre happening everywhere including someplace near you to find an event close to you look for the web sites of associations that represent an entire wine region often those web sites will have
