marking down wall street for the past three tumultuous months investors have found it difficult and sometimes impossible to price many exotic financial instruments hard hit by subprime turmoil now with some of wall streets biggest names goldman sachs group inc lehman brothers holdings inc morgan stanley and bear stearns cos set to begin reporting results for this period next week investors will be paying particular attention to the impact this has had on the brokers balance sheets as they pore over the books investors are likely to home in on data that have only recently begun appearing in the firms financial statements under a new accounting rule firms are distinguishing between financial assets that have real market prices versus those based on models and those that are little more than management guesses the upshot given current market stresses bigger portions of the firms securities holdings might fall into the category of management guesses and relying on these estimates might not help restore investor confidence the uncertainty surrounding assets based on estimates given current market conditions could affect investors view of firms book values that could call into question bullish arguments that the firms are undervalued at current historically low price to book value multiples in addition if investors grow concerned about the true value of some of the assets on the firms balance sheets this could make them anxious about the amount of borrowed funds that the firms employ any change in sentiment on that score could force the firms to grow more conservative leading to lower earnings the firms began breaking down their financial assets into these "levels" at the start of their current fiscal year which began in december when they early adopted a new accounting standard related to fair or market value measurement all u s companies will have to begin using it for financial years starting after nov during the first two fiscal quarters investors didnt pay that much attention to this new data which break financial assets down into three valuation categories now with pricing or marking a big concern on wall street skittish investors are expected to pore over the information the biggest area of concern will be the category for asset values based on estimates or level these assets made up about or less of overall financial assets at goldman morgan lehman and bear at the end of their fiscal second quarters including merrill lynch &amp co which doesnt report results until next month the firms designated &# billion as level assets or about of total assets of the nearly &# billion in financial assets on lehmans balance sheet at the end of the fiscal second quarter for example about &# billion or fell into what is called level the firm said in its financial filings that values in this category "reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset " at bear about &# billion of the firms &# billion in financial assets fall into this category at both firms the bulk of their financial assets &# billion for lehman and &# billion for bear fell into the mark to model category or level assets in level trade in active markets with readily available prices among issues that will now concern investors how much in unrecognized gains and losses is being generated by level assets too large an amount of profit from these assets could call into question the quality of a firms earnings investors also will be watching to see if level assets soar particularly if a firm has to reclassify level assets earlier this year changes in level assets were relatively small at lehman brothers for example nonderivative level financial assets rose to &# billion in the second fiscal quarter from &# billion in the first quarter the worry is that bigger changes could be in store given the current problems in markets that could prove a warning signal to investors so far the data provided by the investment banks in the first two fiscal quarters havent provided evidence that they may be playing accounting games with their valuations according to a report from sanford c bernstein &amp co analyst brad hintz however the firms didnt face the same harsh market conditions during those periods also the firms could now face a greater possibility of having to write down the value of assets which would be more likely to affect those classified as level overall this could add up to more risks for a group whose outlook already is cloudy and whose stocks have taken a recent pounding up to yesterday goldman and morgan were down about since the start of the year lehman had dropped more than and bear had fallen more than in new york stock exchange p m composite trading goldman rose or &# to &# while morgan jumped or &# to &# lehman gained &# or to &# and bear shares gained or &# to &# of course the most immediate concern for investors will be whether the financial markets crisis is subsiding lehman will be the first to report next week some bad news already is baked into investor expectations given that the firm has recently closed some of its mortgage businesses and announced layoffs of about of its person work force investors are cautiously optimistic about results at morgan which reports wednesday and goldman which reports the day after and may even provide some upside surprise according to people familiar with the matter but bear which posts results thursday is fueling worries because it is by far the most dependent on mortgage revenue kate
