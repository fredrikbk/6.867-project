weekend journal sports by the numbers cutting to the chase major league baseball isnt the only big time sport thats about to head into its playoff season with sundays sylvania at new hampshire international speedway in loudon nascars race chase for the championship series gets under way by resetting the points total for the top drivers after the first races of nascars regular season the chase gives even those drivers who are well behind a reasonable shot at taking home the title before this season drivers were simply given small points bonuses based on their performances over the first races but starting this year the top drivers start the chase dead even with the exception of a point per win bonus this means that jeff gordon saw his point lead vanish and now finds himself points behind his teammate defending champ jimmie johnson thanks to mr johnsons six wins including the last two races as opposed to mr gordons four so the chase format makes the regular season little more than a memory in terms of the points race but how much does a drivers regular season performance tell us about his prospects once the chase gets going in the first year of the chase kurt busch came from seventh place in the standings to clinch the title but in the last two seasons the chase has been truer to form in tony stewart entered the chase as the points leader and managed to win the title with relative ease last year jimmie johnson started the chase in second place trailing matt kenseth by less than points at the end of the regular season and also won fairly easily to determine wholl prevail this season we looked at a few other factors in the relationship between regular season performance and chase success for starters while many fans view the chase as a sprint to the finish crossing the finish line first is no more significant in a chase race than it is during the regular season indeed out of the previous chase races only two were won by the guy who eventually won the title actually the two most important factors in chase success are consistency and momentum under nascars scoring system in which theres only a small reward for winning a race but a huge penalty for failing to finish consistency is everything and the best measure of that is how many top finishes a driver collects last year jimmie johnson had top finishes in of the regular season races the same number that tony stewart racked up in the leader in top s so far this season jeff gordon with right behind him is mr stewart with mr johnson mr gordons teammate has as does champion matt kenseth whos eighth in the chase points standings the other important factor is momentum how a driver performs in the races leading up to the chase mr busch didnt have a particularly stellar regular season the year he won the title but he did seem to peak at the right time in the races leading up to the chase he had six top finishes in mr stewart was even more dominant in that regard he finished in the top in nine of the regular seasons last races winning four of them using this yardstick mr stewart and mr busch deserve serious consideration this year theyre tied with mr johnson and mr gordon with seven top finishes in the last races matt kenseth and carl edwards are close behind with six top s down the stretch keep in mind that while failing to finish a few early season races kept mr stewart out of the chase which also likely prompted nascar to expand the chase field to during s home stretch he was nascars most dominant driver winning three of the last races the other wild card half of the chase races will be run using the so called car of tomorrow that should help the hendrick team of messrs gordon johnson and kyle busch who dominated early in regular season car of tomorrow races and could also give a leg up to messrs edwards and stewart who have won recently using the new machinery what does this add up to while the last three title holders messrs johnson stewart and kurt busch remain very much in the mix a strong and steady first half of the season puts mr gordon in the drivers seat look for nascars winningest active driver to capture his fifth championship and his first chase
