book case from hardcover to paper how a blockbuster was born a calculated approach for eat pray love memoir strikes a nerve when pearson plcs viking imprint published elizabeth gilberts memoir "eat pray love" early last year it printed copies only more than the total u s hardcover sales of her previous release "we had high hopes but we didnt put it out in best seller numbers " says viking publisher paul slovak the title a chatty recounting of the authors divorce spiritual search and self redemption as she traveled the world was the fourth for ms gilbert a former writer at gq magazine although her work was well reviewed ms gilbert was considered a mid list author talented but not a proven seller then a strange thing happened the paperback edition of "eat pray love " published in january quickly gained must read status women everywhere it seemed on trains planes and exotic beaches were suddenly entranced making it this summers break out publishing hit the book has had a week run on the new york times paperback nonfiction best seller list where it currently occupies the no position paramount pictures acquired the movie rights for actress julia roberts the author says a sequel is already in the works "i was hooked on page one " says barbara gattermeir a grandmother in kansas city mo who inhaled the paperback in two days "ive since recommended it to a lot of people and theyve all called said they loved it and that theyd given it to somebody else " the books transformation from respectable selling hardcover to paperback sensation was no accident it came about after a series of calculated moves from vikings sister penguin paperback line where executives worked to interpret sales patterns and create a marketing blitz to attract individual readers as well as book clubs penguins approach shows how publishers which typically dont conduct market research are becoming increasingly adept at hand picking certain titles for stardom it also underscores the pressure for publishing houses to deliver books that can get a big second wind from a paperback release even if hardcover sales dont exactly explode the vast majority of books face a tough reality new releases that fail to take off in the first couple of weeks when publishers often pay to place copies on stores front tables are relegated to the back shelves "the usual reflex is to give a book two weeks in the sun and then move on " says bob miller president of walt disney co s hyperion book division this rule of thumb however doesnt apply to books with break out potential "these titles require a different mindset the realization that by staying on them you can build something bigger than youd see with the normal best seller pattern " says mr miller in the case of "eat pray love " executives at penguin paid close attention to the hardcovers early reception it was excerpted in oprah winfreys o magazine and landed a favorable cover article in the new york times book review both big plums for any author hundreds of readers were emailing ms gilbert to tell her how much her story had affected them and to share their own intimate experiences instead of evaporating hardcover sales surprisingly gained momentum in late spring both at major chains and large independent bookstores the title surfaced on the new york times hardcover nonfiction best seller list at no for the issue dated march and then fell to no the following week on march ms gilbert appeared on nbcs "today" show and the book again hit the list for another week ms gilbert years old says she was pleased with her progress but figured the book had seen its best days "i was so happy with everything that happened " she says "i was more than satisfied and then i thought that was it it should have been over but it wasnt " poring over sales data penguin executives saw that stores were reordering at unusual rates barnes &amp noble inc the nations largest book retailer continued to sell to hardcover copies through the end of the year the book had "legs " the trend suggested that the memoir was generating word of mouth publicity believed by many to be the single most important factor in creating a major best seller "what youre looking for are books that didnt just ship and die " says kathryn court publisher of penguin books hardcovers in other words that have already "seeded the audience " ms court makes a point of sitting in on vikings promotion and strategy sessions where she looks for titles that have reordered well and whose sales are growing week to week in fall ms court began to put a plan in motion first she decided that the hardcover dust jacket with its script lettering rendered in pasta prayer beads and flowers was so appealing that she would use it again for the paperback penguin then threw all of its sales and marketing muscle behind the paperback release set for jan each month penguin publishes to fancy "trade" paperbacks high quality editions that are larger in format and easier to read than their cheaper mass market cousins but it only really lends its weight to one or two as a sign of its commitment penguin ordered a first printing of paperbacks for "eat pray love" more copies than the book had sold in hardcover and very large for a nonfiction title price too was significant the hardcover cost &# while the trade paperback would be much more affordable at &# next ms court stoked interest throughout the publishing house itself she asked every member of penguins sales and marketing team to read the book including those who sell to the countrys largest chains she wanted to spark the sort of enthusiasm that becomes infectious among store buyers a tough crowd that is inundated with new books every week "youve got to translate that excitement to people on the outside " ms court says upon its debut penguin made certain the paperback would have high visibility in stores promoting "eat pray love" with freestanding copy floor displays that was a show of confidence among retailers who reserve such prime paid real estate for books with huge promise penguin also invested in ads in addition to targeting usual suspects like the new york times book review and the new yorker magazine it bought space in yoga journal a nod to the books spiritual sensibility the publishers sales and marketing team focused on the books progress in weekly meetings the goal was to create so much buzz that the book would quickly become a new york times best seller which it did "a lot of the reason that these big paperbacks have sold so many copies is that were like a dog with a bone " says ms court "we dont give up " selling ms gilbert the author was just as crucial unlike many writers who dont like touring and are uncomfortable in front of crowds ms gilbert has a sunny upbeat personality that plays well on television and in personal appearances notes ms court "when the writer of a book is attractive generous and funny booksellers end up rooting for her " it helped that ms gilbert had built a following from her prior books her debut novel "stern men " a love story published in and set against the backdrop of lobster fishing in maine was chosen as a discover great new writers selection at barnes &amp noble "we have a history " says edward ash milby who buys biographies and memoirs for barnes &amp noble which quickly emerged as one of ms gilberts most enthusiastic supporters ms gilbert who had toured at the hardcover launch of "eat pray love " hit the road again in support of her paperback visiting more than cities through early summer the itinerary included a west coast trip in june where she appeared at bookstores in pasadena malibu and san jose the author gained book club traction her memoir was the no book sense reading group pick for spring summer which meant many of the independent bookstore members of the american booksellers association recommended it to their customers such kudos are key to winning over retailers like the tattered cover based in the greater denver area it has three locations and sells to more than book clubs it also sends out a bimonthly email newsletter to club members five years ago the retailer serviced only half as many clubs "it all feeds word of mouth and thats what takes you from copies to copies to copies " says ms court "we cant make people love a book " penguin is particularly adept at spinning gold from paperback titles in addition to ms gilberts memoir it published sue monk kidds "the secret life of bees" in and last summers smash hit "the memory keepers daughter" by kim edwards both novels were strong sellers in hardcover but exploded as paperbacks with more than three million copies each in print the &# u s paperback edition of "eat pray love" will generate about &# million in sales for the publisher if it sells two million copies a number that now seems conservative on average a successful nonfiction paperback may sell copies in a year translating to less than &# in sales ms gilberts experience shows what a big influence fancy trade paperbacks are having on an industry that prices its mass market paperbacks at about &# back in the s those smaller rack sized paperbacks were the blockbusters of the business led by such best sellers as william peter blattys "the exorcist" million copies sold peter benchleys "jaws" more than nine million copies and sidney sheldons "the other side of midnight" six million copies plus "one of the mantras of publishing economics of the s and early s was that mass market paperbacks could achieve times the sales of a hardcover " says stuart applebaum a spokesman for bertlesmann ags random house inc then retailers started discounting hardcover titles and the smaller cheaper paperbacks lost ground laurence kirshbaum a book agent who heads up ljk literary management in new york estimates that the current ratio between hardcover and paperback sales is one to one mostly because so many hardcover books are so steeply discounted "these days the bulk of the people who are interested in a book buy it in hardcover thats what makes titles such as eat pray love so exceptional " says mr kirshbaum "they are throwbacks to the days when paperbacks sold huge multiples of the hardcover " reading tastes too have changed virtually all of the hottest recent paperbacks have flourished largely because they appeal to women buyers who account for to of u s book sales among the hits are jeannette wallss memoir of her difficult childhood "the glass castle " which now has million fancy paperbacks in print and azar nafisis memoir "reading lolita in tehran " which is selling at about the same level lisa sees novel "snow flower and the secret fan " has topped million none were hardcover blockbusters "these books connect with readers because they are about lives that are being transformed or lives that are being saved " says patrick nolan director of trade paperback sales for the penguin group ms gilberts story seemed tailor made for a female audience although she appeared to have everything a successful woman could want ms gilbert experienced a premature midlife crisis in her late s crying on the bathroom floor at a m to the dismay of her husband she announced she was leaving him and wanted a divorce then she found her "soul mate " only to discover that they had different emotional needs and couldnt build a

" although her plans were uncertain she knew she wanted to learn italian meditate at her gurus temple in india and spend time with a healer in bali it helps when a book has a happy ending as it gives readers hope ms gilbert eventually finds love in the arms of a divorced brazilian businessman whom she met in bali there was a hitch if they wanted to live together in the u s they would need to get
