salesforce com builds on platform plan new initiative helps companies develop web based services salesforce com inc plans next week to unveil technology to help companies build web based services for business tasks according to people familiar with the matter salesforce com of san francisco lets salespeople and marketers keep track of their customers using a web site that approach offering an online service for business tasks is known as "software as a service " pioneered by salesforce com and others in the late s it has since gained popularity among companies hoping to avoid the cost and complexity of managing software installed on their own computers the new initiative force com is expected to be launched on monday at salesforce coms annual conference for developers it marks the companys latest effort to turn itself into a "platform " allowing other web developers to build their own web based services using salesforce coms technology and host those services on salesforce coms computers said people familiar with the matter a salesforce com spokeswoman declined to comment the effort started in when salesforce com launched sforce a set of tools to help companies develop some web based services last year it created the appexchange an online store where customers could access the services from companies building on its platform and apex a programming language that made it easier to get such services to function but so far the company has had only modest success in evangelizing its platform efforts salesforce com hasnt broken out the revenue from the platform related initiatives but the vast bulk of the companys revenue is thought to still come from its core customer relationship management services in part because it has been difficult for web developers to use salesforce coms technology to build a distinct "user interface" for their services many of the services that have been built on salesforce coms platform look much like the companys core customer relationship management service and offer related functionality initially force com will be largely a rebranding of technology that salesforce com already offers the companys existing platform efforts will now fall under the force com umbrella said one person familiar with the matter but it later will include a key new service called visualforce which will let web developers create services that look and feel distinct from salesforce coms own services this person said those services could be expanded beyond computers for use in other devices such as cellphones and kiosks this person said a preview version of visualforce will be available to developers in salesforce coms fourth quarter ending in january and pricing and an official launch date are still to be determined this person said the company hopes the force com initiative will help customers and independent technology vendors build a broader array of new services this person said the idea is to persuade customers that salesforce coms platform can really be used to develop nearly any online service the way nearly any software program can run on microsoft corp s windows operating system that in turn could help salesforce com generate more revenue from the platform by making it a vital component of other companies online services and giving saleforce com more opportunities to charge those companies finding new revenue sources is increasingly urgent for salesforce com as it searches for ways to maintain its rapid growth and as giant rivals like oracle corp and microsoft increase their online efforts
