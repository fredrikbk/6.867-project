weekend journal review theater a showy lear a soaring seagull king lear closes sept the seagull closes sept royal shakespeare company bam harvey theater fulton st brooklyn n y &# &# don juan giovanni closes sept american repertory theatre loeb drama center brattle st cambridge mass &# &# brooklyn n y ian mckellen and the royal shakespeare company have been barnstorming around the world all summer performing "king lear" and anton chekhovs "the seagull" as staged by trevor nunn the man who brought us "cats " this month theyre in brooklyn and i saw both shows on consecutive nights earlier this week one is good the other near perfect and i was surprised by which was which the buzz on "lear" is true the year old mr mckellen doffs his knickers in the storm scene offering the audience a full frontal view of his gray anatomy the gratuitous gesture is all of a piece with the rest of this exciting but ill sorted production which wobbles between grand manner melodrama lears fool is hanged onstage just before the intermission and scabby touches of directorial cuteness a doddering lear reads his first speech from a handful of three by five cards im still trying to figure out the costumes which looked like theyd been designed for the siberia light opera companys production of "the merry widow " as lear mr mckellen is mannered and ranting until the storm scene when he finds the center of the role and thereafter becomes compelling it is all told an impressive piece of work though to my mind william gaunt walks away with top honors for his performance as gloucester an indelible study in dignity terror and resignation the rest of the ensemble is strong but not always imaginatively directed will i never see a "lear" in which goneril and regan the kings faithless daughters are treated as something other than gargoyles the sound effects are head splittingly loud the incidental music profuse and unmemorable the stage rain subtle and suitable "the seagull " played by the same cast on the same unit set in a new english language version prepared by mr nunn in collaboration with the ensemble is as consistent in tone as "lear" is uncertain here everything is grippingly unostentatiously right tone is everything in chekhovs sad comedies peopled as they are by unfulfilled men and women whose melancholy plight is all the more affecting because it is so funny in mr nunns production "the seagull" is played decisively for laughs and thats the right call if you take care of the comedy in chekhov the pathos will take care of itself all the performances are wonderful especially that of romola garai as nina the naive girl from the provinces who loses her bearings when she meets a famous writer gerald kyd and decides to follow him to moscow and become an actress ms garai is the star of the show but she shines in a radiant sky of superior acting mr nunns "king lear " for all its quirks is worth seeing and his "seagull" is as good as theater gets if you havent yet bought tickets though forget about "lear " which is sold out as are the three "seagulls" in which mr mckellen plays sorin mr gaunt takes over for the rest of the run from here the company travels to minneapoliss guthrie theater oct and uclas royce hall in los angeles oct before returning to england catch them if you can cambridge mass i saw minneapoliss theatre de la jeune lune for the first time last fall and was entranced by its zany transformation of molieres "the miser " now dominique serrand and steven epp are collaborating with the american repertory theatre on a pair of shows in which "don giovanni" and "the marriage of figaro" are similarly rethought and reworked in "don juan giovanni " which is playing in repertory with "figaro" at a r t through the end of the month the familiar tale of the archetypical seducer played with self lacerating urbanity by mr serrand and his down to earth servant played with appropriately galumphing clownishness by mr epp is transplanted to contemporary america the plot is a surreal mash up of mozarts "don giovanni" and molieres "don juan" messrs serrand and epp who are cruising the country in a rusty old plymouth coupe in search of fornicatory adventure pull into a drive in and run into the characters from mozarts opera who are played by six excellent singers and accompanied by a stylish sounding five piece offstage band hijinks ensue at first frivolous then increasingly unnervingly dark like mr nunns "lear " "don juan giovanni" is not above gratuitous shock effects i saw no particular reason for instance why the dons manservant needed to relieve himself onstage and im not sure how much sense the show will make to viewers unfamiliar with the original opera but if you know your way around mozarts version my guess is that youll be enthralled by what "don juan giovanni" has to say about that most disturbing of masterpieces and by the terrific flair with which it is said would that my schedule had allowed me to see "figaro" as well one can never spend enough time with such smart and unpredictable artists mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write
