weekend journal review television shining through fans of kelsey grammer can rejoice in his return to tv in the comedy "back to you" wednesdays p m et on fox no its not another "frasier" nothing could be shove that wish aside though and plenty of good things will shine through in the new show this time the setting is a local tv station in pittsburgh where the once high and mighty anchorman chuck darling mr grammer has returned after disgracing himself on the air in los angeles hell be paired up again with co anchor kelly carr patricia heaton his sparring partner from a decade ago who isnt happy about sharing the limelight again with the preening chuck also in the original newsroom mix are oddball sportscaster marsh mcginley fred willard and underappreciated reporter gary crezyzewski ty burrell sexpot weatherwoman montana diaz herrera ayda field and hapless news director ryan church josh gad round out the ensemble i wish i could say that the writing is what lifts "back to you" above or sets it apart from past comedies in a similar setting from "murphy brown" and "wkrp in cincinnati" to "frasier" itself certainly it ticks along warmly with a fresh zinger now and then and pratfalls that successfully add a twist to the predictable ive seen only two episodes so perhaps all the jokes about sexual incompetence early on arent harbingers of a future lack of wit even then it might not matter what "back to you" lacks in bite it compensates for with chemistry and pure talent the center of it all is the relationship between chuck and kelly and mr grammer and ms heaton work together like they have been doing it all their lives effortlessly seamlessly moving from comedy barbs to fleeting moments of genuine adult angst mr willard is another professional at the top of his game here playing yet another deadpan idiot think "best in show" but with such perfect timing that you never see the gears turning with few exceptions in fact nobody seems to be laboring hard for laughs they know how much better the light touch works not that there isnt some broad brush stuff at one point mr burrells reporter character is assigned to show the stations viewers how a new police taser works by subjecting himself to a shot its an assignment made funnier and more ridiculous by the fact that this is something other reporters at other tv stations have been asked to do among other things "back to you" does mock the tv news biz in any event the set up for the tasering and the way it is filmed are so deft that what might have been mere slapstick becomes instead a scene of comedy genius while "hilarious" aptly describes mr burrells depiction of his zapped character a better word for almost all of the performances here would be "luminous " also new on fox this week is the police drama "k ville" mondays p m et its set in post katrina new orleans which gives the series a unique look and authentic grit so far it is also notable because in the pair of cops at the center of the show the usual sidekick role is reversed the black cop marlin boulet anthony anderson is just as prominent if not more so than his white partner trevor cobb cole hauser like the city itself however almost everybody here is damaged or desperate in some way after just a few minutes you want to know more about every bit of it the series opens with a flashback to the worst post katrina days when boulets former partner fled the chaos an abandonment that is echoed in the present as boulet surveys his old neighborhood and the for sale signs on the decrepit houses of former residents who are never coming back the lawlessness continues as well the cops of "k ville" are working in a semi "blade runner" environment where the criminals steal street signs so the police cant find their way around for added authenticity the opening episode also features a woman who has bought a car with her fema relief money "i gotta ride in style " she explains to which boulet replies "on the taxpayers backs " against the backdrop of a ravaged city two sorts of struggles are going on one is emotional as the main characters try to put their lives together boulet seems to be the most wounded but his partner cobb has demons too closer to the surface the series is about fighting bad guys and the first episode kicks off with a drive by shooting at a charity event to raise money for the citys ninth ward which was home to many of the citys poorest people the violence escalates from there as the cops try to figure out whether a jilted lover is taking revenge or whether a more sinister plot is afoot involving a casino owner and some corrupt security guards the action scenes gunfire explosions car chases happen so fast that they can seem surreal in the worst sense as can the speed with which mysteries are solved no matter what counts here and what makes the show work is atmosphere theres no way a tv show can capture the real drama of new orleanians trying to rebuild and some locals may not appreciate the hollywood piggybacking on their tragedy that said as the denizens of "k ville" move among the ruins of the city the real and the fake merge until you forget that this is mere entertainment its a new experience and an invigorating one this season of hbos "curb your enthusiasm" sundays p m et also features hurricane victims as it began last week larry david and his fictional wife cheryl cheryl hines took in a family of african americans who had been displaced by a storm other than that its business as usual for larry hes still karmically challenged who among us hasnt been tempted to smash a peeping smoke detector rather than crawl up to change its exhausted battery yet who else but larry has been punished by a real fire later starting in the room with the disabled detector he still blunders into sticky situations like the one that begins at an erotic bakery he is still appallingly devious who but larry would steal bouquets from a roadside death memorial for all his flaws the larry david of "curb" is also a worthy crusader when it comes to identifying what he calls "the unwritten rules of society " is there for instance a limit to how many samples a person can taste when there is a line of other customers waiting do dry cleaners really believe that if they lose your shirt it doesnt matter because you will eventually take home someone elses this week larry skewers the concept of anonymous donations in which people get credit for modesty but makes sure their identity isnt a secret "faux anonymity" may not be the largest problem of our time but how exhilarating and even liberating it is to see this and so many other tiny conventions exploded each week "inside the living body" sunday p m et national geographic channel is a glorious thing using high tech cameras and graphics it takes us on a fascinating journey inside the body of a person beginning as a baby girl in the womb as she develops matures and declines over a period of some years one warning after
