weekend journal hollywood report lights camera geopolitics hollywood shelves fluff for slate of war movies risk of viewer fatigue the election is still more than a year away but judging from this falls movie schedule hollywood filmmakers believe the time has come to capitalize on a lame duck presidency and unfavorable public sentiment toward the wars in afghanistan and iraq and the governments antiterror tactics in coming weeks hollywood is releasing a slew of films that deal with current geopolitical issues they include "the kingdom " with jamie foxx as the leader of an fbi antiterrorist team "lions for lambs " featuring tom cruise as a senator crafting foreign policy and "charlie wilsons war " the story of a former congressmans activities in afghanistan during the soviet occupation starring tom hanks and julia roberts studio executives say they believe intelligent audiences are ready for thought provoking movies especially after a highly successful popcorn fare summer built on an unprecedented string of franchise sequels like "pirates of the caribbean " "spider man" and "shrek " they say the timing of these releases which stretch from this week to the end of the year is largely a coincidence mike nichols director of "charlie wilsons war " says hes not worried that audiences will reject the movie because it has thematic similarities to competitors "i suppose women worry for a minute if everybody will be wearing the same dress but beyond that you cant really be too concerned " moviegoers havent always embraced films about politics and war they often come up short at the box office despite critical raves and outsized expectations many highly touted titles like mr nicholss film "primary colors" and "jarhead " released in found only modest audiences "hotel rwanda " the film about the genocide in rwanda earned three oscar nominations in but was ranked out of the top movies at the u s box office critics say hollywood with its distinct liberal bias lacks credibility when it comes to making political films some executives say they wonder if moviegoers confronted with grim realities on the nightly news will want to see fictionalized versions of them as entertainment "i am concerned about viewer fatigue " says chris carlisle president of domestic theatrical marketing at new line cinema which is releasing "rendition" on oct "a lot of people dont want to hear another thing about whats wrong with the government " hollywoods geopolitical tilt is a departure from the fall television season which is dominated by lighter fare and it represents a frontier for filmmakers who have generally waited until long after great global events to take critical looks it wasnt until "the deer hunter" was released in and francis ford coppolas "apocalypse now" opened in that the vietnam war was critically explored other vietnam related films like "full metal jacket" and "platoon" didnt arrive in theaters until the mid s films about the gulf war like "jarhead" and "three kings " came out well after the conflict jonathan kuntz a professor of film history at the school for theater film and television at the university of california los angeles says he believes the catalyst for this change of attitude was the popularity and financial success of michael moores modest &# million documentary "fahrenheit " which took in &# million world wide and effectively broke the unspoken hollywood taboo against attacking current events currently "since that film hollywood is a lot more willing to green light films like that hoping to capture the same box office success " he says one of this years films "lions for lambs " was developed and polished into its final form in about one year an uncharacteristic speed for a major hollywood movie with a roughly &# million budget its the first production from the revived united artists studio which is being run by tom cruise and his producing partner paula wagner the movie in which mr cruise stars alongside meryl streep and robert redford who also directed the film details the interplay between two soldiers in afghanistan and the impact on the political scene back home mr redford plays a college professor who unwittingly inspired the duo to enlist in the army director paul haggis whose new film "in the valley of elah " see a review on w stars tommy lee jones charlize theron and susan sarandon in a classic murder mystery set against the backdrop of the iraq war makes no bones about his political stance "im very political and was very much against this war and the afghanistan war before we invaded " he says he describes the film as a political "trojan horse" disguised as a murder mystery mr haggis the oscar winning writer director of s "crash " launched the project during the early phase of the war when public sentiment was largely behind the conflict he says the current public mood will make it much easier to market the film which opens today "it would have been impossible if the war had gone as well as the president predicted or had there been another major terrorist attack " mr haggis says studio executives are quick to declare that their movies are intended to be thought provoking entertainment not politically charged diatribes polly cohen president of time warner inc s warner independent which distributed "in the valley of elah " says she never saw it "as a big weighty political movie for me its more of a movie about families " gavin hood the south africa born director of new lines "rendition " says he hopes his movie will be "an emotional and thrilling piece of entertainment that will also generate discussion " the movie which stars jake gyllenhaal reese witherspoon and ms streep is a tale about secret cia interrogation policies and a family torn apart when a green card carrying husband is quietly arrested by the u s government and disappears seemingly without a trace while he says many of the details about government tactics in the film are largely unknown to the public mr hood says it will have to walk a fine line to bring in moviegoers "theres always a challenge if a film is perceived as political people may react poorly if its preachy in some way " he says mr carlisle of new line puts it this way "its not about iraq and doesnt beat you over the head with some message " some films with political overtones are basically action movies general electric co s universal pictures is betting &# million on "the kingdom " which stars mr foxx and jennifer garner will draw audiences who also enjoyed the studios "the bourne ultimatum " that movie has raked in &# million world wide since its release on aug "the kingdom " which opens sept has been incubating for more than a decade it was first envisioned by director peter berg as a movie about terrorism in the saudi kingdom around the time of the khobar towers bombings the film whose makers got technical advice from the fbi is a high gloss production with saudi locations painstakingly recreated in suburban phoenix some sequences were filmed in abu dhabi it has all the flourishes of an action picture lots of car chases explosions and nerve rattling gunfights as well as an examination of families and cross cultural relationships unlike "rendition " "elah " and "lions for lambs " which will have to rely largely on word of mouth "the kingdom" is being supported by a flashy marketing campaign if theres any film that could bear the brunt of viewer fatigue it is universals "charlie wilsons war " which does not hit theaters until christmas day it features mr hanks ms roberts and phillip seymour hoffman in the story of former u s congressman charlie wilson whose activities during the afghan soviet conflict in the s had far reaching consequences for the taliban regime years later like "elah " "charlie wilson" is based on a true story it was told as a segment on " minutes" and later in a book on which the film is based mr nichols says the movie is really a story about a mans transformation from a fun loving skirt chaser to someone who aided the afghan rebels in defeating communism "the secret weapon is that its very entertaining " he says "which is hard to do when war is in the title or afghanistan communist russia or any of the other catch phrases that get attached to it "
