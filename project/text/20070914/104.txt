weekend journal taste de gustibus elaine and puddy a match made on earth in an episode of "seinfeld" that lays bare the characters secular sensibilities elaine is shocked to learn that her on again off again boyfriend puddy is a believing christian "so is it a problem that im not really religious " she asks him upon realizing their differing worldviews "not for me " he answers "im not the one going to hell " though elaine herself acknowledges that she doesnt believe in an afterlife she becomes increasingly angry with puddy for not caring more about her eternal damnation finally she explodes "you should be trying to save me " however unlikely the "seinfeld" writers seem to have nailed one of the essential problems of evangelical christians dating outside their faith community what some jokingly refer to as "missionary dating " lisa ann cockrel the managing editor of brazos press a christian publisher writes in an email that "hell is a good barometer for what a christian will think about missionary dating " in other words if puddy really thought elaine was going to experience such a fate could he really date her let alone marry her without trying to save her christians generally trace the prohibition against dating nonbelievers to this passage from corinthians "be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness " but many young evangelicals wonder whether there might be exceptions an advice column in todays christian woman tackles the question "is it a sin to marry a non christian " and a christian teen magazine called brio advises girls on "what to do if someone you know is missionary dating " interfaith dating and marriage has long been a subject of concern among smaller religious groups like jews in part out of fear that their numbers are diminishing evangelical leaders are now tuning in to this conversation there are a variety of factors at work here as americans become more geographically mobile and attend college in higher numbers they are encountering more people outside of their religious communities these encounters are bound to lead to more romantic relationships for evangelicals who want to pair up with others of the same faith but dont manage to do so in their early s trouble lies ahead particularly for women evangelical churches now typically have a split between women and men which means that there are many more single evangelical women out there than their male counterparts as ms cockrel explains "i have friends who wanted to marry a christian guy are still single and are more and more open to dating non christians as they get older theyre tired of waiting " margaret nagib a year old single psychologist who lives outside of chicago sympathizes "sometimes its just nice to go out on a date " ms nagib was seeing a non christian for three months earlier this year she talked with him very early on about her faith and even told him that she would "never consider being serious with someone who wasnt christian " ms nagib says that when he told her he was agnostic she could have ended it right then but the two "clicked really well " he went to church with her and read a book on christianity that she recommended but ultimately the two broke up he asked how her faith would affect their relationship if they got married "when i think of our wedding ceremony i want it to glorify god and when i think of marriage and obviously children they should glorify god " ms nagib says that she has no regrets about the relationship "god brought me into his life for a reason " but she also offers advice for anyone going into such a situation "you should know what your nonnegotiables are you should talk about faith soon " and she also suggests that if you find yourself "becoming defensive about it with your friends theres probably a problem " in fact for older evangelicals it is less often their parents than their friends who steer them away from such relationships camerin courtney a columnist at christiansinglestoday com tells me that most christian parents are just concerned that "their children find someone they love and who loves them back " but pastors regularly remind their flocks to avoid dating outside the faith lee strobel formerly a teaching pastor at saddleback church in southern california and the author of "surviving a spiritual mismatch in marriage " tells people that "conjugal evangelism" doesnt work "if youre feeling like if i just marry this person ill be able to influence him toward god its self deception " he notes that "the nonbeliever is more likely to pull the christian away from his faith " this is a contention by the way that sociologists like brad wilcox at the university of virginia generally support mr wilcox explains "evangelicals who marry nonevangelicals are typically less likely to remain as or become as devout as those who marry within the fold " but mr strobel may be the exception that proves the rule he and his wife leslie were both irreligious when they married when their second child was an infant leslie started to explore her faith shortly after mr strobels wife became a christian and he thought that they would "probably divorce " the issues dividing them quickly came to the fore "we started clashing on whether to give money to the church how we would spend our weekends what we would teach the kids to believe every area of life is affected by faith " after a couple of years though mr strobel himself became a christian and the two are now spiritually matched it is true that both men and women often return to religion once they marry and have children but mr wilcox says in effect dont count on it "promises to convert or to attend church with a spouse on sunday are often broken after the wedding day once the romantic bloom is off " ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
