season often stopping at places within walking distance of some of the homes that had been targeted for foreclosure he has adopted a political platform that calls for stern penalties for predatory lenders and enhanced rights for homeowners who have borrowed from them though not all subprime lenders employ predatory tactics loan experts say some of the nationstar and green tree mortgages in question shared covenants and restrictions that are common in predatory loans these included above market interest rates that rose but could never fall and stiff prepayment penalties that discouraged borrowers from refinancing if their credit ratings or interest rates improved though fortress is publicly traded private equity businesses are notoriously secretive few public documents show how the company distributes its various assets through the funds it manages an edwards campaign official said mr edwards determined in consultation with fund managers that his holdings in an investment pool

in companies that dealt in subprime loans or engaged in anti union practices the campaign official said mr edwards reiterated this position in recent conversations with the fund managers "he gave them very specific instructions " the official said mr edwards said in recent interviews that his campaign has had difficulty tracking down the new orleans area families targeted for foreclosure by fortress affiliated lending companies most of the families dont live on the properties in question many of the houses havent been fully repaired after the storm and a handful were sold at public auction acorn has substantial operations in the storm region and has a history of finding families in similar straits campaign spokesman eric schultz said mr edwards has pledged to help raise
