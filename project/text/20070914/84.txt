the evening wrap banking issues online edition merrill lynchs disclosure today on some of its subprime mortgage backed assets hints of what might lurk on other investment banks balance sheets in a filing friday with the securities and exchange commission merrill lynch said it has adjusted the value of securities backed by subprime mortgages and other assets signaling a possible drag on earnings "credit market conditions have continued to remain challenging in the third quarter and the firm as part of its regular accounting processes has made requisite fair value valuation adjustments as appropriate to certain of these exposures which are reflected in our third quarter to date results " the company said in its second quarter report filed last month the firm mentioned that challenging first half market conditions intensified in the beginning of the third quarter the worlds biggest brokerage didnt delve into details in todays filing about what kind of tweaks it made to valuations or how much they were worth but it was of particular interest seeing as some of the biggest names on wall street are due to report earnings next week and some analysts like deutsche banks mike mayo think that numbers from the likes of goldman sachs bear stearns and lehman brothers could provide the "best snapshot yet" of market dislocations on the other hand it remains to be seen how clear that snapshot will be since giving too clear a picture of the size of mark downs could send shares south in a hurry as mr mayo wrote in his research note earlier this week stocks of brokers should move on "how much in losses if any are incurred above expectations on subprime and lbo loans and guidance on permanent impairment to earnings growth or at least into next year " and if theyre looking for other sources of anxiety as they await quarterly reports from lehman brothers tuesday morgan stanley wednesday bear stearns and goldman sachs thursday financial sector investors could always fret over the state of the economy which todays numbers on retail sales and industrial production suggest downshifted last month if a recession looms "we believe significantly more downside for the stocks looms " wrote analysts from sandler oneill in an earnings preview for brokers earlier this month sandler oneills analysts said they "expect economic growth to continue and accordingly believe buy the brokers is still the right cyclical call however we cede that the probability of a housing led u s recession has increased significantly in the last few months " and of course tuesdays meeting of the federal reserves interest rate setting federal open market committee which is largely expected to cut rates by basis points if not could also come into play as the banks report earnings "banks and brokers should benefit from the likely first fed easing in over four years " wrote deutsche banks mr mayo stocks idle as big week looms stocks edged up slightly friday following the news of difficulty
