weekend journal review television band of bozos some reviewers have compared nbcs new crime drama "the black donnellys" to other recent offerings that feature irish gangsters including the oscar winning "the departed " but it seems to owe much more to the "sopranos " where every bad deed inevitably leads to another which necessitates lots of graphic bludgeonings shootings and carving up of stinking dead bodies mondays p m est one big difference between hbos italian mafia family hit and nbcs story about four irish brothers behaving badly in new yorks hells kitchen is that the donnelly boys are buff young men not slobby middle aged ones another difference which may be fatal for the new show is that neither the acting here or the writing rises above the basic nastiness of the characters as they stumble from one brutal act to another accompanied by a hip rock soundtrack were not watching dramatic art its more like "dawsons creek" for psychopaths the basic premise of the show is that family bonds are stronger than anything in the first episode we were introduced to brother tommy jonathan tucker as a sensitive art student whose studies are interrupted because he has to get his brothers out of trouble theres jimmy tim guidry the thief drunkard and drug supplier with the pretty blond girlfriend who craves heroin theres kevin billy lush the degenerate gambler and all around idiot and finally theres pretty boy sean michael stahl david who so far seems to have very little personality at all when some of the brothers kidnap an italian mob bookie to whom kevin is indebted tommy cleans up that mess by killing both the local italian and irish mob bosses then he smashes up for disposal purposes the body of the bookie who was shot earlier in the grisly day by brother jimmy sean meanwhile has been beaten nearly to death by the bookies friends the donnelly boys loving mother figures out what her boys have been up to but loyally keeps mum like the hardened character she is so does tommys love interest a bar owner named jenny olivia wade who cleans up the bookies blood so the cops wont find it and then goes to bed with tommy in the kind of fever only homicide can create the next morning though she dumps him for at least temporarily a muffin delivery man and so it goes in subsequent episodes as new irish and italian criminal bosses with axes to grind as well as a real ax for torture pop up poor tommy hes going to be sucked into a life he never wanted forced to kill and connive as long as this show lasts what it all is supposed to mean is impossible to tell presumably were expected to accept that a man who will kill for his family but regrets the blood splatter is a morally interesting character but everything from the dim lights to the stilted dialogue seems fake here take the epigraphs from the likes of dostoevsky and yeats that flash on the screen at the beginning of episodes its the kind of trick a sophomore might pull on a college paper to try to make his relatively inane thoughts seem significant "to be irish is to know that in the end the world will break your heart " reads one epigraph attributed to the late sen daniel patrick moynihan well the only thing broken in this show is heads and bones unless you count the moments when the loving brothers get into fights with each other and at least one time so far pull a gun on a sibling the attempts at humor including wisecracks supplied by a hinky family friend named joey ice cream who is supposedly narrating the donnellys story from prison are almost as painful as the absence of dramatic artistry though there is one moment that sums up the whole show when a drunken jimmy is seated at a bar next to a barfly of indeterminate gender "i have three of the best damned brothers you could ask for " jimmy says " they killed for me " "id kill for better conversation " his companion replies pretty apt for a barfly for genuine suffering and victims worthy of our empathy there is the real world including north korea where million souls endure conditions worse than anything peta ever filmed not that "inside north korea" national geographic channel monday p m unearthed many grisly new details about life under the stalinist inspired cult founded by kim il sung and now continued by his son kim jong il unfortunately for the people of north korea their country is so small the size of mississippi that it has proved possible to isolate them entirely from the outside world for more than years presumably some still have the capacity to resent poverty and starvation for the regime operates concentration camps the size of small cities where the families of anyone who has displayed less than perfect devotion to the party and the kims are confined and often worked to death yet correspondent lisa ling was unable to find a single sign of discontent when she sneaked into the capital of pyongyang along with a camera crew by posing as part of a medical team there to conduct cataract surgery the doctor in charge a nepalese surgeon named sanduk ruit operated on more than people in days while ms ling was there inside the hospital the abysmal lack of facilities as basic as soap and water was obvious when they visit an apartment however they discovered nothing more than family members kowtowing before pictures on the wall the only picture seen anywhere of the kims they also were allowed to film the unveiling literally of dr ruits plus patients many of whom had been blind for years as the bandages came off each one blinked and a few even smiled as the success of their operation became clear within seconds though each was squealing with praises for kim jong il thanking him for saving their eyesight one by one they took their first steps as sighted people to the front of the large hall to scream and bawl and bow in front of a huge portrait of kim "thank you great general " one woman shrieks "i will work harder in the salt mines " and each time one of the saved exclaims the crowd goes wild too "we praise you we praise you " they cry out from behind their still bandaged heads it is difficult to watch this without feeling a little sorry for dr ruit whose humanitarian work in developing countries probably will not after this film has aired include north korea it is very painful to see so many fellow humans apparently reduced to a state of sentience no higher than a rabbits ms ling speculates that fear makes them fall into line a more horrifying thought is that million people in a country that has nuclear weapons are now beyond fear
