the morning brief the ever pressing issue of deficient health care online edition the wall street journal online deficiencies of the u s health care system have been a dominant political issue for decades even if they were overshadowed by national security in the years following each week of early seems to bring new evidence that health care will again be a defining issue in the presidential races of proposals for universal insurance coverage have recently proliferated across corporate america and among local governments and now a new poll suggests a majority of americans also back such ideas and are even willing to pay higher taxes to fund them the survey conducted for the new york times and cbs found iraq to be the overarching political issue but that access to affordable health care outranks immigration tax cuts and the promotion of "traditional values" on the publics domestic agenda a majority of respondents favored a federal guarantee of health insurance for every american and the survey found what the times calls a striking willingness to pay as much as &# in additional taxes a year and to forgo future tax cuts "but the same divisions that doomed the last effort at creating universal health insurance under the clinton administration are still apparent " the times adds "americans remain divided largely along party lines over whether the government should require everyone to participate in a national health care plan and over whether the government would do a better job than the private insurance industry in providing coverage " still the recent support from big business long worried about the liabilities of employee health costs may help channel this popular concern into more workable or at least debatable policy options and there is no shortage of studies to back advocates for change one of the latest from the health care advocacy group families usa indicates that "hospitalized children who lack health insurance are twice as likely to die from their injuries as those with insurance " usa today reports that report which shows how uninsured children receive less expensive treatments and are discharged earlier was sent this week to congressional committees looking into how the country might help its million uninsured people which include nine million children adding to the funding quandaries science reports that the national cancer institutes demand for deep cuts in clinical trials is hitting trials for cancer ridden children particularly hard the nci part of the national institutes for health has sought cost reductions from the groups that run large scale cancer trials which puts at risk trials and reduces the patient slots by science says while only of adults with cancer enroll in such trials more than of children do william woods a member of the childrens oncology groups scientific council and president of the american society of pediatric hematology oncology tells the magazine "we had to play solomon and try to figure out which kids would we affect the least " a timely arrest in pakistan american doubts about pakistans cooperation in antiterror efforts have been growing for years even if they werent formally voiced by the bush administration this week apparently on the same day vice president dick cheney conveyed white house concerns to pakistani president pervez musharraf pakistani authorities arrested the former defense minister of the taliban in the city of quetta this despite repeated denials from pakistani officials that the taliban and al qaeda were staging operations in afghanistan from pakistan a u s official tells the los angeles times that mullah obaidullah akhund had access to the highest levels of the taliban and a government official tells the new york times that "hes a big fish but nobody around here thinks this will deal a permanent blow to the operations of the taliban " newsweeks michael hirsh views the cheney trip to pakistan as tacit acknowledgement that the administrations past declarations of "excellent" progress in afghanistan were faulty at a time when the taliban is clearly growing as a threat there and he groups this turnaround with the white houses recent reversals of refusals to join talks that include iran and syria and to talk with north korea before it gave up its nuclear arms "the bush administration has grown enamored of making what i would call "nonconcession concessions " he writes "president george w bush and his senior aides are correcting course big time and implicitly admitting previous errors without any acknowledgement that they are doing so " yesterday officials told the washington post that secretary of state condoleezza rice has named as her counselor eliot a cohen an outspoken critic of the postwar occupation of iraq

million and were mapped out on a poster board by the u s attorney in manhattan michael garcia "clearly " he said "greed is at work " also of note washington post the commander of walter reed army medical center was fired after the army said it had lost trust and confidence in his leadership in the wake of a scandal over outpatient treatment of wounded troops including some who were kept in squalid conditions at the washington hospital complex but the interim reappointment of former walter reed commander lt gen kevin c kiley to replace maj gen george w weightman surprised some defense
