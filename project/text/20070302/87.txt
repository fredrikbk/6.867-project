the armys top civilian official is stepping down while the white house is preparing a far reaching inquiry into the care received by wounded soldiers president bush will appoint a commission to investigate the quality of care at the nations military and veterans hospitals as the scandal surrounding walter reed army medical center continues to percolate a series of articles in the washington post detailed how wounded soldiers returning from battlefields in iraq and afghanistan faced squalid conditions and an imposing and inefficient bureaucracy at the medical center and since the articles were published anger over the conditions they described has only increased late this afternoon mr gates announced that secretary of the army francis j harvey had resigned that news came just one day after the pentagon said army maj gen george w weightman had been relieved of his command of walter reed stating in a bluntly worded release that it had "lost trust and confidence" in his leadership those departures may not be the only consequence of the controversy "i am disappointed that some in the army have not adequately appreciated the seriousness of the situation pertaining to outpatient care at walter reed " mr gates said in a sign of how urgent the issue has become president bush intends to devote his weekly radio address scheduled for broadcast tomorrow to veterans health care and the white house made portions of the planned speech available to the media in advance "one of my most solemn experiences as president is visiting men and women recovering from wounds they suffered in defense of country " mr bush says in the address "spending time with these wounded warriors is also inspiring because so many of them bring the same courage they showed on the battlefield to their battle for recovery " though the review is springing from the controversy over walter reed the president will demand that the panel cast a wide net in order to determine whether similar problems have shadowed other facilities "the review will examine the treatment of the wounded from the time they leave the battlefield to their return to civilian life as veterans so that we can assure that were meeting their physical and mental health needs " dana perino a white house spokeswoman said separately mr bush may be moving toward making some adjustments in his requests for funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan the numbers that could change include the &# billion the president has asked for to help sustain a planned increase of around troops in iraq in the coming months after vice
