lightfleet lets computer data hitch a ride on a laser beam a start up company has developed an unusual way to use lasers to speed the flow of data inside a computer hoping to break a bottleneck that can hamper machines using many microprocessors the company lightfleet inc plans to sell servers it predicts will be much more efficient than existing systems in tackling tough computing problems the tasks could include automatically recognizing a face in a video image or sifting through billions of financial transactions for signs of illegal activity researchers for years have been trying to handle such chores with variants of parallel computing gang tackling problems with chips or systems that use the equivalent of many electronic brains getting answers to complex calculations can be slowed as each microprocessor waits for data being processed by other chips networks inside most servers can easily pass a message from a single microprocessor to another congestion can arise as many chips try to simultaneously send messages to many others lightfleet said new servers it plans to begin selling next summer which will use dual processor chips from intel corp can do such feats easily "once you say everything is connected all the time you do things you never did before " said john peers lightfleets chief executive engineers at the closely held camas wash company decided to exploit lasers but not in the way they are usually used for communications ordinarily such optical networking devices send tightly focused pulses of light down stands of fiber optic cabling lightfleet is doing the opposite using lenses to spread out laser beams and bounce the light off a mirror to send data around a system each microprocessor is installed with a laser transmitter and a set of devices that receive beams of light carrying messages from other chips the light is reflected off the mirror and passes through focusing lenses to the receivers messages from each processor or any combination of them are simultaneously sent to all the other microprocessors each receiver only picks out the messages intended for it because of special addressing information sent with the light beams the design is particularly efficient at sending "all to all" messages between chips in a system said bill dress a lightfleet senior scientist and co inventor of the technology because the system sends light through air lightfleet avoids the need for wiring and associated switching circuitry and software he adds "you dont have traffic issues and messages colliding " said jeffrey hewitt an analyst at the research firm gartner inc "i think it is very interesting " convincing the market about an unfamiliar technology is a tall order mr hewitt said fully exploiting lightfleets technology could require rewriting programs one skeptic is steve scott chief technology officer at supercomputer maker cray inc he said conventional electronic connections inside such machines already distribute data adequately the real bottleneck he said comes from the connecting pins on chips that limit how fast they can send and receive data mr scott questions whether laser based connections are worth the added cost some scientists are eager to try it including those at oregon state universitys college of oceanic and atmospheric sciences big computers there combine data from an array of sensors to model complex phenomena such as the way climate changes affect ocean currents and micro organisms those complex calculations are limited by how quickly processors can communicate said charles sears manager of research computing for the college after being briefed on lightfleets technology "we said this looks pretty exciting " added mark abbott dean of the college
