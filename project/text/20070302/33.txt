epa targets train ships to cut smog washington continuing a seven year crackdown on diesel engine pollution the environmental protection agency is proposing to all but eliminate the soot and smog related emissions of locomotive engines and similar diesel engines used in ships epa administrator stephen johnson is expected to announce the proposal today in newark n j an industrial area plagued by the kind of pollution problems the new rules are intended to minimize "epa is on track to make that black puff of diesel smoke go the way of the steam engine " said mr johnson who estimated the health benefits will be times the estimated &# billion to &# billion cost of implementing the reductions but general electric co the nations largest locomotive maker and currently involved in an advertising campaign touting the ecological benefits of its new locomotives and some of its other products has told epa officials in private meetings that the new rule is "unlikely to be achieved" even with some scientific breakthroughs patrick jarvis a spokesman for ges transportation business declined to comment on the epas plan saying ge didnt know what was in it he said ge would review the ruling and offer its comment to the epa "well be focused on a balanced approach that achieves aggressive" emissions reduction and fuel reduction savings mr jarvis said the rule would require that nitrogen oxide emissions from the most modern locomotives such as general electrics evolution model be reduced more than another locomotive maker along with diesel engine makers and catalyst manufacturers have told the epa they believe they can meet the new specifications which will require the installation of special catalytic converters similar to those used on big diesel powered trucks to remove nitrogen oxides that cause smog the proposal which mr johnson said he hopes will take effect by the end of this year will require most existing locomotives to meet new engine emissions standards when they are overhauled beginning next year a second phase of the rule starting in will apply new standards to newly manufactured engines starting in the rule will require owners of diesel powered ships that cause pollution in u s ports to install the smog reducing catalytic converters the proposal is the last step in a campaign by epa to sharply reduce diesel related pollution
