weekend journal the drivers seat a jeep by any other name if theres one thing that stands out in the volumes of punditry surrounding the potential sale of the american "half" of daimlerchrysler its a shared perspective on jeep does anyone disagree with the notion that this is the crown jewel of the old chrysler corp never mind that last year the companys dodge division sold more trucks than jeep did the consensus is that any potential suitor will be primarily interested in the venerable marque that can trace its lineage directly to world war ii thats because jeep is authentic in a way that madison avenue cant manufacture and even its german owners since havent been able to screw up the word itself became used as a generic term decades ago and as the progenitor of the entire sport utility segment jeep enjoys a following as fanatical as any no matter how much the truck market slides until we successfully pave over every last square mile of the planet there will be a need and desire for real suvs and thats jeeps forte how curious then that the newest jeep is being sold as a dodge a compact model dubbed nitro dont be fooled by its overblown grille and badges this truck is as jeep as jeep gets from its boxy shape and flat hood to the giant wheel flares reminiscent of the wrangler renegade of the early s the nitro is even built in toledo ohio the marques birthplace alongside the jeep liberty on which it is based that means the nitro shares the libertys horsepower liter v and is available in both rear wheel drive and four wheel drive configurations though the dodge offers an optional liter v that boosts horsepower to that engine comes with a five speed automatic transmission unavailable with the smaller v which is mated to either a six speed manual or an optional four speed automatic combined fuel economy will be stuck in the mid to high teens regardless of which engine transmission or driveline you choose miles of driving in a four wheel drive nitro with the liter engine and four speed automatic netted me miles per gallon with a starting price of &# the nitro undercuts the lowest priced liberty by almost &# though ordering the big engine can push the msrp close to &# on the whole the nitro seems reasonably priced for what you get but only if you place a premium on the trucks anachronistic qualities those start with the exterior styling which seems fresh only because weve reached the baroque period in the evolution of suvs they increasingly look like either steroidal station wagons or terrestrial spaceships the nitro just looks like what it is a dumb truck the dodge has an old fashioned solid rear axle rather than an independent rear suspension that gives it the durability of a truck for real off roading but means the nitros ride isnt as soft as that of some car based suvs its standard four wheel drive system is only a part time one meaning the driver needs to activate it for slippery conditions by turning a knob on the console and remember to switch back to two wheel drive for normal conditions or risk damaging the drivetrain perhaps the only thing holding the nitro back from serious off road duty is its lack of a low gear mode for the four wheel drive system in two wheel drive the power is sent rearward like god and the u s army intended this is no namby pamby front wheel drive car turned into a "cute ute " inside the theme continues with a simple instrument panel layout and an unimaginative yet functional interior that places everything right where you expect it unsurprisingly the cheap looking plastic door panels vibrate when you turn up the stereo at least the seats are comfortable and supportive the nitros major engineering change from the liberty is that its wheelbase the distance between the front and rear axle has been lengthened by inches which improves the ride markedly the nitro feels substantially more stable at highway speed and smoother over rough pavement than the liberty though the steering is vague no one will ever accuse the nitro of emulating the forgiving ride of a luxury sedan the current vogue among suvs yet while cruising along a rutted dirt road covered with a few inches of snow its more direct connection with the ground becomes a virtue dodge calls the nitro a midsize suv but its really a large compact though a nearly perfect size for five passengers its easy to drive easy to navigate even through crowded city streets and a breeze to park thanks to its inch length by comparison the standard bearer ford explorer midsize suv is inches long and even the midsize toyota camry sedan stretches to inches with most of the small and midsize suv market shifting toward car based models the nitro seems thoroughly behind the times but that very fact gives it its distinctive charm its more endearing than the liberty whose cartoon like lines look even more wrong today than they did when that model replaced the much loved jeep cherokee for the model year if the nitro carried jeeps trademark seven slot grille it would serve nicely as a refreshed liberty but alas the powers that be have decreed that this jeep will be a dodge meanwhile jeeps two new nameplates for the compass and patriot are both based on the front wheel drive dodge caliber a compact wagon go figure clearly this product strategy bears out the old adage "its a jeep thing you wouldnt understand " too
