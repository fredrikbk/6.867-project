weekend journal tastings a new everyday chardonnay south americas restrained spin on an old favorite we both took a sip of the chardonnay and smiled "its a throwback to our yoots " dottie said and john knew just what she meant even the "yoots" part we were in the middle of a tasting borne of history disappointment and curiosity heres the story when we were growing up inexpensive chardonnay was an everyday pleasure its easy round embracing tastes made it the perfect wine to keep in the refrigerator at all times ready to greet us when we got home from a long day at work we went through many different ones but our house chardonnay for years was estancia from california in the s our house chardonnay became jacobs creek from australia these werent wines to dissect discuss and debate but simply to enjoy and they were inexpensive enough to enjoy regularly bad things have happened however to inexpensive chardonnay from california and australia in broad blind tastings over the past few years as well as in our real lives we have found them mostly unpleasant in far too many cases theyre sticky heavy and phony hard to drink at the same time the wines of chile and argentina have been coming on strong lately were especially big fans of chiles cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc and of argentinas malbec so we wondered is it possible that we should be looking toward chile and argentina for todays inexpensive everyday just plain pleasant chardonnay to be sure our off hand impression before our broad tasting was not great our sense was that most chardonnays wed tried from those countries were simple and lacked tasty fruit but we had never conducted a broad tasting of them now seemed like a good time we included both chile and argentina in the tasting because we figured we couldnt find enough under &# chardonnays from either country to conduct an entire tasting as it turned out there are more out there than we realized we ultimately found almost about two thirds from chile and one third from argentina we focused on recent vintages since these should generally be drunk young we tasted the wines in blind flights over several nights as always we were not looking for "the best" inexpensive chardonnay from chile or argentina but were trying to get an overall sense of their current state truly we had no idea what wed find the answer well its complicated the wines were generally light and in many cases seemed to have more in common with sauvignon blanc clean bright fruit some herbs zippy acidity than chardonnay our complaint with too many chardonnays from australia and california these days is that they have too much of everything these in contrast tended not to have quite enough of anything and in some cases seemed slightly watery and weak but given a choice the restraint and lightness of these wines was more pleasing and made them far easier to drink than the ponderous chardonnays weve tasted too often recently that said not one of them knocked our socks off of the eight wines we liked best we rated seven good very good they were pleasant in a january column about inexpensive american chardonnay three of our six favorites rated good very good and three were just good one other important note about the chilean and argentine wines in general they were not sweet unlike so many inexpensive chardonnays these days that alone was a huge relief they were clean and acidic enough to be good with spiced peel and eat shrimp or while slurping oysters overall we liked the fruit forward qualities of the wines they were crisp and lemony with some hints of tropical fruits on the whole they were not over oaked for all of those people who write to us and ask where to find non oaky chardonnay heres where to start your search in fact the structure of these wines seemed so slight that even a little bit too much oak was a big mistake there were some that got the balance of bright light fruit and oak just right it was one of these in fact that prompted dottie to recall our yoots thats a word from the movie "my cousin vinny " in which brooklyn lawyer joe pesci is talking to a southern judge about the "two yoots" hes representing "what is a yoot " asks the judge and the lawyer explains that he means "youths " the fact that this wine would not only remind us of the estancia and jacobs creek of our youth with their charming oaky roundness but would remind us of them within the terms of a whimsical movie says a lot it was concha y toro "marques de casa concha " which usually costs about &# concha y toro has been a consistent favorite in our tastings of various chilean wines for years our best of tasting was montes alpha which was bursting with ripe fruit and offered beautiful balance in a tasting of inexpensive chilean cabernet sauvignon last year montes was our best of tasting notably two wines we liked cost around &# which is always cause for celebration one was walnut crest from chile and the other was falling star from argentina the falling star as it happened was from which is older than wed usually buy this simple fruity wine the importer frederick wildman says the is currently on shelves we did not see it but wed certainly pick it up if we did all in all if we were looking for a simple charming inexpensive white tonight wed probably still get a sauvignon blanc from chile which we find consistently good but chardonnay lovers should certainly give these wines a try for the money theyre not much of a risk and many of them would be excellent with seafood fried chicken and light pastas and while its hard to think about it now these will be excellent wines this summer thanks to everyone who has already written to tell us about the wine and food you shared on open that bottle night well be
