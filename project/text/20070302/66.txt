omnicom ex executive may aid in suit amended complaint could bolster claims over securities fraud new allegations by a former omnicom group inc executive could provide legal ammunition to claims in a four year old securities fraud lawsuit that the ad giant created a sham entity seneca investments to improperly avoid taking write downs on its internet assets in an amended complaint filed last month in federal court in manhattan the former chief executive of seneca says omnicom controlled the entity and no other party contributed any assets to it the ad giant created seneca in to move ailing internet assets off its balance sheet in the lawsuit initially filed in december michael tierney a former omnicom executive who became ceo of seneca alleges omnicom owes him stock options valued at roughly &# million omnicom maintains the options never vested mr tierney left seneca in march his amended complaint also raises questions about senecas independence from omnicom making allegations that match similar charges in the securities fraud suit omnicom lawyer peter wald said in a statement yesterday "we strongly dispute mr tierneys contention that omnicom controlled seneca " among possible evidence in omnicoms defense is a deposition for an unrelated lawsuit in that deposition mr tierney said that he was only employed by seneca and not omnicom "the evidence clearly shows that mr tierney and his management team have been responsible for the successful day to day activities of seneca since may " mr wald said the securities fraud suits were filed against omnicom in after the wall street journal ran a page one article about seneca and other accounting practices at omnicom in march a judge dismissed two of the lawsuits three allegations involving omnicoms reporting of growth and liabilities the remaining accusation involves seneca the case is pending in federal court in manhattan omnicom the worlds largest ad holding company created seneca in may with pegasus capital advisors llp a greenwich conn based private equity firm and put ailing internet assets into the entity the main assets were stakes in three public internet marketing companies agency com organic and razorfish omnicom had originally acquired the investments during the technology boom but its internet strategy faltered when the boom ended omnicom said in an early filing with the securities and exchange commission that the assets were still worth about what it had paid for them but didnt disclose the price an internal spreadsheet that surfaced later in the securities fraud lawsuit says that it paid &# million but that the stakes value in march totaled &# million between late and mid omnicom used its seneca stock to buy back of organic and agency com which have prospered as the internet ad business has recovered in recent years when it created seneca omnicom said it had enlisted pegasus to help turn around the dot com businesses the deal was structured so that omnicom received preferred shares in seneca in return for the internet assets and some cash pegasus received common stock in seneca omnicom accounted for the seneca deal as an asset sale without reporting a gain or loss it says seneca was structured as an independent entity which allowed the company to avoid recording losses on the assets in his lawsuit mr tierney says that pegasus "contributed nothing and was required to contribute nothing" to seneca he also says that omnicom completely indemnified pegasus and paid the private equity firm roughly &# million in "management fees" to induce pegasus to be a seneca shareholder "this guy is alleging that pegasus is just an agent acting on omnicoms behalf thats a common allegation in this sort of case " says robert willens a tax and accounting analyst at lehman brothers "the result of this being correct would be that seneca would be a wholly owned subsidiary of omnicom and omnicom would have to report senecas results " says mr willens who isnt involved in the lawsuit "that would lead to a restatement no doubt and almost certainly some sort of write off or write down " omnicom argues that the dealings with pegasus were arms length it said in a filing with the sec that pegasus contributed cash to seneca and told its auditors likewise but senecas tax return for doesnt report cash from pegasus according to court documents in the securities fraud lawsuit lawyers for omnicom maintain in court filings in the securities fraud lawsuit that the transfer of assets to seneca was properly accounted for as confirmed by two independent auditing firms arthur andersen and kpmg and that an informal sec inquiry hasnt resulted in action "we certainly disagree with the characterizations of the factual allegations " adds pegasus attorney stephen m baldini a partner at akin gump strauss hauer &amp feld llp "this seems to be a dispute between an individual and omnicom " this isnt the first time mr tierney has sued over compensation issues in the early s he filed a lawsuit to retrieve money from a former employer his claim was rejected mr tierneys lawsuit paints seneca as an entity under omnicoms control "omnicom often made major decisions regarding seneca and its assets without informing" him says the complaint as ceo of seneca mr tierney says he reported directly to omnicoms chief executive john wren and chief financial officer randall weisenburger on a weekly basis in addition the complaint says he maintained all of his omnicom benefits and received w s listing omnicom as his employer through an omnicom spokesman mr wren declined to comment mr weisenburger didnt return messages yesterday seeking comment omnicom altered its relationship with mr tierney in as a result of the pending securities fraud lawsuit according to mr tierneys lawsuit the complaint says that omnicom told mr tierney that it was concerned that his continued work for omnicom in any capacity would support the claims in the securities fraud lawsuit relating to omnicoms control of seneca consequently mr tierney says omnicom refused to pay him for options he had allegedly received under his original employment agreement with the company
