checkmate for big labor this weeks "card check" victory marked the ultimate payoff for past democratic election support for house democrats it marked the end of the honeymoon democrats won in november in part by playing down their special interest patrons unions environmentalists trial lawyers and by playing up a new commitment to the moderate middle class the big question was whether the party had the nerve to govern the way it campaigned and card check was the first test the answer afl cio chief john sweeney isnt smiling for nothing up to now speaker nancy pelosi had kept her troops in line and her partys liberal wing in check the vaunted first " hours" was run like a military operation and revolved around a carefully chosen legislative agenda that would unify every faction in her party it was small potatoes but it worked and it was a lesson in how democrats can practice smart politics the card check in contrast is a lesson in how the partys liberal base forces democrats to back political losers the legislations only purpose is to give unions an unfair advantage in organizing namely by eliminating the secret ballot in union elections and instead allowing thugs to openly bully workers into joining up americans understand and despise this with polls showing of the public thinks card check is a racket democrats therefore left themselves wide open for their first public drubbing the card check gave republicans a rare opening to beat the daylights out of the new majority successfully accusing it of trashing democratic elections and shutting down free speech it unified the business community which put aside its disagreements on health care and immigration to instead team up to make the vote as painful as possible for ms pelosis moderate wing even the liberal press jumped ship and all this meanwhile for a vote that was largely symbolic president bush has vowed that a card check law is dead on arrival and that assumes the legislation could even make it through a senate filibuster which it cant as low points go this was the lowest the new majority has had so far the issue for ms pelosi is that this will undoubtedly not be the only low point the card check is instead the first illustration of the biggest dilemma democratic leaders will face over the next few years savvier party members understand the threat special interests pose to democrats ability to commune with more of america yet the party is completely dependent on those left wing interest groups to finance and man their electoral victories they want a return on their investment for years now unions have provided thousands of volunteers for get out the vote efforts more important theyve provided a huge purse to get democrats elected this time they handed over the money on condition that democrats support what has become their biggest priority this week they called in their chits many democrats also see the card check as vital to their political survival union membership has been nosediving for years in it dropped to just of workers the reigning belief is that if democrats dont do their part to reverse this decline theyll see a huge source of manpower and cash for future elections disappear the card check might be terrible politics but it is the best shot they have to force more americans into unions that will spend the dues to re elect democrats whatever the motivation enough democrats were willing to take a hit if it meant getting card check through not that they didnt attempt to lessen the sting one reason this was the first major domestic legislation up for a vote was that democrats were anxious to get it out of the way quickly and put space between it and next years election house insiders were this week referring to that strategy as the "rip off the band aid" approach this is gonna hurt so do it fast it also explains the pains house labor and education committee chairman george miller took to put the bill through as quietly as possible the card check will be the biggest change in labor law in decades yet mr miller allowed but a single hearing and markup on the issue that hearing was held in the middle of the houses very public iraq debate the better to avoid any notice the issue exploded nonetheless and it was the partys moderate wing that got caught in the crossfire big labor to its credit had approached the card check with a lot more political savvy than is usually the case in particular it started approaching democratic moderates several years ago demanding they co sponsor a card check bill while many in the blue dog wing wouldnt normally agree to such an anti business measure they saw this as a useful opportunity to score some union points after all republicans werent about to bring up the legislation the problem came when democrats won and they had to stand behind their previous support the unions other big coup was to get to this years democratic freshmen early in the electoral game labor explained that any union support they received in their tight races in gop leaning districts would be entirely conditioned on their later vote for card check most of them signed up for this devils bargain since as one democratic aide admitted "we didnt have a choice " the business community this week made sure that those democratic moderates felt the burn the coalition for a democratic workplace a group of more than business outfits against the card check earlier this week laid out a six figure radio buy for just three house districts targeting north carolinas heath shuler floridas tim mahoney and kansass nancy boyda all three ran as conservative democrats and have only tenuous grips on their seats the chamber of commerce spent another &# on radio ads targeting republicans and democrats who are also vulnerable next year the ads had an effect card check supporters had been hoping to get as many as votes instead they mustered just ms pelosi might remember that she only won last years election because of the success of these moderate candidates they were the ones who benefited most from democrats new promises to focus on "middle class" america and it is the democratic party as a whole that will suffer if those promises arent kept write to kim wsj com
