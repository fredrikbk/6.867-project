this week ignited a fire sale that caused shares to fall world wide a sign that china has joined the global market economy yet chinas transition from communism to capitalism remains a work in progress which could mean even more sellers in the months to come when china first permitted stock trading in it did so cautiously it divided ownership of listed companies into tradable and nontradable shares in part to keep the government in control of the companies going public on average just a third of each listed companys shares could be traded publicly the nontradable shares remained in the hands of a variety of big investors that often represented the state but which held back development of a western style stock market nearly two years ago beijing began overhauling the market to make all shares tradable the key aspect of the highly complex process was that each company would permit the sale of previously nontradable shares according to its own timetable the plan looked smart at the time pushing big risks into the future the reforms were a key reason for last years rise in the benchmark shanghai composite index now the day of reckoning appears imminent the lockup periods for selling the nontradable shares are starting to expire investors in about companies holding shares valued at around billion yuan or &# billion will be eligible to sell by year end estimates zhang gang a beijing based analyst at southwest securities co the huge gains in chinese share prices over the past months that pushed the stock markets overall value to more than &# trillion appear to have encouraged parent corporations state investors and other powerful institutions to begin taking advantage of their ability to trade and take profits on their investments regulatory filings show more than a dozen big investors have sold shares in companies listed on the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges in recent weeks the companies affected are those that had initially spearheaded the overhaul in a process that ultimately affected nearly all of the markets listed companies because these institutions are the controlling shareholders in many chinese companies even small sales from insiders can rattle prices indeed some analysts say some such sales were a significant factor in tuesdays sudden plunge in the shanghai composite index the plunge seemed to come unexpectedly the week began with a surge of individual investor enthusiasm in the first session after a weeklong break for the annual lunar new year monday the shanghai composite index was pushed to a record close above

losing yesterday to end at other off loaded holdings in recent weeks include chunks of one of the countrys main telecommunications equipment makers zte corp plus investments in famous makers of wine and construction machinery these insider sales could mark the beginning of a profit taking trend so "this is a valid concern which could result in too much supply " clsa ltd s china research chief li hui told her clients in a report the old share structure has been a nettlesome problem for chinas market for years the different classes of shares contributed to a mismatch of interests between small investors and the big often government shareholders who controlled listed companies holders of nontradable shares for instance had little incentive to take steps that might push the share price higher in the open market since they couldnt themselves trade in the market there were always worries that big investors especially the state would ultimately try to sell the kickoff to nearly five straight years of selling in china beginning in was concern that beijing would permit sale of the nontradable stock the restructuring launched in was arguably the most ambitious single undertaking chinese securities regulators ever introduced but it also invited the risk that for the first time big shareholders would have an opportunity to cash out of their investments just like individuals to make the reform palatable to the public and avoid gutting a market that at the time was already in the doldrums the government built in delays in the complex process preventing big shareholders from selling their newly tradable stakes for one to three years the reforms have been well received and millions of new investors have been drawn to the market not every big investor is expected to take advantage of rights to sell government entities for instance have little desire to lose control of the companies they own and most sales have been less than of a companys value news that some institutional investors had taken profits came as a "shock" to the broader market and future dissolutions could be a long lasting risk for the market says jerry lou an analyst at morgan stanley &amp co "the correction is not done yet and it is too early for bottom fishing " he said in a report european shares continue to slide on global factors european shares continued their march lower with global
