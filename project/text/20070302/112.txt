weekend journal taste houses of worship tomb of the still unknown ancients year after year in spring a new crop of religious dandelions pop up in our post christian culture like the real ones growing in my yard they make a colorful splash that briefly captures our attention until we realize that they are only shallow rooted weeds not beautiful flowers planted long ago in the deep rich soil of the past such as easter lilies last year it was the gnostic nonsense of the "da vinci code " weve had the "gospel of judas iscariot " written centuries after the eyewitnesses were dead this year its a variation on the "da vinci" theme we are not only being told that there was a mrs jesus aka mary magdalene we are also informed that her tomb and that of jesus have been found in jerusalem that dna testing has proved that they are not related and so must have been married how exactly does it prove that and that an ossuary or small casket of at least one of their offspring has been found as well news at or in this case on the discovery channels documentary "the lost tomb of jesus " scheduled for sunday night in a surreal moment on "larry king live" earlier this week the films producer james cameron of "titanic" fame told us with a straight face that we should all be thankful that we now have tangible evidence that jesus existed actually no serious historian of biblical antiquity has ever doubted that there was a historical jesus yet it tells us a lot about the state of our culture that mr camerons remark backed by pseudo science could be seriously made on national television and that the films companion book has already shot up to no on amazons rankings we are a jesus haunted culture that is so historically illiterate that anything can now pass for knowledge of jesus no doubt there are those who welcome "evidence" that undermines the foundation of christianity many people though are simply beguiled by the "obsolescence factor" in our technologically driven society the "newer" must be "truer" and "better " this outlook when applied to a subject like the historical jesus attracts all sorts of unbridled speculation and worse how momentous is the latest jesus as you never knew him story not very it is simply not true as mr camerons claims in his preface to simcha jacobovicis book "the jesus family tomb " that we have had no hard evidence for jesus existence before now except in the bible that ignores mentions in ancient roman and jewish historians such tacitus suetonius and josephus the "jesus tomb" explorers trot out statistics on ancient hebrew names claiming that the ones in the tomb sound too much like known jesus family members for the similarity to be a coincidence but since weve only excavated a minority of archaeological and tomb sites even in jerusalem most ancient names are still buried in the earth making meaningful statistical analysis difficult what we can say for certain is that most of the names found in the talpiot tomb on the outskirts of jerusalem have been seen in many places elsewhere in texts on potsherds in inscriptions in the bible itself they are not rare even by the standards of the limited evidence we do have any good scientific theory must account for all the evidence in this case all the names we find in the talpiot tomb and not just the ones that match the holy family theory for instance we have a matthew in the tomb but jesus had no brothers named matthew and where are brothers like simon or the sisters mentioned in mark and where especially is brother james we actually know that james was buried within sight of the temple mount and talpiot is miles from there eusebius the fourth century church historian saw the tomb and the standing inscribed slab in front of it you also have to ask yourself why would most of the holy family from galilee be buried in a middle class tomb several miles outside of jerusalem in some sheep pasture they were in fact poor and could not afford an ornamental tomb like this one this family was from nazareth too with connections in bethlehem why wouldnt its members be buried in one of those places we also know that crucifixion was considered the most shameful and hideous way to die a blow from which ones family honor did not soon recover if ever so shamefully did jesus die that his first followers and even most of his family abandoned him he was not buried by family members or by the galilean disciples he was put in a tomb near the old city that did not belong to any of them of course the main implicit contention of the documentary and book is that the resurrection is demonstrably a fraud and thus we must assume people like peter and james the brother of jesus were prepared to be martyred in grisly ways to perpetrate a fraud resurrection had only one meaning for early jews a miracle that happens to a persons body so that they are raised from the dead to skeptics no amount of counterargument will matter yet it wouldnt hurt for the rest of us to exercise a bit of skepticism when listening to each years new theories about jesus and the "true" history behind the biblical narrative amos kloner the archaeologist who supervised work at the tomb when it was first discovered in has called the documentarys claims "impossible" and "nonsense " as a new testament scholar i will trust serious scholars like him make no bones about it they have not found jesus tomb mr witherington is professor of new testament interpretation at asbury theological seminary in wilmore ky and the author of "what have they done with jesus "
