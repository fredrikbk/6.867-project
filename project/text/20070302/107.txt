weekend journal review film zodiac killer saga has craft but lacks punch downey gyllenhaal play obsessed pursuers biker film hogs skids length matters the running time of "zodiac" may well be a function of its subject minutes to span more than two decades from the late s to the early s when a serial killer who called himself zodiac terrorized the san francisco bay area and taunted his pursuers with coded messages and theres another reason for the length the scope of david finchers intricate handsomely crafted film goes beyond the pursuit of the killer who was never found to the grindingly erratic nature of the investigation which became an obsession for two cops and two newspapermen in san francisco indeed obsession is the real subject here and obsessing about anything briskly doesnt count yet the film also feels self obsessed an intriguing drama that slowly devolves into a bleak meditation on the absence of dramatics "zodiac" was adapted by james vanderbilt from the book of the same name by robert graysmith a former political cartoonist who was working for the san francisco chronicle when the case hit the news in fact the chronicle was part of the news one of three bay area newspapers to which the killer first sent letters boasting of his crimes that makes the film as much a newspaper story as a police procedural dont think of cary grant and rosalind russell cavorting comically in "his girl friday " though one of the two ink stained wretches of this piece is graysmith himself jake gyllenhaal a relative novice with a nerdy demeanor who is treated like an unpromising intern the other is the chronicles crime reporter paul avery a deep dyed cynic but as played by robert downey jr a man whose mordant wit provides welcome relief from the films oppressive tone the cops inspector dave toschi mark ruffalo and inspector bill armstrong anthony edwards operate in a parallel universe they struggle to pull together evidence from bay area police forces and jurisdictions that barely communicate with one another let alone cooperate with one another while the chronicle guys second guess them follow their own leads and get in the way switching back and forth between the two panels of the diptych structure makes for repetitiveness but it does prove informative one has a sense of intelligent highly motivated men making their way through endless mazes of clues intuitions misapprehensions and misinformation crackpots copycats and deeply weird wannabes keep coming forward to insist theyd committed zodiacs crimes as in many david fincher films the most visually distinctive of which are "seen " "fight club" and "the panic room" the look is much of the medium the distinctive cinematographer harris savides has used digital cameras to create a world of brooding moods thats slightly artificial elusively abstracted and not only in the films several spasms of murderous violence the period evocations are vivid mens shaggy haircuts and long sideburns of course plaid jackets smoking allowed in the last six rows of commuter airplanes and the performances are uniformly fine low key for the cops steady state acidulous for mr downey and increasingly intense for mr gyllenhaals bobby a nerd who comes from behind to dominate the proceedings with his gift for ciphers and solitude yet the overall style is quite conventional and a vital elan is missing throughout except in brian coxs sly shrewd performance as the celebrity lawyer melvin belli this silver haired popinjay is self absorbed to the nth degree but hes larger than life and a wonderfully shameless self dramatizer wild hogs wild horses couldnt drag me to see "wild hogs" a second time but seeing it once can be a liberating experience not in the same sense that its four middle class middle aging buddies from suburban cincinnati liberate themselves from work and family to recapture their youth during a road trip to california on their harleys the movie frees you of the belief that making it in hollywood requires finely honed skills if the writer and director of this coarsely honed sitcom could get hired then the studio doors must be wide open the biker quartet consists of john travolta tim allen martin lawrence and william h macy never mind what work they do since the movies gestures at characterization are rudimentary what they do on the road is pretend to be tough run into real hells angels style outlaws and by taking them on become the men they wanted to be "wild hogs " which includes a cameo by a live revenant from "easy rider " gives a bad name to carpe diem but could have been worse the trip might have started from bangor black snake moan craig brewers "black snake moan" is nothing if not ripe and provocative at least until you see it a black man stands menacingly over a white girl in the publicity stills hes holding one end of a massive chain that encircles her waist but you cant judge a potboiler by its lid yes christina riccis rae is the town whore and a nymphomaniac whose spasms of desire announce themselves with twitchy music and amazing gyrations and yes samuel l jacksons lazarus has his bitter side a former bluesman hes got the blues since his young wife left him but when the church going laz tells the bed going rae "im gonna cure you of your wickedness " youd better believe that the emphasis is on a cure shes been abused hes been wounded he fixes her she fixes him and they both redeem each other craig brewers debut film "hustle and flow " celebrated a good hearted pimp but his second feature isnt just a showcase for a whore with a heart of gold its a soft core simulacrum with a heart of gold for all the preposterous cliches of the plot which clanks as loudly as lazs chain and for all the inertness of justin timberlakes performance as raes brooding squeeze "black snake moan" finds unchained energy in its foolishness and gives mr jackson a chance to pluck a guitar and sing hes really good at it too the music almost redeems the movie avenue montaigne avenue montaigne " a french language bauble by daniele thompson sees an elegant paris neighborhood through the eyes of a provincial gamin from macon as soon as she arrives in the capital sweet jessica whos played with charming if insistent gaucherie by cecile de france lands a waitressing job in a neighborhood cafe where the proprietor tells her

most precious objets dart a famous tv actress whose quest for a serious role she wants to play simone de beauvoir in a film to be directed by sydney pollack resembles a feydeau farce its formula stuff to be sure but full of feeling for the sweep of the past as well as for the unsettled yearning present echoes of juliette greco gilbert becaud and charles aznavour haunt the sound track the collector is played by claude brasseur whose father pierre played the renowned romantic actor in "children of paradise " and jessica could be descended from leslie carons lise or indeed her lili though she also brings to mind audrey tautous "amelie " as cosms go this one is more macro than micro dvd tip "two girls and a guy" is robert downey jr s show even though the two girls are played by heather graham and natasha gregson wagner hes a lying and mercurial lothario whose past catches up with him when the two girls spirited young women actually discover theyve got the same boyfriend james toback wrote and directed this sex farce which is much smarter and more entertaining than it may sound
