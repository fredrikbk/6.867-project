tax getting stiffed a little at a time it is interesting to note that in his feb defense of a sales tax increase to perpetuate a tax and spend strategy for the state of virginia "virginia tax half penny here half penny there soon become millions" the states chamber of commerce president and ceo hugh keogh refers to the tax hike his organization supported as a "half penny " surely something that sounds so innocuous could not harm anyone if only it were so his organizations scheme does not sound so benign when looked at another way as the increase that it is sales tax revenue brings in more money as sales increase hence there is a built in and perpetual revenue generator to raise the rate of the tax is a drastic measure that is rarely if ever appropriate why is it so difficult for states to understand that they should balance their budgets like any american household must do if they wish to spend more of our money in one area they must be willing to reduce spending in another area rather than sock the public with tax hike after tax hike that we cannot and should not have to absorb if one cannot rely upon the virginia chamber of commerce to ensure that the commonwealth lives within its means and does not become tax happy to whom may its residents turn oren m spiegler upper saint clair pa i guess mr keogh figures that if you get stiffed a little at a time then you wont notice check out the virginia treasurys web site it touts the fact that it manages up to &# billion surf a little further into its web site and you find an average monthly liquidity of &# billion thats right its running a &# billion mutual fund on top of a &# billion budget i wonder how my wife would react if she needed to pay a bill saw i had the money tucked away in another account but i said "no way that is my super bowl fund for next year " virginia now has enough for a decade of super bowls but it is never enough thank god for the internet samuel burkeen reston va
