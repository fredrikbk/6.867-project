politics &amp economics house democrats set to retreat from effort to cap troop levels washington the iraq war is proving a humbling experience not just for president bush but also for those in congress who want to end it plagued by internal divisions house democrats have largely abandoned efforts to cap the increase in u s troop levels for iraq and will focus instead on highlighting the wars strain on the military and competing u s interests in afghanistan the major battleground is a wartime spending request which the administration is still adjusting and which has blossomed into a major test for the democrats charged with drafting the legislation the house appropriations committee may add as much as &# billion to mr bushs request to beef up u s operations in afghanistan and shift additional funds to rural development programs more than &# billion would be set aside to improve the readiness of strategic military reserves in the u s and provisions would be added to curb the frequent practice of stretching personnel in iraq by extending combat tours for units already deployed but the white house is given discretion to bypass any such restrictions that it finds burdensome and president bush will have a relatively free hand to add the more than soldiers and marines he wants by the end of may rep john murtha one of the bills chief managers had pushed a tougher line that could have capped the buildup at one to two brigades below mr bushs target but given divisions in his party the pennsylvania democrat was forced to retreat for fear of jeopardizing the larger package the sometimes stormy back and forth which has played out since mr murtha announced his proposals in early january has been a humbling lesson for him and other democrats in just how difficult it is for congress to achieve the unity needed to challenge a presidents war powers similar debates over vietnam a larger war with many more casualties stretched for years and while iraq helped to mobilize voters for democrats in the november elections helping them win control of congress delivering on their promise of change is proving difficult "for seven weeks democrats have been all over the block " said house republican leader john boehner of ohio "they have no strategy to stop the war they have no strategy to win the war they are the majority here on capitol hill its time for them to grow up and make a decision " last night the appropriations leadership was still struggling to pull together the bill which will include the administrations &# billion defense request as well as &# billion for state department and foreign aid accounts and &# billion disaster assistance at home the war debate by so fracturing the house makes this a much more difficult challenge for democrats still finding their legs as the majority complicating the task is the fluid situation on the ground in iraq and afghanistan and the fact that the pentagon appears to have underestimated its needs for support personnel and mine resistant ambush protected armored vehicles further there may also be adjustments to pakistan economic assistance following president cheneys visit there this week an administration official said last evening that there may be "slight adjustments" within its requests but the pentagon has discussed much larger needs approaching &# billion appropriations chairman david obey is under pressure to add billions more for domestic priorities including farm aid and child health programs but to protect himself from critics on the right the wisconsin democrat has set the goal that every dollar for these needs will be more than matched by additional funds for defense and homeland security this has opened the door to both more military spending and additional funds for homeland security priorities that have received less attention in the past these include rail and transit security measures explosive detection devices and tighter inspections of air cargo carried on passenger planes mr obey is pressing still for language that would bar major u s military action against iran without prior authorization from congress but the more serious policy battle and dilemma for democrats has been how far lawmakers should go in trying to cap or restrain the new commitment of u s troops in iraq the new forces ordered by mr bush are intended to quell sectarian violence in shiite and sunni neighborhoods in baghdad and strengthen marine forces against the continued al qaeda presence in anbar province but the army is so short of combat ready units it will take until may to complete the "surge" of five brigades creating an awkward situation for both the military and congress coming in the middle of a fiscal year it was highly unlikely congress could roll back the presidents decision even if it had the political will to limit funding for the surge in testimony before the senate appropriations committee this week marine gen peter pace the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said mr bush could use his "food and forage" powers to continue the mission even if congress were to limit funds "it is my belief that given the mission he has the food and forage responsibilities and authority to resource as he needs to accomplish the mission " gen pace said
