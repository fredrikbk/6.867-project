an uneasy alliance the u s pakistan partnership that came into being on sept was a shotgun marriage and remains an uneasy alliance vice president dick cheneys surprise visit to pakistan earlier this week underscores washingtons frustration with president pervez musharrafs inability to contain the activities of al qaeda and the taliban in the afghan border region the tension is further heightened as the u s congress considers a bill making aid to pakistan conditional on more effective action against these threats the main question is whether this tightening of the noose will produce a positive result or just make things even more difficult for pakistans beleaguered leader in an election year islamabad certainly isnt taking the pressure lying down a foreign ministry spokesperson warned that pakistan would not take any dictation from outside on wednesday the outgoing u s ambassador ryan c crocker was told by officials that pakistan would not allow foreign interference in its internal affairs many observers fear that increasing pressure on gen musharraf could strengthen the hardliners in the military who are skeptical of a partnership with the u s gen musharrafs decision to forge an alliance with the u s meant taking pakistan to war with itself this war which has rarely been examined in depth has pitted the military against the militants the present against the past and a political partnership with america against the culture of jihadist radicalism the outcome of this struggle will affect not only the fate of pakistan but also the ideological climate of the middle east and the security of the world gen musharraf has provided the u s with active support in the hunt for al qaeda fugitives his security forces have captured and delivered to the u s several of the most wanted al qaeda leaders including khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi bin al shibh the masterminds of the attacks but gen musharrafs break with the constituency that backed the taliban has yet to come exposing a paradox in his policy he tried to combat al qaeda while seeking to avoid direct confrontation with the taliban remnants and the homegrown islamic militants he had to walk a fine line between a military reluctant to break entirely with its radical clients and his status as americas key strategic partner in the region the incestuous relationship between jihadist organizations and pakistans all powerful inter services intelligence which helped create much of the islamic militancy and religious extremism that gen musharraf is now confronted with has not completely broken down the recent spate of religious violence and the increasing number of suicide attacks are a grim reminder that the sectarian terrorist network is not only intact but has expanded this raises a serious question about gen musharrafs efforts to combat religious extremism a major reason for his failure to root out extremism and militancy is the lack of consistency in his policies pakistans sectarian groups and jihadist organizations overlap and are linked by similar ideological world views and modes of operation al qaeda is now breeding a new militant threat in pakistan several new terrorist cells have emerged out of the banned outfits which operate as an extension of al qaeda they harbor a new type of young militant coming from educated middle class backgrounds rather than religious schools these cells were behind many of the recent terrorist attacks in the country a good number of these people have been trained in al qaeda camps in the waziristan tribal region which according to u s intelligence agencies is the new command center of the terrorist network those camps have also been used to train young muslim radicals from britain and other countries gen musharraf appears to be in a no win situation the catastrophic failure of the pakistan army operation that killed more than pakistani soldiers in waziristan forced the authorities to make a truce with the militants gen musharraf justified the deal saying it would isolate the foreign fighters operating from the tribal region nato officials in afghanistan disagree saying that the activities of taliban on the afghanistan side had increased threefold since islamabad signed the peace deal in north waziristan last september there is a huge danger that any new military operation in waziristan under pressure from washington will divide the army over the last couple years several midlevel army officers have been court martialed for refusing to fight in waziristan but a policy of appeasement would certainly allow al qaeda and the taliban to expand their terrorist base the militants have already established their rule in the north waziristan tribal region the situation is more worrying as their influence spreads elsewhere these are the fault lines from which a geopolitical earthquake could erupt making the current situation look positively calm by comparison mr hussain who writes from pakistan for the wall street journal is author of "frontline pakistan the struggle with militant islam" columbia university press
