the compliance board despite her indictment by the california attorney general former h p chairman patricia dunn has clearly won the battle in the scandalous h p affair what was the battle about well we have it stated in the press by no less an authority than carly fiorina h ps former ceo that the battle was over ms dunns efforts to eliminate the handful of silicon valley cronies and former friends of dave packard and bill hewlett principally jay keyworth and me from the board of directors and we have it too on the authority of ms dunn who stated very recently "the mode of governance that may be appropriate in the world of venture capital is outmoded in the world of public company governance " so everything you have been reading about the "leaks" at h p is in my opinion mostly a red herring i see this embarrassing public mess as actually the culmination of a war for control of the board of this it company which with the compaq acquisition is now the largest in the world it has been a battle about corporate governance and competing models thereof let me start by describing the "old" model for a board of directors lets call it the "guidance" board this model is still found in quiet corners of silicon valley in private venture capital backed startups in this model the chairman is typically not the ceo and is frequently a partner in one of the enterprises financial backers the boards emphasis is on performance getting the venture up to speed as quickly as possible and normally taking the company public as soon as practical thereby achieving liquidity for all participants few question the effectiveness of this model as few involved question the desirability of creating shareholder value in a company run by a guidance board the roles of the ceo and the chairman are separated for many years i and other venture capitalists like ben rosen the successful chairman of compaq computers until its merger with h p lobbied publicly that this was the model that all of corporate america should follow certain shareholder rights groups also agree that this is the best way so when carly fiorina who was both chairman and ceo departed h p the board at my urging accepted the guidance board model i think that separating the two roles is the best way to avoid the ceo putting the board in his pocket particularly in matters of compensation but the chairman had better be competent the guidance board is typically very involved strategy tactics hiring firing technology and engineering reviews are normal the board may meet monthly and the chairman may visit the company on a weekly basis normally the board is small directors tend to be no nonsense people who expect to be listened to and who take responsibility for their decisions and sometimes this intense involvement is annoying to the management but the results can be more than gratifying it would be hard to picture venture capital working in any other way and few question the model but once the startup becomes a public company a strange metamorphosis commences it begins to be assumed that the public investors have different goals than the original backers the continuing creation of shareholder value the primary goal of the venture capitalist while not forgotten must take its place along side a host of other considerations is the company socially responsible is it inclusive does its board represent the population are women and minorities seated around the board table all of these things unquestionably are desirable i helped effect these kinds of changes on all of the boards with which i have been involved above all when the venture goes public the emphasis shifts with the inevitability of the tide to obeying the laws pertaining to traded companies the sec the stock exchange rules and most recently the sarbanes oxley act come into play since directors must be cognizant of these bit by bit the newly gender and racially inclusive board evolves into a new model the compliance board make no mistake compliance is essential enron is an example of a board that was found not to comply even though everything was signed off by accountants auditors lawyers and investment bankers and even though the chairman of the audit committee was a professor of accounting and dean of the stanford business school the board was found at fault for trading shares at "fraudulently overvalued" prices fines not covered by directors insurance were assessed and paid personally by the directors to the tune of over tens of millions of dollars worldcom is an even better example where directors were fined of their individual net worth because the directors failed to protect the shareholders from management fraud so yes compliance is essential from directors assuming that directors can be found to take these risks and join the board in the first place there is a huge difference between the guidance board with its focus on technical strategy marketing and so forth and the compliance board with its focus on legal issues but surely you ask these models can be combined well the failed experiment at h p tends to cast doubt upon that possibility the experiment started well after the merger with compaq h ps board seemed to have a good mix of people three women two minority members and three technical geeks myself jay keyworth former director of los alamos and reagans science advisor together with dick hackborn inventor of the laserjet and the inkjet printers and former chairman of h p carly fiorina was enthusiastic about my idea of creating a technology committee similar to the audit committee but charged with the responsibility of auditing the &# billion spent annually by the combined companies on r&amp d we geeks were also very concerned about dell computer and its direct sales model which was eating our lunch many board meetings focused on competing with dell and ibm between which h p seemed to be sandwiched the technology committee met separately the day before the board meetings we engineers were the permanent members but the committee was open to all directors several of whom attended from time to time and became very influential we encouraged the company to take some risks in the microprocessor sector and to become less dependent upon a leading vendor who was pocketing what we felt to be "our" profits we completely reconstituted the companys ip licensing policies and focused at every meeting upon an entirely new line of products which havent yet been announced so i cant talk about those at this time maybe more importantly this committee guided the termination of ms fiorina and the hiring of michael hurd in sum i believe this committee is in no small way responsible for the current renaissance of h p so the tech committee should be used as a model for other public high tech companies right wrong it has been reported that the successor chairman of h ps board ms dunn disliked the committee perhaps she believed that it had become too influential and that it was too hard for nontechnical directors to understand many of the issues it discussed it had in effect become a board within the board like an executive committee and everyone familiar with governance principles knows such committees are wrong she lobbied for its elimination and so when the "wet kiss" cnet com article about how great michael hurd was at strategy appeared ms fiorina and i agree that ms dunn launched the now infamous "kona" spying investigation aimed at ridding the board of those directors the tech committee most familiar with strategy whom pattie assumed were the "evil" leakers all this is documented in a characteristically long winded new yorker article of feb when i found out that patricia dunns investigation was a serious invasion of privacy and probably illegal i resigned jay keyworth subsequently also resigned today with too few geeks remaining the tech committee has been dissolved without the leadership of mark hurd and dick hackborn h p could be at risk of being run by a compliance board dont misunderstand a compliance board is a very very busy board it works as hard maybe harder because its all so boring than a guidance board there are so very many matters to comply with so very many governance compliance experts to listen to diversity and inclusionary problems are always there to be discussed sarbanes oxley audit committee meetings can easily require a five hour agenda and require one hour even to summarize for the full board governance and compensation committees are similarly demanding inevitably consultants and lawyers take more and more of center stage in the workings of a compliance board and the governance pressure groups like iss and the labor union pension funds fuel the fires to ever more emphasis on compliance and "independence " it is not practical you see to have a retired employee on his or her former employers board these days even though such people might have great strategic insight into the corporate problems why because they arent independent so where can good directors come from easy a compliance board director can come from anywhere the director of a compliance board listens to consultants and attorneys before deciding matters he she is focused on the regulatory aspects which are largely industry independent so the compliance director is "plug to plug compatible" from board to board like it or hate it what i have described is the evolving standard model in corporate america today would a compliance board be able to prevent another enron i have the lurking suspicion that directors have to understand the fundamental business to understand when it is going off course as a director who once fired a firms auditors just in the nick of time i relied upon the "smell factor " which a life of growing up in the industry had refined but thats the old guidance director in me jack welch has come out strongly in recent weeks with statements consonant with my view of the compliance board he blames the ceo for permitting the board to become preoccupied with sarbanes oxley and similar regulations at the expense of helping to strategize about the overall business he points out that when the going gets tough and it always does at some point the ceo will wish that he had a board in place to help guide the company and the ceo over the rough patches of course i agree but are "plug to plug compatible" directors capable of taking on a strategic role in my view a ceo had first better look at the raw director talent he is taking aboard maybe just maybe "plug to plug compatibility" isnt a good thing mr perkins is a founding partner of kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers this essay is adapted from his speech this week at the dow jones technology conference
