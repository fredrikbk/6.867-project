weekend journal review theater what four california theater companies have to offer los angeles when it comes to art california still gets no respect even though its claims to cultural distinction are self evident too many new york based critics are too provincial to admit that anything good much less significant might be happening on the far side of the continent not caring to fall into that trap i pulled up stakes last week and flew out here to look in on four of the golden states top theater companies i made a special point of seeing the geffen playhouses revival of "speed the plow " in which alicia silverstone the adorable california girl of "clueless " assumes the role created by madonna on broadway in going to los angeles to see david mamets snarlingly comic snapshot of the movie business is like going to a sausage factory to make fun of the pigs and this production pulls no punches greg germann and jon tenney come on like buzzsaws as charlie and bobby the up and coming studio execs who claim to be proud of their artistic whoredom while ms silverstone is just right as karen the seemingly innocent office girl who falls into their clutches randall arneys high octane staging is as good as his cast without compromising a single punch line he makes sure you know what mr mamets characters know which is that they have sold their souls "what if this grace exists " charlie asks bobby at plays end "its not for you you know that bob you know that you have a different thing " those deceptively flat lines nicely underplayed by mr germann never fail to make me shiver but the fact that they were being spoken a stones throw from hollywood made them all the more potent it was as if i were watching christopher marlowes mephistophilis admit to faust "why this is hell nor am i out of it " dont let anyone try to tell you that mr mamet is anything other than deadly serious even when hes being funny especially when hes being funny san diego itamar moses made a biggish splash two seasons ago with "bach in leipzig " a historical fantasia in the manner of tom stoppard whose cocky virtuosity was all the more impressive in light of the fact that its author was just years old now the old globe is putting on mr moses latest play "the four of us " a two man comedy about a pair of twentysomething writers one of whom gideon banner is more successful than the other sean dugan "nobody gives a damn about a writer and his problems except another writer " harold ross the founder of the new yorker famously declared mr moses has proved him wrong for "the four of us" turns out to be a graceful little meditation on friendship and envy smart and sweet and deftly pointed its less flashy than "bach in leipzig" except for a super sly piece of narrative trickery in the next to last scene that took me by surprise but equally compelling "the four of us" has the feel of an indie flick think noah baumbach or whit stillman and could be turned into a good one should that happen i hope messrs banner and dugan star in it because their performances like the play itself are just about perfect cheers to everyone who made it happen starting with itamar moses who is definitely more than just a dazzling flash in the pan costa mesa calif south coast repertory is a suburban theater its minutes from downtown los angeles when traffic is light which it usually isnt known for having given the first performances of such successful plays as "the clean house " "intimate apparel " "prelude to a kiss" and "wit " its also the west coast home of kate whoriskey one of americas most creative young directors her latest show is a new translation by nilo cruz "anna in the tropics" of "life is a dream" "la vida es sueno" pedro calderon de la barcas verse drama about a prince daniel breaker who doubts the reality of the world he sees around him in spain its considered a classic but like the rest of calderons vast output "life is a dream" is all but unknown in this country and mr cruzs fast moving adaptation is intended to make it more accessible to modern audiences taking her cue from calderons proto surrealistic plot which suggests a cross between "the matrix" and "star wars " ms whoriskey has staged "life is a dream" in sci fi style walt spanglers colorful set is palpably interplanetary while the rest of the production brilliantly accompanied by the music of rob milburn and michael bodeen is no less cinematic classical it isnt and i doubt that calderon would have cared for ms whoriskeys directorial high jinks but that didnt diminish my pleasure in the spectacle shes whipped up or in the performances of her cast whose members especially mr breaker lucia brawley and john de lancie rise effortlessly to the challenge of making sense out of the convoluted plot ms whoriskey is a hot name on the regional theater circuit but she hasnt done anything in new york since the premiere of lynn nottages "fabulation" at playwrights horizons dont ask me why like all of her productions this one is outrageously imaginative and unfailingly absorbing south coast rep is lucky to have her as an associate artist and shes just as lucky to be working with so impressive a company san francisco i wanted to catch a traditional classical revival while i was in california and san franciscos american conservatory theater obliged me with paul walshs wonderfully laconic new translation of "hedda gabler " like new yorks roundabout theatre company a c t offers a serious somewhat conservative mix of revivals and newer plays if richard e t whites staging of henrik ibsens most popular play is any indication the companys production style is similarly straightforward except for kent dorseys faux postmodern set in which a th century living room is framed by fluorescent lights and quasi industrial scaffolding this "hedda gabler" is a tasteful unsurprising piece of work rene augesen is mannered but convincing as hedda while her colleagues play it straight down the center except for jack willis whose brayingly campy commissioner brack seemed to have wandered in from some other show my last "hedda gabler" was the sydney theatre companys sped up semi modernized adaptation in which cate blanchett gave a flamboyant performance that reminded me of bette davis on a bumpy night after seeing that wrong headed but undeniably exciting production i couldnt help but feel that a c t s plain jane version was a bit too respectable for its own good mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at
