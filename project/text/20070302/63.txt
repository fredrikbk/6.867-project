politics &amp economics china builds commerce codes beijing fashions measures to underpin fast changing economy beijing chinas leadership is stepping up its efforts to build a legal system that can handle the demands of a complex market driven economy as managing the fast growing nation becomes increasingly challenging that program will take the spotlight when chinas legislature opens its annual session monday the national peoples congress will most likely pass two crucial pieces of economic legislation one would give private property protections of unprecedented force and detail for china another would require foreign and domestic companies to pay the same rate of tax the property rights law will be a symbolic milestone for the nominally communist nation even though it falls far short of what more liberal reformers had initially advocated for foreign businesses the tax law will put them on a more equal footing with local competitors as it gradually brings an end to most of the special breaks offered in the past several other important laws also will be discussed at the meeting for passage later this year including the countrys first antitrust legislation and a measure that would give workers more say in contracts with their employers such measures are the building blocks of a legal infrastructure that underpins the daily functioning of a market economy although chinas legal code is still in its infancy and legal redress can be difficult to come by many of these laws have been in the works for years and have provoked sometimes heated debate they are coming to fruition this year as a consensus grows that legislation can fill some gaping holes and rectify obvious inequities in the current system "china is step by step going down the road of the market economy " said sheng jiemin an expert on antitrust legislation at peking university "the government had to revise many laws after china joined the world trade organization other necessary measures are being regularly issued " the annual meeting of the national peoples congress when nearly delegates gather in beijing is one of the few occasions when chinas leaders discuss their policies in public given the turmoil in chinas stock markets this week as fears spread that a government crackdown on speculation was imminent this years meeting may offer signals on financial policy as well as progress in lawmaking chinas economy has been changing faster than the legal system that is supposed to govern it huge numbers of chinese now own their own homes and run their own businesses but it is difficult to settle who owns what and what they are allowed to do with it private property rights in the abstract have been recognized in chinas constitution through a series of amendments the earliest in but those vague principles are of little help in handling specific cases such as the governments frequent confiscation of land for development that is a big reason for passing the property rights law which details the scope of different types of rights and sets rules for how to change or transfer them "the property rights law tells you what is yours and what is his and how it can be obtained or transferred without that its impossible to solve property disputes " said mei xiaying a professor at the university of international business and economics in beijing businesses in particular will welcome the clarification of property rights which should make it easier to buy and sell major assets such as land he said the legal overhauls have been controversial the proposed property rights law in particular attracted vocal opposition from scholars who worry that it will pave the way for the accelerated privatization of state companies and widen the gap between the wealthy and the poor the draft antimonopoly law under discussion for more than a decade has also been held hostage by disputes among policy makers some want to use it to break open still closed parts of the economy while others see giving the government new antitrust powers as a way to strengthen its control over businesses particularly powerful foreign companies that have dominant market share in china though its laws arent subject to popular vote the chinese government usually tries to build a consensus among officials before pushing through a major policy change as new laws fall into place scholars say chinas commercial code is finally getting close to completion the measures will reinforce chinas shift toward relying on law and legal processes rather than government dictates alone to manage the economy talking shop selected items on the agenda of the national peoples congress submitted for passage enterprise income tax law applies a unified tax rate to foreign and domestic
