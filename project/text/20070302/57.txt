math lessons to boost donor numbers colleges adopt new tricks sinking alumni stats zeal for rankings spur rate inflation albion mich adrian jean kammerer hasnt given albion college a dime since she graduated in "i dont have money to be giving to albion " says the law school student "im living off student loans " yet albion counted ms kammerer as an alumni donor to the school in and school officials keep her on the donor roll by treating the &# she gave as a college senior as a &# annual gift for five years ms kammerer isnt scheduled to drop off albions donor list until the issue more colleges are manipulating their alumni giving rates the background high giving rates boost a schools status in u s news &amp world reports annual college survey and with potential donors what it means the statistic may not accurately reflect what it is intended to measure such fiddling which helped boost the percentage of donating albion alums to in from in paid off handsomely u s news &amp world reports annual higher education survey puts albions alumni giving rate at th among liberal arts colleges contributing to an overall ranking of st among such schools in albion boasted of its alumni giving rate among other credentials in a cover letter for a grant application to the kresge foundation which ultimately awarded the school &# million forget grades at a growing number of schools the greatest inflation is occurring with their alumni giving rate an obscure data point measuring the percentage of alumni who donate in a given fiscal year the chase has gotten so extreme that officials at some schools worry more about the alumni giving rate than the amounts being given some colleges beg alumni for a dollar since the size of the gift doesnt matter in figuring the rate others taking advantage of the fact that the calculation excludes alumni for whom the school lacks valid contact information dont try to track down lost alums the rationale graduates who didnt update the school with their whereabouts are less likely to donate dragging down the schools percentage once used primarily by lesser known colleges and universities such legerdemain is going mainstream as schools try to buck a nationwide decline in the percentage of graduates who donate although the average alumni donation is up the percentage of alumni giving to their colleges dropped to in from in according to the council for advancement and support of education or case which sets standards for calculating giving rates some of that decline is due to demographics a greater number of living alumni reduces giving rates but experts also attribute the shrinking alumni giving rate to more competition from other charities as well as the failure of wealthy colleges to make a compelling case for small donations harvard university with a &# billion endowment saw its alumni giving rate fall to in from in at many colleges trustees set annual targets for alumni giving rates placing pressure on their fund raising staff to make their numbers colleges also worry that any downturn in the alumni giving rate might reduce their chances to get some corporate and foundation grants but perhaps the most powerful motivating force is u s newss annual report although college officials publicly scoff at the magazines rankings many manipulate every possible factor to their advantage the giving rates which are supposed to measure alumni satisfaction with their school account for of u s newss total score the result is a lot of funny math while albion counts the seniors donations for tax purposes in the year they are made it tallies them over five years for the alumni giving rate multiple counting of one time donors "is a shameful practice " says bruce hopkins a kansas city mo attorney who represents colleges and other nonprofits some schools refuse to game the system "i tell my board if you want the participation rate to go up there are a lot of quick ways to do it " says kimberly hokanson director of alumni and parent programs at bates college in lewiston maine "you can ask alumni for a dollar but that doesnt teach them to engage in a meaningful philanthropic relationship with the college im not into quick fixes " bates alumni giving slid to in from in albions foray into creative alumni accounting started in the early s when it began dividing one time gifts from seniors over three years in return it promised not to pitch them again until the three year term expired in albion decided it wanted to spread donations over five years rather than three to boost its giving rate compounding that hike it counted seniors in the classes of and who had been slated to spend three years on the donor list as five year givers last fall albion decided to switch back to the three year term for graduates young graduates saddled with student loans drag down giving rates at most schools but by counting college seniors who give once as multiyear donors albion generated astonishing results by albions figuring of ms kammerers class of donated in the class of supposedly did even better in their first year out of school a giving rate in u s news and the kresge foundation say they werent aware the school was divvying up donations over multiple years robert morse director of data research for u s news says the practice "is obviously bending something " "if i knew that i would have asked them to recalibrate" the alumni giving number adds david fukuzawa program officer for kresge the kresge money which was used to renovate and expand albions science complex included a &# million challenge grant designed to help the school attract more donations last year kresge started asking for an alumni giving rate and a three year projection to help assess how successful grant seeking colleges will be in securing additional funding albion officials acknowledge that the five year program inflated its giving rate after being asked about its policies by this newspaper albions president peter mitchell said he will discontinue the practice of multiyear donations starting with the class of and "replace it with solicitation of every class every year " mr mitchell says he already was planning to cease another practice in recent years albion has counted donating seniors in its tally of alumni givers while excluding all seniors from the total alumni pool a move that increased the giving rate a percent point or two a year mr mitchell says that starting in all seniors will be included in the total pool he vows "clarity and transparency" in future fund raising reports an albion official says other colleges also exaggerate giving rates albions approach says marcia starkey associate vice president of alumni and parent relations is "industry standard " at wabash college in crawfordsville ind of seniors or donated last year says annual fund director joe klen yet wabashs web site says the classs participation rate was which mr klen acknowledges is inaccurate the college only includes the donors not the nondonors in figuring its overall giving rate mr klen says the overall alumni giving rate of is accurate because deceased alums who remain in the pool offset the omitted seniors a growing number of nationally recognized schools like haverford college and wesleyan university count seniors as alumni donors in when haverford adopted this method of seniors gave helping lift its reported alumni giving rate to from in at wesleyan of seniors contributed last year boosting its overall giving rate both schools also include nondonating seniors in their calculations representatives at both schools say the practice is legitimate although seniors usually donate to class gifts before commencement they become alumni by june when colleges finalize giving rates starting in trinity college in hartford conn began counting some college seniors as multiyear donors ronald joyce vice president for advancement says student volunteers went door to door soliciting donations and urging seniors to make their donations count in two separate years trinity achieved a giving rate among seniors helping boost its overall rate to in from in qualifying the college for a &# million gift from an alumni group and seniors authorized trinity to subdivide their one time gifts into two annual contributions giving trinity a head start on its projected alumni giving rate of mr joyce says trinity is complying with case standards by holding the gift portion for the second year in escrow and providing the donor with a receipt in each year because case and u s news guidelines allow schools to exclude alumni for whom they lack valid contact information one popular method for raising the alumni giving rate is by not keeping track of graduates deemed unlikely to donate finding people has certainly gotten easier thanks to the growth of the web according to john taylor a consultant who helped develop the case standards an acceptable lost alumni rate is " or less " brandeis university slashed its lost alumni rate to its current from in in part by posting names of lost alumni on an online directory finding lost alumni sounds worthwhile some may become re engaged with the school and eventually donate but if a college seeks a higher giving rate making an aggressive effort to find alumni is "shooting yourself in the foot " says ben hancock albions vice president for institutional advancement from to two years ago dominican university in river forest ill used internet databases to reduce its percentage of lost alums to from but its giving rate fell to in from in says stephen kuhn dominicans vice president for advancement around that time dominican dropped a notch in the u s news rankings looking for alumni is "a curse and a blessing " mr kuhn says the university of southern california doesnt have contact information for of its alumni who therefore dont count in its reported alumni giving rate diana keim director of annual giving at usc until says she was evaluated on her ability to boost the giving rate not the total amount that was donated "finding lost alumni wasnt that important to us " ms keim says in uscs annual giving rate was now it is sam martinuzzi associate senior vice president for university advancement says alumni participation is the "driving focus" of its annual fund program finding alumni "is always a good thing for usc " he adds transylvania universitys giving rate omits alumni or the school could look for alumni "on a more regular basis and increase our numbers " says bobbi burns director of annual giving at the lexington ky school but she says the "drawback" would be a reduced giving rate albion isnt worried about the of its alumni it has lost track of "were not aggressive at all" in pursuing them president mitchell says adding such efforts waste resources founded by methodists in albion is thriving despite being located in a hard pressed town where the iron ore foundries that once drove the economy have closed the college has boosted enrollment to from in the fall of constructed a new dormitory and administration building and opened an equestrian program it recently completed a &# million fund raising campaign and has a &# million endowment when mr mitchell became president in he identified the alumni giving rate as a priority in trustee william stoffer offered a challenge if albion achieved a giving rate he would donate &# million for a lecture series aided by the multiyear pledge program albion reached the goal in and mr stoffer fulfilled his promise mr stoffer chief executive of albion machine &amp tool co says albion officials kept him informed about their tactics and that he was supportive he adds he would have donated even if the college had fallen just short of a giving rate at albion alumni must donate to have access to the colleges online alumni directory undergraduates who staff albions fund raising phone a thon are paid a bonus for every pledge they elicit for its winter phone a thon held in the admissions buildings basement festooned with balloons in albions purple and gold colors scripts posted on cubicle walls advised student callers to ask prospects "would you even consider a small gift of &# or &# to help us reach our giving rate " with one balky alumnus freshman yume nakamura quickly adjusted her pitch "even &# would help this statistic would you mind donating that much " she asked he agreed and she mailed him a pledge card albion also makes it easy for graduating seniors to donate instead of paying by check or credit card most seniors allow the college to keep part or all of a refundable &# matriculation deposit they paid as freshmen to cover such things as library fees and parking fines "lets see if we can be the only class in the history of any college to give as we go out the door " president mitchell exhorted seniors in february jonathan leazenby a graduate let albion keep &# of his matriculation deposit because he says president mitchell "challenged everybody to do something we take pride in our giving percentage " informed that albion also listed him as a donor in mr leazenby says it was "misleading i dont believe in trying to deceive people "
