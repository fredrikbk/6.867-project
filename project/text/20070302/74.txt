selective school choice theres something about our nations capital that converts many leading democrats to school choice perhaps its the glimpse that washington d c affords into inner city public schools but in most cases this appreciation of school choice extends only to their own children and not to the millions of children in failing public schools indeed a nearly perfect correlation exists among democratic presidential candidates who have exercised school choice for their own children and those who would deny such choices to the parents of other children when the clintons came to washington d c in they could choose any public school for chelsea being responsible parents of means bill and hillary clinton sent her instead to the elite private sidwell friends school two years later mr clinton vetoed a bill that would have allowed low income d c parents to use public funds to send their children to private schools a subsequent version of that program was signed into law by george w bush and today presidential candidate mrs clinton continues to stridently oppose school choice in a speech to the national education association she vowed "never to abandon our public schools" speaking apparently as a politician not a parent john edwards mr populist decries that "america has two school systems one for the affluent and one for everyone else " he should know when he joined the u s senate he sent his children to a religious school because according to usa today the d c "public schools are deeply troubled " mr edwards however opposes private school choice for low income families on the curious grounds that this would "drain resources" from public schools by such logic mr edwards himself "drained" approximately &# from the d c public schools al gore who may yet join the presidential race has said empathetically "if i was a parent of a child who went to an inner city school that was failing i might be for vouchers too " but he isnt and so he is not mr gore sent all of his children to elite private schools in the nations capital like the one he attended growing up but he militantly opposes school choice for low income families there is only one democratic aspirant who sent his children exclusively to public schools and he was also the only one who signed a school choice bill into law in his own state former iowa gov tom vilsack who withdrew from the race when his candidacy failed to gain traction and there is only one candidate sen joe biden who has both sent his children to private school and supported school choice for others the mystery man is sen barack obama who sends his child to a private school in chicago yet once referred to school vouchers as "social darwinism " still he says that on education reform "i think a good place to start would be for both democrats and republicans to say we are willing to experiment and invest in anything that works " well school choice works every study that compares children who applied for school choice scholarships and received them with those who applied but did not shows improved academic performance more important every study that has examined the effect of school choice competition has found significantly improved performance by public schools given their track records it is doubtful how many candidates will agree with sen obamas professed openness to experiment but as he might say we can always have the audacity to hope mr bolick is president and general counsel of the alliance for school choice and senior fellow at the goldwater institute
