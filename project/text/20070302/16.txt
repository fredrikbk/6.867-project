comedy central export aims for local laughs viacoms german channel is part of plan to establish global brand to join mtv over the past two decades viacom inc has taken its music channel mtv and its kids network nickelodeon around the world now its trying to build a third global franchise by exporting that most local of entertainment genres comedy in january viacom began airing a german version of its comedy central network in a strategy the company hopes will strengthen its toehold in one of the worlds biggest media markets its the second international foray for comedy central after poland which debuted with a small digital channel in october germans arent necessarily known for their humor still viacom believes it can build an audience for the german version of comedy central by running homegrown programs alongside foreign fare its most popular show so far is "para comedy " produced for viacom by dortmund based prime productions the show follows handicapped people who play practical jokes on unsuspecting passersby "candid camera" style in one episode a blind woman asks a couple to give her guide dog directions they readily oblige "you have to go straight down that way and on the left youll see a large fountain take a left and go about meters " the man tells the labrador retriever stroking its head "did you get that " it might shock the sensibilities of some but those involved say their motivation is to break down stereotypes of handicapped people through humor "german humor is very down to earth " adds catherine muhlemann a swiss executive who heads viacom in germany the approach of using local content more expensive than simply repackaging u s series could be a model for comedy central in other countries as well the moves are part of a broad overhaul of the overseas business of viacoms mtv networks division since sumner redstone gained control of viacom in the company has pursued an ambitious international expansion with nickelodeon and mtv the music channel alone has international channels and reaches countries the strategy made mtv one of the most recognizable global brands but hasnt done as much for viacoms bottom line last year the companys international business accounted for about of viacoms &# billion revenue but barely broke even according to a person familiar with the situation viacoms new management team which came on board after chief executive tom freston was fired in september has ordered a sweeping restructuring of its overseas operations the new strategy is to focus on big markets such as germany and the united kingdom and scale back mtv networks presence in some smaller ones such as thailand and the philippines there it will shift from owning the channels to licensing its brands to a local partner yesterday viacom said it would lay off people as part of the restructuring of its international business "our job is to build an international operation that we hope will be as strong as viacom is in the u s " mr redstone says the expansion of comedy central is a key test of its new approach viacom operates several comedy channels under the paramount brand in europe it plans to bring those channels under the comedy central umbrella with local content with programs like "the daily show" with jon stewart "south park" and "the colbert report " comedy central has built a loyal following in the u s but repeating its success abroad wont be easy taking comedy overseas has been a tricky undertaking for u s entertainment companies such as time warner inc and walt disney co because american humor doesnt always translate to other cultures for instance while hbos relationship focused "sex and the city" was a big hit in germany the ironic humor of "seinfeld" bombed even so germanys status as europes biggest and richest market has made it an attractive if elusive prize for foreign media companies comedy central is germanys only basic cable channel devoted to humor but it has plenty of competition on germanys larger broadcasters public broadcasters offer a steady helping of comedy including the popular talk show with comedian harald schmidt prosiebensat a commercial broadcaster offers digital subscribers a comedy channel in germany comedy centrals original programming is a mix of traditional stand up and sketch shows some of the programs such as "badesalz " a half hour show of skits in local german dialect showcase established comedians others feature relative unknowns such programming has generated buzz about the channel its viewership is about higher than that of the viacom owned music channel viva plus that it replaced though it is still very small however its been most successful among men ages to a coveted demographic for advertisers new advertisers include car maker nissan motor co and drinks maker red bull gmbh viacom says it plans to continue to invest in local programming but the majority of comedy centrals schedule consists of dubbed u s and u k comedies including "stacked " starring pamela anderson mr redstone defends viacoms strategy on comedy saying he faced similar doubts years ago about mtv which critics derided as a fad "in every place in the world people are interested in comedy just like with music and kids" programming he says last month the year old hollywood mogul who also controls cbs corp met with german government officials mr redstone famous for his frank manner said the state of bavaria should grant viacoms cable channels better distribution in return for viacoms investment in the area "when you need something and want something why not lay it on the line " he says
