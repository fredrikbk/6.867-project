weekend journal the minutes of our lives small private moments get live blog treatment notes from a funeral if you hate newsy holiday letters brace yourself for the live blog people are increasingly documenting the most mundane and private aspects of their lives and posting them the instant they happen from birth "i can see his head a little" to death "so many memories " one blogger posted from a funeral no experience is too personal or sacred not to be shared in november year old graduate student regan ozbirn of atlanta chronicled her first thanksgiving with her husband online with updates like "bring on the pie " her husband computer support technician kevin ozbirn was a little aggravated when she stopped him as he was about to start carving the turkey so she could take a picture "i was ready to eat " he says the assault on privacy and discretion is being driven by a rash of new products the latest technology lets people easily post blog entries from their cellphones and blackberrys until now bloggers giving running commentary from the oscars or the front lines of iraq have been largely dependent on computers earlier this year nokia and blogging service vox started offering a download for nokia nseries smart phones that lets people post text video and photos to a blog directly from their phone sony ericsson began including a blogging feature provided by google on several of its phones last year in october livejournal started allowing users to update their blogs by text message and in august one blogger made public a new tool he wrote called yomoblog which allows people to create and edit posts using blackberrys the play by play personal coverage comes as the number of blogs is rapidly increasing there are currently about million blogs more than double the million that existed a year ago according to san francisco tracking firm technorati and most detail personal experiences the instant updates are the latest manifestation of todays tell all society in which memoirs dominate the nonfiction best seller lists while proponents say live blogging helps them experience an event more fully and provides a nice souvenir the postings can often disrupt the event get scant traffic and annoy those dragooned into reading them and that says nothing of the feelings of a person who might not relish the notion of her maternity room utterances or wedding vows being instantly blasted into cyberspace when josh bancroft a year old intel engineer from portland ore told his wife rachel he wanted to live blog the birth of their second child last august she was reluctant at first once he explained that he would be updating readers with text during slow moments and that he wouldnt be bringing a camera and laptop she relented his posts include "at the hospital now were doing a scheduled c section its kind of weird knowing ahead of time whats going to happen when " and a little later "its a boy " and then "we couldnt be happier " mr bancroft says he had at least readers that day about double the usual on his tech heavy blog but the posts werent completely well received one of the comments on the day of the event from a regular reader he only knows by screen name intelwife said "it is something you should share with your wife not all of us " still mr bancroft whose job partly entails promoting new technologies says the live updates were the best way to record the day "you are capturing a different set of feelings and memories than if you waited until you got home and tried to recall the situation " he says katie bruggeman had every intention of live blogging her familys thanksgiving dinner from the computer in the dining room of her parents home in anchorage alaska the year old television producers assistant in brooklyn n y thought it would be funny to clock details like how many glasses of wine she had and the number of times her parents reproached her but as she was arranging a place setting in front of the computer and explaining the process to her mother her plans were quickly dashed "i made her come and sit at the table " says peggy vigoren ms bruggemans mother "families have so little time together nowadays that at a holiday dinner i think people should sit down together and talk " yet the opportunity to detail moments about a marriage ceremony or first birthday continues to grow wedding sites including theknot com and ourweddingwebsites com and parenting sites such as mayasmom com and parentsconnect com have recently launched the ability for users to create blogs obvious llcs nine month old twitter com is dedicated to the question "what are you doing " people send in their answers up to characters by cellphone by instant messenger or on the web which are posted on their personal page for viewing by a limited group of friends or anyone on the site the site has received more than one million real time posts including one sent in via cellphone by peter kruse while he was sitting in the back of the church at his former pastors funeral in september "it did distract me for about seconds " says mr kruse an aide to adults with disabilities in elgin ill many agree that its hard to fully participate in an event if youre trying to compose pithy thoughtful notes at the same time some academics say the live posts are the latest twist in the decades old conflict between living in the moment and memorializing it from behind a camera lens only worse "people who are live blogging are psychologically more distant from the event " says clay shirky a professor of social software at new york universitys interactive telecommunications program thats leading some bloggers to ask their friends to do the work brendan loy a year old law student at the university of notre dame generally writes about sports current events the weather and his life for his wedding in december he asked a friend to take pictures on a cellphone and immediately upload them to his blog the friend dan seremet of newington conn posted pictures that evening and night and says "it was an honor " mr loy estimates he got almost unique visitors that day up from his daily average of earlier that week that kind of traffic is hard to get tasha buchanan a year old client service representative in newport mich wrote about a less momentous event her new years eve at home she was inspired by another blogger who typed out real time updates during her day cleaning out a closet at p m and again at she wrote about her fiance watching "star wars " at she posted photos of him and her daughter sleeping "i can barely keep my eyes open " she wrote her last post came at midnight "well i hope everyone enjoyed my boring night im going to bed now good night " she says her site had about page views that evening some attribute the popularity of instant broadcasts to a growth in narcissism among young people "they are seeking attention and think everything they do is important and should be read by other people " says jean twenge an associate professor of psychology at san diego state university and author of "generation me why todays young americans are more confident assertive entitled and more miserable than ever before " ms twenge has found that college students have become steadily more narcissistic over the last years with more of them agreeing with statements like "i would like to be the center of attention " "i think i am a special person" and "i wish someone would write my biography " not everyone wants to follow even their own friends exploits in real time melinda van komen a year old homemaker in riverton utah tries to read the blog of her childhood friend christina carbone who lives in lake mary fla every morning but ms van komen has yet to tune into one of her friends

at home mother in lehi utah says she was tempted to live blog the immediate hours after her brothers september funeral when guests were lingering too long at her parents house she thought it would help her remember details like the overwhelming yet calming smell of flowers but decided against it "it wouldnt have been exactly appropriate " she says she waited until the following day to blog about the funeral hosts who want to ensure that guests focus on the festivities are responding with countermeasures expecting about half a dozen bloggers at their wedding joey de villa and wendy koslow posted "a note to other bloggers" on their wedding web site about two weeks before their september nuptials in cambridge mass the note asked guests not to bring their laptops to the event and to only blog about the wedding after the fact "i wanted them to pay attention and enjoy themselves and participate " says ms koslow who came up with the idea for the embargo "i wanted them to be in the moment " although the guests complied the first attendee blog post was up by that night shortly after the reception ended the culprit rev a k m adam a year old episcopal priest from evanston ill who preached at the ceremony from his hotel room he wrote "the ketubah is signed the glass smashed the champagne toasted the disco medley played and the guests exhausted these guests anyway " rev adam
