eu threatens microsoft with new fines antitrust case charges highlight industry rift over sales techniques brussels new european union charges against microsoft corp that threaten the company with as much as &# billion in fines highlight an increasingly fierce industry battle over how to sell business software european regulators launched formal charges yesterday against microsoft for the third time in three years accusing the tech giant of trying to overcharge competitors for information to make their products work well with microsofts ubiquitous windows operating system the charges stem from a eu decision that microsoft abused its near monopoly position as the producer of windows microsoft has already racked up close to &# billion in fines in the case the eus latest move goes to the heart of a growing battle between microsofts traditional fee based software business and challenges from international business machines corp red hat inc and oracle corp which offer free or nominally priced "open source" software microsofts competitors say they believe the company has structured its proposed charges for the programming information in such a way as to undermine their business models the march eu decision requires microsoft to offer licenses for the programming information on "reasonable and non discriminatory terms" to software rivals who need it no companies have licensed the information yet the decision ordered microsoft to help rivals write software linking back office server computers with employees windows driven desktop computers for a narrow range of functions including the accessing and printing of documents and logging onto password protected company systems "the current view is that there is no significant innovation" in the programming information to warrant the price microsoft is charging eu antitrust commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement yesterday but brad smith microsofts general counsel said in an interview he was surprised by the aggressive new charges "i feel we need a more constructive approach to address very complicated and technical issues in a way that is going to make progress " he said microsoft has appealed the original decision against it and a decision from a european court in luxembourg is expected this year the background to the current dispute is an effort by ibm red hat oracle sun microsystems inc and other companies to best microsoft in the lucrative market for business software the rivals strategy is to hawk open source software to companies at little or no price any programmer is free to alter these open computer programs as he likes or make improvements available to others via online downloads hence the term open source the microsoft rivals then make money by selling service contracts to companies to maintain and upgrade their software microsofts software by contrast is protected by fee based licenses that dont allow alteration or sharing of its computer code microsoft proposed a complex system requiring its rivals to pay "per unit royalties " or a fee every time the competitors customers use software that incorporates parts of the disputed microsoft programming information although the eu case only concerns a relatively small part of the overall business market critics say this pricing system is part of a strategy to stymie open source software providers "it would be fundamentally inconsistent with their business model " which doesnt track the number of end users of its products or how they use the products said thomas vinje a lawyer for an industry group including ibm oracle red hat and sun microsystems mr smith of microsoft said the disputed programming information is covered by technology patents and that an additional patents are pending "its hard to see how the commission can argue that even patented information must be made available for free " he said mr vinje countered that many software patents are granted incorrectly and are often reversed upon challenge the eu has fined microsoft twice in regulators ordered the company to pay more than &# million after finding microsoft had exploited its near monopoly in operating systems for personal computers to muscle aside competitors in july regulators hit microsoft with a further million euros fine &# million for failing to compile the disputed programming information in a usable manner microsoft later fixed that problem the "statement of objections" sent to microsoft yesterday is a formal charge outlining how regulators believe the company hasnt complied with eu orders microsoft has four months to answer the charges and can also request a closed door oral hearing after weighing microsofts defense ms kroes will decide whether to level the fine and if so the amount of the penalty microsoft can then appeal the fine to the european court in luxembourg
