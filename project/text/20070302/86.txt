the daily fix familiar injury in womens sports is object of study by physicians online edition why are women more vulnerable to acl injuries thats the question asked by elliott almond and mark emmons in the san jose mercury news surveying a rash of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in pac womens hoops "as the conference tournament begins tonight at hp pavilion seven athletes who were or were expected to be key members of their teams have seen their seasons marred by acl problems " they write "that includes four point guards stanfords hones and rosalyn gold onwude cals alexis gray lawson and arizona states dymond simon the injury has become so common even expected in womens sports such as basketball and soccer that it no longer sends ripples through locker rooms " pac mens basketball has seen one acl injury this year its not just basketball one report claims female college athletes are sidelined by acl tears each year the two writers examine three of the possible culprits for acl injuries in women anatomy biomechanics and hormones in an accompanying q&amp a mr emmons talks with stephen w marshall of the north carolina school of public health about how to investigate non contact acl injuries "they occur when the leg appears to be at full extension with some sort of rotation some change in the direction " dr marshall says "it appears that the body delivers the energy itself to the acls that ruptures it or tears it " sun ming ming is foot an altitude that would make him the tallest player in nba history should he ever make the league he now plays for the abas maryland nighthawks but will he slates josh levin examines the possibilities which seem slim the problem mr sun is very very slow "in his nighthawks debut i watch as sun spends half the game on the wrong side of the court " mr levin writes adding "on defense he plays the same role as the windmill on a minigolf course moving his arms back and forth in a deliberate pattern making contact with the ball and opposing players whenever they stray into his path when the ball caroms off the rim he cant ratchet his arms up fast enough to snare the rebound and despite weighing nearly pounds he cant outmuscle players who are a foot shorter and pounds lighter " mr sun isnt hopeless on the court as mr levin notes he can shoot but thats "kind of poignant considering its the one basketball skill a big man doesnt need to make himself useful a humongous center must be able to rebound block shots and push guys around in the paint sun cant do those things because hes reached the height of diminishing returns hes probably the first basketball player whos too tall to play basketball " mr sun is being tutored by foot gheorghe muresan which leads to a nice bonus for mr levins readers mr muresan once gave a basketball lesson to mr levin whos foot and says he possesses no particular hoops ability read mr levins washington city paper account of how that turned out fans of the tampa bay buccaneers love hard nosed fullback mike alstott and the bucs know it thats the problem says the st petersburg times john romano in considering mr alstotts one year deal for "i know youre still hoping for the fairy tale " he writes "truthfully i am too we imagine the moment when the bucs find themselves on the edge of desperation and alstott comes out of the huddle to save the day but deep down we all know thats not likely to happen and im pretty sure the bucs and alstott know it too so it becomes a loveless marriage held together because of the children and by the children i mean the hairy guys screaming from the top of the bleachers which brings us to this stalemate and to this dilemma do you applaud something you believe is doomed " one of the more amusing signs of spring is big league teams kicking off their exhibition schedules by playing college squads in the boston globe dan shaughnessy has a good time detailing what happened when the northeastern university nine stepped into the box in fort myers against josh beckett of the boston red sox the first hitter center fielder david gustafson did bloop a single on the first pitch ha but after that only one batter of six faced put the ball in play and he grounded out "this is a nice reminder of how hard it is to make it to the major leagues " mr shaughnessy writes "its a demonstration of the great baseball food chain something thats easy to forget until we see a good division college hitter stepping in against a josh beckett " and mr shaughnessy gets curt schilling to break down the numbers "the guys i played with in rookie ball the worst players were times better than anybody i ever played with in high school when i signed i was told that out of every kids that plays baseball gets drafted one out of every kids that play baseball make it to the big leagues something like that " tonight the boston college eagles will take their hacks against the bosox awaiting them on the mound daisuke matsuzaka two espn com writers explain how their planned columns took left turns bill simmons had a pretty good idea what hed wind up writing when he agreed to provide color commentary for two college basketball games on espnu last month "naturally i assumed the experience would lead to some you cant believe how bad i was stories and a newfound appreciation for the genre only one problem its not that hard " in mr simmons view his salvation he gives himself a solid c was that espnu paired him with rob stone a friend of his since college which leads him to a logical question why dont networks value chemistry more "every no announcing team is more like a corporate merger al michaels is a big name john madden is a big name so of course theyre combined into maddenmichaels " he writes "meanwhile the best nfl broadcast was the one espn threw together for a raiders chargers game with a one time crew that included ron jaworski and dick vermeil two old friends we felt like we were sitting on the sofa with them for three hours i loved it why not hire more friends to announce together then we wouldnt have so many teams sounding like theyre on an awkward blind date " then theres the sports equivalent of colin fergusons anguished discussion of britney spears jim caple a card carrying yankee hater thinks we should lay off alex rodriguez mr caple begins with a peek at the column he planned to write mocking the derailment of a rods friendship with derek jeter and the way the new york yankees clubhouse can seem like an outtake from "heathers " but then he explains why he scrapped that column "i mean what has a rod ever done that is so bad " he asks "despite his best efforts at living a clean responsible life he has a worse reputation than terrell owens i know ive mocked him as much as anyone but now i mostly feel sorry for him " after running down reasons to root for rodriguez mr caple offers this "root for a rod because other than saying stupid things he never does anything to embarrass his team or the game he never gives less than his best he never approaches the game with anything less than complete professionalism so what if he cant help himself from making ridiculous statements in an attempt to please everyone at all times there are far worse crimes for an athlete and we complain about them all the time " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
