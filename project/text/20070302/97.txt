uranium do over things sure are looking up for kim jong il the north korean dictator has already been promised tons of fuel oil and eased sanctions in return for one more pledge to give up his nuclear weapons and now even before he has to declare all of his nuclear facilities the bush administration appears to be backing down from its own intelligence judgments on north korea thats the meaning of this weeks disclosure at a senate hearing by administration spook joseph detrani about pyongyangs uranium enrichment program asked for an update by rhode islands jack reed the new director of national intelligence michael mcconnell invited mr detrani to address the issue mr detrani replied that while the u s had previously had "high confidence" about the uranium effort now it was only "at the mid confidence level " keep in mind that the uranium program is separate from the plutonium that kim has already used to explode a nuclear device confronted with u s intelligence in north korean officials admitted to the secret uranium effort in a face to face meeting with then assistant secretary of state jim kelly such an effort violated both the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and the agreed framework that kim had signed with the clinton administration the north koreans have since denied saying that or having any such program but u s intelligence has claimed to have solid evidence that it did whats changed now mr detrani didnt elaborate but the timing of this intelligence walk down is certainly strange under the six party accord signed in beijing on february north korea has days to come clean about all of its nuclear programs and facilities by telegraphing to kim that the u s has new doubts about his uranium plans the bush administration is all but inviting kim to declare as little as possible the flip flop has all the earmarks of the intelligence community trying to cover its own keister if kim does precisely that this is all the more bizarre given the volumes of public evidence that north koreas uranium enrichment program is very real following north koreas admission in numerous bush officials made the rounds discussing what they knew "the enriched uranium issue some have assumed is somewhere off in the fog of the distant future it is not " mr kelly told the senate in march "it is only probably a matter of months and not years behind the plutonium " richard armitage then deputy secretary of state and hardly a neocon said at the time that north korea was acquiring "many more centrifuges than was orginally thought " and he added that north korea had been "intent on going to a full up production program" starting from "at least" february dont believe bush officials how about pervez musharraf in his recent memoir the pakistan president discloses that he learned as early as that north koreans were canoodling with pakistani a q khan to buy uranium enrichment technology "i received a report suggesting that some north korean nuclear experts under the guise of missile engineers had arrived" at pakistan nuclear labs "and were being given secret briefings " mr musharraf writes in his book about the a q khan network "shopping for bombs " bbc reporter gordon corera reports that mr musharraf has admitted that "probably a dozen" centrifuges were sent to north korea from pakistan "both plans and complete devices " as well as "blueprints and designs " and in may two germans were convicted in stuttgart for trying to ship million tons of aluminum tubing to north korea the tubing had been ordered by yun ho jin pyongyangs man at of all places the international atomic energy agency in vienna the measurements on the tubing were made to european standards for the kind of vacuum casings used for gas centrifuges to enrich uranium meanwhile the washington post reported in march that the u s found traces of north korean uf or uranium hexafloride when it dismantled libyas nuclear program the post said pyongyang had sold the uf to pakistan which had later sold it to libya all of this is merely whats on the public record we understand that intelligence is rarely definitive but if this is what adds up to "mid confidence level " what does the cia need for "high" and what in the world qualifies as a "slam dunk" the bigger issue here is what this intelligence reversal suggests about bush administration policy when the february accord was announced senior officials assured us that it included "all" north korean nuclear programs not just plutonium but now that the u s is embarked on an "arms control process " the pressure to keep making unilateral concessions or overlook kims transgressions will be great assume that in its day declaration north korea admits some past attempt to buy centrifuge technology but says its all been destroyed and theres nothing to inspect would president bush really walk away from the talks amid the inevitable criticism from china south korea and the american media we think we know where the state department would come out chris hill states negotiator with the north has already hinted that its uranium program isnt that big a deal white house officials say president bush has earned the benefit of the doubt on north korea and that hell insist on dismantling all of its nuclear facilities we hope hes not relying on the u s intelligence community to tell him when thats happened
