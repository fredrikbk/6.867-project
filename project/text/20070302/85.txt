the afternoon report ditching airbus online edition theres nothing worse than waiting around for a delivery that seems as though it will never arrive just ask united parcel service which finally decided today it couldnt wait forever for airbus to drop off a batch of cargo jets the shipping bellwether said it will scratch orders for airbus a freighters because it doubted the struggling aerospace giant could deliver the promised planes on schedule the development comes just days after the companies agreed on a revised delivery timetable that would have seen ups take delivery of the planes in or ups was originally scheduled to receive its first a superjumbo freighter in but airbus then told the shipping company last fall that the earliest it could deliver the planes was then airbus said yesterday it was shutting down the freighter program in order to concentrate on the commercial version of the superjumbo finally ups management threw up its hands "based on our previous discussions we had felt that was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane " said david abney upss president and chief operating officer "we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule " as it happens ups was the only customer still clinging to the faint hope that a shiny a freighter would on some bright morning land on its doorstep ups rival fedex bailed out

fleets and phase out old planes as they attempt to keep pace with growing demand cant afford to twiddle their thumbs while airbus finds its center ups said for its part the canceled orders wont hurt its growth plans airbus is planning a shake up that includes job cuts but political static from the multinational eads ownership seems sure to tangle the restructuring and more delays may be a reasonable expectation airbuss manufacturing headaches along with a weakening dollar are making it look frail in comparison to boeing but even if the a hadnt been beset by technical problems and even if the dollar had maintained its lofty perch on the world currency markets some believe that airbus simply made an ill advised business decision for which it is now being punished by the market airbus bet that a gate crunch at major airports would force air carriers to demand monster airplanes they could pack with passengers but rising fuel costs and a withering of the traditional hub and spoke airline model turned airbuss wager inside out and boeing was able to step into the breech with its thinner and planes boeing has been trouncing airbus in most sales competitions ever since and is even luring some airbus customers to switch ups hasnt said if it will turn to boeing whose order books are bulging for new planes but todays news may be a victory by default for the u s aerospace giant
