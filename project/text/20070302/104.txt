weekend journal hollywood report tony vs the tudors showtimes henry viii takes on sopranos will sexy royals sell showtime is sending a monarch to take on the mob on april the pay cable channel will debut a lavish sex drenched soap chronicling the wild escapades of a young henry viii "the tudors " starring buff up and comer jonathan rhys meyers as the king of england is showtimes most expensive series ever and in a bold move the network slated the drama for sunday night territory that hbos "the sopranos" and "entourage" will easily dominate when they return after a long hiatus on april showtime still trying hard to catch up to long dominant hbo hopes the move will position "the tudors" to fill the void once the mobster drama leaves the air for good later this spring even the raw tone of "the tudors" is similar to that of "the sopranos " showtime owned by cbs is certainly pulling out all the stops for the series over the next few weeks it will roll out a megawatt marketing campaign estimated to cost &# million to &# million on par with what the big broadcast networks spend to launch promising new shows to rev up "the tudors " the cable network hired a "desperate housewives" veteran to direct episodes and the first two installments feature an over the top sex scene about every eight minutes "henry is usually depicted as a fat guy with a beard who spends his time chewing on chicken wings " says creator michael hirst "we werent interested at all in that guy our henry is a total rock star " although its rare for a network to go up against proven behemoths almost everybody concedes the middle of the week to foxs "american idol " for instance showtime has a limited number of slots in which to launch new shows sunday night when more people are watching tv than on any other night is one of them "you can worry about the competition or just believe in your programming " says showtime chief robert greenblatt "were putting the show where we think it has the best chance to find an audience " as far as hbo is concerned showtime doesnt even register as competition to some degree they have a point hbo owned by time warner has million subscribers compared with showtimes million according to media consultancy kagan research hbo has also already mined history for hits its "rome" just wrapped up a successful second season under the leadership of mr green blatt showtime has launched a flurry of buzzy shows over the past two years including "dexter " a drama about a congenial serial killer and "weeds " an off kilter comedy about a suburban mom who sells pot but the months mr greenblatt had to spend convincing mr rhys meyers and his representatives to consider the title role is evidence of how far showtime still has to climb the year old irish actor has been sought after for movie parts since his breakthrough role in as a soccer coach in "bend it like beckham " but he is still far from a household name yet showtime had to agree to a short episode season and a four year commitment instead of the usual five before his handlers would support his signing on for "the tudors " mr greenblatt says to woo the actor showtime also agreed to film the series in ireland instead of the cheaper czech republic the network and its producing partners are spending over &# million per episode about more than the industry average for a one hour show say people familiar with the production a manager for mr rhys meyers stacy boniello didnt return calls his agent sharon sheinwold referred a call to ms boniello mr greenblatt a former independent producer who got to know mr rhys meyers after casting him as elvis presley in the cbs miniseries "elvis " finally got his way after sending the actor some early scripts by mr hirst "i think people worry that period shows will feel like pbs " mr green blatt says "after johnny read the scripts he realized we wanted something that was edgy and visceral " in an email coordinated by his publicist mr rhys meyers said "michael hirst has written a version of henry that is unconventional and goes against most preconceived notions people may have which completely drew me to playing this character " the idea to focus on henry viii as a sex starved twentysomething came from ben silverman a prolific producer whose other credits include nbcs "the office" and abcs comedy "ugly betty " mr hirst who wrote the screenplay for the film "elizabeth " which starred cate blanchett as a year old elizabeth i says mr silverman called him up one day five years ago and invited the british writer to lunch at londons claridges hotel coming up with a show similar in tone to "the sopranos" was part of mr silvermans vision from the beginning the writer says "we discussed telling henrys story as sort of a tony soprano soap opera " mr hirst says "henry very much functioned like a mob godfather he wasnt polite he lived a raw medieval life " the pair pitched cbs a toned down version of the show in after the network passed saying it didnt fit with its scheduling needs messrs silverman and hirst approached showtime "i looked across television and there were no really great period pieces " says mr silverman "i felt that showtime would really get what i wanted to do " they got it all right after reading several early scripts showtime executives in a conference call early last year had only one question mr hirst says "is any of this true " tv and movie writers often take liberties with history to make their stories compelling to modern audiences some critics say last years "marie antoinette " with kirsten dunst as the young queen resembled a music video more than a biopic it bombed in theaters but "the tudors" may stretch the truth to new limits although the series follows henry viiis various military conquests his dealings with the church and the infamous six marriages it sticks to the facts only about of the time mr hirst estimates for instance he says viewers may be shocked to hear clergy swear in one early episode the king of england whips off his shirt and challenges the dauphin of france to a sweaty wrestling match "im just waiting to be attacked " mr hirst says
