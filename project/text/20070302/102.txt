weekend journal catalog critic the sun also rises imagine a morning when an electronic sun dawns to the chirp of virtual birds and the coffee laced scent of ethylene vinyl acetate aromatherapy beads a grim orwellian vision of the future nope its the latest gizmo to wake you up an alarm clock that mimics the sights and sometimes the sounds and smells of a bright and shiny new day lifestyle retailers claim these "dawn simulators" clocks with a built in light that gradually grows brighter help regulate the bodys natural circadian rhythms leaving users refreshed and alert instead of say bitter and groggy the claims have some basis in science studies have shown that dawn simulators the rising light part not the sounds or smells can be useful in treating sleep problems in people with seasonal affective disorder says kumar budur a psychiatrist and sleep specialist at the cleveland clinic sleep disorders center the jurys still out over whether theres any major benefit for the rest of us "but if you want to try one thats fine theres no harm in trying " dr budur says so we shopped for five choosing the most advanced model available from each retailer in addition to a light we set ours to brighten over minutes each clock had a backup audio alarm a traditional buzz nature sounds radio and or mp player the hammacher schlemmer model had an optional aromatherapy feature with four scents including "morning cafe " we began to think it was all rather bizarre if you want birds sun and coffee how about opening the window raising the shades and preprogramming the krups having tested the clocks we agree with dr budur they didnt harm us that said most annoyed us to no end not just because they were all decor nightmares several were a pain to set one came with a burned out bulb the chemical java aroma of the hammacher schlemmer scent beads was so strong all night that by the time we woke up we could no longer smell the "coffee " only the biobrite did what it was supposed to waking us gently with a soft light though the bar was pretty low its best overall how we shopped it was a challenge finding these clocks online at first because we didnt know what term to google then we tried "dawn simulator " bingo lots of retailers came up more old fashioned models are available like the &# moonbeam clock introduced in the s at l l bean contact us at catalogcritic wsj com digital sunrise clock with white noise best overall biobrite biobrite com &# standard shipping varies by zip code ours was &# the good theres at least some design vision a curvy yin yang thing and it emitted a nice glowing pseudo dawn it had a standard alarm and a white noise feature but no birds the bad the roughly football sized contraption took up half of our bedside table as with any of the clocks the dawn simulator works best in a dark room the shopping the scientific looking site has some literature about sad but no information on shipping times peaceful progression wake up clock best value hammacher schlemmer hammacher com &# standard shipping adds &# the good it had a lot of options for the money and even with the added sound and scent options it was a snap to set the bad wed skip the aroma beads and so much for "peaceful progression" after minutes of gentle light and bird songs the loud standard alarm jarred the peace right out of us the shopping did we get used goods the box looked as if it had been opened and the manual and an aromatherapy vial were loose in the shipping carton the retailer says we could have sent it back for an exchange sunrise &amp sunset alarm clock with soothing sound gadget universe gadgetuniverse com &# standard shipping adds &# the good its light retracts when not in use so the clock was a tad less obtrusive than the others programming it was easy like setting a basic digital alarm clock the bad the "sun" literally rose out of the clock with a mechanical whir and the chirping "birds" sounded like the screeching brakes on the

shine deluxe natural alarm clock the sharper image sharperimage com &# standard shipping adds &# the good cleverly space saving at least in theory its a clock and lamp in one features include eight

we called a customer service rep e mailed a copy
