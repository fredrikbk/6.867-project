till the end of time chicago when i was a boy my father the late political philosopher maurice aristotle machiavelli montesquieu de tocqueville epstein took me aside to explain that in the chicago aldermanic races of the day candidates were spending as much as a quarter of a million dollars to acquire jobs that would pay them an annual salary of &# "think about this son and let me know what you conclude " he said walking off with a sly smile he was of the peripatetic school of philosophy my father callow youth though i might be i was not entirely a numbskull and under my fathers tutelage i came quickly enough to understand that appearance and reality are not always congruent and perhaps nowhere is the distance between the two greater than in chicago politics where idealism it does not go too far to say is the first sign of encroaching insanity which partly explains why richard m daley after a term in office marked by heavy nearly relentless scandal now enters his sixth term as mayor of the city of chicago having won tuesday by acquiring a resounding of the vote to be denied election mr daley would have to have been proven to have ties to al qaeda or to have been caught copping quarters from the poor box at holy name cathedral in chicago a certain amount of scandal scores of people have been charged and convicted in a patronage scheme for example is taken as business as usual to worry too much about it is to be thought squeamish if not indecently delicate mr daley has by chicago standards been a great mayor possibly the greatest the city has known with this new term he shall also be the mayor longest in office the reason for both his greatness and his longevity in the job is that he keeps the machine oiled the joint running the tax base low the town prosperous is everybody happy not a lengthy period is required for cities even magnificent cities to fall apart in his novel "life and fate " the russian writer vasily grossman notes "man never understands that the cities he has built are not an integral part of nature if he wants to defend his culture from wolves and snowstorms if he wants to save it from being strangled by weeds he must keep his broom spade and rifle always at hand if he goes to sleep if he thinks about something else for a year or two then everythings lost the wolves come out of the forest the thistles spread and everything is buried under dust and snow " chicagoans understand this better than most in the interregnum between the two daleys pere et fils that is in the years between and when chicago was without a daley as mayor the wolves were out snows clogged the pavement thistles rolled down crime ridden sad streets dust was everywhere that old decline and fall feeling was in the air rich daley put an end to that the city he has governed has become a vibrant place culturally booming buildings and civic works shooting up all over without obvious racial tension a place in which the talented young are eager to live in this past election mr daley had no real competition apart from a few disgruntled aldermen and local hacks for a time there was talk of jesse jackson jr the congressman and son of the altogether too ubiquitous clergyman taking a shot at running for mayor being mayor of chicago is a greater launching pad for an ambitious young politician than is being a backbencher in the house of representatives but mr jackson realized that mr daley even carrying the freight of scandal within his government couldnt be beaten more is entailed in mr daleys success than a la mussolini a matter of making the railroads run on time mr daley is not theoretician of government but a problem solver and a tenacious one his tenacity is immensely aided by his lack of personal ambition ambition that is to be anything more than mayor of the city of chicago the great administrators and rich daley i believe qualifies here are those men and women who have no desire to be elsewhere the best academic deans do not dream of being president of harvard the best husbands do not dream of sleeping with nicole kidman the best mayors do not dream of going on to the senate and up the greasy pole from there they are anchored happy in their work committed to the job at hand in perpetuity mr daley will be next month the job of mayor appears to be his for as long as he can get to the office in the morning my own expectation is that as mayor of chicago as an older englishman might say of a recently purchased overcoat he will see me out mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" harpercollins
