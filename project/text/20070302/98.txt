tough talks desperate to cut costs ford gets unions help one factory at a time uaw votes givebacks members long resisted detroit for years jerry sullivan the head of the largest united auto workers local at ford motor co fought for higher pay job protections and limits on the work his members had to do but in the past year as ford teetered financially the year old vietnam veteran has changed course these days he has urged his members to accept the outsourcing of company factory jobs to lower paid workers and to work new shifts without the tens of thousands of dollars in overtime they formerly would have earned "ford is in a desperate situation " sighs the burly bearded mr sullivan who has spent years at ford the last as president of uaw local in suburban dearborn "if this company goes down i want to be able to look in the mirror and say i did everything i could " mr sullivans turnabout reflects the stark reality facing the uaw and the big u s car companies which still employ roughly a third of the unions workers after years of job cuts the big three auto makers acknowledge japanese and korean companies are out earning them on each car by delivering more features for less cost now detroit with some help from the union is trying to dismantle old business methods factory by factory in an effort to cut costs ford which lost &# billion last year so far has persuaded uaw locals at of its plants to accept new agreements aimed at transforming the way work is done on the factory floor the "competitive operating agreements " all reached in the past months loosen some complex and often costly work rules in past local negotiations union leaders rarely gave any ground and talks often stalled over such matters as getting microwaves installed for employees use but this time recognizing their precarious position dearborn members agreed that non ford workers earning half their pay could take jobs in the plant such as shuttling car components across the factory floor thousands of uaw members accepted changing to four day hour shifts that can include weekend days without collecting overtime at an engine plant in lima ohio some union workers have volunteered to manage their brethren for a cent an hour bump in pay elsewhere long honored seniority rules have been waived and job definitions have been broadened the new pacts dont deal with uaw members pay packages which due to health care and other benefits are about higher than for workers at asian auto makers u s plants those issues are to be handled in national talks between the uaw leadership and the car companies this summer but company officials and labor experts say fords local negotiations in which ford asked for the unions help may help set a precedent for the national talks an industry consultants chart used by ford during some negotiations with locals estimated detroits auto makers have an average "profit gap" of &# per vehicle compared with the u s units of toyota motor corp honda motor co and nissan motor co that gap is so wide that detroit is losing money on each car labor costs represent &# to &# of the gap according to the consultants figures the biggest share of that &# to &# is attributable to retirees health care costs next is &# for work rules edging out &# for active workers health care ford estimates it will save &# billion a year if all plants adopt the various work rule changes being asked of them daimlerchrysler ag and general motors corp have negotiated some similar changes but generally only at new facilities such as an engine plant that chrysler opened in in dundee mich the uaw hasnt given chrysler similar deals elsewhere in part because chrysler was seen as a profitable company until just a few months ago say people familiar with the talks gm officials taken aback by fords success in getting concessions have begun visiting plants across michigan ohio and elsewhere seeking similar local deals in an effort they have dubbed "true north " at ford the uaw is allowing locals to tear up existing deals months or years before they expire to put the new rules in place ford also has said it will close seven unidentified plants in the next few years and subtly uses that threat with its locals the resulting changes have allowed ford to cut jobs through buyouts once one of the most powerful unions in the world the uaw has seen its work force gutted to about a third of its peak in the s it so far has avoided wholesale concessions unlike unions in the steel and airline industries where many companies have restructured through bankruptcy proceedings but just in the past year gm ford and chrysler have announced restructuring moves that will eventually eliminate about uaw jobs which would lower its membership to just under more cuts could be on the way particularly if daimlerchrysler decides to sell or spin off its chrysler unit yesterday ford announced another big monthly drop in sales for february chrysler said its sales dropped for the month gm announced a cut in production despite a slight sales uptick ford based in dearborn is navigating the worst financial crisis in its year history it expects to keep losing money until at least because it banked for too long on its sales of trucks and suvs continuing to thrive instead they have begun sliding because of rising oil prices and increased competition for most of the s ford was rated the most efficient detroit auto maker the company made &# billion in at the time a record for any auto maker despite a steady rise in market share in the s by the japanese companies in a key auto manufacturing efficiency study called the harbour report estimated ford could assemble a new vehicle in about hours of labor that was five or six hours slower than its asian counterparts like toyota and nissan but hours faster than gm or chrysler ford acknowledges it rested on its laurels as the profits from its popular sport utility vehicles and pickups masked underlying problems in its manufacturing systems by gm and chrysler began to gain on ford last year the harbour report estimated that ford was two hours slower than gm and chrysler and also had slipped to six or seven hours behind the japanese companies "no question we let others pass us on these things we took our eye off the ball and got intoxicated with just making trucks " said chris bolen a ford director of manufacturing who started out as a lima line worker "internally we ignored a lot of waste we let manufacturing get in trouble and now weve painted ourselves into a corner where without radical changes we could go out of business " to avert disaster ford asked for the unions help says joe hinrichs fords head of north american manufacturing instead of just confronting uaw leaders with a list of work practices management wanted to change mr hinrichs and his staff have showed their union counterparts how big the cost gaps are at their factories using the harbour figures and internal data "we really need our people to realize we arent competitive " says mr hinrichs a year old harvard graduate who came to ford after serving as one of the youngest plant managers in gm history "no one has a right to be uncompetitive " for many uaw members some of the changes at ford would have been unthinkable just a few years ago the talks have ventured into sensitive areas such as high uaw absentee rates at ford plants workers only needed a doctors note to be absent without using a vacation day and fords absentee rate on plant floors has been about which the company asserts is about twice the rate of its asian rivals each percentage point costs ford about &# million per year say ford executives the new agreements cap the number of absences regardless of excuse though the company would not discuss the figure still ford and other u s makers still are not nearly as efficient as their japanese rivals "really they are just now getting to rules or processes that toyota already had in place at their plants " said laurie harbour felax the auto efficiency consultant whose figures ford used "they have a long way to go " some work rule changes remain beyond reach for ford at the dearborn truck assembly factory for instance if the company wants to bring in an outside company for specialized repairs to its assembly equipment it must also pay the same number of company repairmen to work last summer ford executives went to mr sullivan as the auto maker was looking at its plans for the next generation of its f pickup truck due out in mid the f is the best selling and most profitable vehicle ford makes but sales slipped last year and it faced two redesigned competitors in gms chevy silverado and toyotas tundra the latter built at a new plant in san antonio ford planned to close its norfolk va truck plant and make fewer f trucks and wanted cuts at dearborn before they would move some of norfolks work there rather than elsewhere mr sullivan didnt have to look far for a worst case scenario he also represents workers at nearby rouge steel a steelmaking operation spun off from ford that began bankruptcy proceedings in "bankruptcy is devastating peoples pensions and health care can just be lost taken away " he says "we understand our work practices werent the best we know how dire it is " mr sullivan and company officials said he like other uaw locals had the national unions backing to negotiate changes though uaw national officials wouldnt comment on its locals agreements dearborn truck assembly fords most recently constructed u s plant sits at the heart of the companys michigan home base its on the site of a previous plant that hosted famous battles by the uaw in the s to organize the auto makers workers over founder henry fords resistance to try to persuade workers to accept what amounted to a retreat from the uaws tradition of always adding to pay and benefits ford plant manager rob webber and kenneth macfarlane director of manufacturing operations for ford trucks shut down the plant floor one day last july to mount a rousing presentation for about workers seated in folding chairs "this is about the uncompetitiveness of us " mr webber announced and put on a video of toyota unveiling its new tundra at the chicago auto show "notice it is ford blue " shouted mr macfarlane he pointed out toyota used the same george thorogood song "bad to the bone " that ford had used in commercials for its f series "make no mistake who they are after " shouted mr macfarlane "it is us " the crowd roared back at him to cut costs messrs webber and macfarlane asked local to let ford hire workers employed by outside contractors to handle unskilled tasks such as wheeling bins of parts and sweeping up the plant floor this kind of outsourcing has long been anathema to the uaw gary walkowicz a year old former uaw plant chairman who has years with ford and now works on the line installing engine wires and other parts handed out fliers to rally dissent "i dont believe in concessions the company will always want more from us " he says about of the workers at dearborn truck assembly and other dearborn plants in local voted in favor of the new agreement elsewhere winning margins have been even higher now uaw members making &# to &# an hour plus benefits that more than double their compensation work for ford at the dearborn truck plant alongside hourly workers making about half the wages and few of the benefits painted yellow safety lines marking walkways between assembly areas on the shop floor now also divide the ford assembly line work force from the outside workers who stay between the lines while ford outsourced about to jobs the uaw didnt lose that many members as part of the contract ford agreed that any outside firm it hired would have to support the uaw organizing the new workers albeit at the lower pay scale mr webber the plant manager says the agreement at dearborn truck saves ford about &# million the largest savings at any one ford plant ford says it also will avoid paying about &# million it would have had to pay in annual overtime for workers to adopt four day hour shifts in place of five day eight hour shifts the four day schedule allows ford to save on utility bills and schedule maintenance on weekdays at an engine plant in lima ohio ford has achieved savings a different way workers there were faced with the threat that engine work could be shifted south to mexico or another plant in addition to accepting outsourcing of work they agreed to shift many managerial duties to union employees this allowed ford to cut the nonunion head count at lima from people to about with the new agreement limas union work force dropped to about workers from the uaw supervisors are called "team leaders " and work in a structure borrowed from japanese assembly lines overseeing eight to other union members the team leaders use big electronic scoreboards above their heads to track each days target for assembling engines if line speeds need to be increased or slowed "rebalanced" in ford parlance the decision is made by uaw members instead of salaried engineers who typically were paid &# or more annually ford had long given up on the union accepting such a move "there are days i wonder why i am doing all this " says brad caskie now a team leader and veteran of years at the lima plant "its pretty much like being a manager and also a worker ford said to us this is what toyota and honda do so its what we need to do " until last summer mr caskies job at ford was to put timing components on car or truck engines as they chugged down the line just under of them an hour when the plant adopted a competitive operating agreement last may and team leader jobs opened paying cents more an hour mr caskie volunteered now the year old ohio native manages workers scheduling vacations overseeing quality of work and arranging meetings to discuss safety or downtime problems when he gets a chance he jumps on the computer near the engine line to see how his team stacks up in terms of quality and speed compared with other teams "im loyal to the company they put my kids through college " said mr caskie who got his first ford job in part because his stepfather and uncle both uaw workers for ford helped him get in "i feel like we had no choice really but to do this " plant manager jan allman says the lima agreement saves the auto maker about &# million a year overall her goal is for lima to pass toyota in the harbour efficiency studies in the process hasnt always gone smoothly earlier this year ford despite its continuing losses said it was considering giving bonuses to white collar workers in part thanks to the cost savings it achieved in getting the new local agreements at the michigan truck plant in wayne mich workers were furious that they were taking cuts while their managers were in line for bonuses a vote on a cost cutting deal there was delayed for weeks after ford acknowledged any bonus plan must include the union the vote was rescheduled and the agreement passed "that bonus thing sent a bad message " says mr sullivan "this is a partnership right we are in this together right we made our concessions so lets be fair " the company is still working out details of the bonus plan
