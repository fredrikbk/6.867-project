weekend journal the wealth report a risky profile asset shift leaves wealthy more exposed to a slump finding corridor of safety when financial markets fall conventional wisdom says the little guy feels the pain while the rich emerge largely unscathed this time may be different this weeks stock market gyrations highlight an uncomfortable truth about the recent wealth boom which has created an unprecedented number of millionaires and billionaires and driven up sales of everything from art and wine to yachts and mansions behind all that wealth is a rising amount of financial risk and borrowing which could inflict substantial losses on the wealthy and the luxury world if markets plummet todays rich have expanded their fortunes and lifestyles in large part by turning to highly risky investments in the search for ever higher returns theyve doubled their holdings in hedge funds and other "alternative investments " and poured their money into stocks while draining down cash at the same time theyve dramatically increased their debt "the wealthy have taken on much more risk than they had or years ago " says steve henningsen a partner at wealth conservancy a colorado wealth management firm "theyre probably more exposed to more risk than the average investor because theyve been the ones buying all these fancy debt products hedge funds and other investments that their advisers told them to buy " granted the rich can afford it if an entrepreneur worth &# million loses half of his investments hes still a multimillionaire yet the risks piling up at the top have created a precarious elite and a financial system heavily intertwined with the wealthy consider stocks the nations richest controlled of the countrys individually held stocks in the latest period measured that was up from in the stock holdings of the richest totaled &# trillion in about equal to the total stock wealth held by the other so when the dow jones industrials tumble as they did this week the top bears larger losses in the last time markets fell significantly financial millionaires or those with at least &# million in investable assets lost &# billion of their total wealth of &# trillion that represented of their wealth yet today theyre exposed to risks far less understood than stocks or bonds since financial millionaires have more than doubled their exposure to hedge funds private equity and other so called alternative investments according to merrill lynch and cap gemini those investments now make up more than of their portfolio they also have increased their exposure to stocks by meantime theyve cut their holdings of cash and bonds the two most stable investments their exposure to real estate has stayed the same todays wealthy also rely more on borrowed money the nations richest held &# trillion in debt up fourfold from a large part of that is mortgage debt but wealth experts say some of the funds have also gone into risky and higher yielding investments such as hedge funds since hedge funds themselves are highly leveraged the double borrowing could make for a rapid fall should hedge funds start to implode while the rich employ sophisticated advisers sometimes they dont steer their clients to the safest investments "a lot of the wealthy have leveraged up their house to put money into hedge funds or do the japan carry trade because they could make more than their costs of borrowing " mr henningsen said "that desire for yield could come back to haunt them " granted some rich investors have started to pare back their risk anticipating a downturn a study by the chicago based spectrem group found that investors with &# million or more in investable assets last year started to move their money away from more aggressive investments like hedge funds and private equity toward more conservative products maria chrin chief executive of circle financial group a new york wealth management firm says the members of the group started reviewing their exposure to riskier investments in their portfolios including hedge funds last spring though she declined to say if the review made them change their portfolio choices but she adds "few investors are adequately evaluating the level of risk in their portfolios " investment advisers say some clients this week started moving money out of overseas stocks exotic debt products and stocks and into cash and bonds others tried pulling money out of their hedge funds but many funds have lock ups which prevent investors from immediately divesting one new york wealth management firm solaris group anticipated a decline and last week put some of its clients into a complex trade that protected their stock holdings in case the market fell between and "we called it our corridor of safety " says solaris founder ralph sinsheimer on the whole however advisers said most clients are staying put at the same time the appetite for risk among the wealthy for even more exotic markets such as wine art
