weekend journal religions generation gap when children become more devout than their parents relationships can get strained katherine rosman on keeping the faith and the peace at the dinner table sex drugs and rock n roll used to be the big three of rebellion some families are adding religion to that list an increasing number of teens and young adults who were raised in nonreligious or nominally religious families are getting swept up in religious fervor this is creating a complicated and sometimes painful family dynamic the parents of year old kevin ellstrand are self described secular humanists who shun organized religion two years ago kevin says he "started following christ with all my heart " he has taken a missionary trip to mexico and participates in a weekly bible study group in a time when many teens are having sex and taking drugs his parents mostly consider his piety a blessing they get upset however when kevin explains that he doesnt believe in evolution "to me this is appalling " says his mother karen byers who has a doctorate in strategic management and was raised a methodist "we get into arguments and voices get a little louder than they should " kevin says "i dont want my parents to go to hell for not believing in god but that is whats going to happen and it really scares me " kevins father alan ellstrand director of m b a programs at the university of arkansas business school says he respects his son but is saddened that he has such worries "im sorry thats the byproduct of his religious studies " says mr ellstrand who grew up unitarian while parents of newly devout offspring often consider religion a benign if not positive influence some say they are disappointed that their children have chosen a lifestyle so different from their own some of these teens and young adults are forgoing secular careers in favor of the ministry moving away from home to religious enclaves skipping family celebrations and changing their given names clergy are in the difficult position of trying to guide young people toward devoutness without dishonoring their families the reluctance of parents to accept their childrens choices can be a source of frustration for some youths and their pastors "my joke is they liked them better when they were on drugs " says pastor peter la joy who directs the student ministry at calvary chapel in tucson ariz while statistics on the number of devout young people are hard to come by some groups that minister to the young report big gains young life an evangelical christian ministry that focuses on children "disinterested" in religion says more than teens attended its programs on a weekly basis during the school year up from years ago "mecca and main street " a new book by geneive abdo a senior analyst at the gallup organizations center for muslim studies argues that a significant number of young u s muslims are becoming substantially more devoted to islam than their parents in the jewish community a growing number of formerly secular young people are embracing an orthodox lifestyle this issue is especially fraught in immigrant communities magdalena ramos and her late husband came to los angeles from honduras years ago to provide economic opportunity for their children "every parent wants their child to have more money " says mrs ramos a housekeeper who didnt raise her son abner with religion during his sophomore year at the university of california at los angeles abner declared that he had decided to devote his life to christ but she became disappointed when abner decided to forgo his plans of becoming a psychologist in favor of low paying ministry work though mrs ramos says she is proud that her son is "a good christian " she had thought he would be the first person in the family with a professional career he also had told her when he was a boy that hed one day help support her says abner who now is "my moms dreams for me are inconsistent with the callings god has for me " tom lins parents immigrants from taiwan sent him to harvard university with the expectation he would become a corporate attorney when he instead opted for a much lower paying career in a christian ministry his mother threatened to kill herself says mr lin a regional director for intervarsity a college ministry that has chapters in the u s mr lin adds that both parents cut off all communication with him for seven years reconnecting only after his mother was diagnosed with cancer she died in mr lin says his choices were "shaming" to the values held within many immigrant cultures his parents "moved to america for material prosperity " says mr lin "when immigrants children forsake the very reason they came to this country its particularly devastating " families in which the children are more religious than the parents arent the norm in "soul searching the religious and spiritual lives of american teenagers " university of notre dame professor christian smith reports that a childs religious beliefs generally will closely reflect his parents and not all religious fervor among the children of secular families has a solely spiritual basis at times "its a part of teenage rebellion " says azeem khan the former national coordinator of young muslims a group that runs summer camps and other youth oriented religious programs overall americans religious devotion seems to have remained fairly constant over the past years in a gallup poll of respondents said they were members of a church or synagogue down slightly from in when asked how important they considered religion in their own lives said it was very important the same as in the embrace of islam by young people can be confounding to secular muslim americans who immigrated to the united states in the s and s "our parents were more culturally muslim than religious " says farhan latif the former president of the muslim students association at the university of michigans dearborn campus and the alumni adviser to the chapter but in the wake of the sept attacks and the racial profiling of muslims that ensued some young people have gravitated toward their religion as a show of ancestral pride and an act of defiance against a society they see as discriminatory young muslims for example says it has seen participation double since to more than people growing up in a pakistani neighborhood in london ershen ali says he shied away from embracing his religion because he says he associated it with "a lot of hypocrisy " he says he routinely witnessed self proclaimed devout muslims drinking alcohol a violation of the quran while attending loyola marymount university in los angeles he joined the muslim students association and began to learn more about "true" islam he says he now considers himself religious praying four or five times a day when planning a recent road trip he consulted google to find a mosque in wyoming mr ali says his father rashid ali has greeted his religious transformation nervously "my dad is always like keep it on the down low " says ershen a management trainee at a supply chain management company in los angeles rashid an engineer for a multinational oil company in the middle east says that his own parents who suffered religious persecution in india taught him that spiritual beliefs are a private matter and the racial profiling of young muslim men has only cemented that view he says he is comfortable with his sons devotion so long as he continues to stay focused on his career and maintains a moderate approach to islam "i feel unfortunately these days that you have to save your kids from drugs from gangs and from radicalism " says the elder mr ali young people gravitating toward orthodoxy is also an emergent issue in the orthodox jewish community
