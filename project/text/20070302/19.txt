continental divide u s stirs debate over africa bank temporary home in tunis starts to look permanent despite a culture clash tunis tunisia to the bush administration it seems obvious the african development banks headquarters should be in black africa four years ago the bank which funds development and antipoverty efforts fled civil war in its longtime home in ivory coast for a temporary refuge in tunisia a stable country in arab north africa now the u s says its time for the bank to leave tunisia give up hopes of returning to ivory coast and find a new permanent home somewhere else south of the sahara "a permanently temporary location simply will not do " ahmed saeed a senior u s treasury official said at the banks annual meeting last may in a roomful of african and european bank delegates not a single person rose to endorse the u s position instead the suggestion that the bank move has fueled a prickly fight involving african pride and european colonialism with accusations traded about arab racism and american arrogance many black african and european member nations agree in principle that the bank should have its headquarters in a sub saharan country whats more some black africans say they experience racism in tunisia "people call you monkey " says one west african banker "sometimes you feel like killing the person but you just give up " but leaving ivory coast permanently black africans fear would signal that a country once hailed as a model of african hope is now just another horror story north africans quietly hope that if they bide their time the bank will end up staying in tunisia out of bureaucratic inertia and everyone but the u s thinks pressing the issue is the diplomatic equivalent of hitting a hornets nest with a stick "we should not even open this discussion " says one senior bank official from black africa since it was established in abidjan ivory coast by african heads of state in the bank has provided more than &# billion in financing although it went through financial woes and mismanagement in the s the banks supporters say it is now back on track to fight poverty and disease tapping financial markets and rich country donations the banks efforts include grants to fight the marburg virus in angola loans to build roads in congo and credits to support state banks in tunisia the u s one of the member nations is contributing &# million to the bank this year for years the banks home country stood as a shining example of africas potential ivory coast boasted good roads fine restaurants and west africas only ice skating rink things fell apart in when rebels attempted to overthrow president laurent gbagbo triggering massacres and civil war with gunfire in the air managers of the development bank frantically evacuated about employees and their families in early the bank picked tunisia as a temporary refuge in large part because of the stability offered by the dictatorial government of president zine el abidine ben ali the new home sparked something of a culture clash both bank and tunisian officials say the influx of thousands of bank professionals and their families jarred a country that had little experience with black africans except as students or laborers bank professional staff earn between &# and &# a year far more than the average tunisian and many drive mercedes or bmw sedans with easily identifiable african development bank license plates they say they have often returned to their parked cars to find them intentionally scratched "sometimes were our own worst enemies " says one east african bank official "were too ostentatious for our own good " four years after the move ivory coast remains in limbo some french and united nations troops patrol a buffer zone between the government controlled south and the rebels in the north the banks official home is still abidjan but the bush administration believes returning there isnt in the cards this month president bush cited "the massacre of large numbers of civilians" and "widespread human rights abuses" in ivory coast in an executive order freezing assets of those contributing to the violence u s treasury officials who want the bank to find a permanent home say tunis is inconvenient because it has no direct flights to most of eastern central or southern africa a bank staffer going to negotiate a loan in rwanda might have to spend a night in paris and another in nairobi washington also believes it enjoys more support than is apparent on the surface especially from anglophone southern and eastern africa ethiopia and zambia have quietly let it be known that theyd be happy to host the bank according to an official familiar with the discussions publicly most africans arent ready to abandon ivory coast "most people feel if your neighbor is in trouble you should help him and not just run away " says gerald zirimwabagabo who represents rwanda ethiopia uganda and several other nations on the banks board of directors france the former colonial ruler of both tunisia and ivory coast is particularly reluctant to see the bank move to a country where people dont speak french meanwhile many european staff members enjoy hopping to rome paris and other european capitals for long weekends "my opinion is that this relocation in tunis will continue" until ivory coast stabilizes says francesco pittore who represents italy france and belgium on the board of directors it cost an estimated &# million to move out of abidjan he says tunisian officials say they arent working to supplant ivory coast "but if the question is on the table about finding a new permanent headquarters we would present our candidacy to be the host " says moncef bouallagui tunisias representative on the board of directors tunisia aspires to be a regional financial center and mr bouallagui says the banks presence is "a sparkling sign to other businesses that people trust tunisia " largely unspoken in the public debate is simmering discontent with tunis among the banks black african staff the employees union estimates that three quarters of the banks staff are living apart from their children spouse or both many employees had lived in ivory coast for a decade or more prior to the evacuation they owned homes that in some cases now sit empty many of their spouses ran small businesses in tunis they typically need a tunisian as a majority partner to go into business black africans say they feel unwelcome in tunis "they look at you like youre from mars " says one veteran central african bank staffer while bank employees say such overt racism has diminished in recent years they still encounter it "i dont say that kind of behavior doesnt exist " says moufida jaballah srarfi a director in tunisias ministry of development and international cooperation "as a tunisian if i go to europe or another country maybe ill encounter racist behavior but i cant judge all westerners as racist based on one case we cant pigeonhole people " one tunisian isabelle naouar senses opportunity among the homesick and well off last month she opened a restaurant next door to the bank the decor is west african the chef ivorian and the tables full "we hope the bank wont move back " she says african development bank founded headquarters abidjan ivory coast evacuated due to civil strife in february temporary headquarters tunis tunisia members nations of which are non african donor countries operations provided &# billion in loans grants and debt relief to african nations in source african development bank
