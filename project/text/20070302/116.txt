the extras befitting a hall of fame quarterback a square foot main house two guest houses a waterfall jacuzzi spa a volleyball court and a putting green what it lacks is a buyer after more than a year on the market a &# million price cut to &# million and a change in listing agents the former miami dolphins home still hasnt sold from miami to san francisco the real estate market is glutted with the splashy homes of professional athletes experts say there are simply more of them out there than there were a decade ago as salaries and signing bonuses have soared and even some first year players are living large in gigantic decked out homes at the same time trades and free agency deals have continued apace meaning more properties are being put up for sale every year and the offers arent rolling in over the top customized amenities such as foot doorways wrought iron gates emblazoned with uniform numbers and basketball courts with stadium seating arent hitting home with prospective buyers many of these properties are sitting on the market for a year or more and if they finally do sell its often at substantially discounted prices americans spent heavily on renovations and upgrades during the frenzied real estate boom &# billion in up an inflation adjusted from a decade earlier according to the national association of home builders and now many are having trouble getting a return on their investment but athletes have turned customization into an extreme sport red sox slugger manny ramirez has yet to sell his square foot condo in boston the &# million penthouse in the ritz carlton towers was listed in when mr ramirez put it up for sale amid postseason rumors that he wanted to be traded he wound up staying with the team and recently took the apartment off the market but local agents say its still available the price may be too high for the area agents say but potential buyers may also be having trouble seeing themselves in an apartment that has a bedroom decked out like fenway park including a mural of the field with the trademark citgo sign in the background and twin beds made to look like the green monster outfield wall with authentic paint and netting "most of the people at the ritz are year olds or year olds i dont think they would see the attraction " says john keith an independent real estate agent in boston both mr ramirez and his broker declined to comment former teammate pedro martinezs luck hasnt been much better he has yet to find a buyer for his house in brookline mass where among other things his initials are inlaid into the parquet floor in the entranceway the five bedroom home where mr martinez lived during his seven years with the red sox before he signed with the new york mets is listed for &# about &# less than its price dallas cowboys wide receiver terrell owens is having similar problems his five bedroom house in moorestown n j the site of his now infamous driveway sit up display during his rancorous contract dispute with the philadelphia eagles was originally listed in october for about &# million its now available for &# million less than what he paid for it in hes also been trying to sell another property in lithonia ga for about a year now even in a community known for expensive real estate mr owenss property available for &# million stands out the square foot house also has features his neighbors homes probably dont such as an indoor basketball court with spectator seating the sort of building more likely to be seen on a college campus than in someones backyard "thats probably the most expensive home within miles of there and thats the problem " says mr owenss broker bill ransom athletes of course arent the only ones contending with todays flagging real estate market nationally sales volume of existing homes fell in over the largest year on year drop since and inventory was up according to the national association of realtors with more homes to choose from buyers are even less likely to pay a premium for amenities they dont want and more likely to pass on homes with personalized features they would have to remove "highly personalized is a nice way of saying your taste isnt what people want " says lanse robb a broker with landvest realty in massachusetts some amenities such as extra large swimming pools or elaborate game rooms simply cost more to build than they add in value other more unusual touches can actually make a home less marketable one example a condo in chicago with an interior that thomas gorman an agent who has toured the house describes as "very jetsons " complete with a vertigo inducing glass spiral staircase originally listed for &# million the condo was just reduced to &# million not all athletes have a choice however they just want to fit in the house former heat center rony seikaly for example had his miami home built with foot high doorways to accommodate his foot inch frame nor do all athletes own homes that are difficult to sell former carolina panthers running back tim biakabutuka rented during his first year in charlotte in then paid &# for a fairly modest square foot home in an affluent but not showy executive home area "some of my neighbors were wondering what i was doing there " he says the house sold two months after he put it on the market in for &# nonetheless the number of athletes with over the top properties on the market is increasing the main reason of course is that they can afford to buy such homes in the first place annual salaries for players in sports like basketball baseball and football now top the &# million mark and signing bonuses continue to rise every year moreover many athletes are earning that money at a time when most people their age are sharing cramped apartments with multiple roommates or living at home with their parents at the same time the cultural influence of television shows like "mtv cribs" has set the bar for the luxe life higher than ever the result athletes are spending big on real estate bling and often very early in their careers the denver nuggets carmelo anthony for example who signed a more than &# million contract in when he was years old bought a house in lakewood colo for &# million the following year it has a batting cage and a bedroom balcony that overlooks an indoor basketball court "any other career its very very slowly youre moving up that ladder " says michaela scurlock of vision realty group which specializes in helping athletes with their real estate deals and is owned by carolina panthers defensive end mike rucker "you literally go from being a college student and heres the draft and in a number of months youre a multimillionaire " says ms scurlock whose husband mike played five seasons in the national football league "sometimes the objective is to have the coolest pad in town " says ed kaminsky whose company sports star relocation has worked with alex rodriguez marcus camby johnny damon and other stars "these guys are in their s maybe their s so what do they like they like home theaters they like playing poker they arent married they have girlfriends its exciting to show off their hard work " other players cant imagine the day when they might have to change teams hardy nickerson a former nfl linebacker who runs a relocation firm for athletes says many jocks arent that farsighted "you get a lot of guys who just arent thinking that theyd ever leave the place theyre playing in " mr nickerson says that may be beginning to change however most of the major leagues now offer some form of orientation for rookies that includes financial planning tips a cottage industry has sprung up to offer advice to young athletes on everything from real estate to retirement one group the professional business and financial network founded by former nfl defensive back ryan mcneil publishes ot a magazine for current and former athletes "i think the younger players coming into the draft know a lot more about whats going on " says frank zecca vice president of octagon a financial services company that works with many pro athletes when all else fails theres always the chance that another player is waiting in the wings

a star on his way into town red sox pitcher curt schilling that didnt surprise mr bledsoes broker maryanne rizzo she always suspected the square foot house which had a wine cellar and a pool with a
