weekend journal taste de gustibus theyre singing songs of love but not for me i recently bought a house on the spur of the moment because of a bird i have never seen it happened during a semi social visit to a family that was about to sell the countryside house they built in the s i had no real idea of moving as i politely toured the inside for a couple of minutes before crossing the backyard to view the land beyond it and then i saw them a line of bluebird houses on poles stretching across a meadow into the distance out came my checkbook just like that funny what seems important at different stages of life we may well snort with derision when the beauty pageant contestants tell us that their goal is to bring about world peace yet thats not an entirely idiotic statement coming from people as young as they are when dreams are big and reserves of energy are wide and deep at some point though we all grow older and grandiosity of ambition gives way to more intimate customized wishes until recently my list had four one swimming with dolphins has now been achieved another playing rhythm guitar on a stage before thousands of screaming rock fans has been abandoned as unrealistic and even unappetizing have you seen patti smith watching the whirling dervishes in turkey can be done easily enough if i try what apparently wont be simple even with all the little houses i now have is seeing a bluebird that creature has often been on my mind since childhood when i watched the old s movie "the blue bird " in which shirley temple searched endlessly for the technicolored "bluebird of happiness " the phrase it seems has now been trademarked by a company in arkansas that sells blown glass figurines in truth the songbird a member of the thrush family has been a symbol of happiness love and other hopeful things for thousands of years in cultures around the world a dead bluebird by contrast represents disillusionment and loss and such omens were all too abundant in the real world until a few years ago by the mid s for instance the eastern bluebird was an endangered species land clearing for development or forest management had removed many of the dead trees and split rail fences in which the bird likes to make cavity nests at the same time house sparrows and european starlings both imports to this country were aggressively grabbing the remaining cavity real estate then in an amazingly effective rescue effort people across much of the u s erected thousands of nesting boxes and began vigilantly patrolling the specially designed houses to chuck out house sparrows and deter predators the eastern bluebird is bountiful again and safe for now if only one would show itself and bring joy to me there are none in my backyard upon inspection the bluebird boxes that had drawn me to a new home proved to be old and roofless and long ago abandoned by any winged animal my only faint hope is that some time later this month or early next a bluebird looking to start a family will fly over my property glance down at the sturdy fresh boxes i have erected and decide to stop so many other birds already have on the coldest days of winter they have come to my feeders in numbers and a variety so profuse that i felt seasick swinging the binoculars around while trying to identify yet another visitor most abundant are the finches which cluster on mesh wire baskets of hulled sunflower seeds like bees on a honeycomb theyre messy eaters so the ground beneath them is always littered with scraps for throngs of mourning doves dark eyed juncos and white throated sparrows the last two winter migrants that will soon be gone more solitary it seems are the chickadees which dart to a feeder and are off in a flash and the tufted titmouse which has a permanent facial expression like the person in munchs "the scream " one of my favorites is the slightly spooky nuthatch which hops headfirst down trees and with its black and white face looks like a miniature penguin the woodpeckers are always striking including the downy woodpecker that gobbles suet the larger red bellied woodpecker in its even more brilliant red cap and perhaps the loveliest of all the big northern flicker with a specked breast bright yellow underwings and a red chevron on the back of its neck there are many lbjs aka little brown jobs that i still cant identify in the feeding frenzy of various hopping sparrows and their ilk but cardinals carolina wrens robins blue jays grackles starlings a mockingbird a coopers hawk a red shouldered hawk and even the occasional venue of strawberry faced turkey vultures perched high up in the walnut tree with their wings spread to catch the sun all have made a glorious appearance the country folk around here claim that a few years ago as one told me "a buzzard breeded with a real mean other kind of bird" and produced a hybrid man eater in one case i know of special care was taken to watch over the disabled son of a local landowner as he limped under a tree with a suspect turkey vulture in it according to my birding book however even when these birds circle above the ground they may only be at play and they are not raptors but are related to storks all this i have seen and learned while waiting for the bluebird if it never comes whos to say that i have not already had my reward in maurice maeterlincks novel "the blue bird " a fairy guides two children on a quest for a bird that is always just beyond their reach its the tale of a longing that finds its satisfaction only by accident after the pursuit ends good results are not guaranteed either an entry on the imdb com web site for the movie version of "the blue bird" informs us that it bombed at the box office effectively ending shirley temples career as a child star moreover the entry says the bird used in the film "flew away from a los angeles aviary soon after the movie was finished " even so i like to imagine that it found its way to a meadow maybe up near salinas and lived out its days there singing from a fence post bringing happiness to all who saw it see related letter "letters to the editor looking for bluebirds" wsj march see related letter
