no headline available is jonathan franzen my friend i didnt much like his most famous novel "the corrections " i think but cant be sure that i interviewed him years ago about a topic i dont recall i am certain weve never met and i have seen him in person only once from across a hotel ballroom accepting a national book award but there he was with a page in facebook and there in front of me was a button that if pressed would have asked him to be my friend having reached the ripe age of i didnt expect to confront the kind of delicate social dilemmas usually associated with emotional teenage girls who are my friends should i befriend people i dont know why does everyone have more friends than me i soon found myself asking new questions more appropriate to my incipient middle age what happened to your hair why havent i heard from you in years you have how many children "old farts have been swarming the place " magazine editor josh quittner wrote to me after accepting my invitation to be a facebook friend "facebook is the future comrade get used to it have you installed scrabulous yet " of which more later facebook is a leader in whats known as social networking or in simpler terms the creation of giant interlinked online communities its a phenomenon that always made me feel like a victorian whod wandered into the jazz age in my heart i knew it was consequential but it made my head hurt my first mistake was to email everyone in my address book asking them to be my friend my next mistake was to ask dozens of people including steve newhouse member of the conde nast magazine dynasty to take part in a movie quiz it was an accident i dont even like movie quizzes day one i took things slowly facebook allows users to constantly update their "status " a note about whats happening right this minute which is displayed on each persons profile page the changes are then broadcast to your network of friends my first updates were the epitome of worthy dullness matthew is at work am matthew is trying am matthew isnt entirely sure about all this but is willing to give it a whirl pm on joshs advice i installed scrabulous an online game virtually the same as scrabble that works within facebook that was the third mistake next update including typos matthew is playing scrabble and is pretty sure he should be doing something more profitable pm matthew is has stopped playing scrabble and now feels guilty pm matthew is not sure he should be spending so much time futzing with this pm the next day was saturday matthew is trying to not look at this over the weekend am matthew is has already broken his weekend promise pm for readers who arent among the million active facebook users a brief explanation facebook is essentially a huge online garden fence where your friends dally users maintain their own web page including information as varied as what books theyre reading what parties they plan to attend and what films they like the difference between social networks and the web writ large is that these pages are well networked every time someone makes a change all their friends are notified through a continuously updated news feed as i type my facebook news feed is telling me that walt mossberg the papers tech columnist is heading to fenway to watch the boston red sox jim spanfeller a forbes executive is unsure what time zone he is in and stefan geens the friend who made me do this in the first place has joined a facebook group dedicated to soderhavet a swedish digital design agency "it really works as a way of staying in touch passively with people " stefan emailed to me as part of his badgering campaign facebook also reminds you of friends birthdays facebook as its name suggests was originally designed to replicate the printed directory handed out to university freshmen only users with a college email account could join last year facebook made two important changes that sped it into the mainstream in august it started allowing outsiders to write mini programs that operate inside its walls ranging from the profound presidential election trackers to the trivial throw food at your friends to the productivity busting scrabulous the next month it decided to offer accounts to all comers the number of active users which facebook defines as those whove used the site within the past days soared from nine million in september to million today its hard to compare rival sites because each uses its own measurement research firm comscore says news corp s myspace the largest social networking site had million unique visitors in the u s in september while facebook had million as a result facebook with a stripped down aesthetic well attuned to grown up sensibilities is graying the company wont be precise about the average age of its users but it will say that the oldest age group it tracks users and older is also its fastest growing from my work computer in the journals washington bureau i started hunting for friends i quickly found dozens of journal staffers and started to feel clueless in addition to old i ran across elizabeth spiers the founding editor of gawker a popular gossip blog and wondered if she was my friend we would bump into each other at media gatherings when i lived in new york mumbling into our drinks and pretending to hear what the other was saying i clicked on the link asking her to be my friend she agreed we are "now" friends facebook reported apparently only in facebooks parallel universe could our relationship blossom into more than mere acquaintanceship we email through facebooks messaging system "the adults have invaded the playground and the kids dont like it one bit " she wrote midway through the afternoon my boss jerry seib wandered over to my desk to talk about something trivial like who might be the next u s attorney general i was futzing with my facebook page and readily admitted i was getting hooked he laughed i dont really think he thought it amusing not long after jon fine a businessweek columnist posted a note to my page "i am so telling rupert that youre playing scrabble during the workday " by which he means rupert murdoch chairman of news corp which is the parent company of myspace and which has agreed to buy dow jones owner of the wall street journal there are actually three fake ruperts on facebook the real mr murdoch does however presumably in a display of corporate cheerleading have his own myspace page jon knew what i was playing because as a "friend" but not much of a friend he was alerted to my activities through his own facebook news feed that night i went home and indulged my narcissism i needed a photo for my profile page and in a pinch at work i had dug up one from the bowels of my hard drive stefan who snapped it in the late s felt the need to post a comment that informed the world i no longer looked so fresh faced ensconced in my home office i took three photos using a camera embedded in my mac i looked tired the lines in my face ran deep that liverish splotch glowed i dumped them all and instead plucked a photo taken at a recent family wedding then using photoshop the great equalizer i steadily removed all signs of age and abuse after a day or so i had friends and was starting to receive friend requests from strangers other users have many thousands of friends because they are either popular or indiscriminate i started to worry about the facebook friends i did have what about the one in the skimpy bikini why does my younger brother look like a yob what would jonathan franzen think of all this in the end i didnt ask for his friendship i did however befriend martha stewart feeling some kind of kinship after having sat through every day of her trial at last count i am one of her facebook friends two days later i persuade my wife a columnist with the journals editorial page to sign up she it turns out is a proper adult and wanted nothing to do with such frivolity she instant messaged me as i edited a front page story prepared a spoof magazine for a colleagues farewell and played three simultaneous scrabulous games one of which i was losing badly kim am this is annoying i have like all these friend requests and notifications and detail requests me am its not annoying its exciting kim am and why is dexter saying im part of his family then i made my fourth mistake facebook allows you to "poke" other users originally a flirtation device a poke is only a message that tells the person youve poked them for incessant pokers theres "superpoke " an application that offers more creative ways to interact with your friends such as bite dropkick sucker punch and a host of things meant for young people that i dont fully understand such as b &# slap pwn and take sexy back from trying to respond to an incessantly poking colleague i pressed the wrong button and defenestrated myself defenestration is a poking option but presumably the programmers never intended it to be used as a reflexive verb since then facebook has become an integral part of daily life the status updates of my friends have emerged as a form of haiku stefan geens is lying in this sentence emma french is puzzling over steak marinade jessica mintz is at the scene of the crime appropriately it also became a forum for the most middle aged of events the birth of my second child i posted some pictures on facebook the journals tax columnist sent me a note commending our "timely and handy new deduction " lost in the kerfuffle was my birthday which fell just three days after my daughter was born id forgotten about it when i logged on to see if anyone had made a scrabble move it was facebook that reminded me
