the week ahead our take on coming events media succession clouds may start to clear at time warner by merissa marr like bottles of brunello di montalcino cellared at time warner inc chief richard parsonss italian vineyard investors in the media company have been kept in the dark of late mr parsons hasnt said exactly when he is giving up the chief executive title or signaled what direction the media company will take once he is gone the skies could start to clear this coming week though with the likely confirmation of what has become an open secret in the past two months that mr parsons will pass the ceo mantle to his no jeff bewkes at the start of according to people familiar with the situation mr parsonss contract ends in may and he is expected to continue as chairman until at least then those people say time warner announces third quarter earnings wednesday and the announcement is expected either then or shortly before wall streets hope is that mr bewkess appointment to the top slot will open the way for a new strategy aimed at kick starting time warners long stagnant share price that could include spinning off or selling some major assets shrinking a media conglomerate whose businesses include the second biggest cable television operator the web portal aol the warner bros film studio the time inc magazine unit and a raft of cable networks from hbo to tnt mr bewkes isnt expected to make a decision on whether to break up the company immediately the year old executive will take some time working out which assets belong in the time warner stable according to people familiar with the situation one of his first tasks will be streamlining what is widely seen as the companys bloated bureaucracy according to people familiar with the situation that could mean significant cost cutting at the company particularly at time warners corporate headquarters down the road one of the biggest question marks hangs over time warner cable and whether mr bewkes will completely spin off the business now owned or simply reduce the stake to less than mr bewkes also is under pressure to provide some clarity on aol and whether he will spin it off that pressure could increase on wednesday depending on aols third quarter performance he is likely to face questions about the future of the magazine unit too with titles including time fortune and people given its anemic growth in the past couple of years mr bewkes may wait a year or two to see if its performance improves before making any decision it is unclear whether mr bewkes will add the chairman title to his duties when mr parsons takes his leave mr parsons took on the dual role of ceo and chairman after ushering steve case out of the company in the wake of the flawed merger with aol corporate leaders are increasingly under pressure not to take on such dual roles still mr bewkess management style is expected to signal a radical shift in time warners corporate culture where mr parsons won over employees with a grandfatherly manner mr bewkess style is more no nonsense mr bewkes who started his time warner career at hbo more than years ago is widely expected to be tougher on the companys performance or lack thereof politics iran afghanistan top agenda of sarkozy merkel visits by john d mckinnon president bush seeks to strengthen ties with his new european chums next week as he welcomes french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel for special visits mr sarkozy comes to the white house tuesday evening where he will be treated to a social dinner and entertainment the french leader who has a fascination with the u s will have official meetings wednesday and then tour george washingtons estate mount vernon along with mr bush ms merkel travels to texas friday for a social dinner and overnight stay at mr bushs crawford ranch a rare invitation that has generally been reserved for the presidents closest allies the two visits contrast sharply with the chilly relations mr bush had with their predecessors jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder still the closer the u s and europe grow over long term policy goals the more complications emerge over how to reach them high on the agenda for both meetings will be iran both mr bush and his french and german counterparts would like the u n security council to impose a new round of economic sanctions to discourage irans nuclear weapon ambitions but the u s led campaign has stalled over resistance from russia and china that has encouraged the u s to impose new economic sanctions it is also feeding a growing debate about whether the european union should follow suit mr sarkozy appears eager to take the next step but ms merkel appears more wary in part because germany does more business with iran french officials "are pushing hard for additional formal eu sanctions but the germans and some other europeans are resisting " says gary samore of the council on foreign relations increasingly european banks and manufacturers are reducing their exposure to iran anyway experts say but the overall impact is likely to be limited as long as other companies can fill the void a second big topic will be afghanistan mr bush worries that the long term outlook there could be even more troubled when he leaves office than it will be for iraq that is largely because of afghanistans lack of natural resources as well as the strong base of operations that the taliban enjoys in western pakistan mr bush is likely to push for bigger troop commitments to afghanistan from the two european leaders further complicating the discussions over afghanistan is the possibility that france under mr sarkozy eventually will elect full membership in nato something france spurned for years as a symbol of its independence from the u s now "sarkozy seems to be readying the ground for fuller participation in the military structure " says stephen flanagan of the center for strategic and international studies but natos central role in afghanistan is an emblem of its increasingly far flung operations and increasing troop levels there could add to mr sarkozys domestic political problems in moving france into nato a third big topic is likely to be turkey a critical u s ally that is currently under pressure from breakaway kurds along the turkey iraq border turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan who is visiting the white house monday is likely to press for further u s help against the kurds hes also likely to seek u s aid in accelerating turkeys efforts to join the eu and overcoming resistance from france which favors delaying the turkish accession retailers october data may provide crystal ball on holiday sales by ann zimmerman when the nations retailers report
