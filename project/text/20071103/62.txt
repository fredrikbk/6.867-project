weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies when words fail sometimes a films greatness or awfulness is just inexplicable my editor is in new york and im in santa monica so we do our weekly editing by phone during a recent conversation about my review of steve carells "dan in real life " she said "lets go to where you refer to evan almighty as inexplicably awful do we really need inexplicably awful says it all " "lets leave it in " i replied "the awfulness really is inexplicable " if that sounds like a complaint its not everyone and everything needs editing i edit compulsively in my head movies i see stories i read reporters i hear on the radio i enjoy the editing process which comes after the hard work of writing is done editing is when you get to play with someone else in the sandbox of language yet we live in increasingly unedited times movies grow not only longer but more misshapen bloggers arent edited for worse as well as better kids resent being edited by teachers they think it cramps their creativity broadcast journalists are edited for time but seldom for clarity of content anchors babble and bloviate unable to edit themselves they cant ask simple questions the reigning champ in this arena is kyra phillips on cnn by the time she has reached the question mark at the end of one of her k rambles all hope of a spontaneous answer has been exhausted charlie roses interrogation techniques can be interminable too still he asked a simple question of steve carell the other night and got a simple answer q "what makes the office work " a "i have no idea " that is deep because movies or tv indeed finished products in any medium can be as inexplicably good as they are bad inexplicability implies mystery its also what makes the critics position problematic we can and should evoke explicate and speculate but never pretend to ourselves or anyone else that were able to explain in a deep sense the ups downs ins and outs of the creative process the awfulness of "evan almighty" was beyond explaining conversely the beauty of "lars and the real girl" cant fully be explained because the people who made it turned such a dubious premise a shy guy falling in love with a life size sex doll into such a lovely fable which was dismissed by at least one mainstream critic for being unrealistic distinctions must be made here some things in the movie business are readily explained given the right point of view i was reminded of this after the opening of "poseidon " a movie that was savaged by every critic worth his or her salt water the morning my review ran i got a call from an agent friend who is cultivated extraordinarily smart and superbly acerb "i read your poseidon piece " he said "it was funny but you missed the whole point " "which is " "when an enormous production like that gets a green light it creates instant millionaires all over town you reviewed a money trough as if it were a movie " different aspects of the same films may be susceptible or not to understanding its ultimately inexplicable that as great a film as "casablanca" should have been cooked up day by day as production bumped along or that frank capra and his cast found the depths they did in "its a wonderful life" without drowning in bathos but its clear that we love the former for its romantic coupling of bogart and bergman and that well soon be watching the latter yet again because the movie tells us with inexplicable eloquence that our lives matter and getting back to the subject of editing its explicable if probably irreversible that not great films the ordinary ones that keep theaters in business are more erratic than they were in the industrys golden age the culprits arent the film editors who may be more skillful than ever but the producers whose roles have been transformed most producers today are money men or women they find the funds package the packages provide the stars for that they get their names on the screen sometimes as many as a dozen producers for a single feature in the old days though producers performed an editorial function i e an adversarial one they may have driven their filmmakers crazy on occasion but they challenged them to sharpen their products these days stars and star directors get to call their own shots this gives them a sense of power that can be heady but dangerously self deceptive theres a lot to be said for sharing the sandbox morgensterns picks certain excellence some classic movies are first seen as anything but when "its a wonderful life" opened in bosley crowther of the new york times deplored not just its supposed sentimentality but "its illusory view of life " here are three films that were seen to be great from the start the lives of others after all the honors deservedly heaped on this intellectual thriller from germany including an oscar for best foreign film its safe to assume that those who care about fine films already know about it heres a reminder though that florian henckel von donnersmarcks debut feature has recently been released on dvd and that the digital version version preserves the peerless performance of ulrich muhe who died earlier this year he plays wiesler the trim taut faced agent of the east german secret police whose life is changed by his state sanctioned eavesdropping on other peoples lives close encounters of the third kind ive often mentioned steven spielbergs classic in passing the reason to talk about it now is a three disc th anniversary "ultimate edition" that hits the stores a week from tuesday the editions ultimateness remains to be seen but "close encounters" is certainly the ultimate so far in movie optimism about life beyond our solar system not only are the aliens good guys they seem to be better guys than some of the terrestrial life forms that turn out to greet them those forms incidentally include a french scientist played by one of the best directors in movie history the late francois truffaut ratatouille an eagerly awaited arrival in the digital ranks pixars latest triumph goes on sale tuesday several readers living in france have sent emails describing the response of french audiences enthusiastic bordering on rhapsodic to this animated tale of a rat who becomes a great parisian chef but you dont have to be french or a gastronome or even an adult though this is one superbly sophisticated comedy to salivate over seeing "ratatouille" on dvd and being able to repeat the best scenes among them the dispatching of a health inspector as if they were numbers in a musical comedy
