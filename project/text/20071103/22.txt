its not so bad to be part of the top while i wouldnt even attempt to argue the statistics quoted in alan reynoldss piece on the top "the truth about the top " editorial page oct i will simply assert that it doesnt pass the "gut test " to quote a line from one of my favorite movies "how many yachts can you water ski behind " whether you are talking ceos or third basemen no one likes to tackle the question of "how much is enough " i think this does us all a disservice so i will take on the great question if you make &# million in any one year in your life even &# million you are set for life that is you have enough to buy a decent house and pay for taxes utilities and groceries for the rest of your life should you choose to live like say of us do you even have enough left over for medical emergencies and the kids college if you are base enough to send them to a state school like the majority of us do and many of these executives and corner infielders make multiple millions for years in a row so whats the problem with paying the tax to keep the road smooth for your bentley when you stay at the trough too long you risk allowing the angry alienated masses to grow restive and sooner or later they may be spray painting graffiti on the stone wall surrounding your estate this must not be allowed to happen of course if your tastes are so exquisite that you need a &# umbrella stand then my argument makes no sense whatsoever what does make sense is that the quality of life for the lower is improved when the very wealthy spend well and keep our economy humming as opposed to investing all the tax savings in a ponzi scheme google at &# i sure hate sounding like a mad socialist but when youre talking about the top sorry they have more than enough p s im working hard and doing all i can to join the other side of this discussion tom marchetta morganville n j mr reynolds uses the term "individual" income several times when explaining the top of income earners and therein lies his problem if only the irs taxed me and my working wife based on our "individual" income we would save several thousands of dollars per year the problem of course is that both taxes and the statistics are based on "household" income which is really a euphemism for "marriage" income if the statistics were based purely on "individual" income im sure the wage disparity would not be that much worse today as when ward and june cleaver were raising the beaver whats happened is that women entered the workforce and in the past few decades educated women have had their incomes match or even exceed that of men educated and upper income people have a tendency to marry one another and because lower income people are less likely to be married than upper income individuals the statistics are skewed even more to have an honest discussion on this subject you first have to start out with honest statistics steve walde easton conn
