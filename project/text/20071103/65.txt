weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink less sugar more sting novelist and wine enthusiast jay mcinerney doesnt think much of mixed drinks indeed his love of the grape was at first a reaction to the cocktail quaffing habits of his bourgeois folks "that wine had no place on my parents suburban dining table " mr mcinerney wrote last year "seemed to confirm the assessment that its consumption was a mark of sophistication " his parents didnt know from wine they drank cocktails "when they drank enough of them they behaved badly especially when they were in their stingers period " mr mcinerney might not have minded the bad behavior quite so much had he been able to think of their excess as "romantic and chic " but alas cocktails of brandy and creme de menthe didnt signify the sort of sophistication to which he aspired he was reinforced in his "sense of wine as an appurtenance of the well lived life" upon reading evelyn waughs "brideshead revisited " but had mr mcinerney had the chance to join waugh for a drink chances are the english satirist would have ordered a round of stingers in the s when waugh was struggling with aches and insomnia doctors prescribed "sleeping drugs including bromide and chloral ingredients when mixed with alcohol of the famous mickey finn " according to waugh biographer douglas lane patey "the drugs were meant to be diluted in water but waugh splashed them together careless of dosage in creme de menthe " the result was a harrowing bout of paranoid psychosis which waugh recounted in his autobiographical novel "the ordeal of gilbert pinfold " when pinfold waugh isnt downing minty mickey finns hes in a bar ordering brandy with his creme de menthe waughs dubious endorsement of the cocktail notwithstanding mr mcinerney is right that the stinger has acquired a downmarket reputation status taxonomist paul fussell in his delightfully nasty little book "class " derides the stinger as one of those sweet drinks favored by "prole america " yet its origin couldnt be more aristocratic reginald "reggie" vanderbilt was the quintessential playboy of the gilded age known for squandering &# in an evenings gambling there was hardly a socialist manifesto of the aught years that didnt hold up young vanderbilt as exhibit a in its indictment of capitalism his lifestyle "impresses even on the dullest of mind the gross stupidity of a system which compels the many to work and suffer that the few may be dissipated ruining themselves while they deprive others " wrote j c cooper in "the handwriting on the wall or revolution in " reggie did much of his ruination with the stinger "the ritual of the cocktail hour say societys veterans was observed in all its pomp and glory in the bar of reggies home and he himself was the high priest the host the mixer " wrote the lima ohio news in a article referring to his bachelor days two decades before according to the newspaper "the stinger was his own invention a short drink with a long reach a subtle blending of ardent nectars a boon to friendship a dispeller of care " vanderbilt spread his stinger gospel to fashionable new york boites such as the cafe des beaux arts by the midteens the stinger was a high society essential one of the first books by don marquis later famous for his comic tales of the poetic cockroach archy and soulful kitty mehitabel was a sendup of debutantes of the day "hermione and her little group of serious thinkers " one issue hermione and her little group takes up is the liquor problem deciding no longer to drink "if any of the working classes happen to be about where they can see us and become corrupted by our example " but with hoi polloi out of sight "a cocktail or two and an occasional stinger is something no one can well avoid taking " the last association of stingers with high society came in the movie musical of that name bing crosby gives grace kelly a stinger to take the sting out of a champagne induced hangover but the overwhelming minty sweetness of the stinger plagued its reputation in the latter half of the century when not derided as somehow louche the cocktail was pegged as a "girlie drink " this taint persists even though during world war ii the stinger was a favorite of navy pilots portraying one such flyboy in "kiss them for me " cary grant downs a succession of them i have to agree that the standard stinger formula one or two parts brandy to one part creme de menthe is hopelessly sugary perhaps the problem is the brandy at the cafe des beaux arts nearly a century ago the cocktail was made with the bitter orange liqueur amer picon which balances the sweetness of creme de menthe most efforts to dry out the stinger however have focused on reducing the proportion of mint liqueur in his book "the fine art of mixing drinks " david embury calls for eight parts brandy to one part creme de menthe and one part fresh lime juice too but the most successful strategy for making the stinger taste as aristocratic as its pedigree is found in a drink named the cold deck its description in the "playboys host &amp bar book" as "a sophisticated stinger" is spot on dry vermouth is added to the stinger to produce an elegant drink with just the right whisper of mint and no cloying sweetness save the stinger for after dinner but try the cold deck as a bracing aperitif and please dont drink either with bromide or
