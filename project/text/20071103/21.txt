hot topic a sinkable treaty the senate foreign relations committee voted wednesday to approve the law of the sea treaty meaning its now up to senate republicans to send this giant octopus of a document back where it belongs to wit the bottom of the ocean the u s last disposed of the united nations convention on the law of the sea lost to its critics when ronald reagan was president this may however the bush administration reversed course and declared that the gippers objections had been fixed by a amendment weve since had a debate on these pages over that point with former secretaries of state george shultz and james baker in favor while ed meese and william clark reagans attorney general and national security adviser remain opposed the best arguments for the treaty come from the u s navy which likes how it creates a legal framework for navigational rights the oil and gas industry approves of provisions that create an "exclusive economic zone" for the u s out to miles theres also the potential for development with clear legal title of resources in the deep seabed which would be managed by the international seabed authority on which the u s would be guaranteed a seat and in fact the amendment did get rid of some of losts most obnoxious provisions such as mandatory technology transfers and other redistributionist nostrums then again the navy has been getting along fine by using the "customary law" that has guaranteed freedom of the seas for three centuries treaty proponents have taken to arguing that unless we ratify russia will lay claim to oil rights over the arctic seabed but russias expansive arctic claims possibly including the sea floor under the north pole are themselves a product of the treaty we also hear that the u s must have its proverbial "seat at the table" in negotiations over such claims but the nations with a direct geographic arctic claim ought to be able to cut a deal without giving cuba or zimbabwe a seat americas historic experience with similar multinational bodies e g the u n human rights commission hardly justifies confidence that having a seat will enhance our influence rather than constrain it the larger problem is the treatys sheer size with no fewer than articles and nine annexes these cover everything from "criminal jurisdiction on board a foreign ship" article to "anadromous stocks" and "catadromous species" articles and to the "jurisdiction of the seabed disputes chamber" article much of this is anodyne but perhaps the senators should read the fine print before voting they might be surprised by what they find consider the treatys potential effects on military activities the administration says these are excluded from the treaty and further that the u s gets to decide what constitutes such activity but then how to explain article which states that "in the territorial sea submarines and other underwater vehicles are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag " how will this affect the ability of u s submarines to gather intelligence in coastal waters or deploy special forces on hostile shores last we checked a &# billion submarine called the uss jimmy carter had been built precisely for that purpose the navy might also ask how its powerful sonars which some environmentalists say harm marine life could run afoul of article this states that countries "shall take all measures necessary to prevent reduce and control pollution of the marine environment resulting from the use of technologies under their jurisdiction or control " or take concerns that the treatys requirements on pollution are a back door mechanism for forcing u s compliance with the kyoto treaty and other global environmental pacts confronted with the argument an administration spokesman told the senate that the treaty did not exercise jurisdiction over land based pollution replied republican senator david vitter "if it is not covered by the treaty why is there a section entitled pollution from land based sources " a good question considering that article notes that countries "shall adopt laws and regulations and take other measures necessary to implement applicable international rules and standards established through competent international organizations" to control such pollution note our emphasis critics are also right to be concerned about the powers of direct taxation the treaty confers on the international seabed authority the details of this innovation are buried in article of the treatys third annex and contain a mix of "production charges" and annual million dollar "administrative" fees such measures are all but unprecedented for an international organization and have a potential for corruption especially when the taxes can run as high as of net proceeds some countries have joined the law of the sea treaty with the u s one of the few holdouts critics are being labeled isolationists or worse but the u s has been abiding voluntarily with the terms of the treaty since with no ill effect twenty some years ago a former president objected to handing sovereignty over two thirds of the earths surface to another unaccountable international body ronald reagan sank the treaty then now its up to senators to show similar courage
