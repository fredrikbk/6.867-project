could wear as a mini dress with tights rather than over pants as an older woman might rather than grouping clothes by collection that is outfits designed to go together bloomingdales decided to merchandise all the tops together to stack the jeans on shelves and to hang jackets from various manufacturers together when i recently visited quotation departments at bloomingdales in white plains and at the chains manhattan flagship i was puzzled at first despite the years ive spent covering the fashion industry beat at the wall street journal i had trouble figuring out what went with what there were racks of catchy print tops in purple animal prints stacks of folded jeans a gray sweater top what finally convinced me to try on a blue print nylon mesh baby doll top a teen trend i had already rejected was a knowledgeable sales woman who acted more like a personal shopper than a cashier i was thrilled the top showed that i had a waistline and i thought it looked good with tight flare leg jeans and a short leather top that the saleswoman also pulled from the rack at nordstrom a top seller is "tummy tuck" jeans by not your daughters jeans a &# million a year label founded in nordstrom carries the jeans in its so called narrative departments where it groups midtier brands such as jones new york tommy bahama and donna ricco that appeal to shoppers ranging in age from their
