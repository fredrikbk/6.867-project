holocaust denial and tehran dictatorships bear paradoxes i came across a set of them years ago when i hosted a dinner for two female iranian medical students whod come to yale medical school on a rare academic exchange program these impressive women had climbed to the top th percentile in a mans profession in a mans country but i was stunned to learn that despite years of education at some of irans premiere schools neither had ever heard of the word "holocaust " or thought of hitler as anything but the german equivalent of napoleon tehrans holocaust denial did not begin with president mahmoud ahmadinejad it began in with the islamic revolution and the subsequent miseducation of the entire post revolutionary generation the holocaust did not exist in the textbooks of my two young guests and there was hardly any literature about it in persian now millions of iranian youths are hearing about the holocaust for the first time through the airing of a government sponsored soap opera called "zero degree turn " in it the islamic republics handpicked director hassan fatthi breaks the regimes taboos beautiful women appear without the islamic dress code men and women also come together hold hands and even fall into a fleeting embrace in the end however the program offers little more than an aesthetically pleasing venue for the regimes usual diatribes its linchpin is a conspiracy theory two israeli agents assassinate the chief rabbi of tehran to frighten the iranian jewish community into leaving iran for israel the noble chief of the iranian embassy in france abdol hossein sardari who facilitated the escape of hundreds of iranian and french jews by providing them with iranian passports is portrayed as a mere opportunist motivated by bribes the good news is that iran is now home to a highly rebellious young generation that is deeply disenchanted with the status quo and suspicious of government propaganda in all its forms including misinformation about jews and israel iranians actually possess a healthy curiosity toward israel in the war between israel and lebanons hezbollah for example young iranians were reportedly not interested in supporting hezbollah and were vehemently against their governments investment in it unfortunately mr ahmadinejad steals the spotlight with his threats toward israel and his dreams of a nuclear iran he has engendered a fear however legitimate that too often blinds western and israeli leaders of the broader more complex realities of the iranian people american european and israeli media are full of dire warnings about the threat of a nuclear iran there is little mention of the plight of the iranians themselves or the ripe opportunity presented by a nation disenchanted with years of theocratic rule a people that has historically been friendly to jews can with some effort be so once again mr ahmadinejad along with his coterie of fundamentalist radicals is already a threat to israel and the region but they do not represent everyday iranians and as much as the regime in tehran would like to deny it a more accepting rational view of israel was once held by iranian leaders in the early s several leading iranian intellectuals traveled to israel on the invitation of the israeli foreign ministry and for the most part the travelogues of their trips amounted to what may be the longest love letter to israel ever to be penned in persian that sentiment of course would change dramatically but for several years at least it seemed that it would determine the attitude of an entire generation toward israel irans holocaust education could begin in iran itself through the port of pahlavi in tens of thousands of polish refugees jewish and non jewish escaped the nazis found a safe haven in iran eventually the majority of them relocated to other parts of the world yet hundreds fell in love with "persia" and stayed iranians could learn of their shared history with the jewish people by visiting the hundreds of polish graves in tehrans doulab cemetery alone despite the regimes anti semitic rhetoric the people have held fast to the values of their ancient civilization they pride themselves on the idea that they have accepted members of other religions and ethnicities as equals and as iranians ms hakakian is the author of "journey from the land of no a girlhood caught in revolutionary iran" three rivers press a memoir of growing up jewish in iran see related letter "letters to the editor victims of a forgotten soviet holocaust" wsj nov
