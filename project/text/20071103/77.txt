weekend journal travel cruises how i learned to stop worrying and love the boat on a caribbean cruise a skeptic gets his sea legs a decent meal on deck labadee haiti with its colorful revolutionary history and its brutal dictatorships haiti has always fascinated me now at long last im standing on haitian soil for an eight hour stopover during my weeklong caribbean cruise i left the ship intending to hire a taxi to drive me to nearby cap haitien haitis second city but ive run into a wall or more precisely a foot high chainlink fence royal caribbean international leases this little beach rimmed peninsula called labadee from the haitian government it wont let any of its cruise passengers venture beyond the fence when i went to the fence to talk with some haitians standing on the other side a guard insisted on standing next to me through the whole conversation royal caribbean says the itinerary does not include an excursion into haiti only to a private beach destination many people reply "over my dead body" when their wife husband or children start nagging them about taking a cruise such nagging is apparently reaching ear splitting proportions as cruises soar in popularity my ship the month old freedom of the seas has been near its capacity of plus for every cruise the past few weeks says royal caribbean even though these weeks have coincided with both the hurricane season and the school year my cruise left from miami stopping in haiti jamaica grand cayman and mexico on paper at least the appeal of a cruise ship is undeniable for roughly the &# a day it would cost for one of the least expensive hotels in manhattan two people can get not only lodging but six meals a day and all manner of entertainment but to me the reality of a cruise is quite different im turned off by the emphasis on casinos liquor vapid entertainment and the formal dinners where bathing suits in the hallways are suddenly replaced by tuxedos literally all dressed up with nowhere to go can a curmudgeon like me survive a week cruising the caribbean the short answer is yes by making some effort it turned out the real fun came outside the ship mostly because i took shore excursions that were more rewarding than shopping for t shirts on the main street of a tourist trap town thanks to some advance planning on my part these four days of liberation combined with some unexpected amenities on board ended up saving the day surprisingly being with people including a wide variety of foreigners and a surprising number of children skipping school also helped when a cruise line has that many people i discovered they have an incentive to provide little niches accommodations for people who dont want to see las vegas type shows and spend their evenings drinking cocktails that have fancy names one such accommodation was a running track almost as long as a standard quarter mile track at a stadium a second involved food on both the qe and freedom of the seas a lot of what i was served in the dining rooms could only be described as "slop" not surprising considering that the cooks have to turn out thousands of meals almost simultaneously the first night on freedom of the seas as an example i ordered the chefs featured entree of broiled cod on a bed of mashed potatoes the cod was so overcooked and so tasteless it was impossible to determine where the layer of cod ended and the layer of mashed potatoes began frank weber vice president for food and beverage operations of royal caribbean says that "compared to an a la carte restaurant experience its still a mass volume operation and there are limitations " as for my fish he says its " a very delicate and difficult item for us " then i discovered a godsend of a niche called jade a cafeteria eight decks up with only a couple dozen tables it specialized in asian food and had a real live chef who was chinese standing there doing simple but tasty stir fries such as scallops with mixed vegetables that plus a bottle of fiery hot pepper sauce i picked up during our second stopover in jamaica kept me eating happily another was quite simple the provision of some deck chairs with overhead lights bright enough for after dinner reading what a pleasure to have a deck entirely to myself and be able to listen to the sounds of the ocean as i read but most of the fun was still on shore after the misfire in haiti the second days excursion in jamaica was a bonanza before setting sail i had done some internet research and hired a car and driver through tour agency yardie tours when i got off the ship at ocho rios a representative of the agency was waiting for me on the dock the driver a gregarious jamaican named christopher embodied the tour agencys slogan "in jamaica we would say no problem mon " we began by driving high up into the mountains to see the birthplace of bob marley the patron saint of reggae music i had told christopher that i wanted to meet ordinary jamaicans and he warned me that many of them would start a conversation by offering to sell marijuana thats exactly what happened as soon as we entered the marley compound a man with long dreadlocks a wicked grin and a marijuana cigarette in his hand stuck his head through an opening in the wall and offered to sell me the joint for &# when i shook my head no the price quickly went to &# when that brought no response he offered a guided tour of his marijuana plantation this was hardly an encounter that could have taken place with a tour bus nor was our next stop when i visited a rural school and had a long talk with the principal about jamaicas education system lunch was another highlight instead of dining with a tour bus of finicky eaters i got to experience for the first time real jerk chicken i dined at an open air restaurant called scotchies jerk centre above ocho rios where the ship docked the secret i learned is using a hot jamaican chili called scotch pepper in the marinade and putting the branches of two special trees over the coals to impart a wonderful smoky flavor while the chicken slowly cooks and smokes its covered with a sheet of corrugated iron back on board i found some events designed for cruise skeptics like me one night there was a classical music concert attended by an audience of incongruously held on one side of a noisy bar three women from kiev two on the violin and one on piano proved quite talented and though my windowless room made me claustrophobic at times the ships vast and airy atrium with a promenade lined with shops worked wonders in making the ship more tolerable psychologically cruise ships can make a lot of additional money by encouraging guests to take organized excursions rather than independent tours there might be incentive for travelers to choose a ship sanctioned trip before the cruise i called the royal caribbean excursion desk and asked if i could book tours independently the representative said yes but she warned me that one of the drawbacks of taking these trips is that the ship might leave without independent day trippers who are running late for cozumel mexico alone the ship offered more than choices ranging from a harley davidson tour of the island &# to a speedboat trip &# to a tequila tasting seminar &# the first day when i got in line to inquire about excursions the woman in front of me spent &# for herself and her elderly mother in minutes i thought i could do better by booking on my own when we docked in george town in grand cayman part of the cayman islands i signed up for a three hour &# snorkeling expedition with one of the free lance tour agents on the dock trying to lure passengers my boat took us to a sandbar a half hour ride away from town to swim with the stingrays but we were hardly alone two cruise ships were in town and a couple hundred people stood on that sandbar with masks on their faces and snorkels in their mouths poking their heads into the water to see stingrays pass by the big flat stingrays were cooperative enough to allow themselves to be hoisted halfway out of the water for photos then we went further to a reef to snorkel where there was room to swim without bumping into someone the reef was sparse and had only relatively few colorful tropical fish not up to what i had heard about this island on my last stop at the mexican island of cozumel i wanted to take a ferry to the mainland and then a bus to the mayan ruins of tulum because i didnt coordinate anything on my own beforehand i opted for the ship sponsored tour it didnt matter that the tour guide made us shout enthusiastically that we were having a good time it didnt matter that lunch was plain tuna fish we had to squeeze out of a foil pouch tulum whose ancient maya ruins stand alongside a brilliant blue sea was great the guide turned out to be so knowledgeable that after his half hour lecture i asked him for a tour of the sculptures and frescoes at the ruins and he happily obliged no one else on the bus was interested in tagging along then came a wonderful hour of snorkeling at a series of inlets and lagoons made into a private water park called xel ha a short drive from tulum the profusion of bright colored fish coming in from the ocean to swim along the rocks was what i had expected at grand cayman similar experiences might have been part of my day in haiti also had i been allowed to leave the beach when i spoke to haitians through that fence a young man named henry who said he had no formal education but had taught himself to speak excellent english told me that he and his friends came down frequently from cap haitien to watch cruise ships pull into port "there are no jobs so there is nothing else for me to do " he said i resolved to return to haiti someday to see what the country is really like and as part of the trip id like to drive from cap haitien to the cruise ship beach experiencing it from the other side of the fence when the security guards see a white man on the wrong side of the fence i predict there will be pandemonium trip planner my experience booking a cruise with the online tour agency cruise com left me with the conclusion that cruise prices can make airfares look almost rational by comparison i initially received a "confirmation booking" for an ocean view cabin on freedom of the seas at the price of &# a couple of days later on a friday i accepted by email and asked how to pay on monday i received an email back saying that the special offer had been withdrawn by royal caribbean international and i was now being offered an interior cabin for &# i immediately called cruise com and another agent said he would reinstate that &# fare i accepted and gave him my credit card number that night he emailed me saying that he couldnt do it that he had contacted royal caribbean and the fare was now &# for an inside cabin which is what i ended up paying my initial confirmation did note that "pricing and availability are subject to change until payment is received " royal caribbean says it cant comment on the special i found but it says all specials have expiration dates and need to be booked before they expire anthony hamawy managing director of cruise com says "its not uncommon for a cruise line to change its price by the hour " stan sesser
