weekend journal sports golf journal deconstructing doffing its hats off lately when shaking hands on the th but why like a lot of baby boomers when i started taking golf seriously as an adult i was more than a little skeptical about the social side of the game from the outside its stilted manners and complicated protocols seemed downright silly i still wish golf were more sincerely welcoming to all especially to women but when it comes to etiquette and tradition ive come around far from diminishing my enjoyment of the game most of those odd little customs once youre familiar with them serve to streamline the action and reinforce the respect that committed players have both for the game and one another in other words ive become an old fogy myself which i mention only because i am trying to understand why my reaction to the latest wrinkle in golf etiquette players taking off their caps after a round before shaking hands has been so muted if you play golf youve probably noticed this little ritual gradually sneaking into the game starting roughly four or five years ago it isnt yet universal i talked to one plus year member at the philadelphia country club who said it still isnt done in his crowd but everyone else i phoned this week seeking counsel agreed that hat doffing on the th green was indeed now a common occurrence and appeared to be growing in popularity the probable explanation for how this new custom began is not surprisingly television in the olden days pros like arnold palmer jack nicklaus and johnny miller didnt routinely wear caps mostly they did so only when it was cold or raining so hat doffing was uncommon nowadays however virtually every pro on tour wears a cap primarily because their sponsors pay them to and the television audience for golf is far larger than ever before henry hughes the pga tours longtime chief of operations pegs the increase in ritualized hat doffing on the th green to or that was when the "new breed" of business savvy young pros including tiger woods began to recognize such moments as the branding opportunities they are and consequently transmitted the hat doffing bug into the public bloodstream the th green rituals on the lpga tour incidentally are much different in large part thats because the relationship between hat and hair for women is more complex which makes simple doffing more difficult according to ty votaw now an executive vice president at the pga tour but formerly the lpga commissioner and still the husband of lpga star sophie gustafson the protocols work like this players who know and like each other hug players who know each other but arent especially fond "air hug " and players who didnt know each other before the round shake hands male caddies and players cheek kiss the positive side of hat doffing is that it ends the round with a grace note of elegance and mutual respect whatever tensions or disputes might have arisen during play cannot survive a proper hat doffing and a solemn look you in the eye handshake marcia wharton a speaker and consultant on matters of etiquette to businesses notes that the practice has a european flavor and shows "the highest level of respect for the other players " she thinks its wonderful on the other side of the ledger however the custom can be a bit clunky youre standing there already with your ball and putter in hand plus a second stick if youre the one tending the flag and now have to add your hat to the collection it requires a bit of juggling in addition theres usually a group waiting back in the fairway to hit up to the green and the last thing golf needs is one more agenda item to slow things down none of these are insuperable obstacles i acknowledge im just saying the other minor issue i have with the practice and clearly this is a matter of taste is that it can seem a bit showy i understand the impulse no doubt it stems from the customs of tipping ones hat on the street and removing ones hat indoors especially at private clubs and perhaps even from the chivalric tradition of a gentleman making his bow to mlady with his big feathered hat in hand but gentlemen dont customarily wear hats anymore and when they do its most often golf like hats worn backward so the doffing of same in my view doesnt always come across as entirely natural it can be done well see tiger woods especially if everyone is on the same page and expects it to happen but doffing can also put people on the spot if youre not prepared to doff when others do its pretty obvious and if for whatever reason you alone fail to doff you cant help but feel like a rube ive been in situations where hat doffing on the final green felt like etiquette one upsmanship which briefly caused some of my earlier suspicions about the game to resurface most of the long accepted standards of golf etiquette serve practical purposes all that business about who has the honors on the tee or who putts first on the green may seem fussy to newcomers but it eliminates untold minutes of you first no you first nonsense the rationales for standing behind the ball when someone else is hitting for not chatting while someone else is swinging and for fixing divots are obvious despite my antidoffing inclinations i do believe that most standards of golf etiquette such as the custom at most private clubs of requiring collared shirts are really just traditions without practical impact on the playing of the game but they are so long established and widely accepted that virtually everyone feels comfortable in honoring them in the end it seems to me thats the main purpose of etiquette to make everyone feel comfortable and relaxed and as freed up as possible to enjoy the game it will be interesting to see whether with time hat doffing achieves
