weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations hillary reveals her inner self the story isnt that the democrats finally took on hillary clinton nor is it that they were gentlemanly to the point of gingerly and tentative there was an air of "please somebody kill her for me so i can jump in and show high minded compassion at her plight " barack obama with his elegance and verbal fluency really did seem like that great and famous political figure from his home state of illinois adlai stevenson who was not at all hungry not at all mean and operated at a step removed from the grubby game mr obama is like someone who would write in his diaries "i shall point out estes kefauvers manifold inconsistencies then to luncheon with arthur and marietta " the odd thing is its easier to be a killer when you know exactly what you stand for when you have a real philosophy the philosophy becomes a platform from which you can strike without ambivalence mr obama seems born to be mild but still thats not the story nor is it that john edwards seems like a furry animal on a wheel trying so hard to the point hes getting a facial tic and getting nowhere failing to get his little furry paws on his prey not knowing you have to get off the wheel to get to the prey you have to stop the rounded rote bromidic phrases and use a normal language that cannot be ignored the story is not that mrs clinton signaled in attitude and demeanor who she believes is her most dangerous foe the great impediment between her and an easy glide to the nomination yes that would be tim russert the story is that she talked about policy not talking points but policy in talking about it she seemed for the first time to be revealing whats inside it was startling its in there the year before her fall and rise i spent a day going over the transcripts so i could quote at length but her exchanges are all over its a real google fest here boiled down is what she said giving illegal immigrants drivers licenses makes sense because it makes sense but she may not be for it but undocumented workers should come out of the shadows and it makes sense maybe she will increase the payroll tax on social security beyond its current &# limit to &# maybe not everybody knows what the possibilities are she may or may not back a federal surcharge on singles making &# a year and couples making &# she suggested she backed it said she didnt back it she then called it a good start or rather "i support and admire" the person proposing such a tax for his "willingness to take this on " she has been accused of doubletalk and she has denied it and she is right it was triple talk quadruple talk olympic level nonresponsiveness and it was even for her rather heavy and smug her husband would have had the sense to look embarrassed as he bobbed and weaved it was part of his charm but he was light on his feet she turns every dance into the polka and it is that amazing thing a grim polka but the larger point is that her policy approach revealed all the impulses not of the new centrism but the old leftism her statements were redolent of the s phrase "command and control " they reflect a bias toward the old tax raising on people who arent rich who arent protected the old "my friends and i know best and well fill you dullards in on the details later " for a few years now ive thought the problem for the democrats in general but for mrs clinton in particular is not that america is against tax increases theyve seen eight years of big spending of wars of spiraling entitlements theyve driven by the mansions of the megarich and have no sympathy for hedge fund movie producer cosmetics empire heirs they sense the system is rigged toward the heavily protected they sense this because theyre not stupid the problem for mrs clinton is not that people sense she will raise taxes its that they dont think shell raise them on the real and truly rich the rich are her friends they contribute to her dine with her have access to her they have an army of accountants theyre protected even from her but she can stick it to others and in the way of modern liberalism for roughly half a century now one suspects shell define affluence down that she would hike taxes on people who make &# a year but those "rich" people who make &# and have two kids and a mortgage and pay local and state taxes in say new jersey they dont see themselves as rich because theyre not theyre already carrying too much of the freight what mrs clinton revealed the other night was more than an unfortunate persona what i think she revealed was that her baseline thinking has perhaps not changed that much since the s when she was a headband wearing power suited leftist who hadnt been wounded yet it seemed to me she made it quite possible to assume you know who shell be making war on and this much more than the latest scandal the chinatown funny money and the bundling could and i think would engender real opposition down the road the big chink in her armor is not stylistic it is about policy it is about the great baseline question in all political life whose ox is being gored a quick word here on why the scandals i refer to above do not deter mrs clintons rise there are people whove made quite a study of her life and times and buy every book from the awful ones such as ed kleins to the excellent ones such as sally bedell smiths recent "for love of politics " a carefully researched data rich compendium on the clintons time in the white house people whove studied mrs clinton often ask why her ethical corner cutting and scandals have not caught up with her why the whole history of financial and fund raising scandals doesnt slow her rise in a funny way shes protected by her reputation its so well known its not news it doesnt make an impression anymore people have pointed out her ethical lapses for so long that they seem boring or impossible to believe "that couldnt be true or she wouldnt be running for president " this thought collides with "and we already know all this anyway " her campaign uses the latter to squash the latest "old news " "cash for rehash " ive never seen anything quite like this dynamic work in modern politics but the other night for the first time i had the feeling maybe it isnt going to work anymore or with such deadening consistency
