four decades of conservative journalism forty years ago this autumn riled up by the impudence of the eras left wing student protesters and by the idiotic profusion of their complaints i started an off campus magazine at indiana university to protest the protesters neither they nor my magazine has disappeared and we remain at each others throats yet to my satisfaction the american spectators beliefs remain unchanged as for the s protesters they have had to cool their rancors to remain on the national scene and sidle toward "centrism" a centrism shaped more by my libertarian and conservative mentors than by their saul alinskys and herbert marcuses equally to my satisfaction the inchoate conservative journalism of years ago has grown in mass and in variety we are in print broadcast and in media unimaginable in talk radio and the internet "we are now more respectable " robert novak observed when interviewed for this piece "less pariahs " rush limbaugh went further "we have destroyed the liberals media monopoly " he told me back in liberals did indeed monopolize journalism which was the way they thought things were meant to be yet events and personalities are borne on the currents of history and those currents were picking up velocity in the late s when i began the american spectator in a farmhouse on the indiana countryside about the only conservative journalists of national stature were columnists such as james jackson kilpatrick and john chamberlain they were generally polemicists though they often had a newspapermans background one however was more sophisticated william f buckley jr he was urbane witty and erudite what is more he had a magazine that he had founded national review for me and for the other anti radical students then founding off campus magazines mr buckley was the prototype his magazine was iconoclastic and combative toward the fatuous liberal left it published a gallimaufry of newspaper journalists for instance m stanton evans worldly academics for instance prof hugh kenner and intellectuals such as frank meyer mr buckleys presence discomfited the liberal journalistic establishment and for them conditions were about to worsen other varieties of journalists were joining the growing community of conservative writers breaking away from the liberal establishment were the likes of irving kristol he and his cohorts were the first and only genuine "neoconservatives " that is to say they were fallen away liberals with resumes that featured some sort of left wing radicalism usually trotskyism in their youth and stints at time life or in new york publishing these neoconservatives brought something new to conservative journalism to wit social science classical philosophy and an aptitude for writing elegant high brow essays on a range of otherwise boring topics such as income distribution or fertility rates though but a pup i welcomed them into the american spectator where it was a little easier for them to operate than in the pages of nr whose writers had been deprecating them for years eventually most conservatives accepted mr kristol and his friends who soon accepted us after all liberalism was becoming ever angrier and given to fantasies it was not a fit environment for the neoconservatives cool reason more reinforcements were on the way by the early s i became increasingly aware that the conservatism of the wall street journals editorial page was taking on an edge its editor robert l bartley had also become friendly with the neoconservatives particularly mr kristol their social science analysis of public policy and their straussian appreciation of classical philosophy were challenging liberal pieties on bartleys pages he and mr kristol had become interested in what was being called supply side economics and the supply side critique of the liberals"mixed economy" offered a dynamic alternative to old fashioned conservative budget cutters in the journals editorials bartley developed one of the few journalistic innovations of the late th century a combination of traditional editorial sermonizing with something new analysis and reportage all in one editorial general reporting was also adding to conservative journalisms weaponry through the example set by the syndicated column of evans &amp novak in the s though both rowland evans and robert novak had been pretty conventional liberals the evolving wrong headedness of liberalism was turning them into conservatives moreover mr novak was becoming a supply sider to my surprise he became as great an influence on the young conservatives of the s as mr buckley had been on the young conservatives of the s he and his friends fred barnes and brit hume urged young conservative journalists to go easy on the polemicizing and to stress reporting as a consequence political reporting spread throughout the community of conservative journalists as did investigative reporting i took the hint and by the late s and early s the american spectator was relying on ever more investigative reporting while continuing to publish traditional polemicists and all purpose intellectuals some of that reporting delivered stories that inspired such now familiar terms as "troopergate" and "travelgate " as well as a term that apparently will live in liberal infamy "the arkansas project " the arkansas project was a wisecrack of mine relating to a series of stories that the magazine published about the clinton administrations misdeeds some minor and amusing some more serious but still amusing to this day the facts of those stories have yet to be disproved infamous though they have become still the currents of history have continued to change journalism and conservative journalism with it talk radio represents a revival of the traditional conservative polemicist the master of the art is rush limbaugh his daily commentary on the news has revived the conservative journalism that i knew in the late s it is polemical and satirical and vastly amusing and boy does it stir up the liberals so much so that they now question the value of the first amendment on capitol hill there are intimations that the time has come to disinter the ancient and anachronistic fairness doctrine thus allowing the federal government to influence the content of talk radio my guess is the effort will fail in part because of the latest innovation in communications the internet web sites and the blogs allow a multiplicity of outlets for free speech demonstrating that there is no need for the fairness doctrine which if ever reintroduced would be inherently unfair and repressive "it is profound what has happened " rush asseverated when i asked for his reflections on the past four decades "you and bartley and buckley established the foundation " well rush there were a few others but thanks "we came in the late s " he went on "we were happy upbeat optimistic about the country and the future " the left wing liberals response has been "rage anger and pessimism people dont want to hear it " rush said "when i began in the liberals had had their monopoly for so long they had become arrogant " they would present "lies and deceits as truth " "we exposed them " he said which only "increased their anger about present day america " rush has something there when he talks about liberal "lies and deceits " certainly in years of conservative journalism neither i nor any of the giants whom i have followed was caught in such huge journalistic frauds as the new york timess jayson blair stories dan rathers hoked up national guard story on george w bush or the new republics mythopoeic pratfalls with stephen glass and now the "baghdad diarist " yes rush we conservative journalists are happier than the opposition and looking back on it we have been more accurate "the story of the conservatives destruction of the liberal media monopoly has not been told and will not have an objective historian until we are gone " rush concludes ok rush you are right but neither of us is going away for a longtime agreed mr tyrrell is the founder and editor in chief of the american spectator a contributing editor to the new york sun and the author most recently of "the clinton crack up the boy presidents life after the white house" thomas nelson
