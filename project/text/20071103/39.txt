talk is cheap in politics but a deep voice helps vocal experts measure candidates likability toting up ums and ahs impressive biographies fine policy positions but do the candidates sound presidential their vocal cords as much as the substance of their words could influence who becomes the next president claim the people who study measure "focus group" and coach the human voice "voice matters its what sells " says john daly a university of texas communications professor who has written a book about persuasion university of california at los angeles psychology professor albert mehrabian even claims to have quantified how important a voice is when we are deciding whether we like the person delivering a message tone of voice accounts for of our opinion body language for and the actual words for just his studies suggest to gauge what the candidates voices say about their appeal the wall street journal asked washington voice coach susan miller of voicetrainer llc to analyze the voices of seven democrats and five republicans by pitch speed and two measures of variability how loud and soft their voices are and how high and low they go ms miller also toted up the "ums" and "ahs" in two second samples of each candidates voice the samples were taken from a may republican debate and a july democratic debate the samples for former television actor and tennessee sen fred thompson were taken from the sept speech in which he announced his candidacy the vocal cord primary like the campaign itself so far is inconclusive but our unscientific poll of ms miller and other leading voice experts suggests among the republicans former massachusetts gov mitt romneys and television actor thompsons baritones win on authority but lose on energy on the democratic side new york sen hillary rodham clintons and illinois sen barack obamas voices convey caring but mrs clinton can sound shrill and mr obama can lack forcefulness the best voice "probably cant be determined " cautions texass mr daly keen to preserve the appearance of authenticity the presidential campaigns said they arent using voice coaches sen clintons campaign alone didnt return emails seeking comment voice coaches generally wont say whether they are helping a specific candidate although none of those commenting in this article are involved in campaigns politics is partly about likability of course ronald reagans voice conveyed warmth and was part of his popularity says the university of pennsylvanias kathleen hall jamieson who studies political communication al gores voice came across as condescending and hurt him in the campaign she says mr thompsons honeyed voice is a big part of his appeal supporters compare it with president reagans but at hertz a measure of vibrations per second mr thompsons voice was higher pitched than that of republican rival mr romney in the samples and also showed less variation in pitch and loudness than the voices of most of his other rivals ms miller calculated pitch is largely determined by anatomy a bigger voice box creates a deeper voice thats too bad for mrs clinton democratic ohio rep dennis kucinich and republican texas rep ron paul who had the highest pitches a deep voice connotes dominance expertise and competence says mr daly "theres a sense of automatic credibility " a high pitched voice on the other hand suggests nervousness excitability sometimes even wackiness think ross perot or howard dean whose scream after his third place finish in the iowa caucuses may have sunk his campaign pitch variability or inflection may be almost as important as pitch because it suggests passion and energy on that measure sen clinton outdistanced the pack the difference between her highest and lowest pitched words was almost triple the score of mr romney who had the least inflection mr romney also had the least difference between his loudest and softest words decibels compared with decibels for sen obama who modulated his volume the most those variations in pitch and volume plus switch ups in speed create what uclas mr mehrabian calls "arousal" in an audience that draws in listeners by creating excitement "emotionally voters will want to embrace your ideas because you have touched them with your passion " adds richard greene a los angeles public speaking coach those vocal gymnastics convey energy but also require it thus mr romneys near monotone risks reinforcing the fear of party pros that he wont galvanize voters says mr greene mr thompsons voice which was only slightly more energetic plays into his opponents attempt to cast him as a lazy campaigner mr greene adds but the pitch variability in mrs clintons midwestern dialect may not be entirely good news if it comes across to voters as shrieking rather than passion mrs clintons pitch is within normal range for a woman says ms miller yet her sudden vocal highs run the danger of making her sound strident says the university of pennsylvanias ms jamieson mr obama has mastered the moving cadence used by many black clergymen to rouse his audiences speech coaches say but the illinois senator punctuated his answer with six "uhs " which voice researchers call "disfluencies " a candidate with too many disfluencies sounds unprepared a candidate with too few can sound rote and unreflective sen clinton who is often criticized as over rehearsed blitzed through a question about nuclear energy at words per minute without a disfluency but she slowed and uhed when asked whether she is a liberal mr daly says research shows that people who speak a bit faster than normal are perceived as more competent persuasive even likable if only because they dont allow listeners time to think about what theyve just heard the average english speaker utters to words a minute and comprehends about twice that he says by that measure mr kucinich was speaking at the outer edge of human comprehension in one sample at words per minute even mr thompsons southern drawl clocked in at words a minute on one sample speech slows with age and loses clarity which some voice professionals say could be a problem for year old arizona sen john mccain mark mckinnon a mccain campaign adviser calls the senators voice "gritty " but frank luntz a republican pollster who has written about how words influence public debate says he hears age in mr mccains voice of course none of this may matter if voters have other reasons to like or dislike a candidate that certainly happened with mr giulianis lisp "it should have hurt him and it doesnt and no ones going to make fun of him for it after " says mr luntz voters also are quick to change their minds as momentum builds behind a candidate george h w bushs high pitched voice aggravated the "wimp factor" in his presidential campaign but wasnt an issue after he was elected says ms jamieson so what would a clinton giuliani match up sound like if opinion polls are correct when they predict the two will lead their parties tickets mr giuliani gets points for lower pitch and its implication of authority mrs clinton wins on inflection with its suggestion of deep concern and on speed both give new definition to a new york minute
