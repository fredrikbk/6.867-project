weekend journal food &amp drink eating out playing with our food why egg filled ravioli and other food stunts are so popular i am a sucker for food stunts feats of prestidigitation with props you can eat i love knowing how swiss pear brandy distillers get whole pears inside their bottles they impale empty bottles over budding pear branches and wait for the fruit to grow then fill the bottle with eau de vie de poire i never tire of intromitting a hardboiled egg into a milk bottle shell and all soak the egg for hours in vinegar to soften drop a spliff of burning paper into the empty bottle set the egg on top and wait while the burning paper consumes the oxygen creating a vacuum that sucks the egg inside to retrieve pour in some water and an alka seltzer and invert at the stupendous dinner cooked by six world class chefs last month for charlie trotters th anniversary in chicago heston blumenthal of britains michelin three star the fat duck hid ipod shuffles in whelk shells that sat next to a delicious seafood mixture on each of guests plates so that they could listen to sounds of the sea on earphones while they ate a complex seafood medley and seafood foam mr blumenthal wylie dufresne of wd in new york and grant achatz of alinea in chicago all of them part of the molecular gastronomy movement led by el bullis ferran adria in northeast spain deploy scientific tools such as liquid nitrogen and low temperature "sous vide" water baths to produce startling and often surreal dishes they are remarkable to look at and astonishing to taste fried mayonnaise after dinner whiskey gum and mystical essences such as "toasted hay " here in formerly bohemian greenwich village we have just survived a typhoon known as the annual halloween parade we are almost as tired of tricks or treats now as we are annoyed at the prospect of once again having our block taken over by tv crews shooting new episodes of "law and order " but i have to say i love the tricky treats two enterprising female chefs perform every night on my street anne burrell of the new hot wine bar and bistro centro vinoteca poaches egg yolks inside big inch circular ravioli anita lo of annisa a rare female chef running a top new york restaurant captures soup and foie gras inside a dumpling my neighborhood sorcieres de cuisine arent molecular gastronomers but they also pull off their stunts with scienctific method and a flair for the theatrical which is an essential part of modern restaurant cooking and as traditional as baked alaska or a souffle ms lo a michigander as well as an alumna of the same new england private school as caroline kennedy schlossberg with a degree in french from columbia combined all of her backgrounds to reinvent a folkloric shanghainese dish that started out as a soup filled bun with a pork meatball inside it came to queens n y as a soup dumpling shaped like a beggars purse served at joes shanghai by when joes opened a manhattan branch it was on every epicures lips literally and figuratively ms lo frenchified it and made it luxurious with a finer dough and foie gras but eating one of these liquid filled parcels requires the same strategy as it did in chinatown holding it in a soup spoon bite off a small piece of the basket suck out the hot soup then eat the solid parts that way hot soup doesnt burst all over you in the kitchen ms los culinary strategy is the same as that of any home cook in the dishs native village of nan xiang she prepares an aspic or solid gelatinized "soup" that slips inside the dumpling and stays solid until steam heated at centro vinoteca in the basement kitchen a meticulous fellow called humberto rolls out a long thin layer of dough for the steroidal ravioli and cuts out three inch disks with a sort of cookie cutter onto them he spreads a mixture of ricotta and parmesan cheese then he cracks an egg separates the yolk from the white and gingerly deposits a perfect sun of a yolk on the cheese a second disk of dough goes on top and is pressed in place to make a single large raviolo ravioli is the plural or to be more exact a raviolone the last syllable an italian "augmentative " implies bigness beyond the normal with a raw yolk inside after a brief say three minute poaching in gently simmering water the dough is cooked as is the still liquid ready to burst on fork contact yolk at this time of year ms burrell emerges from the open kitchen to shave an ounce of white truffle over the raviolone but even without that pricey fillip her delicate egg surprise is a winner a star turn that helped to make the reputation of the great italian restaurant san domenico at imola near bologna from there it has spread not only to my corner but across the country diners familiar with the situation have reported encounters at bostons prezza and at prima ristorante in boulder colo rising star chef steve mannino stuffs his pasta pouches with quail eggs and wild mushrooms at the las vegas olives in the bellagio and at classy fifth floor in san francisco which just got a michelin star chef melissa perello puts her signature on the dish with a duck egg porcini mushrooms peas and serrano ham at centro vinoteca the raviolone waits to delight the connoisseur with proustian recollections of youth or to astonish the neophyte at centro or at annisa or even in the street at the latest "law and order" crime scene my neighborhood is ready for its close up email me at eatingout wsj com corrections &amp amplifications melissa perello is no longer the chef at the fifth floor restaurant in san francisco and the dish raviolone with duck egg porcini mushrooms serrano ham and peas is no longer on the menu the eating out column in saturdays weekend journal incorrectly suggested ms perello was still the chef and that the dish was still served wsj nov
