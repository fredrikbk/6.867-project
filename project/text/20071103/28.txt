living larger in the new russia broke in the nineties the starodubovs are bouncing back and thanking putin reutov russia svetlana starodubova swings left past the cold cut case pointing out the stick of salami she picked up earlier in the week "on sale " she crows her year old daughter irina catches up to drop a package of mussels and her beloved lays potato chips into the shopping cart as the two head for the checkout after a brief wait at the cash register the family is headed back home to their apartment in this high rise suburb just east of moscow passing the new kofe khaus cafe and the chevy dealer when the wall street journal first visited the starodubovs as the soviet union collapsed in salami was also an important issue to get some svetlana and her husband vitaly had to stand in line for three and a half hours in the winter cold holding baby irina the paper returned after russias financial crisis in to find svetlana standing for hours at an open air market selling meat pies to make money for the family while her jobless husband helped irina get ready for first grade their marriage was near collapse like millions of russians who have been lifted out of poverty by a booming economy over the past seven years the starodubovs life has been transformed both now have steady jobs they say theyve patched things up sitting in their cramped but sunny kitchen they show off the new polish made stove they bought on credit this spring svetlana opens the refrigerator to show the well stocked shelves "there was a time when you opened the fridge and there was nothing " she says remembering the lean days of "we live modestly like all working people " says svetlana a plump year old "modestly but we have enough " chimes vitaly years old the starodubovs ascent from the hand to mouth existence of the s to relative security today helps explain why president vladimir putin is perceived so differently in russia than he is in the west for many here he is a hero after nearly two decades of crazy desperation and living from one day to the next the relative calm of the putin era feels like such a tremendous achievement that for many in russia its more than enough to earn their loyalty "to tell the truth i dont know who runs out of money these days " says vitaly "i dont think anyone is that badly off " since mr putin took office in about million russians have been lifted above the official poverty line another million remain in poverty according to government figures an oil fired economic boom has brought long awaited stability after a string of crises in the s and more than doubled average incomes adjusted for inflation since a middle class is growing but so is the gap between rich and poor still the government is scrambling to pour tens of billions of dollars into rebuilding russias crumbling roads power networks hospitals and schools all of which have seen little investment since the collapse of the soviet union in rising incomes are the big reason why nearly half of russians say they want mr putin to stay on when his term ends next spring even though that would require changing the constitution mr putin has said he wont do that but recently said he might become prime minister after the march elections though the starodubov family is better off than theyve been in years rough edges remain among the shiny shopping centers and the new mcdonalds that have popped up around their neighborhood the starodubovs dilapidated brown soviet style high rise is a dingy throwback to an earlier era the elevator smells of urine over the summer vitaly was mugged nearby and couldnt work for over a month forcing the family to dig into savings because neither his nor his wifes job offers sick leave vitaly says he could barely recognize his native village in central russia when he went to visit his year old mother this fall "everything is in collapse theres nothing but old women left " he says "people survive on what they grow themselves " like most russians vitaly and svetlana never marched in the rallies for or against the democratic transformations that swept the country in the past two decades they voted for president boris yeltsin in the s after he abruptly resigned in they cast their ballots for the man he recommended to replace him vladimir putin even though vitaly says he thought the former kgb agent seemed too "soft" to pull russia back together then they say they arent concerned by mr putins crackdown on political opponents and the independent media or his increasing use of soviet style symbols indeed the reassuring stability he has brought leads vitaly to wonder why the soviet system couldnt have been adapted to allow fully stocked stores and freedom to travel like today under communism "we were like children we went where we were directed then they gave us freedom and we were lost we didnt know where to go and what to do next " svetlana says "i like putins policy " by moscow standards the starodubovs are lower middle class vitaly usually earns about rubles &# a month double what svetlana makes sergei their son contributes about rubles a month from the rubles a month he earns as a forklift operator at a warehouse svetlana says the family spends about rubles a month on food and utilities they got their two room apartment plus another one granted to svetlana a few years ago free from the state so they pay no rent or mortgage starting a few years ago the steady income allowed the family to start saving money each month again building up a rainy day fund of several months income in the sberbank savings bank across the street from their apartment svetlana says they dream of buying a car which would cost at least &# new but havent saved enough vitaly demurs that they dont really need one the starodubovs two room square foot apartment is a visual reminder that the familys fitful journey to prosperity isnt complete the fading flowered wallpaper and worn linoleum are a sharp contrast to the richly finished new wood doors with smoked glass on the bathroom and kitchen in the bathroom the floor is done in dark red ceramic but the bare concrete walls still await tiles "we do the renovation bit by bit so we can afford it " says vitaly the habits born of a lifetime in cramped communal apartments mean the starodubovs arent sticklers about personal space sergei sleeps in one room which hes been sharing with two visitors from vitalys hometown whove come to moscow to look for work vitaly svetlana and irina sleep in the living room on beds that double as couches during the day theres also irinas white rat in a cage and the family cat irinas pride is her computer which stands nestled in a bookshelf just to the left of the television set svetlana says the family bought the top of the line model last year at the eldorado electronics store nearby paying for the nearly &# machine with an instant consumer loan they signed up for in the store "we just bought it and didnt really figure out how much wed pay " vitaly admits svetlana says she doesnt know what the interest rate was but that the month loan cost about &# over the cost of the computer last month they finally gave in to irinas calls to connect the pc to the internet which costs about rubles a month the kitchen is bright and nicely finished with brown cabinets and blue tiles bought with the proceeds of one of vitalys rich paydays building villas for the wealthy in the s its a squeeze to get in between the refrigerator and a cardboard box of cooking oil bottles "on special bottles for rubles apiece " crows svetlana over vitalys embarrassed objections she opens the refrigerator to show off the five frozen chickens she got on sale as well as the lamb they use for soup "we need about rubles for food for all of us each day " she says irina whose tastes run richer puts down her bottle of coke and corrects her "sometimes " "potato chips are a necessity " her father teases irina buys x men comic books and loves hollywood movies which she watches on pirated dvds sold widely for a few dollars in the neighborhood one of her first questions for an american visitor was whether hed ever met paris hilton or britney spears svetlana complains that irina has already spent all the money she earned over the summer filling in as a concierge with her mother "she doesnt know what she spent it on " svetlana scoffs irina shrugs she needs a new pair of jeans for school she says although her classmates arent that fashion conscious but cell phones are an important status symbol she says "i want one with speakers " irina adds "you want a new mobile " marvels her father "why do you need another one " irina backs off and leaves this issue for another day irina graduates from high school in the spring but her career plans are still a matter of discussion "i wanted her to be a dental technician " says svetlana but when irina visited a family friends clinic "she almost fainted" from the blood "well be signing up for bookkeeping courses now " declares svetlana "what bookkeeping courses " irina squeals "i wont do that i dont want to be a bookkeeper " since early august the family has had to dip into their savings for everyday expenses because vitalys earnings have all but dried up vitaly was mugged walking back from visiting svetlana in her concierge compartment one evening he says a young couple he thought was waiting for the bus asked him for a cigarette as he reached to get one he was hit from behind he wasnt carrying his cell phone he says so all the thieves got was the rubles he had in his pocket when he stumbled home he didnt call the police or a doctor "the police will just accuse me of something im not guilty of " he says vitaly has tried several different jobs in security over the past few years he moved up from his old parking lot job to a position as a guard in a new supermarket but he says his supervisor started demanding kickbacks from his paycheck threatening to report him for nonexistent violations if he refused vitaly says his request for a transfer was refused so he quit and found another security company there he worked round the clock shifts of four days on with four days off in between guarding construction sites and auto junkyards as the weather turned colder he left that job to look for one indoors since the mugging vitaly has been spending most of his time around the apartment but theres no sign of the tension that wracked their marriage back in when he was out of work now svetlana coos about his signature chicken recipe and he affectionately calls her his "little bookkeeper" for her close watch over the family finances "we worked things out " he says when theyre not working the two spend a lot of time together one afternoon found them headed to the local outdoor market to buy a new pair of pants for svetlana "i have three pairs of pants " says svetlana "when one is in the wash i wear the others " squeezed in along a sidewalk in front of a new shopping mall going up near the railway station the market is a maze of narrow passages between cramped compartments made of corrugated metal dodging other shoppers svetlana heads for a section whose walls are draped with clothes she picks out a pair of dark polyester pants and asks to try them on the saleswoman slides out of the unheated foot by foot box that serves as her shop and signals for svetlana to go in standing in the walkway the saleswoman holds up a small curtain for privacy as svetlana tries on first one pair and then another she asks vitaly how they look and gets his approval for the pair that cost about rubles "in stores things are much more expensive " she says tucking the purchase into her bag further down the passage svetlana stops at a stall selling linens looking for a new bedspread for the living room the saleswoman shows her a white satin one for rubles and looks perplexed when svetlana asks if there are any available for closer to rubles but after heading off to an unseen storage spot she comes back with a deep red one that costs about that svetlana says will work just fine on the way home vitaly and svetlana show off reutovs new city park on a late summer day workers are still bringing soil in to plant lawns a golden domed orthodox church stands to one side "you go in i dont have a scarf to cover my head " svetlana tells vitaly orthodox tradition requires women to cover their heads in church religion was suppressed under the soviets but now its back svetlana increasingly turned to the church in the s vitaly is less of a believer and prefers to walk toward a newly installed fountain just down the path a computer controlled one laid with black granite tiles asked about politics svetlana and vitaly say they welcome mr putins tough guy image and agree that he should stay on for a third term even though hes said he wont do that "yeltsin shouldnt have let the reins go " vitaly says as svetlana points out that both voted for the former president at the time "our country is used to a firm hand " hes happy mr putin has said hell remain influential after the elections "i wouldnt turn down the chance to vote for him again if i could " he says hes also impressed by mr putins new prime minister viktor zubkov who is considered a potential presidential candidate "hes not scared of anyone " vitaly says of the former soviet collective farm boss putins rollback of democratic institutions such as elections and media freedom doesnt bother them opposition demonstrators beaten by police this spring are probably paid stooges vitaly says citing state tv reports "nobodys twisting arms " he says "but just like in any country a person shouldnt talk too much " in any event politics takes a back seat to everyday concerns sitting at the kitchen table svetlana recites prices from memory for summer fruits and where the best deals are the sleek shopping center directly in front of their building is for "rich people the ones with two or three cars " she says their family goes around the corner to a cheaper store where fruit is still plentiful "it was just awful before " says vitaly recalling the deprivations of the s and before that of the soviet period lines for salami were so long shoppers marked their places with numbers written on their hands now he says "were not used to waiting in lines anymore "
