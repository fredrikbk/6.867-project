double squeeze for homes pressed borrowers find help only after falling behind on mortgages struggling homeowners seeking mortgage relief from their lenders say they are hearing a tough message we cant help you unless you first fall behind on payments that is putting borrowers in a bind given that defaulting on a mortgage triggers all kinds of headaches consider sharon cooper of lynn mass who wants to sell her home the problem she now owes more than the house is worth so she asked her lender to allow a "short sale" selling it for less than the amount due and forgiving the rest to avoid foreclosure she says the lender countrywide financial corp in august told her she would first need to fall two months behind on payments so last month she stopped paying "i dont have any option but to stop paying " she says countrywide disputes ms coopers version of events saying in its files there isnt any reference to telling her that she needs to be two months behind "we have been informed that ms cooper is seeking to sell the home " a countrywide spokesman said "we continue to pursue this course as a possible satisfactory solution " as past due home loans keep piling up and some two million adjustable rate mortgages prepare to adjust higher in the coming year mortgage companies are reaching out to borrowers in hopes of fending off foreclosures on the other hand they remain wary of cutting the interest rate extending the term or forgiving debts as long as borrowers are still current on their payments "most companies are not giving people loan modifications until they are late on their loans " says stephanie porta an orlando fla organizer for the association of community organizations for reform now or acorn a community activist group elizabeth schomburg senior vice president of the family credit counseling service in chicago says about to of some families who sought help from the nonprofit agency last month were current on their mortgages and thus considered by lenders as "ineligible" for loan modification "in general the mortgage company wants to see a consumer default on three separate payments before considering a loan modification " she says the group offers credit counseling services in more than states gail cunningham a spokeswoman for the national foundation for credit counseling says its member agencies in areas from southern california to texas have seen the same trend "one counselor in amarillo texas just told me it seems to me they almost encourage people to fall behind in order to find help " ms cunningham says mortgage companies on the other hand often point to the way home loans are sold and packaged today as the key factor that complicates their efforts to help borrowers most mortgages are no longer owned by the companies that originated them but are funneled into securities and sold to investors world wide as a result mortgage servicers who collect payments on the loans for a fee often define their responsibility as maximizing returns for the investors for whom they service the loans mortgage servicers have to make sure they can "defend" the actions they take to help prevent foreclosures said steve bailey head of countrywides loan administration division in a recent interview often he said those investors ask "are they truly not able to pay " still mr bailey said "to recommend someone to not pay is a bad recommendation " he acknowledged that countrywide is "significantly more open" to modify loans for borrowers who have already fallen behind the reason if "youre current and trying to renegotiate the existing contract thats not fair to the investor" in the mortgages other servicers agree that it is more difficult though not impossible to rework loans while borrowers are still paying investors are concerned about "frivolous or dishonest claims of financial stress " countrywide said in a statement demand for modified loans is expected to grow fitch ratings estimates that modified loans could account for to of all loans outstanding over the next to months that compares with the current level of less than in addition the bond rating firm says loan modifications may be the only "viable" strategy to avoid foreclosures for as many as of the subprime loans that are already in default or determined to face "a reasonably foreseeable default scenario " in a move to respond to calls from regulators to stem foreclosures from spreading further countrywide of calabasas calif the largest u s home mortgage lender late last month announced a plan to refinance or restructure as much as &# billion in loans by the end of next year for homeowners facing higher payments because their interest rates are "resetting" to higher levels "unprecedented times call for unprecedented remedies " said countrywide president and chief operating officer david sambol in a statement that plan which includes reaching out to still current but at risk borrowers could put pressure on other lenders to follow suit "you dont want to give money away " says larry litton jr chief executive of litton loan servicing a houston servicer specializing in "subprime" mortgages held by borrowers with patchy credit histories still he said if some basic income and expense figures "indicate the borrower does have trouble keeping up its pretty easy to determine on a loan modification " litton estimates that it modified about loans in september including already defaulted loans and still current loans with rates resetting in the next three months
