the weekend interview with natan sharansky dissident jerusalem an eternity ago in the former soviet refusenik and israeli government minister natan sharansky called george w bush "a dissident president" "jokingly " he tells me thinking back to that first white house meeting "i didnt think itd be so true that hed be so lonely because " as he later warned mr bush "dissidents are lonely " the fortunes of mr sharansky and his ideas about freedom rose and sunk with president bushs opinion polls his "the case for democracy" came along three years ago when the administration seriously looked to push it in the muslim world the president loved the book and mr sharansky became the in house philosopher for the bush doctrine "if you want a glimpse of how i think about foreign policy read natan sharanskys book " blurbs mr bush on the back cover of the paperback edition but democracy is a dirty word these days so mr sharansky is lonely too bounced out of israeli politics and out of favor he vaclav havel and other former eastern european dissident faces of the freedom agenda are dismissed as cold war naifs pernicious utopians or worse men whose moral manichaeism has no business in the "complex middle east " america is back to its realist ways in the region propping up egyptian and saudi gerontocrats the day i visit mr sharansky condi rice is here to prod all sides to another middle east peace conference with no mention of political opening as part of the bargain across town at the shalem center his new professional home in jerusalems german colony mr sharansky puts a brave face on this latest turn in his life nine years in a siberian prison camp without seeing his young wife he says puts everything that follows in healthy perspective his smiling eyes are framed by a recognizable bald pate and graying sideburns hes almost an anecdote or joke is never absent for long in conversation as almost any east european will tell you humor makes unpleasant reality go down easier mr sharansky says of his adversaries among the western intellectual elite "those people who are always wrong they were wrong about the soviet union they were wrong about oslo the israeli palestinian peace deal they were wrong about appeasing yasser arafat they are the intellectual leaders of these battles so what can i tell you " but his side is today on a back foot the war in iraq and the rise of hamas in the palestinian territories aided by the ballot box are exhibits a and b in the case against the bush doctrine and its contention that democracy can put down roots in arab soil mr sharansky considers these cases immaterial "whats happening today in iraq has nothing to do with the question whether promoting democracy is a good idea or whether people in iraq want to live in freedom " the iraqis refusal to defend saddam hussein and courage in voting for a new constitution and parliament settled that argument for mr sharansky iraqs kurds sunnis and shiites are he says engaged in a different no less ferocious struggle over "identity" his current obsession and the subject of his next book the victory of hamas in last years palestinian elections is widely considered a defeat for the bush doctrine mr sharansky recalls seeing friends at the white house the day of the vote "they said oh its the first time its a good experiment and i said i fully disagree its a terrible experiment now of course they come back and say you see you want to promote democracy and you get hamas " as he argued in his bestselling book the west confuses the ballot box with democracy "the election has to be at the end of the process of building free society " he says "if there is no free and democratic society elections can never be free and democratic " having not even attempted a "bottom up" overhaul of its politics and economy the palestinians werent ready for a poll he says nor were other post cold war western protectorates he faults successive u s administrations for pushing votes before their time in bosnia right after its war ended in iraq and in the palestinian territories "nobody thought in to have elections in germany and japan " mr sharansky says his belief that arabs can stomach democracy hasnt wavered but that not many others ever shared it typical was former prime minister ariel sharons smiling quip to him "good for you natan that you convinced bush of things that dont exist " with benefit of hindsight mr sharansky says that "democracy is a rather problematic word because democracy is about technique i would prefer freedom i would say people dont want to live under constant fear " its as much as hell concede his bigger concern is the wests own weak stomach this is a familiar theme for mr sharansky and others who waged the cold war battle on the other side of the wall prosperous stable societies can lack by these lights moral clarity and courage and are prone to cynical compromises or gullibility under totalitarianism the challenge is to fight evil he paraphrases the british writer melanie phillips and in free societies it is to see evil for much of the last century "the policy of the free world was to build and strengthen friendly dictators " says mr sharansky "the more the free world enjoys their freedom the more they will be reluctant to support any freedom for others i saw it in my personal life in the soviet union i see it to this day they say the arabs are not capable of this such a strong racist statement " he pauses "thats interesting its politically uncorrect sic to be a racist but its so politically correct now to say that promoting democracy is a bad idea " mr sharansky says washington didnt give the freedom agenda a chance when the administration briefly pressed arab dictatorships if only with tougher rhetoric "there were results " he says citing egypts release of dissident saad ibrahim and lebanons cedar revolution against the syrians but the saudis egyptians and others rightly figured the storm would pass hosni mubarak bowed to pressure to hold presidential elections then rigged them and for good measure imprisoned his opponent ayman nour "its such a clear return to the old days when from the top you have to try to decide with the leaders who dont represent anything and ignore all your principles " says mr sharansky "im very careful not to be too critical of bush simply because i believe that the very fact that we can disagree on a democratic agenda" say over the wisdom of holding early elections "is because there is such an agenda " says mr sharansky walking down emek refaim street past coffee shops and groceries mr sharanskys height challenges a source of self deprecating jokes and his prominence in israel are clearer on every corner someone greets this soviet born jew in a blue shirt and cap over a lunch of goose leg and lamb kabob the land of his birth threatens to spoil the meal but mr sharansky somewhat surprisingly sounds more upbeat about prospects for democracy in that region than in the arab world obviously he says mr putin "likes power" and wont give it up at a shalem sponsored conference on democracy promotion in prague this past june mr sharansky recalls dedicating his book to garry kasparov the long shot opposition candidate for russian president in march elections "to dissident kasparov from chess player sharansky " he laughs mr sharansky is no slouch but hardly in the same league as the world chess champion he thinks mr kasparov will be safe as long as he doesnt pose a serious threat to mr putins hold on power in his view the wests so called russia experts misjudged mr putins aspirations and political talents particularly his ability "to use the right language in russia " once when the russian president went on an anti western tirade mr sharansky recalls that secretary rice one of those experts noted that mr putin was ruining his image abroad "i told her he looks stupid to you but the most important thing is how he looks in moscow and in moscow he looks like a hero " in spite of the fast slide toward authoritarianism russia has economic freedoms and an absence of fear which says mr sharansky puts the soviet days far into the past "to bring back that type of fear you need to kill hundreds of thousands maybe millions " russian democracy can be salvaged he muses without a coup or revolution say if mr putins fortunes falter or more tantalizingly given its the source of russias recent bolshiness oil prices drop "im cautiously optimistic " he says mr sharansky considers the right to make a buck or travel freely as important as political freedoms his gulag mates were almost all "economic prisoners" the dissident campaign in the s was to let soviet jewry emigrate not bring down the imperium with a power like china the west doesnt need to play down the freedom agenda he says deng xiaopings market reforms brought a fair measure of liberty defusing nationalism and making beijing easier to work with and china can be encouraged further down this road in his view international donors erred by not pushing the palestinian authority to open the economy of the territories for business seen from the u s or israel the outlook for mideast democracy looks grim here politicians are bracing for possible war with iran over the mullahs nuclear program across the separation fence in the palestinian territories in mr sharanskys pithy summary civil war rages "between fundamentalist terrorists and secular terrorists " the arab dictatorships look as immovable as before missing in mr sharanskys view is the political vision to see beyond this unhappy status quo if ronald reagan managed to face down a nuclear superpower determined to destroy the free world then surely his successors can handle a couple of poor arab states highly dependent on western aid in response to the line that "democracy cant be imposed from outside " mr sharansky shoots back that the soviets improved their human rights record after the helsinki accords put the spotlight on it the u s and europe have far greater economic and political leverage in arab countries than with moscow then to force through reforms of their economies politics and schools they choose not to use it the other charge is the arab world lacks for andrei sakharovs noble democrats with a constituency mr sharansky is unconvinced "they were saying for many years sakharov is a nice guy but he doesnt represent anyone and i as his spokesman had to explain he represents millions and millions of double thinkers who are afraid to speak " mr sharanskys stubbornness is famous during his release in exchange for a couple soviet spies the kgb told him to walk straight across glienicke bridge he zigzagged this account he tells me is partly apocryphal that happened earlier at the airport in east berlin when he meandered from the plane to a waiting car there is a funny but less well known story about the bridge mr sharansky was dressed in civilian clothes bought for him in moscow which were too big the kgb didnt let him have a belt for his baggy pants and he was forced to hold them up with a rope "when i was on the bridge and i asked the u s official" who was guiding him across "where is the border at this line he pointed oh freedom and i jumped over the rope broke at the last moment i caught my pants "then they asked me what was your first thought when you came to freedom how not to lose my trousers " and he laughs mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
