we need an intelligent debate on intelligence robert f turner argues that the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa is unconstitutional because it usurps presidential power but fails to cite anything in the constitution to support his position "the surveillance law that matters " editorial page oct the reason is that the constitution says nothing about the president having the "power to authorize warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance " as much as mr turner apparently would like to use the constitution as a cudgel with which to quiet those who want a pesky congress to more strictly regulate how the government conducts foreign intelligence operations the constitution being written by americans rather than europeans does not read like a lengthy code that tries to answer all possible questions so what there are sound arguments that support legislatively giving the president wide discretion in conducting foreign intelligence make those arguments the public can be trusted with the debate and with the selection of members of congress and of presidents who can hash out and resolve these issues this process in no way ensures that the result will adequately protect the u s but no process including letting the president do what he wants because he has some invisible constitutional "power" to do so will ensure success what will be ensured is that we the citizenry whose nation this is in the first place will get the result we want and deserve that is the price and the strength of republican government barton l jacka san diego while its true that congress with the erroneous approval of the supreme court regulates things that it does not have authority to regulate the idea that the president or at least this president is bound by the constitution is laughable there is a reason presidents and other federal elected officials take an oath to "protect and defend the constitution " just because congress and the court abandon that oath does not mean the president should also to the contrary the president must now be especially vigilant in defending our nations fundamental principles when the president twice mentioned unconstitutional aspects of the mccain feingold act while he was in the process of signing it he knowingly committed dereliction of duty of the most important duty other than his role as commander in chief so while the president should be bound by the constitution he clearly isnt ross kaminsky nederland colo mr turner argues that the president has broad powers "to manage the business of intelligence as prudence might suggest " citing federalist no to support his position yet the plain language of the fourth amendment constrains the power of the executive branch to act alone by requiring judicial warrants for a search the authors of the federalist papers did not have to worry about the fourth amendment because they published their papers well before the fourth amendment was even proposed federalist no was published on march whereas what is now the bill of rights was not even proposed until many months later in furthermore the federalist papers opposed a bill of rights see federalist no so in terms of history mr turners reliance on federalist no is specious no discussion of the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance can rely on anything said in the federalist papers about the powers of the executive branch it was precisely the fear of overreaching federal power that made the people of the united states insist that the constitution had to be modified by the bill of rights jack harllee washington
