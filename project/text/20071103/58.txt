weekend journal books diagnosis diffident why psychiatrys field guide approach sometimes mistakes temperament for illness shyness by christopher lane yale pages &# if you were anxious about speaking in public would you prefer to be called a "social phobic" needing a pill a "neurotic" needing psychoanalysis or a shy person needing practice and coaching id opt for no but not everyone agrees certainly some people have been helped by pills for social phobia and would swear by no in "shyness how normal behavior became a sickness " christopher lane seems to favor no but that might have been expected since he appears to have brought an affection for freudian psychoanalysis to his investigations to his credit mr lane a professor of literature at northwestern university notes that when psychiatrists diagnose the shy as suffering from social phobia they mistake a variation in human temperament for a mental disorder if anything the diagnosis only adds to the sense of unease felt by shy people he is also right in observing that the psychiatrists diagnostic and statistical manual dsm the professions standard page reference work errs by designating other kinds of normal human variation as mental disorders and so exaggerates the incidence of mental illness these days almost any restless and active boy especially if he attends a school that has cut back on recess runs the risk of being labeled as suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd a military hero might well be assessed as having post traumatic stress disorder ptsd if he shows any unease after battle and it seems that no one can be sad in our time without being prescribed a pill for major depression rather than given consolation "shyness" is strongest when it recounts how this state of affairs came to pass it describes how contemporary diagnostic practices in psychiatry date back to and the publication of the third edition of dsm dsm iii the editor dr robert spitzer was the director of the department of psychiatric epidemiology at columbia university and he strove to change the ways that psychiatrists at the time identified mental disorders mr lane in his skepticism toward the whole dsm project underestimates the significance of the problems that dr spitzer and his colleagues were trying to correct those problems had become steadily more obvious during the s new medications were appearing that had salutary effects on specific mental disorders particularly the most severe ones such as manic depressive illness and schizophrenia but many freudian psychoanalysts rejected the importance of differentiating between various disorders they insisted that medications merely sedated patients blocking the resolution of their "inner conflicts " adherents of the psychoanalytic method also neglected to treat vulnerable populations such as the poor the elderly and the mentally subnormal claiming that these people were "inaccessible" to therapy basically research into the nature cause and treatment of psychiatric disorders was stymied because no one could agree over what was being studied edward shorter in "a history of psychiatry" refers to this era when freudianism was dominant as "the hiatus" in american psychiatry putting together dsm iii robert spitzer and his associates produced a diagnostic manual that works by defining the wide variety of mental disorders according to the symptoms that patients display the earlier dsm editions were not nearly so expansive the spitzer manual functions as a "field guide" identical in character to naturalists field guides but tied to mental disorders rather than birds wild flowers or trees field guides work for identification purposes and when nothing better is available they stand in for a diagnostic tool resting on more essential distinguishing characteristics but just as the field guides of naturalists can lead to a mixing up and confusion of species and varieties that look similar as many "birders" will attest the field guide method in psychiatry has now as mr lane notes often mixed up truly ill folks with shy restless sad and worried people in other words just about everyone at one time or another but the truth is that the problems of today in psychiatry as in any other enterprise are the result of the solutions of yesterday mr lane fails to describe the serious inadequacies of yesterdays psychiatry that prompted and were addressed by dsm iii he then proposes to solve todays problems by encouraging psychiatrists to resurrect the teachings of sigmund freud and return freudian psychoanalysis to esteem "psychodynamic therapists " mr lane writes "help us see that social phobia and avoidant personality disorder can represent complex sometimes appropriate signs of noncompliance with social norms " his suggestion is akin to noting the several social and political problems of contemporary russia and recommending a return to stalinism mr lane did interview dr spitzer and provides vivid portraits of how dsm iii was constructed over the course of six years by dr spitzer and a team of less from "the concentrated energies of brilliant minds than the raucous class of a teacher whose unruly pupils wont stay quiet " but he believes that dr spitzer and his colleagues wanted above all to dethrone psychoanalysis and devalue its school of thought "spitzer had handpicked his team for its shared interest in diagnostic issues and opposed all other schools of psychiatry especially psychodynamic therapy and freudian psychoanalysis " in other words rather than regarding dsm iii as an honorable and partially successful step forward he sees it as a regressive and reactionary one motivated more by "neurotic" impulses than by scientific reason mr lane thus uses the classical freudian tactic of dealing with challenging critics accuse them of bad faith if only the author of "shyness" had been a bit more bashful rather than neurotic freud bashers of mr lanes imagining the editors of dsm iii were well meaning and responsible agents for the discipline striving to furnish psychiatrists with tools so that diagnostic terms could be used in a uniform fashion an absolute necessity for progress and research and no one who has worked in psychiatry before and after will deny the manuals powerful benefits with dsm iii psychiatrists at least began to use diagnostic terms consistently research in psychiatric departments began to boom after and many advances occurred not only were new medications discovered and disseminated medications that saved lives truncated periods of illness and reduced bad side effects but psychotherapy itself was redesigned and redeployed in ways that could be tested and measured because therapists could finally differentiate disorders important sub specialties emerged as in geriatric psychiatry social psychiatry and the treatment of the mentally subnormal although professors of literature such as mr lane remain devoted to freud who certainly knew how to spin a good tale about the human condition the truth is that scientific investigations into brain mechanisms behavioral controls vulnerabilities of temperament and responses to life adversities will gradually solve the problems he has identified a return to either the master from vienna himself or the mannerists who followed after him will paralyze the effort today freud is deader than elvis nobody investigating psychiatric disorders is dancing to freuds tunes and as for helping allay the social difficulties that shy people face such as public speaking i favor lots of practice and coaching but i have occasionally prescribed a pill for the desperate to help the process along and been pleased with the result dr mchugh the author of "the mind has mountains" is the university distinguished service professor of psychiatry at johns hopkins university
