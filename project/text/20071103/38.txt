politics &amp economics mukasey gets crucial support schumer feinstein back attorney general pick confirmation is likely washington two senior senate democrats threw their support behind michael b mukaseys nomination to head the justice department turning the tide and likely assuring his confirmation sens charles schumer of new york and dianne feinstein of california on friday explained their decision saying fixing problems and repairing morale at the justice department are more important than settling larger political disputes concern among some lawmakers over mr mukaseys views on torture surveillance and presidential power had begun threatening a nomination that two weeks ago seemed a sure thing with those votes mr mukasey is likely assured to win endorsement by the senate judiciary committee in a vote tuesday he would then face a full senate vote where confirmation is highly likely earlier friday democratic sen patrick leahy of vermont said he would vote against mr mukasey mr leahy cited mr mukaseys refusal to declare that an interrogation technique known as waterboarding which simulates drowning constitutes torture mr leahys decision means that at least half of the democrats on the panel are planning to vote against mr mukasey the nominee likely can count on the support of all nine republicans on the committee mr schumer of new york had first suggested mr mukasey a former top federal judge in new yorks southern district as an attorney general pick or even a supreme court justice the senator had wavered in recent days on whether he would support mr mukasey but said he was won over after meeting with the former judge friday "judge mukasey is not my ideal choice " mr schumer said "however judge mukasey whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him is far better than anyone could expect from this administration " mr mukaseys nomination became bogged down after the dispute on waterboarding which reflected a broader one between congress and the bush administration over its assertion of broad presidential powers the administrations legal position is that the president when faced with a national security threat has the constitutional authority to disregard certain laws which critics say may include those that ban torture or restrict warrantless surveillance "i am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the department of justice i like michael mukasey i wish that i could support his nomination but i cannot " mr leahy said the democratic support for mr mukasey makes it likely that congress will try to pass a law that bans waterboarding in nonmilitary interrogations they had previously made it illegal in military detentions sen schumer said mr mukasey assured him the president would be bound by such a law mr mukaseys responses to questions on presidential power have been vague and conditional that has reminded some democrats of the former attorney general alberto gonzales whose sometimes clumsy defenses of white house legal opinions eroded his credibility among many lawmakers mr gonzales resigned under pressure in september mr bush on friday defended mr mukasey and couched his argument in national security terms "theres going to be another fight on the senate floor coming next week " he said in an appearance in south carolina mr mukasey is "a good man hes a fair man hes an independent man and hes plenty qualified to be the attorney general and i strongly urge the united states senate to confirm this man so that i can have an attorney general to work with to protect the united states of america from further attack " the president stood alongside sen lindsay graham a judiciary committee republican who had previously voiced misgivings over mr mukaseys refusal to take a stand on waterboarding sen graham has since thrown his support to mr mukasey
