the deficit in profile president bush yesterday vetoed a &# billion water projects bill and already theres a meltdown on capitol hill members seem to be taking it as a personal affront and no surprise there the measure authorizes projects for the u s army corps of engineers but congress treats it as another excuse for pork the problem is excess and a lack of priorities the corps which has a &# billion projects backlog identified &# billion in necessary civil works for so the house passed a bill at &# billion and the senate at &# billion and then they compromised with the &# billion in his veto statement president bush argued that "taxpayers should not be asked to support a pork barrel system of federal authorization and funding where a projects merit is an afterthought " thats too sensible for ohio republican george voinovich in a press release yesterday the senator lamented the rejection of "this critical legislation" and promised "to do what we can to get these vital projects funded by overriding this veto " we wondered how many projects mr voinovich had himself sponsored in the water bill and sure enough his fingerprints are all over it a watchdog group called taxpayers for common sense tabulated more than special interest earmarks and according to their review mr voinovich has slotted at least two dozen highlights include a &# million "ecosystem restoration project" for the hocking river basin &# million for the lower girard lake dam &# million for "wastewater infrastructure" in akron and &# million for the same thing in columbus &# million for "offstream water supply reserve" in fremont &# million to construct water lines in chauncey and millfield and millions of dollars for other ohio projects perhaps some of these projects are valuable and there are worse earmark offenders than mr voinovich but the senator is still worth singling out because for years he has been one of congresss great deficit scolds while he lards up bills with his own "vital projects " he routinely moans that tax cuts are impossible because of the deficit in fact he is the deficit
