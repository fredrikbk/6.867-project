confusion reigns over proper use of anemia drug doctors and patients are struggling to balance benefits and risks of taking a popular anemia drug to restore red blood cells battered by chemotherapy theyre hoping a food and drug administration advisory panel meeting next week will give them some guidance for the past decade a drug called erythropoietin or epo has been given to millions of severely anemic people as a way to boost production of red blood cells without resorting to transfusions which carry a small but real risk of viral infection the drug has been seen as a boon to chemo patients as many as a year become anemic enough to need treatment to replenish red blood cells that ferry oxygen around the body without enough red cells anemia patients grow fatigued and short of breath and may experience chest pain but a string of studies in recent months called the strategy into question the studies show that aggressive treatment with epo carries a risk of cardiovascular disease cancer progression or poorer overall survival in particular researchers argue that at high doses epos red cell boosting benefits are undermined by other risks drugs in this class are sold as aranesp and epogen by amgen inc and procrit by johnson &amp johnson the emerging safety concerns caused the fda to put a so called black box warning on these drugs labels in march urging doctors to use the smallest dose needed to avoid transfusions increased mortality risk also led medicare insurers to withdraw coverage of epo for people not taking chemo whose anemia is caused by cancer itself in the wake of all this doctors and patients are in a quandary many doctors still use epo albeit in more conservative doses others alternate with blood transfusions which have become safer by screening tests that reduce risk of infections like hiv and hepatitis some patients are refusing to take epo and a number of doctors fret that the drugs are overprescribed citing ease of reimbursement and time saving practices such as the use of "standing orders" instructions to give regular epo shots without monitoring hemoglobin the fda advisory panel is sifting through the emerging data to address some of the confusion depending on the panels conclusions the fda could further refine its dosing guidelines clarify permissible advertising promotions and possibly even order further studies of how epo interacts with cancer many patients attest to a better quality of life after using epo in myrtle beach s c retired school superintendent thomas dowling has battled lung cancer since and a bout of chemo induced anemia in that left him lethargic after aranesp injections he says "i had a return of the energy id had before i was able to resume golf and continued to work " the cancer which reappeared in his brain last may responded well to radiation he says oncologist john glaspy professor of medicine at the university of california at los angeles says that for patients with falling hemoglobin a critical protein carried by red blood cells doctors must face the decision "when we see a patient whose hemoglobin is falling there is a theoretical risk if we do something blood clots and possible effect on survival and a risk if we dont do something transfusions and symptoms like fatigue shortness of breath and chest pain " says dr glaspy who receives research support from amgen and j&amp js ortho unit "doctors feel concerned and unguided because the black box warning makes them feel vulnerable and at risk to be criticized after the fact " he says he adds that he doesnt feel that epo is commonly over prescribed san francisco based oncologist stephen hufford says that advertising of certain epo products has drawn some patients to ask for epo drugs by name and the drugs have been "over marketed " but he says the recent studies highlighting the risks are now chilling a degree of consumer demand a year old patient of dr huffords with recurrent uterine cancer who is anemic from her third round of chemotherapy recently read the news about potential risks of epo and declined her epo shot dr hufford who says he receives no support from amgen or j&amp j continues to prescribe epo for some of his patients wyndham wilson lymphoma research chief at the national cancer institute a unit of the national institutes of health in bethesda md avoids epo altogether in his clinical practice and his labs personal research he fears epo could potentially affect tumors either as a direct growth signal or because it enriches the tumor environment with fresh circulation lee schwartzberg medical director of the west clinic in memphis tenn says his clinic has issued guidelines starting epo treatment only when a chemo patients hemoglobin drops below then they treat with epo and closely monitor hemoglobin stopping as soon as it reaches concerns about epo have arisen before and lately have picked up steam chris corcoran of guilford conn recalls that when his daughter received chemotherapy for liver cancer a decade ago the injections of epo she received to alleviate her anemia caused spikes in a protein in her blood that is a biomarker for her cancer four times in a four month period her epo treatment were followed by a rebound in the biomarker confirms her physician joe mcnamara a pediatric oncologist at yale university medical center mr corcoran said he recalls speaking to an amgen scientist who said he doubted that epo was stimulating his daughters cancer but that to rule it out he would need a sample of amandas tumor that was never done by either party and the corcorans with dr mcnamaras assent switched amanda to transfusions for her anemia she remains healthy today an amgen spokeswoman said that the scientist with whom mr corcoran spoke has left the company amgen also said it believes research so far failed to prove epo promotes cancer progression amgen cites a review of over studies by the british cochrane collaboration an organization that looks at groups of studies as well as its own recent study showing neutral effect of epo on survival of lung cancer patients on may the fdas oncology drugs advisory committee will meet to weigh mounds of study evidence much of it conflicting emerging safety issues were fanned by a study in germany that found patients with head and neck cancer treated with epo had poorer survival rates than those who didnt receive epo similar results came from a danish study that was halted late last year because scientists were worried about epos risks full details from that study havent yet been released one outcome might be a clearer focus on who should and shouldnt get epo drugs the main focus of the fdas black box warning so far are patients with head and neck cancer as well as patients not on chemo whose anemia is the result of the tumor itself a group for whom the drug was never approved epo drugs are also approved to treat anemia that occurs in chronic kidney failure patients and those on dialysis although studies have shown that over treatment with epo places them at greater risk of heart attack and stroke too they arent the focus of this panel meeting the fda declined to comment ahead of the meeting ari baron a san francisco oncologist who also has served as a paid speaker for amgen among other companies says its crucial to bear in mind that epos risks are so far confined to so called off label uses in higher than approved doses the blood used in transfusions "is not without risks and expense " he says "its also a precious and limited resource these drugs have been a godsend in the blinding light of scrutiny we shouldnt lose sight of that "
