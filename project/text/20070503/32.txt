dunkin donuts whips up a recipe for expansion joe rando has had no problem selling baked goods to residents of nashville tenn since he opened the first dunkin donuts in the area in august on opening day he even sold out of doughnuts but getting locals to make dunkin their regular stop for coffee which has a higher profit margin than baked goods has been more challenging "dunkin is truly entrenched as a ritual for northeastern customers " says mr rando in nashville he says "we havent necessarily changed the behavior the coffee buying behavior yet " mr rando is a pioneer of sorts a key part of a dunkin donuts expansion plan that got under way a year ago among the goals to give what has been essentially an eastern chain of coffee and doughnut shops a stronger presence in the south the west and overseas the plan calls for dunkin to eventually increase the number of its u s outlets from the current plus out of a total of plus to and move into more foreign countries including china the plan involves more than geographical expansion last year the chain designed more stores with coffeehouse touches and added savory afternoon sandwiches to appeal to those who no longer eat three meals executives and franchisees say the overall plan has been a success so far over the course of the year some things worked others didnt but in each case the chain learned some lessons and is now fine tuning its expansion strategy accordingly feedback has been crucial from its new sandwich line dunkin scrapped a stuffed melt variety after customers thought it sounded messy the chain created a new logo a sleek steaming cup of coffee but ditched it and went back to its old chunky styrofoam cup after patrons deemed the new one too stylized dunkin a unit of dunkin brands inc canton mass faces stiffening competition from mcdonalds corp which is moving toward selling lattes and cappuccinos to the same middle class customer and also is bolstering its snack line at the same time dunkins upgraded interiors with shiny steel cases and espresso machines placed at customers eye level are aimed at attracting patrons who like a touch of the atmosphere that starbucks and other cafes offer "when people say "geez youre taking on starbucks we like to say we were here first " dunkin chief executive jon luther says figuring out just how much style to add to the brand has been tricky new stores were painted in coffee colored hues until longtime customers indicated they wanted a touch more of the old bright pink and orange "it didnt feel enough like a dunkin " says regina lewis vice president of consumer and brand insights for the chain in october dunkin brands which is owned by thomas h lee partners bain capital partners and the carlyle group said it had put its togos sandwich chain on the block thats in part because executives decided they didnt need the brand in order to sell afternoon fare now dunkin is launching a new line of warm flatbread sandwiches filled with ham and swiss turkey bacon and cheddar or three types of cheese all the sandwiches are typically priced under &# the sandwiches are key to setting dunkin apart from competitors by playing up its bakery roots "weve got bakery flexibility that none of them have " says joe scafido dunkins chief creative and innovation officer ms lewis envisions dunkin carving out the same type of brand niche in food service as target corp has in retailing along with the new sandwiches dunkin is trying to play up the fact that it sells hot breakfast offerings throughout the day unlike mcdonalds and most fast food chains at a remodeled dunkin in downtown chicago the menu advertises those items under the header "anytime breakfast " on a recent friday afternoon year old financial planner may lam walked into that chicago location and ordered sausage egg and cheese on a croissant hash browns and coffee ms lam says she craves breakfast food at all hours and skipped lunch so she could plow through a stack of papers at work she unwrapped her sandwich while sitting at a high bar along the window the store felt more relaxing to ms lam than an older dunkin where she used to study on hard chairs "i think theyre playing music " she observed as bon jovi piped from the speaker system to determine the best cities to open new locations dunkin has been conducting "psychographic" studies across the country to gauge whether peoples values attitudes and interests fit with its brand earlier research showed that dunkin customers had a distinctly unpretentious attitude and disliked more stylized chains like starbucks because of that identity dunkin began referring to its customers as members of the dunkin tribe in the surveys dunkin asked people a series of questions to determine whether they had the down to earth attitude that characterizes the dunkin tribe the questions asked whether the person sometimes had to use his or her looks to get ahead or whether it was important to live an upscale lifestyle dunkin determined that one third of the country is made up of people who are part of the dunkin tribe even though they may not live near a store that has reassured the chain it can move beyond the eastern half of the country where most of its u s stores are but getting those people to become regular coffee customers is still a big challenge people "have their own little ritual " says william kussell dunkins chief operating officer "in order to interrupt their ritual you have to give them reason to switch " to do that dunkin tries to pick the most convenient locations available holds vip nights with the local fire department chief and school officials and passes out lots of free samples in nashville the first new city that dunkin has entered since launching its plan mr rando the franchisee says sales at his two stores are two to three times his original projections baked goods account for more than of his sales with the rest coming from beverages mr rando wants coffee and other beverages to make up a bigger percentage of those sales not only because drinks have wider profit margins but they also can be served more quickly to win customers from competitors mr rando asks workers to remember regular customers names and drink orders for established franchisees the changes in menu and design havent come without cost marvin kaplan who has dunkin outlets in the sarasota fla area opened one with the new design scheme in february he says it was a gamble to invest at least &# in cooking equipment to help him heat the new flatbreads and pizzas but his more stylish interiors are enticing customers to bring their laptops and linger "i dont want them hanging around for hours " mr kaplan says "but if they come for minutes thats a great thing "
