colleges seek to address affordability as tuition continues to soar some offer more grants ease aid formulas lock in fees as college tuition continues to outpace inflation year after year many schools are experimenting with ways to help more students afford the potentially crippling costs spurred in part by increased competition for the best students a number of colleges have launched new programs for this fall that include freezing tuition offering more grants instead of loans and tinkering with financial aid formulas to reduce the amount families are expected to contribute unlike past aid efforts which mainly helped financially needy students the latest moves also stand to benefit more affluent families many colleges today can afford to be more generous as their endowment coffers are flush from strong stock market gains and they are under pressure to do so as growth in federal financial aid has been dwarfed by rising school costs college costs including tuition fees and living expenses can top &# a year at some private institutions and tuition and fees are expected to rise a further to this year according to the national association of independent colleges and universities

another prestigious college that would have required him and his parents to take out &# in loans "that was definitely too much " says the year old more schools also are starting to give a break to homeowners a group of elite private colleges calling themselves the presidents group after the federal antitrust exception that allows them to set joint aid rules began using a more generous financial aid calculation this year that is expected to reduce the expected contributions for families whose homes have appreciated the group which includes schools such as duke university dartmouth college and the university of pennsylvania had previously asked financial aid officers to count the market value of a house up to times a familys income as an available asset regardless of how large a mortgage the family was carrying starting this fall the schools will count only home equity which is market value minus mortgage debt and cap that at times income it "allows us to focus on the reality of a familys financial strength " says jim belvin dukes financial aid director and chairman of the technical committee for the group stanford university which isnt a member of the group also said recently it would begin capping the amount of home equity assessed in the calculation of a parental contribution to times the family income the move is expected to reduce parental contributions for families
