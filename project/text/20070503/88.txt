shrink to fit as its population declines youngstown thinks small rather than trying to grow ohio city plans more open space youngstown ohio hanging next to city planner bill davignons desk is a giant map of this city divided into neighborhoods one is oak hill a gritty enclave just south of downtown the neighborhood once densely populated has lost of its population in recent decades and is dotted with abandoned buildings and empty lots faced with the devastation of oak hill and other depressed pockets of the city youngstown is trying an unusual approach allow such areas to keep emptying out and in some cases become almost rural unused streets and alleys eventually could be torn up and planted over the city says abandoned buildings could be razed leading to the creation of larger home lots with plenty of green space and new parks youngstown a former steel producing hub has been losing residents for years as a result of the closing of most of its steel mills but rather than struggle to regain its former glory or population it has adopted an economic development plan that boils down to controlled shrinkage by accepting the inevitable the city says it can reduce its housing stock infrastructure and services accordingly the plan is still in its early stages as a first step mr davignon and other city planners have divided youngstown into neighborhoods and labeled them as stable transitional or weak now theyre working on a customized plan for each one noting which corners need street signs which sidewalks need to be repaired and which buildings need to be demolished the goal is to craft plans for about neighborhoods a year another goal is to wipe away the most obvious blight the city estimates it will take about four years to bulldoze the biggest eyesores including about abandoned homes and several hundred old stores schools and other structures "the vision is still evolving but the ultimate result will be to create more open space where there used to be part of the city " says mr davignon talk like that would be considered blasphemy in most cities where officials are taught to promote growth and development and fight against population decline accepting that a city is going to shrink goes against conventional wisdom that a bigger city means more jobs more taxpayers more revenue better education and better services in essence a higher standard of living "its un american it seems like youre doing something wrong if youre not growing " says hunter morrison director of the center for urban and regional studies at youngstown state university who worked with the city to come up with its strategy but he says the idea is "not really about growth or shrinkage its about managing change " the approach is controversial encouraging and accepting the hollowing out of neighborhoods will by default and design hit youngstowns poor and minority residents the hardest about of youngstowns residents are black another hispanic and the blight is heavily concentrated in minority neighborhoods which are slated for the biggest makeovers "you always have to ask yourself what areas are going to be abandoned " says john russo who teaches labor and working class studies at youngstown state "and most of those are the african american parts of the city " youngstown has promised not to force anyone to move which has helped allay some fears in minority neighborhoods others think the idea could be a hard sell "you have to be skeptical because its really hard to do something like this " says frank popper a rutgers university land use planner who studies regions with population declines "the one thing you always run up against is that americans dont want to be told about decline " youngstown which has lost half its population since the s says it needs a radically different approach to halt decay its pointless to try to revive certain neighborhoods the citys leaders argue since the exodus of residents often makes those areas unpleasant and dangerous places to live leading to further decline "the concept of trying to grow out of economic malaise is just not realistic for us " says mayor jay williams years old one of his first official acts after being elected in was to apply surplus money to demolition in the city although youngstown is one of the first cities to openly embrace this philosophy the idea of planning to get smaller is gaining consideration around the world earlier this year the university of california berkeley held a symposium called "the future of shrinking cities" that attracted people from five continents in parts of eastern germany the government has earmarked some &# billion for tearing down communist era prefabricated apartment blocks and replacing them with green space partly in response to an exodus of residents to the west european cities are more experienced with the phenomenon of shrinking urban centers having endured centuries of war and famine that caused many of the regions great cities to fluctuate in size over time a berlin based "shrinking cities" project partly funded by the german government compiles research about urban population loss the group says that during the s more than a quarter of the worlds large cities saw population declines mostly in industrial regions such as eastern germany and the u s heartland but also in japan russia and china where people are moving from remote cities to booming coastal centers "the issue is most visible in cities that are concentrated in a single industry like steel " says philipp oswalt an architect who heads the german project indeed a similar pattern is now being repeated in a host of other midwestern cities including smaller ones such as muncie ind and flint mich which have seen huge shutdowns of auto related plants and subsequent population declines population loss can manifest itself in unexpected places and for a variety of reasons says mr oswalt paris for instance has a vibrant center but is surrounded by rings of industrial suburbs where in some cases population is falling new orleans was radically downsized in a matter of hours by a hurricane and floods the german group has put together a traveling art exhibit on the topic with works from more than artists in countries one film profiles a suburban family moving the remains of a loved one from a city cemetery to a nearby township a painting depicts a neighborhood scene where little remains but a utility pole surrounded by childrens toys the exhibit recently opened in cleveland after a run in detroit two cities grappling with population declines few cities have adopted a plan like youngstowns the city is a classic "hole in the donut" community increasingly empty in the middle but with growing suburbs in youngstowns population stood at the steel industry was booming and city leaders envisioned youngstown growing to a quarter of a million people by the end of the century new neighborhoods were laid out on the fringes of the city in anticipation of growth but by the s the steel industry had gone into a tailspin as producers faced an influx of lower priced foreign made steel today only a single large steel mill is left and the citys population has wilted to about most of the mills have been torn down like other midwest cities youngstown tried to find other big employers to replace steel city officials lured both a state "supermax" prison and a for profit prison other efforts including redeveloping about acres of former steel mill sites into industrial parks have been successful but not the job creating dynamos that steel was youngstown is bisected by the mahoning river a meandering waterway once lined with the mills the city has made some headway in recent years sprucing up downtown buildings while youngstown state located not far from downtown has invested in new buildings and landscaping but population continued to decline and abandoned buildings blighted entire city blocks property and income tax revenue fell and delinquencies rose in city officials decided they had to come up with a new master plan the task was assigned to mr williams then a city planner and now mayor "we came up with a simple concept " he says "this will be a smaller city but that doesnt have to be a bad thing " he doesnt mean physically smaller youngstown will never reduce its overall footprint he says because political boundaries are too deeply ingrained lopping off neighborhoods would likely prompt litigation from residents who dont want to lose city services meanwhile neighboring suburbs arent that interested in annexing youngstowns problems but within the city which sprawls out over square miles there are sizable areas that can be shifted to other uses mr williams says he envisions large blocks of green space throughout the city the theme of the master plan is to make youngstown "clean and green " he says the mayor has sharply increased the citys annual budget for demolition to &# million this year from &# in youngstown is filled with properties that have been essentially abandoned by owners who failed to keep up tax payments the city places liens on the properties it clears to cover the cost of demolition and recently shifted to a policy of trying to negotiate with owners to gain control over such parcels these blurred ownership lines are one of the reasons the city expects it will take years to reshape many neighborhoods "at this stage were focused on clearing decades of blight that had built up " says the mayor tearing things down is relatively easy and is done by many cities much tougher is figuring out creative ways to use vacant land and getting residents to accept a new vision for what it means for their city to prosper with this in mind youngstown in late asked a group of urban planners to come up with design ideas focusing on the oak hill neighborhood planners canvassed the neighborhood asking residents what they would like to see the answers surprised them many city planners for instance favor creating dense developments but many oak hill residents told them something very different "they said that the one thing they liked was that their area was becoming less dense that there was more space between them and their neighbors " says terry schwartz an urban planner from kent state they werent eager to see new housing built either since many long time residents fear new units are almost certain to be low income housing joseph jennings a year old retired steelworker has lived in oak hill since he came to youngstown in the s from west virginia to work in the mills he says he likes the idea of reshaping his neighborhood so its less crowded "itd help hold up the value of the property and make people more willing to invest " he says "its a good thing to spread things out thats the way people like to live nowadays anyway " he built his house nearly years ago buying a double lot so he would have room for a two car garage he notes there are a number of empty lots on his street today norma stefanik an urban designer who lives in one of youngstowns most desirable neighborhoods on the citys north side says more attention should be paid to basics such as using existing building codes to pressure landowners to do a better job of maintaining their properties "a lot could be done just by going after the people who are letting their properties decline " she says rufus hudson an african american councilman who represents youngstowns largely minority east side knows the areas slated for emptying out are mostly occupied by minorities but he says the city cant continue to serve an infrastructure built for a much more densely populated city "our population has fallen steadily " he says "but we still have miles of roads that have to be kept paved and plowed " the forces of demographics are doing much of the clearing for the city mr hudson estimates that within a decade about of the residential streets in his district will be empty enough to allow them to be closed the city has told residents that it will stop investing resources to redevelop certain areas city officials say there are many places where streets could ultimately be dug up street lights taken down and sidewalks removed in order to create green spaces where there were once densely settled blocks while it doesnt have specifics yet the city says it expects certain vacant land to be turned into parks or community gardens another idea already taking place to a limited extent is to take empty parcels on blighted streets and sell them for small amounts to remaining residents so homeowners who have decided to stay would be allowed to expand their yards or even rebuild their houses to spread out over more than one lot the day to day task of planning for a smaller youngstown is handled by mr davignon director of the citys community development agency who works out of an office in a converted post office building downtown "we have to break the downward cycle " he says noting that many people in youngstowns stable neighborhoods are hesitant to invest in their homes because they worry that the blight will eventually engulf them "theres a mindset in youngstown that says its coming my way the blight is moving this way we have to put a stop to that "
