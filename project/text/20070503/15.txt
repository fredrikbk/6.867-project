buying a laptop means more attention to special features special issues arise when you buy a laptop computer most of the major specs i recommended two weeks ago in my annual spring guide to buying a computer hold true for laptops as well as desktops that guide can be found at walt allthingsd com guide but buying a portable involves additional factors so here are some tips for making laptop purchases first you may want to wait to get that new laptop until later this year or early in there are a number of interesting new hardware features coming one is called a "solid state drive " or ssd which replaces the traditional hard disk with a faster drive made of memory chips like those used in digital cameras another is a "hybrid hard drive " or hhd which combines memory chips with a standard hard disk for faster start ups also more and more laptops will be using light emitting diodes or leds to light up their screens a method that promises to be both brighter and less power hungry you also may want to wait for laptops with a new type of wi fi wireless networking built in its called "n " and promises to be faster and to have longer range for windows vista users another new laptop feature coming soon is a small screen on the lid called a sideshow which can display calendar appointments and new emails even if you dont wait there are some features to know about that arent available on most desktops one is a built in web camera and microphone highly useful for making video calls and recording videos to be posted online another is a feature that allows you to play music videos or dvds without booting up windows in addition if you travel a lot you may want something called a built in wwan or wireless wide area network this is essentially a cellphone modem that makes internet connections over a cellular carrier another key feature is a new kind of slot on the side of most laptops for add on cards like wireless modems its called an expresscard slot and confusingly it comes in two sizes your old style cards called pc cards wont fit in these new slots so unless you want to buy new cards you might look for a laptop that has both the old and new slots battery life weight and size remain crucial on laptops unless you are buying a huge "desktop replacement" laptop which will rarely leave the house or be unplugged for everyone else i recommend finding a laptop that offers at least three hours of battery life on a single charge without requiring you to dim the screen so much you cant see anything most laptops cluster around the six to seven pound range which is fine for occasional travel or for carrying between classes or between home and office but if you are a frequent air traveler and have the budget shoot for a laptop that weighs four pounds or less and is small enough to use on a seat tray in coach even when the person in front of you reclines the most expensive laptops are at the extremes huge multimedia machines and ultra portable models for hard core road warriors most well configured windows laptops with typical inch screens are between &# and &# i find that laptops with inch widescreen displays make a nice compromise between mobility and power at the moment there are very few brand name models in that size notably apples &# macbook which weighs pounds and sonys vaio sz line which weighs pounds but costs roughly twice as much more inch models are coming later this year from other manufacturers finally theres the perennial issue of windows versus mac apples two laptop lines the macbook and macbook pro are very good they have better built in software than any windows laptop ive seen and dont suffer from the security issues that plague windows and they can even run windows software if you need that but the mac laptops lack some features that are common on windows portables such as slots for camera memory cards and built in cellular modems and the macbook even lacks an expresscard or pc card slot among windows machines i think sony and lenovo make especially well designed laptops but almost any name brand would be fine addendum im happy to say there is a new expanded and redesigned online home for all my columns its at walt allthingsd com and access is free it contains the current versions of the columns with the accompanying videos plus a searchable two year column archive and a new blog called mossblog which i will update occasionally this new column home page is part of a larger new web site called all things digital at allthingsd com in addition to my columns and blog it contains technology news analysis and opinion from journalists kara swisher katherine boehret and john paczkowski and guest blogs from prominent technology figures my columns will still be published on the journals main web site wsj com which is available to paid subscribers and includes a much larger archive going back more than a decade email me at mossberg wsj com
