murdochs editors know his voice londons times offers glimpse of hands on way the mogul runs his newspaper empire some owners of newspapers seldom if ever speak to their editors rupert murdoch is not one of them to generations of newspaper editors the news corp chairman and chief executives voice is familiar he telephones to pass on news tips or story ideas complain about the tone of the papers coverage or just catch up on gossip mr murdoch grew up around newspapers and even while he runs a vast global media empire has long been famous for his willingness to check layouts and change headlines former editors say "he would point to a picture and say that photo shouldnt be cropped like that " says peter stothard a former editor of the times who still works for news corp as editor of times literary supplement "and you know he was always right " mr murdochs hands on style differs markedly from the traditions of the publisher he now wants to buy the wall street journals parent dow jones &amp co whose controlling shareholder is the bancroft family has long maintained a distance from the companys operations the family which owns of the equity but through supervoting stock has voting control has board representation but no involvement with direct management of the paper while the editorial page has a conservative political viewpoint a strict separation is enforced between the editorial page and the newsroom designed to ensure opinion and news coverage dont mix the bancroft family is steeped in that culture and a sense of pride in the companys long history and independence has led them to endure an often sluggish stock price over the years for that reason how mr murdoch might change the culture of the journal is likely to be an issue as dow jones and the bancrofts consider his bid mr murdoch has taken pains to reassure the family about his intentions in an interview tuesday with his companys fox news channel he noted that the bancroft family "has done a fantastic job as the guardians of this newspaper and its editorial traditions " he added that "we are the sort of people with the same traditions that i think will prove great guardians for this paper " he encountered similar concerns some years ago when he acquired the times of london and sunday times the papers owned by the same company but run by different editorial staffs are venerable institutions in the united kingdom at the time mr murdoch was best known for his tabloid titles the sun in london and the new york post a year after mr murdoch took over the editor he appointed harold evans was forced out after clashing with mr murdoch mr evans went on to write a vitriolic account of his stint at the times in which he accused mr murdoch of eroding the times standards and breaking promises he made to maintain the papers editorial independence contacted via email yesterday mr evans referred a reporter to his book to win control of the times and its sunday sibling mr murdoch made certain promises about retaining the independence of the paper according to mr evanss book "good times bad times " these included a guarantee that "the editors would have control of the political policy of their newspapers and freedom within fixed annual budgets" and "that the editors would not be subject to instruction from either the proprietor or management on the selection and balance of news and opinion " instructions to journalists were to be given "only by their editor " "in my year as editor of the times murdoch broke all these guarantees " mr evans wrote quoting mr murdoch telling a times editor that they were "not worth the paper theyre written on " another example cited by mr evans mr murdoch once told an editor not to worry about whether a cartoon of just assassinated egyptian president anwar sadat was tasteful "we want to sell newspapers print it " mr murdoch has said in the past that harold evanss comments were a "self justifying fantasy " a news corp spokesman said mr murdoch cut costs at the times and his other british newspapers in when he moved production from the center of london to the london docklands in order to avoid printers union rules under news corp s ownership the circulation of the times has increased today the sunday times is britains top selling broadsheet selling about million copies a weekend in mr murdoch converted the sister paper the times to a tabloid size while retaining its relatively sober editorial approach the paper is still losing money according to regulatory filings but has been hiring journalists and expanding its internet operations under the current editor robert thomson he says that the print newsroom staff is about bigger than when he joined in mr thomson and several other current and former senior journalists at the times and sunday times says mr murdoch gives editors wide latitude mr murdoch doesnt tell times editors which political parties to support the former editors say in the last british election the times endorsed prime minister tony blair and the sunday times opposed him in when mr blair came to power the times didnt endorse him even though mr murdoch had publicly praised the labour party leader "the editorial judgments including the errors of judgment are entirely my responsibility " mr thomson said in an email yesterday "readers can see that there is a very clear line between comment and reporting and all of our reporters have the objective of being objective " ken chandler a former editor of the new york post says he felt that mr murdoch had a "positive influence" on the paper "when he made suggestions for stories they were usually good ideas if they turned out to be not a good idea we didnt pursue them " as an example he said mr murdoch in suggested the post profile crime victims in the wake of a new york times series on how prison inmates were suffering "he called up and said to me did you see that piece in the times what about the victims werent their lives ruined why dont you find out " mr chandler said that mr murdoch would sometimes call up to ask why was the post "being so tough on people sometimes it would have been a friend of his " but "i always found if the justification was good that was the end of the story " mr murdoch also has poured resources into the paper andrew neil a former editor of the sunday times says mr murdoch would likely make changes to the journal if his bid was successful "i think he would want the news to be informed by the editorial agenda " he says "he is quite interventionist but he gives more latitude to his quality newspapers than his tabloids he realizes for quality newspapers you cant just hire people you boss around " he adds "to survive you have to be on the same planet as rupert but you dont have to be on the same continent "
