home &amp family cranky consumer hacking down your household bills cost cutting test gets mixed results restoring old plan special to the wsj if youre looking to cut back on household expenses a good place to start is with those nagging bills that never go away for good were living in the age of surreptitious bill creep rising energy prices and our growing collections of gadgets gradually push utility bills higher and extras like text messaging on cellphones digital cable and credit card rewards programs add little fees that nevertheless add up at the same time the internet with sites like lowermybills com is supposed to make it easier to hunt down deals and comparison shop for low prices we looked at five recurring bills our home phone cellphone electricity cable internet and charge card fees to see how much room we had to negotiate a lower rate for our current service or if that didnt work an enhanced package for the rate were already paying at the end of our test we racked up a net savings of &# a year not bad but we hoped for more after negotiating through the tangle of phone trees and inscrutable pricing plans we actually let ourselves be talked into paying more for an upgraded service from one provider and struck out completely with two others on the bright side were no longer completely in the dark about our electric bill after hearing a clear explanation of it for the first time while price comparison web sites claim to offer efficient one stop shopping they didnt always have the best information and lowermybills com always seemed to want more personal information than was necessary for the service we wanted to price for the most part we found it wasnt as important as we expected to be armed with reams of information when we simply asked the companies that had better deals offered them up willingly we got off to an inauspicious start in our cost cutting quest with american express where wed been paying &# a year for multiple cards and access to the points program we checked out the amex web site as well as lowermybills com and creditcardscompare com we saw options that would provide us with similar benefits for a lower fee so we called amex and said we were looking for a better deal in the end we upgraded to a card that costs &# more a year we hope that extra services will let us stretch our dollars which is almost as good as finding a cheaper deal we didnt expect much wiggle room to haggle with consolidated edison for electricity but a mailer offered a fixed instead of a variable rate it turned out that the "fixed rate" referred to the price per kilowatt hour not the total on our bill moreover we learned we were already paying that fixed rate which was cents per kwh the variable rate was only cents but we were told its based on overall demand and usually rises a lot during the summer were not the gambling type so we didnt make a switch we will check back with con ed during the next heat wave to see just how high the variable rate would climb during peak demand time warner our cable tv and internet service provider left us frustrated the pricing information on its web site wasnt clear but to be fair we looked at cablevisions optimum site to compare and found it to be equally bad nevertheless we called time warner and were told we could shave &# off of our bill which had been &# a month if we gave up our sports channels plus bravo boom and we we gave it a shot unfortunately when we turned on our tv later that night we still had all the sports channels and bravo but were missing at least others including bbc america and turner classic movies which we tune in to regularly we called back and found out that part of the savings came from being downgraded to a cheaper and slower internet service and we lost all of our "digital" channels including several favorites the customer service person who explained this offered a level between our old and new services but it would cost &# a month a &# increase exasperated we just restored what wed had before and were given a free month of hbo and showtime as consolation we finally were able to save a bit of money with verizon our home phone provider we had been paying &# for unlimited local regional and long distance service plus home voicemail but we saw an offer on verizons web site for a similar package that was cheaper and included additional services we called and the saleswoman offered us the same plan we had plus home voicemail call waiting and caller id for &# plus the new plan would allow us to store three times as many voicemails getting more and paying less easily made it worth the single phone call when it comes to cellphone use we knocked a few dollars off our bill but we have to chalk it up to a fluke find on the web more than brilliant bargaining tactics we pay verizon wireless &# for minutes a month shared between two phones plus &# a month for the second phone but during a particularly voluble month for us we used only minutes we were anxious to find a more economical plan but couldnt find anything smaller online when we called the phone company the rep confirmed that we already had the least expensive package we could get for two or more phones we thought we were out of luck but checked the companys web site one last time and found an offer for employee discounts for some corporations we used our spouses email address at a fortune company and got an email later that told us we had qualified for a corporate discount of which would knock a little more than &# off of our monthly bill not too shabby write cranky wsj com company service american express charge card fees what we had &# a year for two green cards with a points program what we requested a new card with either lower fees or more benefits what we got more benefits for more money we now pay &# a year a &# increase for two gold cards comment we didnt lower our bill but we hope well get more for our money with the new card company service con edison electricity rates what we had a fluctuating rate for electricity we thought what we requested a fixed rate that might be more economical what we got nothing it turns out we were already paying a fixed rate comment it was worth five minutes on the phone to more clearly understand how were billed well keep an eye on the variable rate in the next few months to see which one really is the better deal company service time warner cable tv internet service www timewarner cable com what we had &# a month for high speed internet and digital cable what we requested a similar package at a lower rate what we got nothing we were offered a lower rate but it curtailed our internet speed and cable channels more extensively than we were told it would so we reverted to our old plan comment we wish time warner would provide better information on its web site and make its prices easier to understand at the least customer service should be able to give accurate information company service verizon home phone service www verizon com what we had &# a month for unlimited local regional domestic long distance plus voice mail what we requested a similar package at a lower rate what we got &# for the same phone service plus voicemail call waiting and caller id comment customer service readily offered the lower price and encouraged us to check in periodically for new deals company service verizon wireless cellphone service what we had &# a month for minutes nationwide plus &# for second phone that shares the minutes what we requested a cheaper package with fewer minutes or a discount through our employer what we got through a deal with our spouses employer well get off the &# plan comment we were disappointed we would have to keep paying for far more minutes than we use but the employee discount we found on our own on the web site helps
