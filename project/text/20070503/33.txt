elitist defense of the gray lady ignores shareholder interests the spirited commentary by washington post chairman donald e graham is the poorest defense of an elitist position since louis xiv "the gray ladys virtue " editorial page april regard for the moment the artificially manipulated price of mr grahams own companys stock kept stratospherically high on a per share basis to discourage wide ownership of same by gasp the "public " mr graham decries the possibility that the new york times abolish its elitist anti democratic ownership and control structure because if it were eliminated "a line of buyers eager to buy it would form within minutes " sacre bleu an open auction of willing buyers competing to buy a poorly managed business that produces an almost great newspaper better they should eat cake no this outrageous defense will no doubt be used more by his enemies than his fellow class b owners i can hear the hedge funders now saying "thank you donald thank you " mr graham and arthur sulzberger jr have alienated much of their natural core constituency and readership regular folks who once understood what these two newspapers represented and why now the gray ladys masthead "all the news thats fit to print" is perhaps better reworded as "like frogs in the pot youll eventually get used to the slant " put bluntly two tiered stock "structures" should be banned if the grahams the sulzbergers and the families controlling dow jones want to have the benefits of uncontested ownership and almost total control then they should join the line asking to buy in and take themselves private geoffrey d batrouney new rochelle n y it was with amused satisfaction that i read donald grahams plea concerning the special status of the new york times and other newspapers for years out here in the wilderness of medical care we have been pointing out that models of health care that focus only on "customers " "providers" and financial endpoints do not fully capture the unique aspects of our industry alas it has been in vain and physicians nurses and other actual providers of care as well as patients have seen more and more actual health care dollars flushed down a potpourri of hmos ppos and other administratively burdensome entities now it appears that another industry is in the sights of those who wish to make their service more efficient yes the vast sums to be made will not go to those of you in the trenches i am sorry to say however i have two recommendations first this change is inevitable so mr graham you might win this battle but the war is already lost second i could give you something to ease your pain but only if your medical plan covers it steven dale boggs m d m b a gaffney s c mr grahams defense of the ownership model of the new york times co is valid only if the sulzbergers are running the company to the benefit of the shareholders to the best of their ability while maintaining their integrity journalistically the many former readers of the times apparently dont see the gray lady as a respectable publication or fewer would be abandoning it why should news consumers respect the times with no boundary between their op ed and their news pages the times is clearly an enterprise that puts ideology above shareholder interests the sulzbergers have forfeited the trust of the shareholders and do not deserve unchecked governance of this publicly traded company steve town erie colo while mr grahams concern for journalistic integrity is admirable he seems to imply that the times should be run as a not for profit corporation as long held by the courts publicly traded companies are not to be run as eleemosynary institutions management thus ignores its fiduciary duties to shareholders if steps can be taken to increase long term profits but are purposely ignored if the times feels that profit maximization is incompatible with its goal of principled journalism then it should take the newspaper private otherwise it should take seriously the concerns of those who contribute capital and drop any notion that only the sulzbergers can preserve the reputation of the times surely such notions are not supported by recent troubles at the newspaper furthermore mr grahams argument that shareholders are aware of the dual class structure upon purchasing stock and can subsequently sell at any time is profoundly unconvincing pardon morgan stanley and other shareholders for wanting to increase returns to their investment by eliminating what they perceive as an unresponsive governance structure mr grahams "wall street walk" argument is nothing new and thankfully has been largely dismissed in the world of modern corporate governance he should not be surprised that shareholder activism has targeted a newspaper perhaps he is less surprised than concerned that the washington post might be next jonathan urick malverne n y
