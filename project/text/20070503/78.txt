oil lubricates asia mideast ties intertwining economies may alter power balance implications for the west riyadh saudi arabia a gathering here of asian and middle east energy ministers has cast a fresh spotlight on how rapidly the petroleum rich persian gulf and energy hungry east asia are intertwining their economies with potentially significant consequences for the international balance of power the asian ministerial energy roundtable which met yesterday surveyed oil demand supply possibilities and energy investment opportunities in asia where explosive economic growth is helping drive the world economy the ministers at the meeting jointly hosted by saudi arabia and japan represent the huge oil exporters of the persian gulf region dubbed west asia by the group and such major consumers from east asia as china south korea and india "we discussed today the need for substantial investment in the whole energy value chain " saudi arabian oil minister ali naimi said at a news conference "the numbers are very substantial " mohamed bin dhaen al hamli oil minister of the united arab emirates and president of the organization of petroleum exporting countries said the arab nations of the persian gulf are spending &# billion on new energy projects from now to the end of the decade alone a significant amount of that funding comes from rising east asian purchases of middle eastern energy supplies as well as from joint energy projects the growing ties have broad implications for western nations as the mideast and east asia gain oil market clout state controlled oil companies particularly in the persian gulf region have taken the lead in developing major new reserves while major western oil producers find access to new supplies increasingly limited where companies and decision makers once focused on events in western energy capitals such as houston new york and london these same players are increasingly concentrating their efforts in places like dubai rising east asian investment in the middle east could prompt burgeoning powers china and india to take a more active interest in trying to stabilize the region while also encouraging middle eastern leaders to look east not just to traditional powers such as washington and moscow as players in the volatile regions diplomacy in middle eastern capitals decisions made in beijing and new delhi could ultimately gain the same heft as decisions made in washington the global nature of the oil market means that all consuming nations likely will benefit from the increased production that results from new investment the u s which has considerable say in oil markets as the worlds no consumer by far also retains major say by virtue of its role as a defensive shield for the saudis asias big oil buyers such as china have no comparable global military presence a reality that will temper asias rising clout in the gulf still the meeting yesterday paves the way for more conciliatory ties between the nations on either end of the asian continent that stands in potential contrast to tensions that have flared occasionally between the middle east and western consuming nations asia already consumes more oil than western europe the asian and persian gulf ministers meeting here in the saudi capital represent more than half the worlds population the majority of its oil and gas reserves and some of the expected rise in world energy demand in decades to come the meeting comes as asian invested joint venture refineries petrochemical plants and gas terminals are popping up all over the region from saudi arabia to japan all of this is made possible by asias exports of goods and services which in turn have created a vast and growing appetite for oil in the region and the gulfs ability to sate it for a price "its a global virtuous loop" of investment said william ramsay deputy executive director of the paris based international energy agency which monitors oil on behalf of industrialized nations saudi arabias mr naimi said two thirds of oil exports from west asia including saudi arabia and iran go to east asia and these shipments account for of east asias crude oil imports in saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter some of crude oil shipments or million barrels a day now head east to south asia and east asia the kingdom has been signing deals to deliver even more oil to voracious energy consumers such as china and india even as it expands oil output and invests in refineries at home and abroad "the show is not over yet " prince abdel aziz bin salman saudi arabias deputy oil minister said at a news conference tuesday the roundtable gathering he said allows the participants to "know the future plans of each party" in the talks the huge amounts of money that east asia pays for its rapidly rising oil use are in part being recycled to finance a burst of economic activity in the gulf saudi arabia the largest economy in the persian gulf is undertaking in the next few years projects valued at some &# billion just this week metals titan alcan inc based in montreal signed a &# billion agreement to jointly develop a huge aluminum complex in the kingdom more than &# billion is being spent by the saudis on expanding oil production and on joint venture refineries with japans sumitomo chemical co frances total sa conocophillips and exxon mobil corp of the u s china petroleum &amp chemical corp or sinopec and others at a formal dinner welcoming the ministers the saudi hosts paid homage to the contiguous regions diverse cuisines with a succession of dishes ranging from persian rice to japanese soba noodles the increasing links between the gulf and asia could have deep geopolitical ramifications the middle east asian romancing at these roundtable conferences this is the second after an inaugural meeting in new delhi in contrasts with the hostility and suspicion between opec and the west in the oil crisis ridden s that standoff resulted in the creation of the iea whose primary purpose is to protect the rich countries of the west from supply crises by sharing emergency hoards of oil in the past decade to be sure relations between the iea and opec have improved significantly and both organizations were represented at this meeting but china and india whose combined oil use is already two thirds the western european total arent members of either the iea or of opec the asian ministerial roundtable provides a forum for these two countries to sit face to face with their major suppliers and consider their mutual energy future together
