politics &amp economics republicans hit health care rift bush shift on childrens insurance leaves some candidates cold washington providing health insurance for poor children is an issue that has dogged president bush from his days as texas governor to these years late in his white house term when he is facing a democratic congress eager to expand coverage to more families who cant afford it the issue will come to the fore again this summer in a tug of war over the future of the state childrens health insurance program a federal block grant program that complements medicaid coverage of the very poor created in the wake of overhauling welfare in the late s "s chip" targets the children of working families just above the poverty line and has grown to be immensely popular and more costly as well after being pummeled with criticism during his white house run that he had been slow to help to uninsured children in texas mr bush set about as president to make his mark on s chip early the new administration aggressively encouraged states to experiment and even to cover parents if that helped sign up children enrollment rose by almost a third under then health and human services secretary tommy thompson another former governor from wisconsin records indicate that in its first six years the bush administration approved close to two dozen waivers giving states greater flexibility such as expanding eligibility with the federal funds but now with s chip up for extension in october mr bush has changed course most independent analysts agree that his fiscal budget wont cover the cost of s chips current enrollment and program coverage for adults would be rolled back in about a dozen states administration officials concede the budget is also an ideological statement that too much government support risks crowding out private sector insurance alternatives mr bush wants to promote but by not providing greater funding for s chip the white house risks sacrificing credibility in one of the biggest health care policy debates this year most striking is the juxtaposition between mr bushs latest stance and the republican presidential field which includes several former governors former arkansas gov mike huckabee won a waiver for his state to begin a still fledgling program covering adults "i think its a terrible idea to do that " he says of efforts to tighten the rules to exclude parents "if you stabilize that childs family you are helping the child were not exactly doing anything good for kids where their parents cant get coverage " "i support the program " says mr thompson the former hhs secretary now trying to mount an underdog presidential campaign in iowa "we approved a lot of waivers " he recalls one went to massachusetts when yet another presidential contender mitt romney was governor there "current funding issues with the s chip program including any changes in the formula should be dealt with by congress " mr romney says and arizona home to sen john mccain already covers about parents under an s chip waiver the mccain presidential campaign is considering a proposal to greatly expand s chip nationally by allowing automatic enrollment for any child who meets the same income tests applied in the federal school lunch program medicaid director dennis smith sees no contradiction between the presidents budget and earlier waivers he said states were warned that they could expand aid eligibility only as far as their annual federal allotment would carry them hhs also notes that there is more money in the system than it now appears because some states havent spent all their grants at the heart of the fight is not surprisingly money washington actually provides a more generous federal match than it does for medicaid the state federal entitlement program for the poor the percentages vary but a state paying a share under medicaid might only pay under s chip the second reality is that covering children has become ever more attractive politically as the number of uninsured americans rises major business lobbies have joined coalitions with labor groups this year to run ads supporting more funding for s chip virtually every democratic health plan offered in congress begins with some expansion of the program the danger is that the two sides will fail to engage and be unable to deal effectively with a program that will always need fine tuning just as the presidents budget appears to underfund s chip democrats are accused of overreaching in wanting to add as much as &# billion to the program over the next five years s chips initial slow growth hid its financial problems for a time states that outspent their allotment could tap into unused funds but aggregate spending now exceeds available federal funds leading some states with shortfalls to ask washington to make up the difference with republicans controlling congress lawmakers provided an additional &# million to cover s chips shortfall last year this fiscal year with democrats in the majority congress is proposing to cover an estimated &# million shortfall part of the confusion about s chip spending results from enrollment estimates that fluctuate widely depending on how the numbers are counted if enrollment is measured for a fixed month from year to year the number is close to four million but if all participants are counted including everyone who goes in and out of the program in the course of a year the cumulative total in was million according to the government accountability office the house energy and commerce committee expects to take up the issue in june and democrats have set their sights on covering as many as six million more children and teenagers who qualify but arent yet covered it will be a major test of new "pay go" rules requiring that any new spending be matched by new revenue or cost savings to keep the package deficit neutral given the presidents posture democrats fear it will be that much harder to get the bipartisan cooperation needed to make these tough budget decisions watching from wisconsin is the states medicaid director jason helgerson "states that cover adults have higher success rates in signing up their kids " he says but without the extra s chip funds to help cover his states adults wisconsin would face &# million more in annual costs "were concerned about anything done at the federal level that impacts our ability to cover uninsured families " he said
