capital how an emerging market trend may ease volatility a decade ago when financial crisis spread from thailand to indonesia to korea to russia to brazil one common thread was that emerging market economies had done a lot of borrowing in dollars sharp declines in their exchange rates increased the burden of paying back debts measured in baht rupiah and won painful tax increases cuts in government spending sharply higher interest rates and corporate bankruptcies ensued emerging market countries inability to borrow abroad in their own currencies has been dubbed "original sin" by economists barry eichengreen ricardo hausmann and urgo panizza they have argued it is a major reason that developing country economies are more volatile and crisis prone than the u s europe and japan which long have borrowed in their own currencies a lot has not changed in the past years the tendency of investors to assume that todays trends will continue indefinitely for instance one thing that has changed is that emerging market governments and corporations increasingly are borrowing in their own currencies and that should make their economies more stable emerging market governments had &# billion in home currency debt outstanding when the crisis hit in last year they had &# trillion according to the bank for international settlements the central bank for central bankers companies in those countries had &# billion of home currency debt in last year they had &# trillion a lot of those bonds are held by emerging market citizens who save in the currency they earn available data reveal the currency in which debt is denominated not the nationality of the debt holder but in the past two years foreign investors have become active buyers of local currency debt j p morgan chase now calculates indexes for emerging market debt issued in local currencies the market capitalization of such debt available to foreign investors stood at &# billion at the start of excluding china india and others with capital controls or other hurdles for foreign buyers why and is this redemption from original sin or is it a passing moment likely to vanish when financial market sentiment shifts the fact that poland and brazil can borrow billions in zlotys and reals reflects a confluence of forces foreign investors traditionally feared that an inflation prone debtor could simply print more of its own currency if it had trouble paying its debts so they insisted on being paid back in dollars or euros thats still a risk but low inflation rates around the world make it less of a concern the virulent high inflation rates that often triggered sharp currency devaluations have vanished and low interest rates in many developed countries have led global investors to take more risk to get higher hoped for returns or borrow in low rate countries like japan and invest in higher rate emerging markets at the same time financial markets have evolved "the growth in derivatives markets and credit default swaps means that you can better cover exchange rate risk and credit event risk market jargon for defaulting on debts internationally than in the past " says vincent truglia who oversees sovereign risk ratings at moodys investors service and emerging market economies are stronger their government budgets are in better shape many are running trade surpluses the move toward flexible exchange rates has reduced the proclivity for economy shaking crises countries from south africa to mexico to the philippines have been buying back dollar denominated debt and replacing it with local currency bonds and their successful companies are getting better at global finance from wall street to academia there are differences on how much of this reflects the kindness of global economic conditions and how much lasting changes "perhaps the market may be a little exuberant " says university of chicago economist raghuram rajan "but there are fundamentals that have helped when its easy to borrow easy to finance these countries look very healthy " but some of this reflects structural changes that should withstand the next economic storm joyce chang j p morgans head of emerging markets says flatly "i dont think its at all transitory " among other things the rise of pension funds insurance companies and mutual funds in latin america eastern europe and asia creates an appetite for local currency bonds this growing base of local investors brings demand and depth to markets that once had very little that in turn makes foreign investors more comfortable global financial markets wont remain placid forever some emerging market country will default and remind global investors that they arent demanding enough for taking risks all investment fads end but some of the right lessons have been drawn from the crisis this is one of them the eagerness and ability of emerging markets to borrow in their own currencies makes life a little less treacherous for the people who live in those countries and that is a good thing
