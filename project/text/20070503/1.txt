pretty boy vs golden boy boxing is on the ropes these days the last fight in which there was a real buzz about it was lewis versus tyson in there have been epic contests since then but nothing to capture that all important crossover fan the football or baseball fanatic who is otherwise indifferent to boxing but will occasionally plug in for a bout of very special interest heavyweights have traditionally been the magnets to attract nonboxing enthusiasts however that division is in chaos today with four title holders worse yet with the emergence of mixed martial arts as the fastest growing spectator sport in america professional pugilism is now facing staunch competition for the attention of those with a taste for personal combat boxing in short needs a big fight badly and it has one in saturdays wbc super welterweight title tilt between champion oscar de la hoya and floyd mayweather the bout which will be shown on hbo pay per view has been vigorously promoted with a nationwide tour by the fighters and a slick hbo documentary miniseries " " that follows the camp preparations of both boxers a great fight is one that casts a set of questions and as boxing star sugar shane mosely told me "this bout will answer all kinds of issues can size and power de la hoya conquer speed mayweather is oscar too old is mayweather really that good " the younger and smaller man mr mayweather is years old and wbc welterweight champion hes been undefeated in professional contests has held world titles in four weight divisions and is widely recognized as the best pound for pound boxer in the world today always in condition the former olympian has hypersonic hand speed and is so difficult to hit that his amateur ring mates gave him the moniker "pretty boy floyd " because scarcely anyone could lay a glove to his face when i asked the grand rapids mich native how he developed his matchless ability to avoid blows he said with a laugh that "its just the mayweather brand of defense " though not very revealing he was right mr mayweather hails from a family of highly skilled technical boxers his father floyd and his fathers brothers roger and jeff were elite professionals and had elements of the current champs method the basics of the mayweather defense include using a lot of feints dipping left and right keeping your weight back your right hand high your left shoulder turned in slightly and your chin tucked behind it freddy roach mr de la hoyas current trainer adds "floyd has great vision in the ring and so can see punches coming " this enables a boxer to roll with a blow and dissipate its impact on the offense side mr mayweather is a pinpoint counter puncher with good power he is also adept at luring his opponents out of position if there is an eyebrow that might be raised it is in the fact that he has not faced the caliber of opposition that has been common fare for mr de la hoya whose win loss record stands at the golden boy as mr de la hoya has been known since he won a gold medal in the olympics is a six time world champion who has fought virtually every well known fighter in the pound vicinity at mr de la hoya is fast and packs one of the most potent left hooks in the game he has superb balance i once watched him fire off straight punches without losing his legs as muhammad alis former trainer angelo dundee noted "oscar is always in great shape and he is a thinker who knows how to adapt in the ring " mr de la hoya still has the looks of a choir boy but when he climbs through the ropes he does battle in a controlled fury he confided "this fight is the most personal one that i have ever been in mayweather and i did an city promotional tour and by the end of the first stop his constant insults and disrespect really got under my skin " mr mayweather is dismissive of both mr de la hoyas ability and his grit he insists that the bout which will take place at the mgm grand in las vegas will be an easy victory and because of his youth quickness and command of his craft most boxing experts agree that mr mayweather will win though the bout has yet to hit the voltage of hagler versus leonard it sold out the seat arena in three hours ross greenburg the president of hbo sports noted "there have only been two nonheavyweight fights to pull in over one million pay per view buys they both involved de la hoya this fight is sure to hit that mark and may go well beyond it " in addition to the fascinating matchup there are some spicy subtexts to this competition both boxers grew up in difficult financial straits and are the sons of fathers who were fanatical about making them world champions mr de la hoya can recall being dragged out of a baseball game as a young boy so that he could get in his boxing workout in mr mayweathers case his father floyd mayweather sr was incarcerated for a few years when he was a boy but not before he made his son a highly accomplished student of boxing in the hbo miniseries " " floyd mayweather jr revealed that his father was very strict and would bang him around for mistakes he made in the ring he says "i was afraid of my father until i was in my early s " but when questioned about his martinet parenting tactics the elder mayweather shrugs and points to his boxing product now a boxing guru floyd mayweather sr had been mr de la hoyas trainer for the past six years indeed mr de la hoya told me that it was only when he took on his current opponents father as a cornerman that he began to absorb some of the more subtle points of boxing defense for the unheard of sum of &# million floyd sr offered to train mr de la hoya for the bout with floyd jr but thinking the arrangement too psychologically complicated mr de la hoya rejected the deal much to the chagrin of his father floyd jr has elected to continue training with his uncle roger also the history of boxing reverberates with moans about promoters exploiting boxers but in this case one of the principals namely mr de la hoya is also the president of and principal stockholder in the company promoting the bout in oscar de la hoya and richard schaefer formed golden boy promotions boxers shane mosely bernard hopkins and marco antonio barrera signed on as part owners and executives to the surprise of many insiders golden boy promotions immediately established itself as a major player in the boxing promotion game to avoid any appearance of impropriety on saturday night both the officials and mr mayweather will be paid by a third party company namely don chargrin promotions even if mr de la hoya takes his lumps in the bout golden boy promotions is sure to come out in fine fettle for having promoted the first mega boxing event in five years mr marino is a professor in the college of health and human performance at the university of florida
