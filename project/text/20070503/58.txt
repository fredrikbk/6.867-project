mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i am concerned about security on my laptop when traveling and using nonsecure internet connections available at motels is there a way to be secure when accessing my financial web sites while using a motels connection a you can install a good firewall and sweep your laptop with security software for spyware and other malicious software that might transmit passwords and you can make sure you are using antiphishing software better yet you could use a sort of private internet tunnel called a virtual private network or a remote control service like gotomypc so you are actually using your home pc remotely to contact the web sites involved but the bottom line is that unless you are on a network that you can control and secure such as a home or office network i wouldnt advise accessing financial accounts online or performing financial transactions i wouldnt trust sensitive online transactions to any public internet connection such as those at motels there are too many people including other guests the motel staff and the people at the company that provides the motels internet service who could potentially be watching what you are doing q is there a cellular phone that can be taken abroad that has a good email capability for a comfortable price a that depends on what youd consider "good" email capability or what price would be "comfortable" for you it also depends on what countries youre heading for but in general any blackberry or treo that works with the at&amp t formerly cingular or t mobile networks here in the u s will work in europe and in many other regions and both have what i consider good email capabilities for the price which can vary depending on model and be as low as &# q in general we love our new macbook laptop but there is one thing were not sure how to work around we find that there are some web sites that dont seem to work well with the built in safari browser and on some sites we are unable to play a video is there a solution a yes for the web pages that dont work well with safari you can download and use as an alternative the firefox browser which comes in a mac version that is essentially identical to its windows version you can get firefox which is free at mozilla com the videos that wont play were likely produced in the latest version of microsofts windows media format microsoft offers free software that allows these videos to play on a mac its called flipmac and can be downloaded at www microsoft com windows windowsmedia player wmcomponents mspx
