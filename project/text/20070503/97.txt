the evening wrap dutch rumble barclays and abn amro holdings are seeking to join forces in what would be the biggest bank deal ever but the proposed megamerger has just collided with a megaobstacle after a court put a key component of the combination on ice the dutch enterprise chamber informed abn amro today that it "forbids" the company from pursuing its current agreement to sell the chicago based lasalle banking business to bank of america for &# billion the proceeds from the sale would help finance the barclays deal however a group of dutch holders had hauled abn into court earlier this week arguing that the lasalle proposal should have been subject to a vote by shareholders and today the court agreed "we believe it is unacceptable that a part of abn amro is sold without making sure that a general assembly can discuss this " the court said the shareholders that sued the company argued that the lasalle sale had been engineered with a single purpose frustrating any potential challengers to barclays but if that was the goal the courts ruling undermines it indeed chances are now substantially higher that a competing proposal from a consortium of banks including royal bank of scotland fortis and santander central hispano will find a toehold a barclays spokesman said the bank was keeping a stiff upper lip and pressing on with its stock offer which is valued at &# billion abn didnt comment it has been difficult to hear from anyone outside the boardrooms at barclays and abn who seemed thrilled with their proposed tie up especially after the rbs consortium popped onto the scene with an offer worth very nearly &# billion with abn apparently turning up its nose at what many shareholders perceive as a much more generous offer relations between management and the companys public holders have moved quickly from being merely testy to something more hostile british activist investor christopher hohn asked the companys chairman to fire chief executive officer rijkman groenink at once charging in a one page letter this week that mr groenik was "disregarding" the interests of shareholders during the deal talks a majority of shareholders urged abn to break itself up and in addition to the dutch complaint another lawsuit filed by shareholders in new york complained that the deals with barclays and bank of america are one sided and should be scrapped the heat seemed to get to abn this week when mr groenik penned a letter to the rbs led consortium asking that it provide more information about its offer abn could also be facing a legal struggle with bank of america if the lasalle deal ends up getting scuttled "we have a binding contract and intend to take all necessary steps to protect our legal rights " bank of america spokesman scott silvestri said the financial services giant had earlier indicated that it views it pact with abn as airtight bank of america is no greenhorn when it comes to deal making having grown into the second largest bank behind only citigroup in terms of market value through a series of mergers and acquisitions kenneth lewis bank of americas chairman and ceo has already traveled to chicago to meet with some
