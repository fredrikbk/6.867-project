ibms latest chip advance cuts power usage international business machines corp unveiled a new way of developing semiconductor chips that permits significantly lower power consumption and smaller size ibm said the technique involves growing chips with tiny airless holes that serve as vacuums these vacuums insulate the wires that run through the holes in the chips better than the silicon materials used for insulation insulating the minute wires in semiconductors is crucial because electrical leaks from one wire to another can create false signals reducing leaks would save energy consumption by ibm said while substituting vacuums for silicon allows for smaller wires and less insulation space john kelly ibms senior vice president of technology said "this is the advent of a new era " because it is the first time a chip maker has been able to grow nano scaled parts that are only a few atoms wide by stimulating materials to form a natural pattern of tiny holes such small dimensions have proved difficult to create with the photo lithography techniques generally used to make semiconductors mr kelly said the chips are likely to start appearing in ibms most powerful computers in he said they will be licensed to its semiconductor partners including advanced micro devices inc a maker of intel compatible microprocessors and toshiba corp he declined to discuss other licensing plans the technology development was led by daniel edelstein one of ibms engineering fellows who has pioneered a number of semiconductor breakthroughs in the past decade including the industrys migration to copper wiring from aluminum a decade ago mr edelstein said he isnt aware of any development teams in industry or academia that took ibms approach of growing material full of holes to create the vacuum insulator around the wires he said there have been academic papers about using vacuums as insulators
