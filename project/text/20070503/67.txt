north korea time its been two and a half weeks since the day deadline passed on april for north korea to comply with the first part of the nuclear accord reached in february that includes shutting down the yongbyong nuclear reactor letting in u n inspectors and providing a list of all nuclear programs but so far no word from pyongyang and nothing from beijing or washington either president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice both recently claimed their "patience" is not "endless " contrary to all available evidence meanwhile another north korean deadline has been allowed to lapse on january united nations secretary general ban ki moon ordered an "external inquiry" into all u n programs in north korea including the united nations development fund unicef the world food program and the u n population fund mr bans announcement followed our report on irregularities in undp programs in north korea and u s concerns that tens of millions of dollars in hard currency were funneled to dictator kim jong il mr ban imposed a day deadline for the audit but it appears to be lost somewhere in the u n bureaucracy the auditors spent two weeks in march at undp headquarters in new york interviewing staff and looking at the books but they have yet to set foot in north korea much less file a report oh and the "independent" and "external" audit mr ban ordered is being conducted by the u n s own board of auditors consisting of a team from south africa france and the philippines we had a challenge gathering even these details the board of auditors refuses to talk to the press the undp understandably feels it lacks standing to comment on an investigation of itself and mr bans press office cant seem to get the facts straight first telling us the auditors were in korea and then informing us they werent youd think someone at the u n would show more interest in explaining one of the bosss priorities to the public it will be interesting to see how kim jong il responds if the auditors get around to asking for visas the dictator recently told the last two undp officials left in pyongyang to get out the undp suspended operations there in march after our reports and after the kim government refused to let aid officials visit the projects they fund mr ban is staying mum on the missed u n deadline but on the evidence so far kim can be forgiven if he concludes that the world isnt serious about enforcing any of its deadlines concerning north korea see related letter "letters to the editor ban asked probe of u n activities in north korea" wsj may
