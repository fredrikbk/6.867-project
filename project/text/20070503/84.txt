some nonfinancial firms may get bank charters washington a compromise may be in the works to allow some companies outside the financial services arena to win special banking charters but the deal would leave out retail giants such as wal mart stores inc and home depot inc the house financial services committee approved legislation yesterday that would prevent retailers and other commercial firms from owning industrial banks but before the voice vote committee chairman rep barney frank d mass said he would consider allowing some commercial firms to own limited purpose banking charters when negotiations begin with the senate industrial banks are chartered by states but must have federal deposit insurance which means their applications are subject to approval by the federal deposit insurance corp the fdic has agreed not to approve new applications until jan so congress has time to debate the issue sen robert bennett r utah a senior republican on the senate banking committee and an industrial bank supporter said he was cheered by mr franks remarks more than half of the industrial banks in operation have headquarters in utah and make up a large segment of that states financial services industry "based less on the language of the bill than on the comments of the chairman i think there is a possibility that a deal can be made " mr bennett said in an interview wal mart applied for an industrial bank charter in so it could process credit cards and other payments without having to outsource those transactions critics said wal mart was trying to gain a foothold that would allow it to offer banking products after two years of delay the company withdrew its bid in march home depot which has an application before the fdic has argued it should be allowed to own the same type of bank already owned by companies such as target corp "we oppose the bill and remain hopeful that commercial firms will continue to be allowed to own bank charters " a home depot spokesman said the possible exception mr frank mentioned is likely to benefit auto companies some of which already use industrial bank charters to help finance loans for customers toyota motor corp bmw ag and volkswagen ag already hold such charters as so called industrial loan corporations or ilcs daimlerchrysler ag and ford motor co have applied for the charters but the fdic hasnt ruled on their bids "one of the things i believe should emerge once this bill comes to the senate is almost certainly some agreement to allow a limited form of self financing ilc for some other entities " mr frank said during debate the issue of whether commercial firms should be allowed to own industrial banks has emerged as one of the most divisive financial services policy questions in washington critics have argued that allowing commercial firms to own banks presents a dangerous mixture of banking and commerce possibly putting the federal deposit insurance system at risk if a commercial firm fails supporters argue that these charters have operated safely for years and offer consumers more choice typically one or two lawmakers wouldnt be able to stop legislation on their own but because of the way senate rules work and because of mr bennetts seniority he has stood as a huge obstacle to legislation in the past
