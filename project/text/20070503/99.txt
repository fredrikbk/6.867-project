business day sign up for the e mail here the chinese courtship of persian gulf oil producers in recent years has only been the most obvious manifestation of growing energy ties between the middle east and far east which were the subject of a meeting co hosted yesterday by saudi arabia and japan the geopolitical implications of the trend could be seen in the nomenclature of the riyadh ministerial meeting which dubbed the gulf states "west asia " among eastern attendees were china south korea and india whose long growing manufacturing and export prowess have helped fuel a vast regional appetite for oil and gas and they are among the eastern countries whose energy purchases provide a significant amount of the &# billion in new energy projects that opec members plan between now and the end of the decade as the wall street journal notes they have also entered into joint ventures in the gulf region where state controlled energy companies have been taking the lead in developing new reserves at a time when western petroleum firms are having a tougher time finding new supplies the journal adds this has already seen the oil business focus migrate from the likes of houston and london to places like dubai and with it companies like the oil services provider halliburton but the repercussions are as much political as corporate "rising east asian investment in the middle east could prompt burgeoning powers china and india to take a more active interest in trying to stabilize the region while also encouraging middle eastern leaders to look east not just to traditional powers such as washington and moscow as players in the volatile regions diplomacy " the journal says "in middle eastern capitals decisions made in beijing and new delhi could ultimately gain the same heft as decisions made in washington " few petro political decisions in the middle east are made without consideration of iran which has been the subject of speculation that saudi production increases and potential oil price declines were partly aimed at undercutting iranian wealth and influence and iran too has broadened its ties to the east even beyond the energy deals with china that havent hurt its cause at the u n security council last month iran became a significant financial backer of a new malaysian oil pipeline aimed at helping shippers avoid the crowded malacca strait as the financial times then reported the rising east asian influence in the middle east comes at a time when u s influence there has been on the wane in large part due to the war in iraq oil in that country seems increasingly the source of discord rather than stability yesterday oil minister hussein al shahristani said a draft law on the national sharing of oil revenues approved by the cabinet in february was finally submitted to parliament the redistribution of oil revenue is a major pillar of u s aspirations for pacifying iraqs violent sectarian divisions but as the washington post notes the draft law sets up "potentially bitter negotiations" over how to share the wealth and who controls the petroleum infrastructure kurdish and sunni arab officials expressed what the new york times calls deep reservations about the oil legislation and kurds especially dont want to give up management of some northern assets to a state run enterprise va bonuses despite healthcare shortfall officials at the department of veterans affairs received hefty bonuses that ranged up to &# just months after the agency experienced an embarrassing budgetary shortfall of &# billion that put military veterans health care in peril according to a list of the bonuses obtained by the associated press "among those receiving payments were a deputy assistant secretary and several regional directors who crafted the vas flawed budget for based on misleading accounting " the ap reports "also receiving a top bonus was the deputy undersecretary for benefits who helps manage a disability claims system that has a backlog of cases and delays averaging days in getting benefits to injured veterans " justice probes politics of prosecutor hiring members of congress from both parties have expressed puzzlement at why monica goodling a former aide to attorney general alberto gonzales cited the fifth amendments protection against self incrimination when refusing to testify about the firing of eight u s attorneys last year her reasons may be getting clearer the justice department itself is now looking into whether ms goodling violated federal law by using the political affiliation of applicants when deciding who to hire as career prosecutors the wall street journal reports the department has denied partisan politics played a role in the firing of the u s attorneys a process in which ms goodling as mr gonzaless white house liaison played a role but while u s attorneys are de facto political appointees justice department policy and federal law ban political considerations from the process of hiring or firing assistant u s attorneys who are career employees the journal notes the new probe into ms goodlings actions signal that the original department inquiry into the fired u s attorneys has expanded into new territory the washington post adds on a related front the senate judiciary committee yesterday issued subpoenas to mr gonzales seeking all emails he received from white house political czar karl rove that relate to the dismissals and in a letter to the attorney general sen patrick leahy the committees democratic chairman criticized the department "for not being responsive to congressional requests for information " the hill reports blaming that sneeze on global warming the latest possible victims of global warming its allergy sufferers according to a growing body of scientific evidence that suggests climate change is tied to what the wall street journal calls "the dramatic rise in allergies and asthma in the western world " higher levels of carbon dioxide have been found to "turbocharge" plant growth including for example ragweed the main cause of autumn hay fever the journal reports the next report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change due out in august plans to address the issue and will likely say the higher temperatures and carbon dioxide levels blamed on greenhouse gases "have increased the abundance of pollen known to trigger allergies and worsen asthma " the journal says "it will also conclude that spring when allergy causing tree pollen is at peak levels has been arriving to days earlier over the past three decades a trend expected to continue in coming years " the upside of global warming the new york times adds is that gardeners are enjoying wider plant hardiness zones and longer growing seasons that have produced palm trees in knoxville tenn and subtropical camellias in pennsylvania "but horticulturists warn that it is shortsighted to view this as good news " the times says "warmer temperatures help pests as well as plants and studies have shown that weeds and invasive species receive a greater boost from higher levels of carbon dioxide a heat trapping gas than desirable plants do poison ivy becomes more toxic ragweed dumps more pollen and kudzu the fast growing vine that has swallowed whole woodlands in the south is creeping northward " le debate she needed to prove she was presidential he needed to show he wasnt a monster last nights debate between the two candidates to succeed frances jacques chirac gave socialist segolene royal and conservative nicolas sarkozy a chance to achieve those aims but while their sometimes fiery exchange made for compelling television it wasnt clear whether they succeeded ms royal was aggressive from the start while mr sarkozy tried at first to take a measured and calm approach as the financial times notes but her strategy of all out attack left him little choice but to turn aggressive as well even as "her longwinded and often emotional argument" might have undermined her goal as the times of london put it the debate and it was true debate with little interference from the refereeing news anchors focused on domestic policy security the hour workweek and public spending for police and hospitals as the new york times reports ms royals policy gaffes earlier in the campaign and the polls that show her trailing mr sarkozy had helped lower expectations for her performance but as newsweek says the consensus may be that she held her own which wouldnt seem enough to overcome mr sarkozys advantage still the debate which drew million viewers as much as a major sporting event as le figaro notes didnt hurt her with one key voter francois bayrou the centrist candidate eliminated in the first round of voting but whose of the ballots gave him influence questioned by le monde after the debate mr bayrou said he probably wont make an endorsement before sundays final round but he added "i wont vote for sarkozy " also of note washington post a virulent
