the shadow candidates tonight republicans go on stage to trade sound bites in a debate at the reagan library in los angeles but a lot of media oxygen is being used up by the "noncandidate candidates" those who might want to be president but havent yet officially jumped into the race in every election some conventional wisdom is swept aside be it that third party candidates cant influence the race ross perot won of the popular vote in that sitting presidents have to wait for their opposing party to pick a candidate bill clinton ran negative ads more than a year before the election and went on to be the first democrat to win re election since fdr in or that an internet based campaign cant threaten an establishment candidate howard dean surged if briefly past everyone in conventional wisdom is only right until it turns out to be wrong this year the assumption that the best way to run for president is to well run for president might go by the boards everyone agrees on the negatives of being a noncandidate rivals scoop up cash campaign talent and endorsements while noncandidates sit and wait but for the already well known there are advantages to being "outside the ring " while official candidates are scrutinized relentlessly for gaffes and battered by "independent" opposition groups noncandidates can be selective in their media exposure and appear high minded playing hard to get also creates allure and curiosity today noncandidates appeal to both parties depending on the poll between one third and three fifths of republicans are dissatisfied with their current crop of candidates last month a straw poll at the oklahoma republican partys convention saw noncandidates fred thompson and newt gingrich top the field with a majority of the votes between them democrats are more happy with their field but persistent doubts about hillary clintons electability or barack obamas seasoning fuels speculation that al gore or some other savior will enter the race mr gingrich is touring the country touting his ideas without the scrutiny and legal constraints that an official candidates fund raising team would get his aim is to offer "solutions so compelling that if voters say i have to be the president it will happen " he will make up his mind in september but in the meantime his audiences are larger his influence greater and his exposure on tv even more ubiquitous the same is true for mr gore only a noncandidate could get the praise and royal treatment he enjoyed testifying before congress in march this summer he is both losing weight and keeping his name in the headlines by promoting his new book and environmentally themed rock concerts even if he doesnt win the nobel peace prize this fall he could parachute into the presidential race he has trained thousands of people to present his global warming film in every state a cast of supporters who could easily be converted into campaign volunteers a quinnipiac poll of three battleground states shows that mr gore polls better against leading republicans than either mrs clinton or mr obama mr thompson whose movies and network appearances are a fixture on tv screens is clearly being helped for now by not being part of the candidate pack the day after tonights gop debate he will appear before a large gop audience in orange county miles south of the reagan library c span and cnn will cover the event live his solo act may get as many viewers as tonights debate pollsters john zogby and doug schoen both agree that mr thompson could shake up the gop race another candidate who could transform the race is popular new york mayor mike bloomberg a client of mr schoens he has already told friends he could easily spend &# million of his own money on an independent run and could snap up middle of the road voters from both parties whoever runs looking over this years shadow candidates it is clear that they are changing the rules of american politics "americans love having more choices " says peter brown an analyst with the quinnipiac poll "theyll now even give noncandidates a real look to see if theres something there theyre missing in the others " in blogger mickey kaus refined the feiler faster thesis which holds that though news cycles are constantly getting faster "people are comfortable processing that information with what seems like breathtaking speed " this rapid pace may be transforming presidential politics voters arent waiting for pundits to tell them who is running for president and shadow candidates can run low cost guerilla campaigns using the internet talk shows and word of mouth "candidates have been running so long already it opens up opportunities for late entries " says glenn reynolds of instapundit com "we may not like it but voter boredom may now be a driver of politics " modern presidential campaigns started in when the first kennedy nixon debate established the primacy of television this upcoming race could mark similar dramatic changes in the pace shape and tone of elections to come mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
