home &amp family breast cancer fall gets focus case drop preceded hormone changes test decline is cited a much debated decline in breast cancer cases which many experts attributed to a drop off in hormone use actually started nine years ago well before the recent hormone changes according to a new report from the american cancer society at the same time use of mammography has declined in recent years the researchers note so while some of the cancer decline is likely attributable to a drop off in hormones one big culprit may be the fact that fewer women are getting screened the findings reported in the medical journal breast cancer research suggest that thousands of cancers may be going undetected that means many of these cancers could still show up eventually but at a later more deadly stage according to the acs researchers the data add to the increasingly confusing breast cancer puzzle and raise new questions about the impact that menopause hormones mammography screening rates and other changes have had on the number of cancers diagnosed in the u s in december researchers from the university of texass m d anderson cancer center and the university of california los angeles reported that breast cancer cases dropped by from to they speculated that the decline was due to the fact that millions of women abruptly stopped using menopause hormones in mid after a major government study linked hormone use in older women with higher rates of heart attacks and breast cancer the new american cancer society study looks at the pattern of breast cancer rates since it showed a overall decline in the breast cancer rate between and and in the years leading up to the government hormone study breast cancer incidence had already started to drop by nearly the decrease was seen in several age groups and was greatest for small tumors and early stage cancers that are most commonly detected by mammography says acs epidemiologist ahmedin jemal the steep drop in breast cancer between and likely is linked with declines in menopause hormone use say researchers it may be that the abrupt stopping of hormones by millions of women changed the growth pattern of existing cancers which are known to be influenced by estrogen another factor may be that women who stopped taking hormones in also stopped going to the doctor to refill prescriptions and as a result were also less likely to get a screening mammogram but notably mammography rates among women who were to years old fell from to according to the december m d anderson study "with the cessation of hrt comes the drop off of doctor visits and less compliance with mammography " says marisa weiss a philadelphia oncologist and founder of breastcancer org "there are fewer reasons to see your doctor because hes no longer prescribing hrt and the absolutely required mammogram doctors must have prior to prescribing hrt drops out " peter ravdin one of the m d anderson researchers who co authored the december report on breast cancer rates says the new research "complements" the initial study which noted that changes in screening rates could also explain some of the breast cancer decline "whether its a long term effect or whether eventually there will be an increase in incidence again we dont know the answer to that " he says the new american cancer society data are important because many women have been confused by the reports about breast cancer hormones and screening says len lichtenfeld acs deputy chief medical officer "the message a woman is hearing is i dont have to worry about breast cancer any more because im not taking hormones" says dr lichtenfeld who fears women will stop seeking mammograms "the thing that frightens me so much is we really have made some progress in early detection "
