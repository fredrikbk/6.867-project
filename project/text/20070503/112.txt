world bank rolls renaissance pope adrian vi once said of the roman curia that its sins "were so widespread that those afflicted by the vice did not even notice the stench anymore " its a line that could also describe the world bank staff and its outrage over the "scandalous" raise paul wolfowitz awarded his girlfriend shaha riza when he became president if its transparency over salaries that bank employees want by all means lets have it specifically lets make public the names salaries and benefits of every bank employee who makes more than ms riza american taxpayers supply some of the banks capital and a new round of fund raising for the banks international development association is about to commence if congress is going to ante up the &# billion or so the bank is expected to request the least it can do is insist on more accountability keep in mind that mr wolfowitz was directed by the banks ethics committee to find a new job for ms riza a longtime bank staffer when he became president in despite his requests to be recused from the matter the committee suggested an "in situ promotion" to the next paygrade or an "ad hoc salary increase" as part of a "settlement of claims " the offer was intended to be generous given that ms riza who already had been shortlisted for promotion was being forced out of the bank possibly for good for a conflict she did not create and to a job she had not sought ms riza was eventually given an external assignment at the state department with a salary paid by the bank of &# up from the &# she had previously made at the bank to mr wolfowitzs critics this was improper and excessive especially given that condoleezza rice makes about &# less but this is highly selective outrage given normal procedure at the bank of its roughly employees no fewer than have salaries higher than the u s secretary of state clearly "fighting poverty" does not mean taking a vow of poverty at "multilateral" institutions at the time of ms rizas departure from the bank she was a grade "g" senior professional employee the typical salary in that grade hovers around the &# mark for the next level grade "h" the level to which ms riza was due to be promoted salaries average in the &# range with an upper band of &# no fewer than of bank employees are in this happy bracket even sweeter all of this is tax free to non americans u s employees have to pay u s tax but have their income taxes reimbursed by the bank as with any public bureaucracy these jobs are also impossible to lose for anything other than gross incompetence or venality some of mr wolfowitzs accusers notably former general counsel roberto danino are angry precisely because he upset their lifetime sinecure by demanding higher performance these details are common knowledge within the bank itself so its only fair that they be made public to the american taxpayers who finance this comfortable poverty fighting lifestyle alison cave the head of the bank staff association leading the campaign against mr wolfowitz ought to be the first to make her salary and performance reviews public in the name of restoring the banks "credibility " to borrow one of her favorite words and while congress is at it lets also disclose the names and details of the bank employees with "potential for supervision" conflicts of interest cited by the banks human resources department in a document when mr wolfowitz became president ms riza was four levels down in the world bank hierarchy a far more distant potential conflict we suspect than most of those cases from the beginning the attack on mr wolfowitz and ms riza has been a calculated political putsch by europeans and world bank staff who fancy themselves immune from any real public scrutiny if its a "credible" and transparent bank they want lets get out the firehose and really go to work see related letter "letters to the editor a lifetime sinecure i was there two years" wsj may
