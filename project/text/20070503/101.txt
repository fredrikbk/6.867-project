these days photography collectors are getting picky its time to look again at the market for photography as art last week sothebys photographs department offered prize images from the collection of blue chip dealer margaret w westons private collection earned &# million and no one blinked just a decade ago the spring photo sales at three auction houses together couldnt match the price of this one sale for the record in april sothebys total photography sales came to &# christies brought in &# phillips de pury &amp co earned &# unlike old master drawings or impressionist paintings photography is a fairly new art commodity until the mid s buyers were content to haunt rare books sales and country auctions prices didnt rise because there was no real competition and no glamour few museums had collections there were almost no galleries most people bought photographs because they liked them and could afford truly first rate work when comparable paintings were simply out of reach sam wagstaff a nationally known curator of contemporary art and arnold crane a wealthy chicago lawyer were the exceptions they had very deep pockets knew what they liked and needed no guidance from museums or dealers in fact they reveled in the chance to discover new masters from every era a thrill ordinarily reserved for collectors of new work by young artists wagstaff found those as well of course his most famous discovery being robert mapplethorpe in the s the combined force of regular auctions a growing number of dealers high profile museum shows and inevitable shifts in fashion brought about a change prices regularly began to reach five figures and a field that once resembled a cult started to look a lot more like the rest of the art world with a recognized canon of artists constellations of star collectors dealers and curators when ms weston opened her gallery in carmel calif in she already belonged to the royalty of american photography her ex husband cole weston was the son of renowned edward weston and an artist in his own right she inherited very few of their photographs but her close friend ansel adams gave her his work for her first gallery show and she continued to represent him until his death she was among the first to sell work from the estates of canonical photographers such as paul strand and andre kertesz but it is almost impossible to estimate the size of her contribution the risk she took in when she paid &# for edward westons "shell " the image landed on the cover of newsweek because no one had ever paid that much for a single photograph before today that same record belongs to a landscape by edward steichen which sold last year at sothebys for &# stephen perloff publisher of the photograph collector a trade journal told me that "maggi assembled a group of pictures that embody many of the elements of the collectors holy grail " in her introduction to the sale catalog and in conversation during the preview exhibition denise bethel sothebys senior vice president and director of the photographs department pointed out that ms weston had long enjoyed access to images seen only by the richest and most discerning collectors and institutions her message was that this sale offered private collectors a matchless opportunity to acquire images they would find no where else many buyers compared it to the sale of photographs from the collection of the metropolitan museum and the sale of photographs from the collection of the museum of modern art new yorker critic vince aletti called ms westons collection "the smartest show in town " the weston sale included several prize images that rarely come to the market if only because owners never want to give them up a good example was an early print of man rays "noir et blanche " made soon after when the image was shot scholars have recently shown that the unforgettable surrealist still life pairing model kikis head with an african mask was first made as an assignment for french vogue at one time its commercial origin would have been a problem for those who only wanted to buy art made expressly for exhibition in a museum or gallery todays more liberal collectors prize formal innovation and originality wherever they find it and ms westons sale included some fine examples such as a fashion image made by richard avedon for harpers bazaar and a cosmetics ad by baron adolf de meyer the record sale for the evening was "the ascent of attic angles" by edward weston a rare print and a stunning moment in the history of photography when weston found a way to push this stubbornly descriptive art form into abstraction as always some photographs did not sell but just as sherlock holmes used "the curious incident of the dog that did not bark" to discover who stole race horse silver blaze from his stable the unsold lots hold clues to the current market though many dealers observed that the prices in general were "retail" too high to allow them to make a ready profit these same dealers were bidding on behalf of their clients too remote or discreet to visit the sale in person these sophisticated collectors are the photographic equivalent of holmess silent dogs they passed on key lots one nonseller was the romantic platinum portrait edward weston made in of his soon to be mistress tina modotti which appeared on the cover the catalog a sensuous document of a crucial moment in his life and career with its soft focus and sentimental subject matter the image shows the end of his "pictorialist" style weston would soon leave this style behind when he and modotti moved to mexico and he began to create the nearly abstract studies of shells and vegetables which made his name the only known variant of this image at the center for creative photography in tucson is slightly larger and includes a portion of modottis bare breast a detail that also makes it more desirable though not for sale this print also has no signature for &# the minimum estimate todays buyer was not tempted buyers also passed on "trumpet organ pipes wurlitzer " made by margaret bourke white for fortune magazine this image was signed on the mount not on the image itself buyers may have questioned the warm tones of the print which could signal deterioration caused by excessive exposure to light the image may also have suffered by comparison to a similar bourke white composition in a later sale at much lower price once upon a time you had to be a little bit mad to collect photographs but no longer and if a certain sense of adventure has left the photography market in its place we have demanding informed buyers high prices and the promise of higher ones to come ms bethel of sothebys whose tenure in the field rivals that of ms weston summed it up "when i started with photography it was not a glamorous job not a paintings job photography was at the very bottom of the art chain its not any more " these days opportunity comes in a more democratic form all you really need is money ms panzer is an art historian specializing in photography her book "things as they are photojournalism in context " won the icp infinity award for best
