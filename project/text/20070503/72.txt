patently obvious we cant believe were writing this but the supreme court is restoring some sanity to americas runaway patent law a year ago it gave judges much needed flexibility in granting or denying permanent injunctions in ebay and this week it took another positive step in ksr v teleflex which dealt with the design of the humble gas pedal but has far larger consequences in striking down a teleflex patent on a gas pedal the high court showed how easily patent law can "stifle rather than promote" progress in the words of justice anthony kennedys unanimous opinion the question was whether a pedal design patented in was nothing more than an "obvious" combination of previously existing designs the trial court ruled it was obvious and invalidated the patent an appeals court overruled but the supremes sided with the trial court in doing so the justices rebuked the appellate patent court for having raised the bar too high in assessing "obviousness " this is important because it will help rein in what has become a proliferation of patents for increasingly small or dubious technology adaptations this in turn is damaging innovation by throwing more and more business decisions into patent court federal law requires that patents only be granted for non obvious innovations this is because patents ought to protect inventions that require a discovery a leap of logic or imagination an example that justice kennedy cites in teleflex is that of a battery that used an electrode previously thought unsuitable for that purpose an inventor discovered that the conventional wisdom was wrong and a new type of battery came into being the teleflex gas pedal by contrast combined elements of existing pedals in a way that neither defied the conventional wisdom nor resulted in novel unexpected benefits the fact that no one had combined those elements in that particular way was not the court ruled sufficient to conclude that the combination merited a patent more broadly justice kennedy wrote that the federal courts had adopted too strict a standard for invalidating patents this could have broad ramifications our patent system is only as good as the bureaucrats who grant the patents and the courts that enforce them so if a legal standard allows dubious patents to be enforced then innovation and the economy may suffer this is the point overlooked by some of our libertarian friends who argue that because property rights are good and a patent is a kind of property right then all patents must be good but only a good patent is good that much should be obvious a bad legal standard allows bad patents to be enforced against legitimate competitors and it tells the folks at the patent office to be less careful in issuing patents than they should be teleflex is the latest in a series of cases that have tried to better define the proper limits and roles of patents this is not partisan or ideological work and it wont get much attention in the next supreme court confirmation fight but it is vital to promoting innovation in a competitive economy and is worth applauding see related letter "letters to the editor flexible patent law and its achilles heel" wsj may
