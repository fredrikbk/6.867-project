at dow jones focus is on the bancroft family rupert murdoch has preached peace and cooperation with the shareholder family that holds the keys to dow jones &amp co now he faces a critical test might his only way of winning be to divide and conquer after a board meeting yesterday afternoon in the seagram building in midtown manhattan dow joness board said that shares representing of the companys overall voting power favored rejection of the &# billion offer from mr murdochs news corp and that the company would take no immediate action the companys decision and the slim margin of the vote sets the stage for a complicated clash of interests and allegiances which increases potential tensions between the bancrofts dow joness board of directors and other shareholders eager to sell the company the bancroft family members opposed to mr murdochs offer got a boost yesterday when they were told that another large shareholder the ottaway family is firmly opposed to selling to mr murdoch according to people briefed on the meeting the most recent dow jones proxy filing shows the ottaways own of the companys class b shares the ottaway family acquired its interest in the newspaper publisher when it sold its chain of community newspapers to dow jones in the ottaways opposition to the murdoch bid is significant because it means that at least of the votes now oppose the offer investors though appeared to be betting that dow jones would be sold to somebody in the end the stock closed yesterday at &# a share down cents from the day before when the offer was first disclosed the familys rejection is sure to upset dow joness nonfamily shareholders many of whom traded into the stock in the last hours in expectation of a sale but the margin is still thin and the family is large and far flung the bancrofts didnt know they would be under pressure to express a preference until tuesday when cnbc broke the news of the offer even with the ottaways opposition a defection by a relatively small number of family members could swing the vote the other way and the delays could provide cover for mr murdoch to attempt to negotiate with individual family trustees the spread of the bancroft family now into its fifth generation has diluted attachment to the company one family member champion powerboat racer jeff stevenson years old said in an interview last night that he "hasnt talked to anyone about whats going on im not really that involved " the independent directors are in a delicate position if the family continues to be steadfastly against a sale the board cant override it that essentially neuters the board which is typically a companys most important instrument for negotiating any transaction last week the board briefly discussed setting up a special committee of its directors to pursue the offer but it has decided not to do so for now according to people familiar with the matter without the familys voting sway one of these people said the board would almost certainly vote to approve the offer which represents a premium of roughly over dow joness closing price monday but one person close to the family said that some members could ultimately settle on a deal adding "theyre not all together " this person noted that a generational rift has broken out with older family members more resistant to mr murdochs overture a sweetened offer would be the most direct way to win more support short of that mr murdoch might also consider offering a higher price for the companys supervoting shares than its common stock such arrangements are typically detested by shareholders but they are legal such enticements still cant force the family to do anything observes morton pierce an attorney at the law firm dewey ballantine "they dont owe a fiduciary duty to the other shareholders " he said "human nature being what it is once you get that offer it can certainly create a great deal of tension" between families and independent board members another scenario could involve family members who wish the company to remain independent buying the shares of relatives who want to sell when class b shares are sold they convert to nonvoting stock but there is an exemption for selling to other family members another consideration for those who might oppose the bid the companys certificate of incorporation says that it has some latitude to consider the effect "of such a transaction upon the independence and integrity of the corporations publications and services and the social and economic effects of such actions " the companys board consists of members four of whom represent the bancroft family michael elefante the boston based trustee who directly represents of the familys voting power and influences even more has played an active role in recent weeks as the intermediary between the family and the company according to people familiar with the matter there are three branches of the bancroft family they come largely from the descendants of jane cook jessie cox and hugh bancroft jr ms cooks branch includes martha robes her sister jean stevenson and elizabeth steele who is a dow jones director the second branch descended from ms cox includes william cox and his sister jane macelree and their children the third branch represented by chris bancroft who also serves on the board includes elisabeth goth who voiced her opposition to dow joness management a decade ago within the three branches there are sub branches and a number of trusts unlike the trusts controlling new york times co the bancroft family trusts are under no obligation to vote together "this family can be split " said a person familiar with the familys history even within certain branches of the family there is the potential for differing opinions for instance chris bancroft has consistently been against a sale of the company according to a person familiar with his thinking but in the younger generation of that same branch family members such as ms goth have pushed for consideration of mr murdochs offer this person said news corp is among the players trying to divine the inner workings of the family "the word on this is patience " said one person in the news corp camp who noted that mr murdoch hopes to meet with bancroft family members in coming weeks mr murdochs bid raises fewer regulatory questions than other potential bids such as ones from gannett co or bloomberg lp which are more obvious direct competitors because dow jones doesnt own any radio or television properties and arguably doesnt compete with the new york post news corp would be unlikely to run afoul of federal restrictions on cross ownership of newspaper and broadcast properties in local markets the federal communications commission caps the number of television radio station or cable franchises a company may hold but has no similar restrictions on newspaper properties dana cimilluca amy schatz and karen richardson contributed to this article
