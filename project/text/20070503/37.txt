fed likely to stand pat on rates washington inflation is close to the feds preferred level but dont expect the central bank to declare victory just yet federal reserve officials are scheduled to meet next week and are likely to leave their target for short term interest rates at they are also likely to reiterate that inflation is their predominant concern even though inflation recently edged lower fed officials also still see risks to growth especially from weakness in business investment and housing but those risks dont appear to have grown in the past month yesterday the commerce department reported that u s factory orders jumped in march from february led by gains in aircraft though they remain below decembers level according to fed officials there are still potential obstacles to further declines in inflation such as a rebound in energy prices a drop in the dollar and most important the failure of unemployment to rise as expected the april employment report due tomorrow will show whether the long expected weakening in u s job markets has begun to be sure fed officials are happy with the latest inflation news the "core" price index of personal consumption expenditures which excludes food and energy didnt rise in march and was up from a year earlier compared with in february fed officials differ on their preferred inflation rate but for most it is or lower fed officials have forecast for some time that core inflation would edge lower this year and fall below next year that forecast went off track in january and february but marchs data appear to have put it back on track but the fed is wary of taking great comfort in that shift for a few reasons first with core inflation at or above for three years now the fed is inclined to see any move up from todays level as far more consequential than a move lower a second reason is that the fed sees several risks that could send inflation higher the leading concern is that even as the economy has slowed unemployment has kept falling "with labor markets appearing to have tightened further rather than easing as expected the upside risks to inflation have gotten bigger " federal reserve bank of san francisco president janet yellen said last week fed officials believe it is only a matter of time before unemployment heads higher especially in construction which has plunged indeed a report by deutsche bank found that in the past years employment in the construction sector lags behind construction activity by six to nine months construction employment has already started to weaken and that will intensify in the months ahead the bank said still fed officials have waited so long for unemployment to rise that another possibility is gaining attention that growth in productivity or output per worker has slowed that would mean companies would have to hire more workers for a given increase in sales if those companies raised wages to attract those workers as they have lately they would face a choice between raising prices and accepting narrower profit margins other risks that have caught the feds attention recently include a rebound in energy prices which could work its way into other goods and services and boost inflationary psychology and the dollar since the start of the year the dollar has fallen against a basket of u s trading partners currencies despite these risks fed officials still think inflation will go lower they arent alarmed by a recent rise in food prices which they attribute primarily to normal volatility more lasting factors such as the impact of ethanol demand on corn prices are thought to be too small to have a broad impact on inflation and they take comfort that the publics expectations of inflation havent increased notably according to yesterdays factory orders report capital goods orders excluding defense and aircraft jumped in march but that wasnt enough to reverse the prior two months plunge
