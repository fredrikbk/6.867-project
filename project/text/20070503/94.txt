the afternoon report gms mortgage millstone online edition general motors hit a subprime mortgage pothole in the first quarter hurting the hobbled auto giant at a time that is still trying to realign itself amid a drastically changed automobiles market the auto makers earnings took a dive plunging from the same time a year ago as weak results from gmac financial services crumpled the bottom line ever since this earnings season got rolling investors have been on the alert for fallout from the subprime mortgage implosion and in the end many lenders appear to have dodged major damage but gmac which yesterday reported a &# million loss for the first quarter in contrast to a &# million profit a year earlier showed the effects of the wave of defaults by mortgage borrowers with less than spotless credit histories that had been expected to some extent but today gm finance chief fritz henderson suggested some analysts had wandered too close to the sunny side of the street in gauging how much damage gmacs problems would do to the auto maker gm recognized a net loss of &# million on its stake in gmac gm unloaded a majority interest in the usually profitable financing unit last year as it sought to scrape up money for its restructuring the mortgage undertow couldnt come at a worse time for gm which is now in the middle of a massive restructuring effort aimed at getting its north american automotive operations off the shoulder and back into the fast lane but progress has been tough to come by in a very tough market the ascendant toyota motor usurped gm as the global auto sales leader during the first quarter and the second quarter got off to a very flimsy start as the housing market and rising gasoline prices sapped auto demand across the board amid gms effort to tighten production schedules and head counts it is losing market share during the first quarter its u s share declined by one percentage point to gm trimmed production by as it attempts to better align output with demand and also cut down on high volume but low margin sales to rental car agencies overall the north american operations net loss narrowed to &# million from &# million in last years first quarter while its sales dropped to &# billion from &# billion those results did little to please investors some of whom had been hoping that gms restructuring might yield a little black ink on the north american income statement but given aprils weak sales and the chance that inventory will pile up prospects dont look good for the companys core car operations in a note to clients lehman brothers analyst brian johnson wrote that any significant boost from gms new line of pickups now seems a distant possibility and that without substantial concessions from union workers "meaningful improvements in profitability are unlikely in our view " there is another black cloud hanging over gm in the dispute between the parts supplier delphi and its unionized work force over pay and benefits if an agreement cannot be reached at that company and workers decide to strike it could close down gms assembly lines gm expects to settle the delphi talks soon though mr henderson said the auto maker is lifting its estimate on wage subsidies that it will need to pay to reach a deal gm shares dropped on the big board economic data support blue chips a solid looking reading on worker
