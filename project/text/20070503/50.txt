how a railroad rivaled the glories of rome conquering gotham by jill jonnes viking pages &# bridge and tunnel" is an aspersion cast on the un chic residents of long island or new jersey who commute to manhattan over or under the waters that encircle the city like a shimmering velvet rope jill jonness superb "conquering gotham" shows how times have changed a century ago the same three words conjured up enterprise and audacity millions of dollars were invested and dozens of lives lost in pursuit of the prize of an unbroken rail link through new york that is in addition to the new york centrals long standing route from the north millions more dollars were poured into construction of pennsylvania station an edifice patterned after the great buildings of ancient rome as well it might have been at the turn of the th century the u s looked a little like the second coming of the roman empire ms jonness first rate narrative tracks the tunnels the station and the times in which they were conceived dug and built the book she did not write is an extended and necessarily invidious comparison between the heroic era of urban construction and our own yes in a nicely turned addendum she does mourn the wanton mid s demolition of penn station but she leaves it up to the reader to contrast for example the immense undertakings of with the hole in the ground where the world trade center towers used to stand only now more than five years after the attacks have new structures begun to rise where the twin towers stood and they still havent risen much neither does she note the conspicuous non invocation of the eminent domain doctrine in the early th century and its promiscuous use in the early st it must be said that money is not the authors best subject investors will find much to enjoy in "conquering gotham " but they will wish the book told more about the finances of the mighty pennsylvania railroad which bankrolled the whole project tunnels and station alike and pushed it through to its glorious conclusion its no easy thing to imagine a st century corporation laying out billions to out build and out beautify the romans yet the old pennsy did just that and at a substantial cost to its stock market capitalization stubborn men achieved great feats years ago alexander j cassatt president of the pennsylvania railroad was among the stubbornest he never wavered in his faith that trains could enter manhattan not on ferries but through tunnels and once arrived discharge their passengers in a building whose function seemed not so much to keep out the elements as to ennoble the human spirit and immortalize the corporation that paid for it all the trick was translating this grand vision into watertight tunnels groin vaulted coffered ceilings and corinthian columns the silty hudson river bottom presented one set of problems the seemingly impenetrable east river rocks another then there were the crooked city fathers the pennsy bought itself a peck of trouble and delay by refusing on principle to pay the kind of tribute that tammany hall felt it deserved reading about these trials and tribulations so vividly described by ms jonnes the reader may feel an unscratchable itch to go back in time and have a brief word with the long deceased members of the pennsy front office one might ask them for instance "are you sure you want to build this monumental station on the eve of the automobile age and have you heard about the wright brothers " or "do you really suppose that the government will allow you to earn the returns youve projected over the long pull now that teddy roosevelt is opening the floodgates to the meddling politics of his rising cousin franklin " uncoached by time travelers however management pushed on it bought up huge tracts of manhattan real estate with the shareholders money not the taxpayers it filed not one environmental impact statement it hired sandhogs to tunnel and blast and when one fell ill or died of the bends or was shattered by a carelessly laid stick of dynamite it hired another and when the neighborhood around penn station was rocked by an especially big mistimed explosion the company just shrugged "this happens occasionally in all blasting work " its contractor airily said in a statement "and is an unavoidable accident " when the financial future becomes especially opaque wall street people cast an envious glance at those who seem to work in a state of certain knowledge there was no such certainty in the hole digging trades a century ago the engineers racked their brains over the tunnels connecting new jersey and lower manhattan it seems that the pathways undulated how much more would they waver under the constant pounding of fully loaded passenger trains the experts were divided over this life and death issue should they try to secure the tunnels to the riverbed floor with screw piles after much wrangling the anti screw pile faction prevailed though neither those men nor their professional adversaries could really be sure they were right happily the mass drowning they silently feared never came to pass as for the bridge and tunnel crowd of how do you suppose they responded to the triumph of man over the natural and political elements ms jonnes relates that the long island railroad riders "fumed at having to exchange their old commuter tickets for new ones at the cost of an additional dollar " a century later theyre still mad mr grant is the editor of grants interest rate observer and the author most recently of "john adams party of one" farrar straus
