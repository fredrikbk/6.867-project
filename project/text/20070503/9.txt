battling on at lonely iraq outpost gis stay as hope fades u s soldiers persevere despite snipers ambush fighting for each other tarmiyah iraq for u s troops just walking a simple foot patrol through this small trash strewn city miles north of baghdad has become unthinkable if the americans spend longer than minutes in one place a sniper will track them down and begin shooting "it is getting to the point where we really cant interact with the people " says lt cody wallace executive officer of the unit that patrols the city even the local police chief who oversees the area that includes tarmiyah refuses to set foot in the town as u s and iraqi troops have surged into baghdad in a quest to bring stability there enemy fighters have moved into the surrounding towns u s commanders in these areas lack the manpower to defeat insurgents or protect the locals on most days there are fewer than u s troops in tarmiyah a city of about many of them angry and disenfranchised sunnis their goal is to keep the enemy off balance with periodic raids its the best they can hope for under the new u s "surge strategy " which some u s officers in iraq say does little more than chase insurgents from one part of the country to another the experience of the soldiers from the second battalion eighth cavalry regiments demon company here is a window into what motivates troops in a war that an increasing number of americans have concluded is a lost cause few of the soldiers in tarmiyah expect to change the city where support for the insurgency is strong and hostility to the u s presence is often overt instead they persevere for each other in mid february a massive truck bomb sheared off the front of the soldiers base in tarmiyah sending concrete and glass flying through the air like daggers the soldiers at the small outpost spent the next four hours fighting for their lives against a force of to insurgents after the battle the troops got a few weeks to heal those healthy enough to fight returned to a new patrol base that is so close to the ruins of their old building that soldiers on roof guard duty can look down on the spot where they faced down death today most still have glass and shrapnel embedded in their skin from the february ambush none of the soldiers in tarmiyah talk about winning anymore but even some of the most severely wounded soldiers from that attack argued with their commanders and doctors to return to the patrol base with their fellow troops "is what we lost worth it not even a little bit " says staff sgt chad stallings but like many of those badly wounded in the blast he has returned to the base "i am not ever going to change the world but at least i can be there for my soldiers " says the lanky year old sergeant from dexter mo in spring tarmiyah on the surface at least was a much more peaceful place u s and iraqi troops surrounded the city with razor wire set up the patrol base in the city and began a &# million campaign to rebuild the citys schools clinics and sewer system soldiers often referred to the city located miles north of baghdad as the "petting zoo " a nod to the number of top generals who came to see what u s commanders considered a success story last summer tarmiyah began to fall apart a battalion of about to iraqi army soldiers that had been based in the city was transferred to baghdad to support the new u s iraqi effort to stabilize the capital at the same time some to angry sunnis driven from their homes in baghdad by shiite militia forces began streaming into this largely sunni city sunni insurgents affiliated with al qaeda in iraq joined them insurgents began extorting money from iraqi contractors working for the americans and in december the man tarmiyah police force which shared the patrol base with american troops drew their weapons saying they were going out on a patrol and never returned the three dozen soldiers from demon company were the only security forces left in the city the soldiers typically spent four days at the patrol base a spartan outpost without running water or hot food and then rotated back to camp taji a big u s base about miles away for four days in february staff sgt james copeland a broad shouldered year old who has a tattoo of a skeletal uncle sam flashing his middle fingers snaking up his right arm was named acting platoon sergeant of one of demon companys four platoons sgt copeland couldnt believe how far he had come when he enlisted in he was working at a mcdonalds in hutchinson kan he was then years old newly married and the father of an infant daughter "wow who would have thought that i would be a platoon sergeant " he wrote in early february in the journal he kept under his bunk "if i stay out of trouble maybe someday i will make sergeant major i have so much to learn " on feb sgt copelands platoon rolled out to tarmiyah for a four day rotation the soldiers noticed that something seemed wrong in the city on the roof of one house near the patrol base they spotted a man tossing homing pigeons and waving a blue flag pigeons are often used by insurgents to send signals about the location of u s troops a pickup truck rolled past with two children in the back banging on metal propane canisters with sticks the soldiers assumed the clanging was another signal the following day the markets were empty as u s troops walked through the city fellow soldiers watched over them from a rooftop one was pfc justin paton a big gregarious soldier from rural michigan who the troops nicknamed "cornfed " out of nowhere the soldiers heard the crack of an enemy sniper rifle "patons down " screamed a soldier sgt copeland the second in command of the platoon sprinted to the roof the year old privates chest had collapsed and blood was spilling into his lungs suffocating him the troops loaded pfc paton into a humvee and sped off with the doors still open and pfc patons foot frame dangling part of the way out of the truck he died an hour later sgt copeland told one of his soldiers to wash the blood out of the humvee and collect pfc patons personal items a few letters a timex watch and an ipod he then retreated to the empty detainee holding area to get away from everyone and cry "i cant believe this happened " he scribbled in red ink in his journal "i wish it was me and not him " commanders at camp taji asked the platoon if they wanted to cut short their stay and come back to the big base pfc paton was the units first fatality and his death shattered the feeling of invincibility many of the young soldiers felt sgt copeland discussed the offer with lt shawn jokinen the platoons year old leader they decided to finish their four day stint the events that followed were pieced together in interviews with some two dozen demon company soldiers and u s army records the following day the soldiers got a tip telling them where the sniper who shot pfc paton lived at a m on feb they raided the house and two others arresting seven men the soldiers returned to the patrol base around a m elated and exhausted most of the soldiers went to sleep sgt copeland wrote a note to himself to buy a phone card when he got back to camp taji and call his year old daughter at a m he checked the time on pfc patons watch which had been placed under his cot for safekeeping a few minutes later the soldiers woke to the sound of bullets pinging off the patrol base followed by a frantic scream "get your s on " sgt copeland yelled "theyve breached the compound " a truck loaded with more than pounds of explosives had seconds earlier smashed through the front gate of the patrol base sgt copeland the laces still flapping on his untied boots started to wake the troops lt jokinen fired a couple of shots at the driver the truck exploded and everything went black the blast killed sgt pedro colon a year old soldier from the bronx spc montrel mcarn who a few minutes earlier had been playing video games was hit by shrapnel that sliced off half of his face and part of his skull say soldiers sgt copeland his back and neck peppered with glass quickly told his troops to search the compound for insurgents troops who were too hurt to fight were led over to a small one story command post building next to the patrol base at the command post a year old soldier was working feverishly to get the bases radios which had been knocked out by the blast running so the soldiers could call for help a piece of glass was sticking out of his ear pfc trent gray a year old from eastern kentucky coal country was sitting on the floor with the other severely wounded troops "the blood wasnt just dripping from my head it was squirting pumping through my fingers " he says he told himself that if the enemy made it into the compound he would kill himself with his mm pistol "i dont want to get my head cut off and have my wife watch it on the internet " he recalls thinking lt jokinen the platoon leader looked otherworldly his face was coated in white dust and streaked with crimson red blood he had a concussion and was mumbling incoherently sgt copeland grabbed lt jokinens body armor and pfc grays machine gun and led a group of soldiers to the roof of the patrol base to try to hold off the enemy until help arrived they began firing at enemy fighters running through the streets and shot into buildings where they thought they were taking fire finally around a m the soldiers got a hand held radio working and rushed it to the roof with the radio the troops could direct the apache attack helicopters circling overhead to enemy positions lt clint burleson one of the apache pilots began talking to a sergeant on the patrol base roof the soldier sounded "disconnected and out of it " lt burleson recalls "his voice was creaky like he had been crying " "hey buddy if you can point me in the direction that you are taking fire from i will make it stop " lt burleson told the sergeant who calmed down the apaches began blasting away the enemy fire gradually died down around a m the soldiers on the roof were relieved by fresh troops from camp taji sgt copeland searched through the rubble by his bunk for his journal which he found buried near his cot and pfc patons watch which he couldnt find as the adrenaline faded the troops began to experience pain from the shards of glass and metal that had sliced their faces backs arms and feet a few were overcome by fear sgt brandon benton a year old from sacramento calif threw up and then tried to cover it up with a sandbag so that no one would slip sgt copeland held his emotions in check until he was ushered into the hospital at camp taji he pulled off his shirt revealing his back which was peppered with fragments of glass "how did you get wounded " a doctor asked him he didnt answer for the first time that day sgt copeland says he began to sob the troops from demon company got about three weeks to heal and receive new equipment at camp taji before they were sent back to tarmiyah the first few days in their new home a girls school about yards from the old patrol base were harrowing they were hit regularly with machine gun fire mortars and rocket propelled grenades some soldiers slept in their boots and others wore their bullet proof vests to bed many of the soldiers were angry at the people of tarmiyah who they thought seemed to know a big attack was coming but never told the americans "right after the incident i was filled with a lot of hate " says sgt copeland as his anger died down sgt copeland says he began to wonder what purpose he and his fellow soldiers were serving in the city "the people here are not even trying to help themselves " he says "someone threatens them and they just cower " u s commanders say they are reluctant to give up the patrol base in the city out of concern that it will look like they have been driven out by the enemy "if were not out here they have won " says sgt jason fisher a year old soldier who fought for hours from the roof of the old base an iraqi battalion made up of about to soldiers is expected to arrive in tarmiyah later this summer to help with security until then the goal is to just hang on and as much as possible keep the enemy from completely taking over in the evenings soldiers at the base pass the time playing cards by the light of chemical glow sticks and cook ramen noodles on a small campfire in the courtyard sometimes they set ambushes in an effort to catch insurgents planting roadside bombs a few days a week they drive by the ruins of their old patrol base shooing away locals who spray anti american graffiti on the walls and steal bricks and metal rods for their own construction projects in late march a small team of demon company soldiers hid out in a half finished house hoping to ambush insurgents laying bombs on a road on the outskirts of tarmiyah the insurgents never showed up but after a few hours some local laborers arrived to work on the house the u s soldiers searched them for weapons and then escorted them to the top floor of the house to wait for a couple of hours sgt copeland and sgt fisher offered the workers a strawberry breakfast bar and began to chat with them with the help of their interpreter the laborers who had been driven from baghdad by shiite militias told them that most people in the town hated the americans and believed that they were siding with the shiites "you should be in the shiite areas too not just the sunni ones " said one of the men named mohammed sgt copeland and sgt fisher tried to reassure the laborers "we are not siding with anyone " sgt fisher said "we just want everyone to live in peace so we can go home " the attack that eroded the troops faith in tarmiyah seems to have made some of them more willing to fight for each other before the feb attack sgt benton who had vomited when the fighting was done insisted to superiors that he shouldnt even be in iraq the year olds enlistment contract ended in november but the army which is short of sergeants made him finish his one year tour as part of its "stop loss" policy sgt benton was furious and in early february his superiors threatened in writing to demote him unless his performance improved "i have to undo a lot of stupid things i have done " he says today "i have a strong bond with this platoon i dont want to leave and if i die out here i dont want to be remembered as the s head that everyone had to think of something nice to say about at my memorial service " by mid march eight soldiers still hadnt returned to the patrol base pfc gray whose temporal artery was spurting blood after the explosion put off returning until sgt stallings his section leader was ready to go back "weve got a bond we were blown up together " pfc gray says "plus he makes me laugh so that i am not thinking about getting blown up into a million little pieces " the two were cleared by doctors and returned together in late march the night before his doctors appointment certifying him as healthy pfc gray says he couldnt sleep the year old watched three movies on his dvd player and talked on the phone to his wife who is pregnant with their first child he fell asleep around a m and was jolted awake by a nightmare two hours later in the dream sgt copeland was screaming that someone had breached the gate of their old patrol base pfc gray says he frantically tried to lace up his shoes but he couldnt get them tied the louder sgt copeland screamed the more he fumbled early last month pfc gray decided he wasnt ready to stay at the outpost "i had a really hard time " he wrote in an email at his request pfc gray says his bosses assigned him to a headquarters job at camp taji he says he hopes it will be "for a month or so until i feel better " sgt stallings his friend who carries shrapnel in his body from a rocket propelled grenade attack and glass from the february explosion stayed the hardest decision for commanders was whether to let lt jokinen the platoon leader go back with his troops today he is virtually deaf in one ear and seems to have limited hearing in the other one he has to turn his head to hear at camp taji lt jokinen who is married with two young children says he had a hard time sleeping when a rocket slammed into camp taji he says he was overcome by a feeling of helplessness similar to what he felt in the immediate aftermath of the attack when a bad concussion left him disoriented and afraid last month lt jokinen returned to the tarmiyah outpost his superiors "wanted me to go on leave and rest up some more but i had to get back out there with my platoon " he wrote in an email "i also needed to prove to myself that i did not lose the ability to be a soldier and to lead i needed to get over the wall of fear and get my confidence back " despite his misgivings about the mission in tarmiyah sgt copeland says he never doubted that he would return with his troops "i dont deploy for the iraqi people " he says "we all come here to fight for the guys on our left and our right "
