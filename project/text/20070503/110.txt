why we had to sell ancient art works we write to set the record straight regarding tom freudenheims leisure &amp arts commentaries on nov and this past march about the albright knox art gallerys plan to deaccession a number of ancient art works peripheral to its core mission as a modern and contemporary art institution the albright knox held a special members meeting on march to vote on a motion against deaccessioning mr freudenheim reported that the motion failed but neglected to report the magnitude members voted for deaccessioning against fewer than of the museums members voted against a result that mr freudenheim somehow calls an "unprecedented outpouring of disapproval " mr freudenheim repeats the allegations of a "failed lawsuit" to stop the deaccessioning but the lawsuit did not just fail the judge found it completely baseless and dismissed it entirely mr freudenheim says he attended the albright knoxs special meeting "as a member a role i began in elementary school " in fact he left buffalo years ago but bought a &# membership six hours before the rolls closed for the special meeting the impression of lifelong membership is a clever misrepresentation according to mr freudenheim the "museums spokespersons misrepresented the collections history as devoted to mostly modern and contemporary art " that is exactly the albright knoxs history a dec financial times article said "the albright knox is of course justly celebrated for its modern and contemporary collections only moma outshines it in terms of quality and depth " in one of his books mr freudenheim himself says the albright knox is a "pivotal museum for seeing contemporary art " mr freudenheim quoted and agreed with a speaker at the special meeting who said the albright knox is holding a "yard sale " actually works are being deaccessioned of which are chinese export porcelain teacups plates etc the remaining items represent less than of the items in the permanent collection hardly a "yard sale " these items were all carefully screened in a highly professional process mr freudenheim makes some valid points we agree with him that the art of the past illuminates the art of the present that is why the albright knox is keeping many works of ancient art a fact mr freudenheim chooses not to mention we realize mr freudenheim is a columnist with wide latitude to express his opinion two of his columns on the albright knox are titled "in the fray " and he was personally "in the fray" as an unpaid activist working against the albright knoxs deaccessioning project the leader of the plaintiffs group publicly acknowledged that mr freudenheim has been in constant contact with him to discuss tactics the board acknowledges deaccessioning is a difficult decision that will not please everyone if the albright knox had unlimited resources it would not sell anything in reality the board had to choose it made a painful choice to sell selected works marginal to the institutions core history and mission so that the permanent collection would continue to flourish in the future for more than years people in buffalo and the world have been able to see the most interesting art of their own times at the albright knox we believe that should continue the courts and the membership have spoken and they have supported the boards decision now is the time for people who really care about the arts in buffalo to share in the renewed excitement and activities at the albright knox and to come together constructively to support this outstanding art institution charles w banta president albright knox art gallery buffalo n y
