dispatches from iraq thanksgiving day in baghdad and living with the new normal online edition an iraqi colleague asked me on thanksgiving day how the holiday got started trying to recall my elementary school education i told him about the pilgrims and native americans having a feast together and giving thanks for their harvest "but didnt the americans kill all the indians " he asked "well not all of them but yes many were killed " i said "thats the part that americans dont want to talk about " he said and he seemed to be speaking about the situation in iraq as well i explained to him that thanksgiving has evolved as a holiday and not many people at least no one i know celebrate it in memory of the gathering of the pilgrims and native americans instead its a time that family and friends come together to give thanks for what they have in their lives and also to remember the many who dont have as much as they do he liked that explanation better i spent thanksgiving at the home of another news organization there was a turkey brought in from jordan there were apple and pumpkin pies one of the journalists gave a toast before the meal giving thanks to the gathered friends who make life here more bearable we drank wine and gorged ourselves on mashed potatoes cranberry sauce and stuffing it actually felt like thanksgiving but i guess thanksgiving in baghdad wouldnt be complete without the typical sounds of iraq in the late afternoon i heard about a dozen mortar rounds go off and could see the smoke drifting into the air from my window a few of us went up to the roof to get a better view maybe they were the same ones that landed in the green zone or international zone as its now called several people were injured in that attack the morning after thanksgiving there was an explosion at a pet market in baghdad and people were killed gina chon nov the new normal i was interviewing an ambassador today and we were able to sit at a table in the yard outside our office because we spend most of our time cooped up inside it was nice to feel the breeze and the warmth of the sun while we talked we wouldnt have been able to do that a few months ago when mortar rounds constantly bombarded our area much has been made about the recent security improvements and there is no doubt that things have gotten better but its not easy to assess because everything becomes relative here five hundred attacks a month are better than which are better than some in the u s military talk about getting things to a tolerable level of violence when the decline will start to plateau and that will become "the new normal " its still dangerous for iraqis but as long as they stay in familiar neighborhoods they do have an easier time getting around than foreigners i still cant go out to markets and restaurants without worrying about being kidnapped my iraqi friends still dont want to be seen with me in most baghdad neighborhoods and i still cant go to someones home in the red zone for dinner without having a security briefing and wearing body armor after the interview was over we chatted about life here and how things will seem strange when we go home we joked about how precious our id cards are the ones that say where we can go what we have access to our badge holders that carry the id cards are our most valued possessions here without them i could not go anywhere not to press conferences and not on embeds the ambassador said that a few days ago he forgot to wear his badge holder and he felt naked im now used to getting patted down and having our car searched whenever i attend a press conference ive only been here for a month and that already seems normal i asked an iraqi colleague today when he thought the foot tall concrete walls that line many baghdad neighborhoods would disappear he said probably five or six years but he doesnt mind because they have made neighborhoods safer since there is just one way in and out for many of these areas besides hes used to them by now the walls are normal gina chon nov
