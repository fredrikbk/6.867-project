will character be destiny you might not think one lousy debate performance or one silly planted question would jolt a storming campaign then again you might not be hillary clinton if the last few weeks have shown anything its that mrs clinton has some weak spots what isnt yet clear is whether her democratic opponents have the time or the will to exploit them until recently the biggest thing going for hillary is that she has appeared "inevitable " this is no accident mrs clinton may not be as naturally gifted as her husband but she does have access to his playbook one of bills more brilliant strategies when he ran in was to campaign as if he were already the nominee it gave an otherwise little known governor the legitimacy to sideline his opponents mrs clinton has made this tactic a cornerstone of her campaign and it had been working during debates she frequently speaks on "behalf of everyone" on the stage she chooses moments wisely to make statements no democrat disagrees with "george bush is ruining this country" leaving the competition nodding in miserable agreement her insistence that she and her democratic colleagues should keep this race focused on their arch enemy was equally savvy with everyone piling on dubya nobody was piling on her add to this mrs clintons stash of money the vaunted infrastructure the endorsements and her superstar status the clinton campaign has flogged all of these to leave the impression shes the only player in the game the trick is that theres little room for error the media hates a winner as much as it hates a preordained election and so it has seized on her missteps to blitz the papers with stories suggesting shes not teflon for a campaign betting so much on perception this new doubt is not good mrs clintons opponents have also got wise to her "inevitability" game and no one more so than john edwards his decision to unleash the big guns on her iraq vote and "dirty" corporate money has already yielded him a victory shes deigned to acknowledge hes actually on the stage and even answered some of his criticisms which in turn has suggested to audiences that she views him as a threat his strategy of going for broke in iowa is also aimed at cracking the clinton juggernaut the best way to prove to voters that someone isnt inevitable is to beat her in the first race in the nation grateful as that nation is to mr edwards for livening up the debate and unleashing some healthy clinton criticism from other campaigns were also just days from iowa the long gentle treatment by opponents allowed mrs clinton to build up such a sizable lead the attacks might now come a little too late they also may remain a little too little yes mr edwards is hitting mrs clinton on foreign policy yes barack obama is taking it to her on trade but consider this what none of her democratic opponents has broached what has so far been a super off limits high security no fly zone is any direct mention of mrs clintons ethically challenged period as first lady interesting given that character is mrs clintons biggest problem for all the clinton protestations that they were the object of a conspiracy the polls consistently show that even democratic voters are queasy about her honesty the most recent abc news washington post poll of likely democratic caucus goers in iowa which puts mr obama ahead shows him beating her by as the most honest and trustworthy candidate every bump on the clinton campaign road has also been linked to her reputation as insincere norman hsu made donations to many democrats but it was mrs clintons cache that dominated the headlines thanks to the s fund raising scandals what campaign hasnt planted a question yet catching mrs clinton in the act revived the stereotype of a calculating lawyer from arkansas flubbing one policy question among hundreds on immigrant drivers licenses shouldnt be a big deal but it reminds folks of a clinton white house that specialized in double talk and dissembling mrs clinton has all but broadcast that her greatest fear is that her opponents will reopen this can of clinton creepy crawlies her refusal which is growing news to expedite the release of her records from her time as first lady is one big sign her campaigns aggressive reaction to the merest hint of a personal comment by an opponent is another it isnt clear the clinton campaign is sitting on dirt on barack obama but theyre happy to have him think they are mr obama has come the closest to delving into mrs clintons past though you need an enigma machine to decode it his campaign slogan is "change we can believe in " translation if you elect her dont be surprised what she discovers in a box under a table hes mused about "character and judgment " translation i dont trade in cattle futures freudian psychology this is mortal kombat it is not yet while the squeaky clean mr obama may be best positioned to make a moral case against mrs clinton his own "politics of hope" has made it difficult to pull out the brass knuckles the rest of mrs clintons opponents fear an attack on her ethics would backfire allowing her to paint herself as a female victim you can bet theyve studied the video of rick lazio mrs clintons senate opponent invading her debate space and mrs clintons ensuing performance as flinching defenseless woman mr lazio sank like a rock she has suggested shes not above a repeat act dispatching bill to warn that "the boys" were being awfully "tough" on his wife some democrats seem to be relying on republicans to raise the character question but liberal voters arent listening to rudy giuliani or mitt romney and if they were theyd view gop persecution as added reason to vote for her mrs clinton thinks so having just unveiled an ad featuring romney and mccain attacks the democratic debate has grown more personal in past days with the barbs hitting ever closer to home whether this carries into a tougher discussion on mrs clintons character who knows it may just be inevitable
