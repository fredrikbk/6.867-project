weekend journal the backlash against tithing as churches push donations congregants balk thats not the way god works can you put a price on faith that is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing giving of your income to the church is increasingly challenged opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the bible a practice created by man not god they say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose and they are arguing with pastors writing letters and quitting congregations in protest in response some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades the backlash comes as some churches step up their efforts to encourage tithing some are setting up "giving kiosks" that allow congregants to donate using their debit cards when they attend services others are offering financial seminars that teach people in debt how they can continue tithing even while paying off their loans media savvy pastors such as ed young in grapevine texas sell sermons online about tithing and in a shift more catholic parishes are asking churchgoers to tithe says paul forbes administrator of mckenna stewardship ministry a nonprofit that says it has encouraged more than parishes to tithe in the last decade popes havent requested tithes in recent decades church leaders say tithing isnt just a theological issue but a financial one americans gave an estimated &# billion to congregations in almost a third of the countrys &# billion in charitable donations according to giving usa foundation a nonprofit educational organization in glenview ill but giving to religion is growing more slowly than other types of giving says patrick rooney director of research at the center on philanthropy at indiana university thats partly because people are attending church less frequently says mr rooney and are giving to a wider array of causes including secular ones that worries some church leaders "if everyone gives of their income because thats what they feel like giving you arent going to have money to pay the light bill and keep the doors open " says duane rice an official with evangelical friends international a denomination that believes that tithing is required by the bible many christians who dont read the bible literally say that by tithing they are not misreading the text but rather interpreting it differently tithing has its roots in the biblical tale of abraham presenting a tenth of the war spoils to melchizedek the king of salem in the old testament jews brought of their harvest to a storehouse as a welfare plan for the needy or in case of famine that percentage say pro tithers can be a useful guideline for christians today "its the best financial discipline i know " says terry parsons stewardship officer for the episcopal church other faiths also urge followers to donate muslims are obligated to give a zakat to charity usually of the market value of a believers assets each year most jewish synagogues request an annual membership fee often based on family income tithing ranges from a requirement to a suggestion depending on the denomination and the church mormons must give to the church or they may be barred from temples where ceremonies take place some evangelical protestant churches require new members to sign covenants promising to tithe or give generously those who openly refuse to tithe might be denied leadership roles or asked to leave the congregation the tithe has been the episcopal churchs "minimum standard" since although the average annual gift from its million members in reached only &# less than the requirement according to its own figures for judy willingham of san antonio years of tithing came to an end earlier this year she says she gave a tenth of her pay to cornerstone church because the pastor the rev john c hagee teaches "if you obey god and you tithe god will return it to you fold " ms willingham who earns &# annually as an administrative assistant says she started to research the practice reading criticism online and studying the bible and concluded that shed been "guilted into tithing " she quit the church and hasnt found another one steve sorensen director of pastoral ministries at cornerstone says the church requires its paid and volunteer leaders to tithe and teaches new members to do so although it doesnt make them show proof of income "when you tithe god makes promises to us that he is not going to let anything bad or destructive come about " says mr sorensen for those who dont tithe he says the lord "is not obligated to do those things for you " resistance to tithing has been increasing steadily in recent years as more churchgoers have questioned the way their churches spend money like other philanthropists today religious givers want to see exactly how their donations are being used in some cases the growth of megachurches some with expensive worship centers equipped with coffee bars and widescreen tvs have turned people off of tithing and those who object are finding like minded souls on the web in theological forums many churchgoers also balk at the idea that a certain amount of money will ensure salvation they see tithing and say "no thats not the way god works " says james hudnut beumler dean of vanderbilt universitys divinity school and author of the recent book "in pursuit of the almightys dollar " a history of protestant fund raising john magrino a new jersey lawyer says he regularly donated money during the weekly collection at his catholic church but tithing was a different story "its my money to do with what i want " says mr magrino a father of two he says he felt guilty when the pastor at sacred heart church in suffern n y started giving sermons about tithing and putting reminders in the church bulletin "that was the message i got from tithing make it hurt if it hurts then you get the spiritual renewal " msgr joseph giandurco now the pastor at sacred heart says he doesnt ask for tithes partly because he sensed his congregants disliked it some baptist churches are trying to encourage tithing by accepting credit card payments and automatic deductions from checking accounts two years ago the rev marty baker pastor of stevens creek church in augusta ga created the "giving kiosk" machine that allows congregants to donate at the church from their bank cards he and his wife launched securegive a for profit company which has placed kiosks in churches he says the machines can help track which families are giving the most in gainesville ga crown financial ministries offers training courses to people who then teach churchgoers around the country about how they can save budget and get out of debt while still giving of their earnings to the church "when they obey his word that is to give god creates opportunities supernaturally for them to save more and spend less " says the rev rob peters who began offering crown classes at first baptist at weston in weston fla five years ago he says giving to the church rose the first year the classes were taught compared with the year before when he objected to his churchs instructions to tithe kirk cesaretti took it up with the church leaders in response he received a letter from the pastor and elders of hydesville community church in hydesville calif "at this time we believe your concerns do not warrant any change in our church policy or positions " the letter read the letter closed with a verse from hebrews "obey your leaders and submit to them for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account let them do this with joy and not with grief for this would be unprofitable for you " mr cesaretti an engineer in fortuna calif says he took the letter to mean he was no longer welcome at the church hydesvilles senior pastor michael delamarian iii says he believes "the more you give the more youre going to be blessed " he says he did not bar mr cesaretti from the church the anti tithing movement has found support in some unlikely places theologically conservative divinity schools and church pulpits at southeastern baptist theological seminary in wake forest n c professor andreas kostenberger challenges tithing in classes on the new testament he teaches that if you add up all taxes paid by the ancient israelites they exceed and that in the new testament theres no percentage rule he says pastors perpetuate the figure out of "pragmatism tradition and ignorance quite frankly " after years leading union missionary baptist church in chesapeake ohio the rev bob barbour stopped preaching about tithing a few years ago he now promotes what he calls "grace giving" a voluntary unspecified amount because he says it squares better with scripture the church still receives enough to cover expenses he says and if it falls short so be it "you cant beat people over the heads " during a staff discussion two years ago about the &# million annual budget the pastor the rev mark engel said that he expected employees to give of their gross income to the church and to teach congregants to do the same the denomination an offshoot of the quaker faith has long urged members to tithe employee kevin rohr earned &# a year organizing activities for young adults and had a wife and four children to support he told the pastor in a letter that christians are not required to tithe within months he quit his job mr engel declined to discuss the details of mr rohrs employment but said "the expectation is that every member of the staff should fulfill the commitment they made to preach and practice the doctrines" of the denomination mr rohr is now supporting his family by driving trucks he says he still believes what he wrote to mr engel "all decisions to give and how much to give are between the believer and their god not meant to be used as stumbling blocks or judgments against others "
