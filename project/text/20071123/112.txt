will it be sadat or arafat at annapolis the annapolis conference for which extravagant preparations have been under way for months is reminiscent of an anxious hostess searching for a theme to a party she wishes to throw without actually knowing who to invite who might attend or what will be the theme to celebrate or the occasion to mark global view nov anwar sadat had no such uncertainties when he faced the realities of the egyptian economic political and military condition and decided to go to jerusalem his message was "no more war" and he was received in jerusalem in november by menachem begin with an open fulsome and conciliatory response leading to the camp david agreement in where the details of sadats message were implemented it is time for the arab world to engage in the same calculus as did sadat and recognize that "no more war" is the only message that might give any promise of accomplishment to the annapolis meeting without it any conference or series of discussions will follow the familiar pattern of declarations and perhaps some "confidence building measures" of no material significance israel should demand that as a predicate to its attendance at annapolis the arab world must convincingly demonstrate that it accepts israels right to exist forswears any intention to destroy the jewish state and agrees that arab refugees from prior wars may return only to areas that will be included in the anticipated palestinian state when it is permitted to emerge without those assurances israel should not accept a conference that might agree on abstract concessions that will only become the starting points of demands when future negotiations occur unless the arab world and its acolytes and supporters accept an "end of conflict" to the arab israel struggle the status quo will not be altered in such a case the palestinian people will face the continuation of a declining economy decaying society and absence of hope in contrast israel has demonstrated that despite continuing assaults by arab terrorists and the launching of missiles and bombs at its cities it has been able to assure its people of reasonable safety and security expand its economy and strengthen its society in every respect it is for the arab world to choose whether they will follow the path of sadat or of arafat having lost no opportunity to lose an opportunity for the advancement of peace one cannot be too optimistic that the arab world will make the right choice kenneth j bialkin chairman america israel friendship league new york
