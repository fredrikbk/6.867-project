counting on kindergartners like him to help rejuvenate the sport adrenaline sports from vertical skateboarding to bmx racing may be all the rage but the original one skydiving has fallen on hard times as air traffic increases and small airports become encroached by suburban sprawl skydiving centers or "drop zones " are being crowded out while the sport is still relatively cheap soaring fuel prices

center in lebanon ohio is trying to boost the sports image by donating more than tandem jumps to charities each year and won permission from the uspa and a parachute manufacturer to take terminally ill children as young as on tandem skydives "people think its just an asinine activity that you risk your life for " says skydiving coach dan brodsky chenfeld who works at the perris valley skydiving center miles east of los angeles mr brodsky chenfeld who once suffered a broken neck in a plane crash says skydiving should be seen as a serious sport that requires focus and dedication the sports most ambitious initiative is opening "vertical wind tunnels " giant tubes with fans on the floor that blow fast enough to keep people afloat in shopping centers and at drop zones across the country while many of the customers are adults children who are too young to jump out of planes can practice the sport safely for about &# a session there are wind tunnels open across the country and at least five more being built in cities including philadelphia toronto east rutherford n j kansas city kan and austin texas skydive arizona opened an indoor center for all ages in september with a swimming

shorts and cleats throw on their helmets and flying suits and jump back in the minivan "i dont usually have much time to cook dinner " says ms tinucci the tunnel which looks like a spaceship has four fans of up to horsepower that can produce a mph wind current they create enough wind resistance and noise to simulate free fall some beginners sprawl on the floor and give the technician a thumbs up to start the fans more advanced flyers like the tinuccis just hurl themselves though the door with the fans already blowing starting position is arms out belly down about feet in the air but maneuvers include spinning flying head down or shooting up as high as feet to the metal grate at the top of the tunnel the first time he and his sister tried it "we were like whoa " says justin tinucci a fourth grader "we got addicted and went again and again " last week the flying tinuccis helped open the new ifly tunnel at universal studios and in march justin will go to bedford england to compete in a tunnel with some of the worlds top professional skydivers hell be sponsored by energy drink maker go fast and helmet company sky systems "before we started skydiving we had no chance of being famous "
