weekend journal sports by the numbers spreading the wealth its been a topsy turvy season in college football so far with a new prime contender for the jan national championship game in new orleans emerging almost every weekend thanks to an uncommonly large number of significant upsets the past six weeks have seen six different teams ranked first or second in the bowl championship series standings why has there been such upheaval in the sports top echelons some of it has to do with perennial powers such as usc making unexpected early exits from title contention but the underlying reason has to do with greater parity throughout college football and that parity finds its roots in the changes and improvements in high school football call it the friday night lights effect kansas which took over the no spot when oregon was upset by arizona on nov has been a key beneficiary of this trend its sophomore quarterback todd reesing has played only games at the college level but hes already established himself as one of the nations top passers why was mr reesing able to step in and be so effective so soon because of the preparation he received in high school at lake travis high in austin texas he worked out of a pro style spread offense and put up mind boggling numbers in his senior year he passed for yards and touchdowns during a game season hes just the kind of signal caller that most head coaches covet with one exception his height or lack thereof mr reesing stands feet inches was a possible reason why most of the major football powers passed on him at kansas he was redshirted his freshman year but came in against colorado and led his team to three touchdowns this year hes thrown for yards touchdowns and yards per attempt kansas has scored points in its last three games including points against nebraska the highest total ever scored against the school these numbers along with the jayhawks emergence as a national power have established mr reesing as a dark horse candidate for the heisman trophy and its mr reesings high school background in the spread offense that at least partly accounts for his effectiveness at the college level the offensive system on which he cut his signal calling teeth just happens to also be the one used by the kansas jayhawks popularized by rich rodriguez at west virginia the spread offense was also the weapon that kentucky used to hand top ranked lsu its only loss this season this attack operates often without a huddle and the quarterback often lines up in the shotgun position with no more than one running back depending heavily on keeping the defense off balance the spread promotes parity because its a great equalizer of physical talent because the spread allows him to pass outside the pocket mr reesings size isnt much of a factor while the precocious ability to see the field that he developed during his high school years is a huge asset the spread offense does have an achilles heel however it is based on perfect execution by skill players rather than the physical dominance exerted by the top teams with a traditional running game this can result in a delicate balance between the players on the offensive squad one that can make spread offense teams especially vulnerable to upsets when a key player drops out of the picture oregon another team that runs a spread offense relied heavily on versatile quarterback dennis dixon when mr dixon suffered a season ending injury to an already damaged knee it cost the team not simply a win against arizona but quite likely a shot at the national championship so as they wind down their season against missouri this saturday with a possible big championship game on dec kansas hopes to avoid the problems that have befallen the seasons previous no teams the key to doing so will likely be a quarterback who took his high school lessons to heart
