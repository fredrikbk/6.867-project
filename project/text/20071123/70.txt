slow motion u s private equity kings negotiate a maze in japan carlyle phone deal was hung up for two years avoiding vulture tag tokyo with the u s private equity boom stalled by lenders new stinginess japan where banks are eager to lend and many businesses are ripe for restructuring would seem fertile new ground for the buyout firms yet consider the experience of carlyle group six years ago the washington d c based private equity firm set out to acquire a small japanese mobile phone company that was languishing the targets revenue was falling its technology was seen as outdated and a conglomerate that owned it was showing scant interest in the business now here was carlyle willing to pay more than a billion dollars for the enterprise yet it took carlyle two years to persuade the parent company to sell carlyle clinched a deal only when it brought in a japanese corporate partner and agreed not to do layoffs at the target company then to gain the trust of the companys skeptical employees a carlyle executive took a desk among its salespeople and even occasionally called on prospective clients himself japan has a surfeit of candidates for restructuring while carlyles long effort is now bearing fruit the firms experience shows why the second largest economy remains such a tricky place for private equity investors who often buy public companies and restructure them hoping to resell them later for big profits the buyout opportunities here result from japanese conglomerates rush to expand over recent decades in doing so they accumulated sprawling portfolios of businesses sometimes with little evident regard to whether these fit their core strategies japanese companies trail overseas competitors on a host of benchmarks including return on equity a measure of how effective a company is at generating profits from its assets japanese companies have an average roe of just under the global average is more than now international competition and more demanding shareholders are pressuring these companies to streamline some such as sanyo electric co have started to do so in a restructuring led by goldman sachs group inc the diversified manufacturer has shed a finance unit and has tried to sell a weak semiconductor business but many japanese companies still cant overcome a reluctance to sell parts of their business a move that is often seen as an admission of failure they are particularly hesitant to sell to private equity firms which are often derided here as "vultures" that use ruthless downsizing tactics while the number of private equity deals in japan has risen it is still tiny compared with the level in the u s and europe there were private equity deals in japan last year double the number in according to data tracker dealogic but the total value of last years deals in japan was just &# billion a sliver of the &# billion in the u s "you have to be incredibly patient and show the company that you bring more to the table than money " says michael marshall chief executive of pineridge partners kk a private equity firm that has bought japanese companies since mr marshall an american co founded pineridge with a japanese partner but the majority of its employees are japanese and it has its headquarters in tokyo it sticks to a few sectors such as audio equipment and resorts so it can bring expertise to target companies the firm uses businesses it has acquired to make subsequent purchases so the deals feel more like industry mergers than private equity acquisitions until recently the few western private equity firms that set foot in japan got reputations as bottom feeders one u s firm ripplewood holdings shocked japans genteel business society in as it restructured a nationalized lender that it renamed shinsei bank the banks new management team refused to lend to a troubled department store which ultimately collapsed that was unthinkable for japanese banks which were expected to serve society and not just their own business interests carlyle opened its tokyo office in as japans decadelong slump sagged toward its low point carlyle was determined to be less controversial when it raised money for its japan fund carlyle limited the amount taken from non japanese investors to less than half the fund believing it would be more readily accepted if local investors were seen as the primary beneficiaries of any takeover in carlyle recruited masato marumo who had helped start a private equity department at the quasi governmental industrial bank of japan the year old had become interested in private equity when he was sent to harvard to get an m b a once at carlyle mr marumo was intrigued by a subsidiary of the big japanese mobile phone company kddi corp the subsidiary ddi pocket had a technology developed in japan as an alternative to cellphones called personal handyphone system or phs it offered good voice quality at a fifth the price of cellphone service by using a network of relatively simple and low cost antennas that communicated with the phones over very short ranges but phs worked poorly in moving cars and trains dropped calls were routine although the system initially gained ground after its introduction in it lost favor when the price of cellphone service eased two other japanese companies that offered phs eventually stopped doing so kddi too largely lost interest as its own cellphone business grew kddi considered closing down ddi pocket according to people familiar with the situation but mr marumo saw promise in it he believed the phs technology could catch on with budget conscious business users in japan where cellphone service was unusually expensive in september carlyle approached kddi about acquiring ddi pocket kddi was uncomfortable selling to carlyle like many big japanese companies it felt responsible for the fate of its subsidiaries employees and it questioned a private equity firms commitment to the telecom business say the people familiar with the situation kddi officials declined to comment for this article as months went by carlyle executives in the u s suggested that mr marumo move on he stood firm he noticed the popularity of an existing cheap flat rate data plan for laptop computers and thought that a flat rate plan might boost the mobile phone service as well to entice kddi to sell mr marumo and his boss tamotsu adachi recruited kyocera corp a supplier and shareholder of kddi to co invest in a takeover of the kddi subsidiary they also told kddi it could retain a stake a tactic sometimes used in japan to allow a seller to feel as if it hasnt completely abandoned a business more than two years after negotiations began an eternity in the world of private money carlyle announced a &# billion deal to buy ddi pocket with kyocera and kddi as co investors carlyle took the biggest chunk at the time june it was the second biggest private equity transaction in japan after ripplewoods buyout of japan telecom it came at an awkward moment just weeks before ripplewood had sold japan telecom to an internet company after owning it only seven months the "flip" raised questions about the commitment of private equity funds to companies they buy ripplewoods large profit more than four times what it had paid renewed criticism that private equity funds were only interested in a quick buck this caused many japanese who often feel an emotional attachment to their companies to bristle ddi pocket employees wondered if carlyle would act the same way to ease concerns following the buyout mr marumo went on what he calls a "caravan tour" to visit all of the companys major offices and promised that carlyle had a long term plan carlyle pledged to retain all ddi pocket employees keep existing management and continue to hold most meetings in japanese mr marumo expected a hostile reception but instead found a demoralized group many offices hadnt had a visit from executives of former parent kddi in more than two years ddi pocket had just of the japanese mobile phone market and was adding only a few thousand customers a month while cellular operators were gaining hundreds of thousands to lift morale mr marumo and his team set up a contest to pick a new name for the company the winner was "willcom " suggestive of both the companys resolve to thrive and its technology called wireless local loop the employee who submitted the winning suggestion was a longtime facilities manager at the company "we really wanted all employees to participate in one exercise to make them feel like they were all in it together " says mr marumo a pensive man who chooses his words carefully even though the business had lost money many willcom employees remained passionate about the company among them was masaki kikugawa an executive who believed in the potential of the phs technology and saw expanding its use as his mission he had tried and failed to persuade kddi to invest in the business watching in frustration as it turned south and kddis interest waned to mr kikugawa carlyles takeover was an opportunity to give phs another push although carlyle enforced more discipline about meeting deadlines and required a more thorough analysis of the market the firm has let willcom figure out its own strategy to meet the new goals "carlyles ownership has made us freer to do what we want " says mr kikugawa whom carlyle made president of the newly renamed willcom he adds that he identifies with the fighting spirit of carlyles mr marumo mr kikugawa gave carlyle a sales boosting idea hed been hesitant to bring up with kddi because it might draw customers away from kddis main business cellular service the idea was to offer japans first flat rate calling plan allowing subscribers to call other willcom customers as much as they wanted for a monthly fee of &# the plan was possible because phs technology costs are lower than traditional cellular networks people in japan pay some of the worlds highest mobile phone bills giving the flat rate plan a lot of potential carlyles mr marumo liked the idea his concern was that adding customers costs money in the short run marketing fees and the need for big discounts on handsets cut into revenue so in the near term the flat rate plan would probably mean a decline in willcoms cash flow private equity firms generally dont want to see that because they need cash to pay off the big loans customarily taken out to buy companies and carlyle executives in the u s balked at the flat rate plan mr marumo flew to washington armed with a stack of long term sales projections to plead his case with a carlyle co founder david rubenstein after hours of strenuous discussions mr marumo got his way willcom introduced the plan in may mr rubenstein acknowledges the decision was difficult but says the company got it right "although the flat rate plan by willcom seemed to be a risky move we saw opportunities " mr rubenstein said in an email "it was not the first time we gave up short term gains in search of longer term success " meanwhile mr marumo got involved in restructuring the willcom sales force kddi hadnt pushed the force hard mr marumo says and it called on prospective customers randomly after the takeover the team moved more methodically concentrating on six industries that had traveling sales representatives who needed to transmit lots of data mr marumo took a desk amid a big room full of willcom salespeople where he could evaluate the teams performance and identify the most successful members he called weekly meetings at which employees practiced sales pitches on one another and made a personal pitch to an acquaintance at an insurance company the team gradually began to generate sales at companies such as lawson inc a convenience store operator which bought more than phone contracts the number of customers has grown since the flat rate plan was introduced to million as of june while willcom remains a niche player with about market share its sudden growth came as a jolt to a complacent japanese mobile phone industry the no player softbank corp responded by introducing an all you can use plan for calls between its cellular customers during set times the major players ntt docomo inc and kddi responded by cutting their cellphone prices sharply freed from the limits of being a secondary subsidiary in a giant company willcom began to take more risks to launch products and services despite the conventional wisdom that "smart phones" with keyboards and pc capabilities dont sell in japan willcom has succeeded with a sleek model developed with sharp corp now ntt docomo and softbank are following with their own smart phones willcom executives say theyre busy coming up with new ideas willcom is investing in its technology by adding more antennas so calls arent dropped as often it is developing next generation networks with higher speed internet access and is considered a strong contender for one of two new wireless licenses that the government will issue next month carlyle plans to sell shares of the company to the public a move that should provide the payoff after a decision on the license has been made for mr marumo willcom has turned into "our showcase deal " he says "it has really gotten our investment team here off the ground "
