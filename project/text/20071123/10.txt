burrito chain assembles a winning combo ignoring fast food formula chipotle promotes service costly natural ingredients look at enough billboards for chipotle mexican grill inc and youll detect an omission they never show a bare burrito instead chipotle displays its signature item enclosed in foil "you can never make the perfect burrito for someone " explains william espey the companys creative services manager "if you keep it wrapped its their perfect burrito " chipotle mexican grill has arguably become the countrys most successful fast food chain in recent years by rejecting almost every major technique on which the industry was built not only does it not show the product it doesnt advertise on television it doesnt franchise it has some of the highest ingredient costs in the industry and its executives arent especially concerned that customers wait as long as minutes in lines that routinely stretch out the door nonetheless chipotles shares have more than doubled in the past year making it the best performing publicly held u s restaurant chain and while traditional fast food chains are posting same store sales growth in the low single digits chipotle has increased its same store sales at a double digit rate each year for almost a decade but chipotle founder steve ells has a more ambitious goal as well mr ells the companys chairman and chief executive hopes that like chipotle other fast food chains will pressure suppliers to raise animals more naturally and humanely and produce ingredients in a way that is more environmentally sustainable an approach he calls "food with integrity " mr ells opened the first chipotle in in an attempt to put a new twist on the taquerias he visited while working as a sous chef in san francisco having trained at the culinary institute of america in hyde park n y mr ells planned to use the eatery to make enough money to open a fine dining restaurant to set chipotle apart he modified the burritos to include more upscale ingredients like rice with freshly chopped cilantro and steak marinated for hours he set workers up in an assembly line so that customers can see the burritos being put together and order their own combinations and he gave the restaurants minimalist interiors with blond wood tables and corrugated metal artwork to help build a following the companys then public relations director passed out free burritos to reporters covering the trial of oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh which took place in chipotles hometown of denver the chain still relies heavily on giveaways instead of traditional ads on halloween it gave away a free burrito taco or salad to any customer who came in dressed as one of those items in when chipotle had locations mr ells sold part of the company to mcdonalds corp it was an unlikely move given the disparaging things mr ells says about mainstream fast food "traditional fast food has become little more than fuel " he says but mcdonalds had capital that would help chipotle grow and agreed to give mr ells autonomy it invested about &# million in chipotle altogether last year mr ells took chipotle public and mcdonalds shed its interest brett conway a year old salesman for r r donnelley &amp sons co in chicago says he goes to chipotle a couple of times a month in part because the meat is naturally raised "it always tastes fresh " says mr conway who usually orders a carnitas burrito or a "burrito bol" a burrito served in a bowl without the tortilla topped with hot salsa guacamole cheese and lettuce chipotle has about locations now and it plans to add at least next year by comparison mcdonalds has outlets and in the mexican arena yum brands inc s taco bell has u s locations but while chipotle executives refer to their fare as fast food it is often considered part of a new group of restaurants called "fast casual" that includes panera bread co and other eateries with more attractive interiors and food that is slightly higher priced than the offerings at burger chains chipotle intends to open its first non u s location in canada next year and is looking at developing outlets in london paris and frankfurt of course consumers are fickle when it comes to restaurants making it difficult for chains to maintain success over time chipotles narrow menu could make it hard for the chain to hold customers interest but mr ells argues that the menu is more varied than it appears because of the many ways in which the ingredients can be combined the chains founder says he sees potential for chipotle to do in fast food what whole foods market inc has done in the grocery industry popularize natural foods by selling them in an appealing environment but chipotle hasnt been able to secure as much naturally raised meat as it would like ann daniels the executive director of purchasing says the company simply cant get suppliers to produce enough a quarter of the beans chipotle serves are organic it has started buying some locally grown peppers onions and cilantro and serving dairy products from "pasture raised cows " which it says have spent less time in confinement than cows on most large dairy farms mr ells is concerned that the restaurants remain affordable the burritos already cost about &# which becomes more challenging as the chain upgrades its ingredients and he notes the company cares more about where the ingredients come from than most of its customers do chipotle knows it has a problem with long lines at peak times the chain has videotaped as many as people walking away from a single location in one hour because they werent willing to wait at a chicago chipotle during lunch recently about people were waiting to order spilling out the doorway onto the sidewalk cusandra mcfolley a year old legal assistant stepped into the line then turned away after about a minute she and a friend had already walked away from another chipotle three blocks away because the line there was too long "every time i come i do the same thing walk away " ms mcfolley said chipotles president and chief operating officer monty moran says the company has been trying to speed up the lines by installing automatic change machines at cash registers and using handheld credit card devices to take orders from customers in line it also is placing greater emphasis on its restaurant managers paying them annual salaries and bonuses that total in the six figures but executives say that while the lines are long they move quickly and "we dont ever want it to be speed over great service " mr moran says
