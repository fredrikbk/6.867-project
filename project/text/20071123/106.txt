weekend journal the home front the upside to the downturn contractors return calls materials cost less mr bowess half price renovation its not the best time to be selling a house in much of the country but increasingly its a good time to build or renovate one the housing slump has pushed down prices on everything from lumber and drywall to labor and design fees legions of carpenters tile layers and landscapers are idle architects are taking on small renovation projects they once would have sniffed at and contractors are offering their services at a discount some people in the building trades are even posting fliers at construction sites to drum up business its a striking contrast from the heady days of the real estate boom when builders and contractors could hardly keep pace with demand prices of materials soared and a six month wait to start a kitchen renovation was commonplace now some homeowners are moving forward on renovation or building projects theyve put off for years others are exacting substantial price cuts from contractors desperate for work a few months ago mike bowes remodeled the bathroom and guest bedroom of his &# condo in las vegas the job which cost &# included a walk in shower a new vanity bamboo flooring in the guest room and retextured plaster on the walls and ceilings last year the same work would have cost nearly twice as much he estimates "and i would have had to beg someone to do it " now the year old commercial roofing sales manager is planning to upgrade his kitchen living room and porch while prices remain low "im going to keep going " he says even small repair jobs once the province of independent plumbers electricians and handymen are getting scooped up by larger firms when a bathroom pipe burst at the home of julie gebhardt a schoolteacher in manchester mich she called a local builder for a referral instead the firm peters building co said it would take the job itself the company needs the work says president jim haeussler before the slump the company built to houses a year to sell on the market at &# to &# so far this year it has built just houses mr haeussler says the joint center for housing studies at harvard university estimates that million homes will be built this year in the u s down from just over two million in on tuesday the commerce department said construction of single family houses fell in october from a year earlier meantime more homeowners will renovate their kitchens this year million up from million in but they will spend a lot less &# billion compared with &# billion according to the national kitchen &amp bath association bathroom renovations this year are expected to rise by to million from while spending on them will grow to &# billion from the trade group projects one reason some renovations will cost less this year is the falling price of many key building materials the price of oriented strand board a plywood substitute used for walls and roof sheathing dropped from the third quarter of to the same quarter this year according to the national association of home builders during the same period framing lumber prices fell says the association and drywall prices which soared during the real estate run up to a record dropped from last years third quarter according to united states gypsum co the largest manufacturer of drywall in north america "if youre going to do any kind of construction now is the best time youre going to have to do that in the next five years " says bill harrison of harrison design associates an atlanta based architecture firm that specializes in high end homes its also a good time to be shopping for an architect bryan jones of jones pierce architects also of atlanta says his person company used to concentrate on remodeling jobs valued between &# and &# but now he says inquiries about new projects are down by nearly half from a year ago and the firm is taking on smaller jobs to make up for the lost work "were chasing stuff we definitely wouldnt have done a year ago " he says the same goes for builders after russ nank jr s three bedroom ranch house in rock creek ohio burned down last year he snagged payne &amp payne builders a cleveland based firm to erect a four bedroom cape cod style home the firm took on the &# project even though it was located outside its usual territory and was about one third the size of its usual jobs "the timing could not have been better for us " mr nank says adding that he was able to afford a bigger home with more costly upgrades including hickory cabinets and granite counters than he had expected two years ago says company co owner dave payne he would have politely declined such a project "we had a map we had a line and we didnt go outside of that line " he says of his company which is about miles from rock creek but as he watched his list of prospective projects shrivel to five from last fall mr payne says he threw out the rules in april his company even built a &# one room addition for one client "were chasing every lead " he says not all parts of the country have been affected equally builders in seattle new york and los angeles where the job and housing markets have remained firm report business as usual and many architects who specialize in high end homes say they are as busy as ever but the picture is much different in states like nevada florida and arizona building hotbeds during the housing boom that have since gone bust the same is true in midwestern states such as michigan and ohio particularly hard hit by foreclosures and subprime mortgage defaults in these areas builders contractors and landscapers say theyre watching their backlog of work shrink to a few weeks from months as new projects dry up amid the flurry of competitive pricing from hungry builders comes a warning for homeowners prices that seem too good to be true very well might be "if somebodys low balling it theyre probably cutting out something thats important and you need to know what it is " says deborah pierce an architect in newton mass this spring nicki tragesser of atwater calif started building a square foot two story addition for her ranch house she had called contractors and chosen the one who gave the cheapest estimate after being impressed by a house hed just finished "i felt flabbergasted he was only going to charge me &# for what i wanted " ms tragesser says only after she signed a contract did she learn that she would have to purchase an air conditioning unit herself and pay an electrician separately to do the wiring and that was just the beginning four months after construction should have wrapped up her cement floors are cracking the flooring upstairs is uneven and doors hang lopsided on their hinges the contractor has quit and ms tragesser spent an extra &# trying to correct his work the contractor didnt return a call seeking comment but others have used their newfound bargaining edge to their advantage amy and bob phillips of tucson ariz began work on a four bedroom adobe style house in february with newly lower pricing on a variety of items including stucco wood and labor the phillips were able to afford upgrades such as solid wood doors glass doorknobs and steel garage doors on their &# budget while their builder did most of the bargaining on materials for the house the couple bid out a backyard pool themselves by pressuring contractors to lower their bids the phillipses have knocked &# off the cost "were definitely playing people off each other and theyre definitely dropping their prices " says mrs phillips a convention planner
