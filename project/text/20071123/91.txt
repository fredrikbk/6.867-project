weekend journal catalog critic no crumbs for christmas the holiday season is a time of nonstop socializing and celebrating but therein lies the rub or rather the mess of crumbs under the buffet table fortunately a new wave of cordless hand vacuums can solve the problem unlike the handy but not quite powerful enough models of a previous generation the new models not only promise to up the suction factor they also bring some styling into play so that the vac need not be banished to a garage or storage closet last year dirt devil released its kone cordless floor vac designed by karim rashid it proved so popular that it paved the way this year for the kurv cordless hand vac "a simple elegant shape that you can proudly display in any room " the company touts another heralded model the dyson dc root which was introduced a year ago its patented root cyclone technology promises "no loss of suction " a company spokesman says sales "exceed our expectations " to see if the latest vacs lived up to the hype we bought five models and put them to the test both in our home on carpeted and tile surfaces and car to make matters more interesting we came up with our own "holiday dirt mix" bits of potato chips torn wrapping paper and other detritus and sprinkled it around the house we quickly learned that styling and suction will get you only so far in cleaning a holiday mess the dirt devil kurv whose curvaceous design may turn heads failed to win our vote its nozzle wasnt wide enough forcing us to go over areas again and again and the dyson dc root yes its got the suction but we found it somewhat impractical because of its bulky shape and bothersome on off mechanism you have to keep your finger on the trigger if you want the unit to operate continually another model that proved frustrating the black &amp decker cordless volt hand vac its a behemoth of a machine powerful and feature rich we liked the fact that it folds for easier storage but its weight isnt distributed evenly enough its too heavy in the back so it had a tendency to slide around in our hands with the readivac volt cordless hand vac a model thats more streamlined but still plenty strong in the suction department one of the main drawbacks was something altogether different an unpleasant smell like burning rubber coming from the motor in the end our pick for best overall and best value was the shark cordless hand vac sv &# from goodmans it may have not been as sexy or as powerful as some of the other models but it did the job thanks to a motorized brush head the only tested unit with such a feature that worked very well on carpeted surfaces and a crevice tool that let us clean hard to reach places such as in between sofa cushions or in the tracks of our sliding doors the holiday crumbs never stood a chance shark cordless hand vac sv volts goodmans best overall and best value goodmans net &# priority shipping cost &# ground cost &# the good a relatively powerful machine that has an advantage over the others because of its detachable motorized brush which makes cleaning carpeted surfaces a breeze a crevice tool that gets into hard to reach places is another plus the bad this was the only unit to come without a charging station or dock a spokesman for the manufacturer says that an earlier version of the vac included a charging station but "it was a piece that got lost as opposed to being a benefit" for product users the shopping you can buy the vac directly from the manufacturer sharkcompany com but it costs more &# and takes longer to ship black &amp decker cordless volt hand vac wal mart walmart com &# expedited shipping cost &# standard cost &# the good with volts of power this had plenty of suction its other noteworthy features included two settings for

good a relatively lightweight unit with strong suction wattage not provided and mess free cleanup plus it doesnt require filter replacement the bad its also a bit bulky the unit looks like a mini leaf blower making it more cumbersome to operate and you cant switch it on and let it go you need to keep your finger on the trigger company spokesman says the trigger function is the "best solution for
