weekend journal review film wide eyed glee refreshing wit lift enchanted adams is delightful dylan stays elusive in sluggish im not there like the cinderella figure she plays in disneys "enchanted " amy adams spreads a contagion of delight the movie is great fun but shes enchanting this is one of those performances that announces in the fullest sense of the term the arrival of a star the announcement is made initially via animation the story begins as a seemingly classic hand painted disney cartoon but with a cantering spirit of self parody that the director kevin lima reins in safely this side of camp amy adams is the voice of giselle a commoner singing ever so tremulously and snow whitely about true love to a twittering audience of forest animals that includes her favorite chipmunk pip already ms adamss performance is audacious in its fruitcake ardor yet thats only a token of whats to come when giselle on the day shes to marry a charming prince is banished by his stepmother a wicked queen to a place where there are no happy ever afters i e live action manhattan which she enters as an extralegal alien through a con ed steam tunnel beneath times square the film plays each of its worlds against the other its lovely to see a hitherto animated about to be princess plunked down or rather hurtled up into what passes for urban reality where she natters on about how her silkworm friends made her voluminous wedding gown though the rabbits did help with the sewing but the conceit succeeds as well as it does almost totally because the star sustains it with a tonal delicacy and poise worthy of the young julie andrews who made a pretty popular picture for disney a while ago and who provides the narrators voice in this one giselle thinks indoor plumbing is magical i thought the movie was magical when giselle having chanced to meet robert a handsome single father and about to be married divorce lawyer played by patrick dempsey summons an animated battalion of local animals for a thorough cleaning of his riverside drive apartment and for a gleeful variation on the theme of "whistle while you work" or when she strolls with him through central park bursts uncontrollably into song alan menken and stephen schwartz did the original score and soon has the parks human population singing and dancing with her ms adamss triumph wont come as a complete surprise to those few who saw "junebug " a small distinctive film in which she played with heartbreaking eloquence a pregnant young woman lost in a bad marriage and foolish dreams still that performance could not have predicted the variety and electrifying energy of this one any more than mr limas direction of disneys animated feature "tarzan" could have predicted the verve and confidence of his live action work here he directed from an original screenplay by bill kelly and "enchanted " for all of its amiable borrowings and occasional stumbles truly is alive the film doesnt feel corporate formulaic or machine made except for a hyperventilating climax with an overwrought dragon and for roberts needlessly unpleasant fiancee and giselles rival played by idina menzel a striking departure from disneys conventional calibrations this family entertainment treats the subject of love and marriage with sophisticated wit at one point theres even a brief discussion of irony but the key word is striking contemporary audiences will find the film refreshingly new movie lovers with longer memories may find affecting resonances between wide eyed giselle trying to figure out the love games suddenly revised rules and josh the bewildered boy in a mans body played by tom hanks in "big " or jeff danielss befuddled tom baxter the explorer who steps out of the movie screen in "the purple rose of cairo " the prince of the piece edward is played by james marsden for a while i wondered if hed be able to hold his own in a role that isnt fully written edward leaves animation land to find his fiancee only to run into a succession of real life troubles that often depend on slapstick but the actor is consistently likable and its perfectly fine that edward functions mainly as a hunky buffoon susan sarandon gives evil her best and very funny shot as the voice of the wicked queen while nathaniel the princes servant is played by timothy spall a virtuoso of the grotesque mr spall looks animated in the flesh im not there one of the revelations of "no direction home " martin scorseses documentary about bob dylan was the extent to which the young dylan internalized the persona and the milieu as well as the music of woody guthrie todd hayness counterpart to that film "im not there " takes a surreal approach to extending the observation that dylan has internalized many artists and many of their qualities in the course of his remarkable career theres literally no dylan on screen in this dylan film though the sound track abounds in his songs because some of the singers salient qualities not just influences but essences are represented by six different actors including christian bale richard gere heath ledger and cate blanchett its an intriguing stunt and ambitious in its effort to speak to the mystery of identity but a stunt nevertheless one that wears out its welcome with sluggish pacing excessive length and some secondary performances of surprising clumsiness theres nothing clumsy though about edward lachmans cinematography its revelatory from start to finish margot at the wedding nicole kidman plays a psyche killer in "margot at the wedding " a new film by noah baumbach his debut feature was "the squid and the whale " ms kidman is margot zeller an acerbic writer who shows up by surprise at the wedding of her estranged sister pauline jennifer jason leigh and promptly lays waste to everyone around her maybe margot has a borderline personality disorder maybe not but she observes no boundaries in her infinite narcissism and shes come to the right place since pauline whos about to marry a petulant corpulent child played cheerlessly by jack black can give as bad as she gets when it comes to sibling rivalry mr baumbachs concern is as in his previous film the family romance and mutual need but "margot" is unsparing and ultimately punishing in its insistence on the psychodynamics of dysfunction its not as if this gifted filmmaker is running on empty you just wish hed find an alternative fuel dvd tip julianne moore is the anguished isolate carol white in todd hayness "safe" a surreal drama of suburbia that could be called "im almost not there " carol thinks her problems stem from the environment that shes a victim of fumes and noise and toxic substances the movie suggests that its deeper than that a case of contemporary anomie that cant be cured by filters or new age retreats i didnt much like "safe" when it came out but the film has stuck in my mind i should take my own recommendation and see it again
