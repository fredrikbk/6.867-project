the end game clinton hits rough patch as iowa showdown nears rivals strike from left as she courts center responsibility gene ballston va as hillary clinton huddled with advisers not long ago she was pressed to stake a position popular with the partys left leaning voters on one issue but the presidential front runner resisted it wasnt her position "if i do what you all want me to do ill look great for the next couple months " she said according to one insiders account "but what if im the nominee ill be ripped apart by the republicans and what if im the president my hands will be tied " the new york senators response captured the tension at the core of her month old presidential bid and helps illuminate why she has hit a dangerously bumpy stretch as januarys first nominating votes near sen clinton actually is running two campaigns at once courting left leaning democrats to get the nomination but mindful even now of maintaining a sufficiently centrist course to withstand republican attacks and win election next november beyond that sen clinton views her campaign as a template for her possible presidency having witnessed bill clintons early struggles reconciling campaign promises with governing and guided by his private advice now she knows first hand that what candidates say now for political points can haunt them as president close advisers call this caution her "responsibility gene " the result as the front runner sen clinton has drawn attacks from democratic rivals at a crucial moment on topics ranging from iran to taxes even while holding positions that could serve her well in a general election campaign or as president she will be tested further with four more democratic debates in december before the ultimate test in the opening nominating contest jan in iowa in two recent polls of likely iowa caucus goers sen clinton was slightly ahead in one but her chief rival illinois sen barack obama had retaken the edge in the other a decisive clinton victory in iowa potentially could clinch the nomination a loss or even a close call makes her vulnerable in the states that follow no first time candidate before has juggled these conflicting considerations in quite this way because none has ever run from sen clintons unique position she is far ahead in national polls for the nomination her party is favored in polls to win the presidential election and she has personal experience moving from campaign trail to white house typically presidential candidates go a step at a time focusing like lasers on the nomination pivoting to the center only when its in hand and worrying about promises made once inside the west wing sen clintons aides said she was unavailable for an interview but interviews with numerous advisers associates and even republicans attested to her success this year in methodically building her lead over rival democrats with tireless stumping and discipline she gained ground by taking rough edges off her imperious image and promoting her experience and competence in the process persuading many doubting democrats that she is "electable " now her party foes are nervous and even desperate as the days dwindle to the first potentially make or break vote in iowa the only state where polls show a tight race they are all firing at her aiming where she is most vulnerable her reputation as too cautious and calculating stoking the conflict are republicans who report their first uptick in donations to party headquarters in many months thanks to a recent stream of "stop hillary" fund raising emails and sen clinton by her own hedging on several issues has provided ammunition the jeopardy for her is that one democrat could emerge from the pack to be the "un hillary " consolidating support from voters to try to deny her the nomination her challenge is to prevent that but without undoing what real progress she has made according to polls in appealing to a broader swath of the electorate its proving a struggle that was evident in recent weeks that included the two most contentious debates in the long series that she and a half dozen other democrats have had this year in both she was thrown on the defensive by the second she had come prepared to give as good as she got but substantively as well as stylistically she faces risks in the coming weeks while any candidate seeking to be commander in chief and certainly a woman must show she can fight her own battles too shrill an attack could erode sen clintons hard won gains at softening her image some of the skills needed to pull this off havent come naturally to sen clinton despite her long exposure to the national limelight she came late in life to a political career of her own and has worked to develop her own voice for example she has never found it easy to give simple answers to questions as first lady she once listened as white house press secretary joe lockhart briefly distilled for president clinton what he the aide would tell reporters about some complex foreign policy news she took him aside afterward he says "how do you do that " she asked "i need to learn how to do that i was trained as a lawyer ive always made an argument in paragraphs i need to learn to speak in sound bites " that was his clue he recalls that she was contemplating a senate run nearly a decade and two senate elections later as sen clinton runs for president her long view from nomination to white house has colored her strategy and her approach to issues from the start it helps explain perhaps her most controversial moves to date her early refusal to apologize for her vote authorizing president bush to use force in iraq and her more recent hard line vote in the senate on iran to designate its elite revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization both stands have been unpopular with democratic caucus and primary voters but campaign supporters say such positions serve to persuade voters more generally that a woman has the strength to be commander in chief and isnt afraid to use force the long view is reflected too in the details of her universal health care plan in addressing not just the needs of the uninsured but also the concerns about health care quality and cost of middle class americans who are insured she convinced many skeptics that she did learn from the clintons failed health care proposal of the mid s in contrast her lack of details on plans for social security global warming and other problems awaiting the next president reflect a wariness of taking stands on taxes for instance that could give republicans ammunition in on trade sen clinton has played to the union voters who are influential in democratic nomination contests shifting to a more protectionist line from the free trade position of her husbands administration but she has not gone so far as rival john edwards the former north carolina senator even in fund raising the clinton campaign from the start encouraged early donors to think ahead to the general election they were asked to give &# the maximum &# for the primaries as well as another &# to be held for fall clinton advisers are adamant that they and their candidate dont take the nomination for granted let alone the election yet even in iowa from the start sen clinton had one eye on the nomination and another on the general election and beyond she started behind in state polls to both mr edwards who had maintained his iowa ties since his second place showing in the presidential caucuses and sen obama who benefited from being a fresh face from next door illinois by october she had pulled ahead of both men in polls of likely caucus goers with frequent campaigning in iowa about trips so far since january sen clinton sought to prove to voters who relish their vetting role that she doesnt take the nomination for granted she followed the model that got her elected twice in new york trying to meet as many people as possible even in republican leaning areas to dispel many voters ice queen image of her but with antiwar sentiment particularly strong among iowa democrats her iraq vote was a liability initially mr edwards apologized for his own iraq vote and pressed sen clinton to do the same she refused even as voters at her early events challenged her and antiwar protesters picketed over time her emphasis on the future promising to end the war as president neutralized the issue polls and voter interviews show chief strategist and pollster mark penn is said to be the main force in the clinton inner circle for thinking ahead to the general election campaign even to the discomfort of some advisers who fret about primary election politics advisers say mr penn argued internally that for sen clinton to apologize or admit a mistake on the war vote would be seen as a sign of weakness for a woman seeking to be commander in chief especially among independents needed in the general election but advisers insist sen clinton went with her own instincts "she was dead set against apologizing dead set against it " says communications director howard wolfson "she didnt think she had anything to apologize for " even democrats who were privately critical for months now say her determined stand was the politically smart move with a discipline rivaling that of george w bushs campaigns sen clinton and her advisers all year have hammered the message that she has the strength and experience to change the nations course their effectiveness is evident in polls and focus groups that show even most republicans give sen clinton high grades for being strong and competent while that would bode well for a general election internally some advisers including some with iowa experience insisted early on that sen clinton also had to work on one other crucial factor just to win the nomination let alone the presidency "some of us would say but theyve got to like you " recalls lorraine voles who along with her husband formerly worked for iowas sen tom harkin "she got it she understood " ms voles has now left the clinton campaign and is an independent consultant sen clinton entered the race last winter with the highest negative poll ratings for likability of any candidate to reintroduce herself in effect to democratic voters and independents sen clinton was routinely scheduled for two hours at each stop one hour for her speech and voters questions another to chat sign autographs and smile for photographs as long as any voter remained while still high her negatives have abated in iowa and nationally now the campaign for the nomination has entered a new and final phase the time for sustained attacks on the front runner before a pre halloween debate in philadelphia her chief rival sen obama announced that he would take a more confrontational stance at the debate the other rivals took jabs as well sen clinton held her own for much of the two hours but hedged on several questions most memorably a late one on whether illegal immigrants should have drivers licenses her response provided a case study in the political and personal crosscurrents that sen clinton is navigating politically a simple "no" to licensing undocumented workers would have undercut her states democratic governor eliot spitzer who had proposed such a plan and it could have alienated democratic hispanic voters who fear that anti immigrant fever is making potential targets of all spanish speakers a "yes " on the other hand would be video fodder for republican attack ads in the general election bill clinton is warning democrats privately against falling into such traps according to some party members he predicts republicans will pound democrats on the immigration issue in the general election because the republican partys traditional strong suit the national security card has been neutralized by president bushs handling of the iraq war but on top of political calculations over licensing illegal immigrants sen clinton the policy wonk is mindful of the arguments that some state and local law enforcement officials have made there are an estimated million undocumented workers in the u s and absent an overhaul of immigration law the many drivers among them should be encouraged to get licensed and insured for public safety that is the policy argument she tried to express at the oct debate to admirers and sometimes frustrated aides such episodes are evidence of the "responsibility gene " "she will not say certain things " says longtime clinton counselor robert barnett "theres a level of responsibility she feels that what she says now should accurately predict what shed do as president " clinton critics see it differently nearly two weeks later sen obama was still seeking advantage at her expense "not answering questions because were afraid our answers wont be popular just wont do it " he told an audience of democrats in iowa that included sen clinton meanwhile under withering attack in new york gov spitzer dropped his hugely unpopular license plan the next day on the eve of another debate sen clinton issued a statement that as president she would oppose licenses for illegal immigrants after two weeks of bad press she arrived at last thursdays debate in las vegas ready to give a flat "no" when the question inevitably came at her again at the outset clinton advisers were wary of such debates front runners have the most to lose in sharing a stage with underdogs gunning for them and the confrontations could provide grist for republican attack ads should she be the nominee yet sen clintons recent debate flap aside the unprecedented number of televised debates proved to be a huge help even rival campaigns acknowledge as she consistently got high marks while few voters watch the debates many hear the reviews for days afterward says mr wolfson "they ended up reinforcing our message one of these people is ready to be president on day one "
