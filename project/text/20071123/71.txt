stem cell breakthrough for almost a decade now embryonic stem cells escs have been heralded as a panacea for a range of ailments from neurological disorders such as parkinsons to failing organs in cancer patients these remarkable cells do have the potential to bring medical advances they can turn into every cell type of the body and can provide a potentially unlimited supply of transplantable cells the trouble has been that esc research came with a heavy price the cells could only be obtained by destroying human embryos this ignited an intensely polarized debate between those opposed to embryo destructive research and others who thought that the therapeutic potential of the work justified the use of human embryos from early on however there were voices stanford universitys william b hurlbut a member of the presidents council on bioethics foremost among them suggesting that this moral and political dispute could have a solution that was both scientifically and ethically acceptable that science could solve the dilemma it created now that hope appears to have been dramatically realized and the landscape has radically changed two major scientific papers published this week in science and cell magazines unveil a proven way to generate patient matched human pluripotent stem cells without human cloning and without the use of human embryos or human or animal eggs researchers have generated "induced pluripotent state" cells with the properties of human embryonic stem cells by direct "reprogramming" of adult cells they produced cells like those derived from embryos but without any ethical controversy reprogramming now allows us to exploit the advantages of embryonic stem cells without destroying human embryos heres how it works adult cells are obtained from a skin biopsy by a procedure no more painful than a blood draw the skin cells are grown in culture and then treated with a combination of four reprogramming factors inserted into the adult cells with a gene therapy virus within two to three weeks the combined effect of these factors converts some of the adult skin cells into induced pluripotent state cells ipscs remarkably ipscs have all the relevant properties that make embryonic stem cells so attractive they grow indefinitely and can produce all cell types the senior scientist of the american team is james thomson who first described human embryonic stem cells in thus his conclusion that ipscs are virtually identical to embryo derived stem cells carries special weight the induced pluripotent cells are actually superior to embryo derived stem cells in one critical respect they are patient specific and hence will not be rejected by the immune system of the person from whom they are derived the ability to generate embryonic stem cells matched to a particular person was the main reason for efforts to produce human embryos by so called therapeutic cloning now even the scientist who generated "dolly" the sheep and developed mammalian cloning ian wilmut from scotland has concluded that direct reprogramming is a superior method for this purpose he recently announced that he is abandoning cloning research and is focusing his efforts on direct reprogramming it should be cautioned that this astonishing breakthrough will not produce immediate cures the therapeutic potential of all human pluripotent stem cells including those generated by direct reprogramming remains uncertain the risk for tumor formation a feature common to all pluripotent stem cells is a grave concern and the risk may be higher in ipscs than in embryo derived stem cells because the genes used for reprogramming remain inserted in the cell in addition the efficient conversion of pluripotent stem cells to transplantable cells that will be useful in the clinic is not yet possible for any human cell type although much progress has been made thus no immediate therapies should be expected from human pluripotent stem cell based therapy either embryo derived or ipsc still pluripotent stem cells have very important uses apart from therapy and here ipscs are clearly superior to embryo derived escs pluripotent stem cells can be used to study "developmental biology in a dish " they enable researchers to observe how human organs and tissues form the insights garnered from such studies are likely to lead to the development of new drugs and strategies which can benefit human health direct reprogramming techniques make it possible to generate pluripotent cells from specific individuals including those with particular diseases it will be possible to make ipscs from children with fanconis anemia a devastating genetic disease and to study the effects of candidate drugs on the formation of human blood these kinds of experiments are now immediately possible and likely will be the first practical application of ipscs the exciting finding that patient specific pluripotent stem cells can be generated easily and efficiently through direct reprogramming without the use of human eggs or the generation of human embryos is a tremendous leap forward science has provided a resolution to the ethical and political debate and all parties emerge victorious scientists have access to an ethically uncompromised source of pluripotent stem cells for research patients may ultimately benefit from therapies using these cells and all citizens are spared the corrosive effects of ongoing cultural warfare over embryo destructive research this new finding offers the best possible outcome to a debate that for too long pitted science and ethics
