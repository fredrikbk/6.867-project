weekend journal review television out of this world nimrod nation" is that rare thing a story of small town life in america that neither looks for nor finds a dark underbelly p m est for the next four mondays on the sundance channel it was filmed during the winter and spring of in watersmeet mich where the heavy snowfalls and sub zero weather of the states remote upper peninsula seem to have frozen time itself set to "fargo" like music in a major key it feels like ibsen without the depression and "napoleon dynamite" without fools the residents of watersmeet are not old fashioned in dress or speech we meet a teenage choirgirl with a bulging unwed belly parents who appear to have been divorced and native americans who feel like outsiders yet away from the nasty brutish world of the cities most townsfolk seem to have grown up incapable of cynicism or guile discovering these innocents preserved as in amber one feels the wonder of an archaeologist who has stumbled upon a lost civilization it is a world whose contours we recognize "nimrod nation" refers to the players and fans of watersmeets school basketball team in which the towns hopes and dreams reside like the nimrod of genesis the locals also are avid hunters through the ice and in the woods where they shoot deer rabbits and birds which children learn to skin and prepare for the table the only apparent mourner at this slaughter is a man who apparently had grown fond of a jolly pig although even the most gun happy redeem themselves by hauling road kill onto a frozen lake to feed a starving eagle youd think that with such a limited menu of activities the young people in particular would be longing to escape yet generations keep on coming in watersmeet the local k school with about students has never been fuller only one girl a senior named hope expresses a desire to fly the coop but her idea of a warmer climate and adventure is no farther away than wisconsin and a degree in cosmetology we get to know hope and most residents in the context of the basketball season where coach george peterson iii father of star guard george iv is hoping to guide the nimrods through another championship year as the season progresses a group of geezers many of whom graduated from the school in the s meets over coffee to analyze the players on game nights away and at home the stands are packed with cheering nimrod fans one mother frustrated by the emphasis on basketball tries to persuade coach peterson who also is the school principal to promote a bowling team somehow we know that this idea like the drama club that puts on a play called "toys r alive " will never amount to more than a sideshow routine life goes on of course parents talk to teachers about their kids grades and college prospects outdoorsman jeff zelinski tries to get a petition going against a lot development on the shores of a favorite lake the cheerleaders get manicures and discuss nimrod center nathan vestich who has wooed and dumped a string of girls one of whom takes her anger out on his truck surveying the damage even nathans male friends understand that he deserved it "you broke her heart so she broke your windshield " although local police say that crime is not a big problem all is not sweetness and light some of the boys use vulgar language when they are hanging out with their hunting rifles the school is concerned enough about drugs drinking and sex to bring in a motivational speaker hes a man with a smashed face who tells the kids that when he drove drunk a crash pushed the radio knob into his left eye and the right one "lay on the floor in three small parts " whatever they get up to with their dates when the cameras are off though the girls dont do suggestive moves in their court side cheering routines a big thrill for the boys is watching a blond woman enter a convenience store across the street while one informs the group "i was told by some guys that chicks in their s are the hot ones to get " quaintness runs through the town like a river when students are studying the origins of man and homo erectus we cant be sure one senior is kidding when he asks "did they die out because they were gay " other jokes are more obvious such as the one a husband boasts about playing on his wife putting sunflower seeds in her underwear drawer to make her think the house has mice the camera catches people in sad moments too like the first time the choirgirl brings her new baby home and realizes that her destiny is irrevocably changed no one is so touching however as nimrod star brian aimsback a native american he ought to be happy he is a famous big scorer the beloved boyfriend of hope and active in school affairs yet brians grandmother sees prejudice against indians as a big barrier we can never tell whether brian agrees with her because he never articulates his feelings all we know is that on the basketball court and especially when he has had a bad game he can look like a frightened child then near the end of the film he follows the advice of a chippewa elder and dons native regalia for an indian dancing competition there for the first time we see brian transformed into a man director brett morgan does not patronize his subjects or attempt to romanticize their environment we know without seeing ugly details that as the seasons cycle so does the circle of birth and death success and failure boredom and elation the ominous note here comes from the fact that the film was made after watersmeet was chosen for a series of espn ads about devotion to athletics by now the townsfolk have had cameras following them for ages and some sundance informs us are even available for interviews undoubtedly all of this will have left them self aware and self conscious in ways they were not before it may be unfair to compare the citizens of watersmeet to amazonians who greet the first visitor from the outside world as naked as they were born and soon after don loincloths and covet michael jackson t shirts we cannot insist that the towns people cling to a more innocent past just for our sakes yet its impossible not to believe as the maple sap runs and the film ends that the more the residents of nimrod nation keep to their old ways the more contented they will be what makes frank caliendo so good at doing impressions of famous people and why is it such a delight to see there are many chances to ponder these questions in the new tbs series "frank tv" tuesdays p m earlier this week mr caliendo portrayed the entire cast of "seinfeld" and made us laugh again at bill clinton and george w bush next tuesday among many other impressions he nails robert de niro and does an ad for "sean connerys voice club for men " down the road will come dr phil adam sandler and james gandolfini among many others what a wonderful way to end the day and fall asleep happy
