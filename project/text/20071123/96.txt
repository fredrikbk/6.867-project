weekend journal review theater the prison of the heart a park in our house victory gardens greenhouse n lincoln ave chicago &# &# closes dec what the butler saw court theater s ellis ave chicago &# &# closes dec chicago too many american theatergoers think that new york is the only place where you can see two or three first class shows in a long weekend now that a stagehands strike has closed down most of broadway i come bearing glad tidings if its "destination theater" you crave chicago is as good a destination as manhattan no sooner did the strike start than i booked a flight to the windy city knowing that id be able to choose from a half dozen worthy productions once i got there i picked a pair of plays by nilo cruz and joe orton and came home happy mr cruz who was born in cuba in won a pulitzer prize in for "anna in the tropics " a sumptuously old fashioned play whose high drama and luxuriant language delighted me when i saw it on broadway "a park in our house " written in works the same rich vein of poetic naturalism set in cuba in it shows what happens when dimitri lance baker a russian scientist spends a month with a family whose members are suffering from the effects of life under castro the father gustavo mellado is a government apparatchik who no longer believes in the system he serves and has been rendered impotent by his subservience while pilar marcela munoz his daughter is a nubile idealistic teenager who fancies herself a "romantic revolutionary" and longs to live in moscow but settles for sleeping with dimitri she is too naive to fully understand what the adults with whom she lives know from hard experience which is that her country is a prison of the heart a place where fear and distrust seep into every human transaction and even the unconscious mind is tainted "in this house my family doesnt like to go to bed at night theyre afraid of dreaming of seeing what they dont want to see when they close their eyes " the characters in "a park in our house " like the ones in "anna in the tropics " speak with an easy lyricism that sweetens their most casual utterances "what does a plain white button do it buttons it buttons a shirt but a pair of cuff links a pair of cuff links tells the story of a sleeve " such lyricism could cloy in the hands of a less accomplished playwright but mr cruz knows how to make his dialogue sing and shine and the six members of the cast of "a park in our house " co produced by victory gardens theater and teatro vista a local latino company are no less adept at making the most of the gorgeous speeches he has put in their mouths dennis zacek victory gardens artistic director has staged the play with handsome simplicity aided by samuel balls claustrophobia inducing set whose bedroom subtly suggests a jail cell "a park in our house" is being performed in victory gardens seat greenhouse a comfortably shabby space into which this tender soft spoken play fits perfectly i cant imagine a more satisfying production joe orton was the great anarch of postwar farce and had he not been bludgeoned to death in at the cruelly early age of he would now be universally acknowledged as a major playwright instead his posthumous reputation is based on only three full length plays the last of which "what the butler saw " has just been revived by the court theater the university of chicagos much admired professional ensemble i have some problems with this production but it works the opening night crowd laughed itself silly and if youve never seen any of ortons plays its a plausible place to start ortons farces are about proper middle class folk whose facades of respectability are shattered by sex in "what the butler saw " he turns up the heat underneath dr prentice blake montgomery a superficially respectable psychiatrist who longs to ravish geraldine barclay mechelle moe the prim young lady from the friendly faces employment bureau who has come to his office looking for work no sooner does he inveigle her into stripping hes a doctor you know than his wife mary beth fisher walks in and the doors there are four start slamming all this is the stuff of your standard mid s west end sex farce but the comic stakes are higher in "what the butler saw " in ortons hands things get vastly crazier in very short order and by plays end everyone on stage is half naked drunk doped to the eyeballs and or covered with stage blood none of which stops them from firing off razor sharp one and two liners "have you taken up transvestism id no idea our marriage teetered on the edge of fashion " sean graney who runs the hypocrites one of chicagos smaller theater troupes was clearly out to make a splash with "what the butler saw " which is his major house debut in an interview printed in the program he complains that theater in chicago is "stuck in an american realism mindset " not so this flamboyant production which is set in an ultra sterile s modern doctors office but is otherwise as far from naturalistic as it can possibly be mr graney has dumped his whole bag of directorial tricks on top of ortons play flashing lights zany sound effects cute background music touches of pythonesque parody theyre good tricks and id love to see them in a different show but here they get between the action and the audience not only do ortons best lines get lost in the shuffle but the uncontrolled chaos of mr graneys staging obscures the point of "what the butler saw " which is that normality is an illusion "marriage excuses no one the freaks roll call" instead of shedding their outward skins of propriety bit by bit everyone in the cast starts off wild and crazy which leaves them with nowhere to go for all its excesses mr graneys production works in spite of itself and the cast is very fine especially joe foust who plays dr rance the tightly wrapped government inspector who speaks with the voice of authority "i represent her majestys government your immediate superiors in madness" so is kevin depinets set which is so priggishly austere that youll start snickering as soon as you walk into the theater this isnt the "what the butler saw" of my dreams but itll do until a cooler crisper one comes along mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
