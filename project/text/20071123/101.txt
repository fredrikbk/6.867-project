weekend journal taste suburban development i didnt grow up in levittown n y the iconic american suburb founded years ago but you could call north woodmere the long island town my parents moved to in a close relation in poet richard wilbur wrote "to an american poet just dead" "in summer sunk and stupefied the suburbs deepen in their sleep of death " many of us who were raised in these places would have agreed some might even have cheered the news announced a couple of weeks ago that the levitt co has gone bankrupt the streets of our suburbs were often roughly paved at first trees were slim sticks that provided little shade everyone was similarly aged and for the most part from one of the three major new york social food groups italians irish and jews boredom could be relieved only by a train ride to manhattan in our innocence we did not know why our parents moved to these pre packaged wonderlands the only times we got an inkling was when visiting relatives still back in brooklyn they lived in apartments on blocks with no yards and often attended dangerous schools our parents as we understood only when we got older knew what they were doing they were part of a nationwide revolution in expectations among middle and working class city dwellers for whom a move to suburbia meant the chance to flee the crime crowding and other ills of urban america what made this revolution possible was in large part what made cars refrigerators and tv sets luxury goods no longer mass production like most geniuses william levitt the founder of levittown worked on a simple premise if you could build houses on an assembly line and remove cost creating encumbrances most famously basements you could make them affordable for average americans "any damn fool can build homes " mr levitt who made the cover of time in once noted "what counts is how many you can sell for how little " previously homeownership had been a prospect for only the affluent or people in the hinterlands but mr levitt using production techniques he perfected in the navy offered amazingly cheap homes the first cape cods went for &# in when median family income was &# with the aid of mortgage financing from the gi bill buyers could get along with down payments as low as &# and monthly installments of as little as &# by the time he was finished homes were completed in levittown this was not a singular achievement but one repeated by mr levitt himself in philadelphias suburbs and by imitators from coast to coast indeed by the mid s america enjoyed a rate of homeownership roughly two thirds of all families double that of germany switzerland france and britain nearly three quarters of afl cio members and the vast majority of intact families owned their own homes new york planning czar robert moses who constructed the road system that made developments like levittown viable for commuters understood the appeal of these new communities "the little identical suburban boxes of average people which differ only in color and planting represent a measure of success unheard of by hundreds of millions on other continents " he said suburbs absorbed a remarkable of the nations population increase during the s and the pattern has not much changed we remain an increasingly suburban nation despite a strong uptick in residential growth in some core cities during the first five years of the new millennium suburbs and exurbs accounted for slightly more than of the total growth in our metropolitan areas but what of suburbanizations naysayers social critics have long denounced these neighborhoods as racist and levittown like many suburbs did once exclude african americans only a few trickled in after the supreme court rulings on segregation in the s in nearly of all suburbanites were white traditional urbanists also have little love for suburbia lewis mumford and jane jacobs agreed on little but this mr mumford identified the suburbs as the "anti city " sucking the creative essence out of old urban areas and turning them into disregarded parcels of "a disordered and disintegrating urban mass " ms jacobs was hostile both to suburbia and to its primary means of transportation she identified the car as "the chief destroyer of american communities " this assessment hasnt gotten better with time the tradition of suburb bashing among intellectuals like richard wilbur continues today in the writings of james howard kunstler and urban critic paul knox who denounces suburbia as "vulgaria " such hostility is based on everything from the aesthetics of the communities to claims that their car dependent culture helps to expand the nations waistlines and now suburbs have come under fire from environmentalists who hector them for their alleged contributions to global warming but places like fort bend county texas and walnut calif are not your fathers suburbs they boast some of the most diverse populations in the nation todays levittown n y is still only nonwhite but willingboro n j another levittown development in the philadelphia suburbs is now majority black indeed more than one in four suburbanites nationwide is a minority group member along with immigrants and their offspring african americans have been consistently moving to the suburbs the percentage of blacks living in the periphery has risen to well over one in three and although they are far from hotbeds of culture many suburbs are not as boring and featureless as they seemed when i was a kid recently details magazine even published a guide to "the hippest burbs to live in " foodies know that many of the best ethnic restaurants can now be found in suburban strip malls operated by immigrants who have flocked to places like los angeless san gabriel valley or houstons bellaire road thriving performing arts centers have risen in such unlikely locations as cobb county outside atlanta and costa mesa calif some newer suburbs also come complete with extensive park systems bike trails and areas with restored natural habitats yet despite these changes no one will mistake contemporary levittown or the san fernando valley neighborhood where my family now resides for new yorks soho or san franciscos north beach instead their success revolves around many of the basics that william levitt recognized as critical affordable homes good schools nice parks and public safety as long as suburbs continue to deliver them the master developers legacy is likely to live on for another years mr kotkin is a presidential fellow in urban futures at chapman university in orange calif he is author of "the city a global history "
