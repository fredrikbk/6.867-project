foods investors are heartened by its resilient sales the growth prospects of its recently acquired wild oats stores and its dividend which the natural foods company boosted by in the latest quarter yet more competition higher costs and murkiness surrounding wild oats dilution on earnings suggest that investors unless they have strong stomachs should consider shopping elsewhere "its a stock that today you just have to step aside on " says rob lutts who manages &# million as president of cabot money management in salem mass cabot bought about &# million in whole foods shares starting in but

first seven weeks of the first quarter of fiscal while wild oats stores posted a respectable in the same period in p m nasdaq stock market composite trading wednesday whole foods shares fell cents or to &# giving the company a market value of about &# billion the quarterly dividend of cents a share yields about whole foods shares are above their week low currently trading at times projected per share earnings this hefty valuation is despite a share price that has fallen some from a high in october as investors became jittery when a consumer slowdown hit other high end food retailers such as coffee purveyor starbucks corp they believed that sluggishness could slam growth at the rapidly expanding grocery chain bulls argue that its pricey valuation is less of a reflection of earnings which they agree will be lackluster because of the high costs of integrating wild oats than a big earnings revival expected in that is when some analysts expect the wild oats acquisition to bolster earnings in a big way the federal trade commission is appealing the merger on antitrust grounds though unwinding the tie up is considered a long shot "you need to consider the tremendous long term growth potential when you look at its valuation " says mark miller an analyst at william blair &amp co in chicago while he has cut his earnings per share estimate for by more than to a range of &# to &# he estimates &# a share for "then the valuation becomes more manageable " he says whole foods didnt respond to requests for comment still paying times forward earnings for the promise of rapid growth

an analyst at hsbc securities who has an "underweight" rating in whole foods wrote in a research report there is weakness elsewhere whole foods fourth quarter earnings were down from the year earlier

growing so fast that there are a lot of costs that come before the benefit " says andrew wolf an analyst with bb&amp t capital markets which has a "hold" rating on the stock management is optimistic in terms of sales and gross margins "but its not showing up in earnings " adds mr wolf neither he nor his company own whole foods shares the company didnt provide much guidance on how much the wild oats merger would weigh on earnings next year so analysts have been reducing their per share estimates for by a wide range of cents to cents a share eyeballing the impact of unexpected costs and leaving an uncertain outlook for investors for example mr wolf cut his estimate by cents to &# a share to reflect the fact that whole foods is keeping former corporate employees of wild oats longer than he expected to help manage the integration whole foods founder and chief executive john mackey who sparked controversy this year when he acknowledged posting favorable comments about himself and the company on internet chat rooms under the pseudonym rahodeb has long told investors that he doesnt manage the company to please wall street on a quarterly basis and that they should be prepared to invest in whole foods for the long term to be rewarded that is another sign of why investors may want to leave the shopping cart in the rack
