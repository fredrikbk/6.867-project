to lack of responsibility it was with disappointment and dismay that i read david wessels nov "capital" column "why some mortgage bailouts make sense" in which he sets forth a number of rationales for which those who entered into risky adjustable rate mortgages should now receive government handouts as they face potential foreclosure what mr wessel and others who advocate a huge role for government fail to recognize is that when one group is unfairly enriched others must pay for those who disregarded the laudable tenet of exerting good common sense before entering into the largest financial transaction of their lives the message is that personal responsibility isnt required the responsible will continue to subsidize the irresponsible in this latest grand welfare scheme i suppose this is what i should come to expect in a nation that has established an entitlement to have and raise a family at the expense of others oren m spiegler upper saint clair pa
