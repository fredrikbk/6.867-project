french street fight congested streets and idle trains are a familiar sight in france but the huge transport strike which paralyzed the country for over a week could be one of the last it all depends on whether frances new leader is more ronald reagan or jacques chirac president nicolas sarkozy picked this fight presumably to win it his planned overhaul of the "special pensions regime" for select government workers isnt controversial outside the public sector unions that called their members out nor is it all that crucial to frances economic future but mr sarkozy must neutralize the unions before he can fulfill his promise to make france globally competitive again the reforms that matter most are next the unions realize the stakes should the new president prevail on pensions the way clears for him to push liberalized labor codes a higher retirement age across the board a smaller civil service autonomy for universities and a revamped welfare state if mr sarkozy loses this fight then the chances of serious change are close to nil the cost of failure for the new man at the elysee palace can hardly be exaggerated in then president chirac tried something similar only to cave after three weeks of strikes mr sarkozy has tended to define himself against his hapless predecessor and one time rival that serves him well earlier this week in un chirac tones he declared "these reforms have been too long coming we will not give way we will not retreat " the strong rhetoric is a good sign mr sarkozy might take inspiration from the fortitude that led reagan to fire the air traffic controllers as in that strike government employees in critical transport jobs are in mr sarkozys word taking the economy and public "hostage " the majority judging by the results of this years elections that swept a sarkozy led center right into power stand against the unions which represent a fraction of the work force last weekend during a rainstorm thousands of enraged parisians turned out to march against the strikers who have made their lives so difficult if even the french are getting fed up with the political extortion practiced by their unions then theres hope for europe yet this reform affects only about half a million railway metro and some select public employees such as parliamentarians and no misprint here ballet dancers they can retire up to years earlier than anyone else including most civil servants on full state pension that privilege dating back to in the case of the ballerinas costs french taxpayers about &# billion a year no ones livelihood is in jeopardy civil servants enjoy almost complete job security in a country with the euro zones highest unemployment rate this reform merely levels the playing field and puts a small dent in the chronic deficit of the state run pensions system negotiations began wednesday among employers state and the unions and yesterday most rail workers voted to "suspend" the strike while talks continue the unions are on the defensive early wednesday four high speed rail lines out of paris were closed when militant strikers damaged signaling connections some union bosses may figure such tactics and the threat of prolonged labor action can force french politicians to bend to their will theyve done it before one possible government concession may be to compensate current workers for the rise in the number of years needed to qualify for pension a one off cost but a clear red line is the permanent shift to a higher retirement age mr sarkozys election in may brought a gust of fresh hyper energy to french life a recent economic downturn global credit jitters the presidents own marital woes and now the strikes put an autumnal damper on things but expectations remain high that mr sarkozy can revitalize a country mired in three decades of economic gloom
