weekend journal taste de gustibus the well spring brussels old ladies sitting in otherwise empty churches thats the picture most of my american friends have of spirituality in europe well that or a continent being overrun by jihadist muslims its not an entirely incorrect picture the empty churches not the scimitar wielding immigrants how is it then that a guy like me bible belt born and bred lifetime churchgoer has found spiritual renewal in this pit of secularism and am i the only one the hard data show that christianity remains in long term decline here a gallup poll found that of europeans attend a weekly worship service of any faith compared with of americans and the spiritual gap between the u s and europe is actually "worse than people think " says philip jenkins author of "gods continent christianity islam and europes religious crisis " but the light is not yet out those remaining believers and the faith communities they form are what prof jenkins calls "white dwarves" because "theyre smaller than the sun but they shine brighter " im no astrophysicist but it seems to me that such intense bodies when composed of people who believe passionately in a cause are more likely to expand than to contract this is certainly true of the church in which im involved here which has grown to members larger than the average church in belgium in just a couple of years my wife and i began to look for a church soon after moving to brussels three years ago it was almost a reflex and initially may have amounted to little more than the search for the familiar after trying an anglican church that resembled the catholic one she grew up in and a scottish congregation that seemed like the methodist one i was raised in we came upon a new church called the well that had been planted by missionaries from the u s its a mix of the familiar and the foreign the leaders speak with american accents but rather than deliver a sermon they encourage attendees to hash out the weeks topic in small discussion groups the presentations they do make are often multimedia with clips from movies like "alfie" and sitcoms like "the office " the well doesnt gather as one large group in a church building but rather as a few smaller groups in cafes and restaurants thats in part because we dont actually own a building but theres a purpose behind this too its far less intimidating for newcomers to visit a public space with a dozen or so other people than a normal "church" with pews and a steeple and a hundred strange faces in the course of our gatherings we also meet people who were just going out for coffee and probably wouldnt have wandered into a sanctuary along the way this emphasis on the nontraditional is intentional for many of the europeans ive met here its not god who is dead to them as much as it is the church the official often state supported church be it catholic anglican or lutheran now new life is being infused into these churches by missionaries from america and even africa some of the elements in the well and its sister churches in madrid amsterdam and other european cities that are deemed unusual here would seem familiar to american christians worship songs that sound like rock n roll rather than th century hymns discussions focusing on a personal relationship with god rather than a list of dos and donts but other elements would seem out of place even in cool u s churches holding services in a microbrewery is an effective way to hammer home the point that church doesnt have to be the way it always has been the message is getting out a mostly american and british group at first the well now regularly attracts people from belgium france holland portugal romania bulgaria ghana and lebanon some wouldnt be attending church if the well didnt exist for those of us who have always been involved in a church the outward differences with more traditional congregations spark important questions if i show up at a cafe for worship one week and only three other people are there does it still "count" as church if i go from a church that serves grape juice at communion to one where i can sip the house pale ale between prayers am i practicing the same faith these questions have helped me to focus on what pulled me toward church any church originally there is an added sense of urgency when you undergo such self examination in a land where being religious is not exactly de rigueur the data dont yet reveal a similar awakening in the europeans around me but i have faith mr wingfield is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal europe see related letter "letters to the editor light in darkest europe" wsj nov
