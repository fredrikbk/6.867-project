target proof your company the increasing number of buyouts of public companies by private equity this year so far from in is putting more pressure on corporate boards to enhance shareholder value although private equity funds are currently on hold because of the credit crisis they are very large and will return to action during the hiatus public companies should improve their performance and avoid being a future target by taking a few pages out of the private equity play book of course some private equity deals have succeeded because of excess leverage quick flips or onerous fees however several careful studies including research published in the mckinsey quarterly in have shown that the majority of companies acquired by private equity funds have outperformed thanks to substantially improved operations and better designed incentives a broad analysis of this outperformance reveals five key factors while some may be unique to the privately held company public directors should ask the following five questions and consider the extent to which they can apply the answers to their particular company is there too much cash on the balance sheet firms acquired by private equity keep idle cash to a minimum yet there is a record amount of cash sitting on the books of public companies in the s&amp p &# trillion in versus less than &# billion in is this cash hoard larger than needed as a safety cushion or to finance merger "synergies" that may not materialize while a share buyback can make sense in specific circumstances raising a cash dividend is a much more reliable way to increase shareholder value citigroup research shows that stocks in the top quintile for dividend growth have on average outperformed those in the bottom quintile for dividend growth by per year since is the capital structure optimal private equity funds are well known for increasing debt and reducing equity in companies they acquire historically public companies have resisted adding leverage for fear it would damage their credit rating and lower their stock price but the impact of a lower credit rating on a companys market multiple the price of a share of stock divided by its earnings per share has shrunk sharply over the past five years in companies rated a or higher had market multiples of and companies rated bbb had a market multiple of as of the corresponding multiples were and respectively does the operating plan significantly increase shareholder value in a study of businesses owned by private equity in europe ernst &amp young calculated that the value of these businesses grew at twice the average annual rate achieved by public companies in the same country and the same sector why according to the report "making long term improvements in the profit growth and value of businesses does not come from cost cutting or financial engineering it comes from focused investment making the few key changes happen fast and the benefit of shared incentives of investors and management " some of these practices could be adopted to capture gains for public shareholders with the right incentives for public company executives and directors is executive compensation tied closely enough to shareholder value a relatively small group of senior executives at companies owned by private equity have much larger equity stakes than those in public companies however these senior executives will not actually receive any rewards unless the private equity fund owning the company actually realizes a substantial gain private equity funds also do not allow top executives to leave with large exit packages despite poor performance do directors devote enough time and have enough incentive to increase shareholder value private equity boards tend to be smaller with a greater number of retired industry experts putting in more time on average than public boards they deserve a much higher level of compensation but not through annual fees directors of private equity companies hold substantial equity in them and share in the performance fees of the private equity funds typically of the returns realized by these funds such small boards may be particularly effective in smaller public companies which have trouble recruiting outside directors large public companies could learn a lot by creating internal swat teams who would play the hypothetical role of a private equity fund taking over the company in either case public directors would do well to pre emptively apply some of the lessons of private equity now before the next deal cycle mr pozen is chairman of mfs investment management this op ed is adapted from "what public companies can learn from private equity " in the november harvard business review
