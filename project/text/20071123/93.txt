weekend journal review books when buildings stopped making sense architecture of the absurd by john silber quantuck lane press pages &# the massachusetts institute of technology has just filed suit against the architect frank gehry whose wavy odd angled metallic forms infiltrate the skylines of many american cities and not a few abroad like bilbao spain the suit seeks unspecified damages for "design and construction failures" at the stata center a two towered structure that opened three years ago housing computer science labs on mits cambridge mass campus mr gehrys response "m i t is after our insurance " john silbers "architecture of the absurd" might serve as an amicus brief for mit it is a thoughtful argument against the excesses of "designer" architects and urban planning utopians mr silber the former president of boston university may seem as he notes "an unlikely person to write a book on architecture " but he is an architects son and a professional philosopher who as the president of a major university for years directed the construction of buildings totaling million square feet of floor area more than most clients to say the least his critique of todays architectural culture has a hard nosed clarity that is seldom found in todays writing about architecture mr silber begins by recalling how in the s he participated in a series of conversations with the renowned faculty of the school of architecture at the university of texas he remembers suggesting that as a practical art architecture could not indulge in the kind of absurdity that theater was then famous for in the work for example of samuel beckett and eugene ionesco he claimed that "no client of sound mind would pay for the design and construction of an absurdity" and "no architect would consider an absurd building as the fulfillment of his professional responsibilities " "but " mr silber now reflects "after seeing what has happened to architecture in the past few decades all i can say is how could i have been so wrong " he makes a distinction between a building conceived in an absurd way and one that becomes absurd only through constructional mistakes or structural miscalculations an example of the second category is i m peis john hancock building in boston mr silber finds beautiful the way the reflective surfaces of the structure mirror the surrounding landmarks such as trinity church but the whole exercise was rendered ridiculous by mr peis prideful bad planning which has resulted in glass wall segments popping out and falling in some cases hundreds of feet to the ground a truly absurd building mr silber says is one that has absurdity built into its intention an example is mr peis pyramid at the louvre in paris mr pei sited his glass pyramid in such a way as to block the classic facades of the louvre itself it was a deliberate act of cultural vandalism in mr silbers view mr pei "is responsible for creating a constant disturbing tension between the pyramid and the courtyard that compromises the beauty of each pei might say that he intended to create this tension but by what right did he spoil the view of that magnificent space " mr silbers polemic it should be said is not an attack on architectural modernism he greatly admires mies van der rohes seagram building in new york for instance an austerely elegant bauhaus tower of bronze and glass and he loves frank lloyd wrights fallingwater in rural pennsylvania even though he sees that its disastrous structural flaws the seeming wish of its cantilevers dramatically suspended over a waterfall to fall down resulted from the colossal ego of an architect who dismissed the advice of engineering consultants hired by the client edgar kaufmann wright may have designed beautiful buildings but he also helped to beget the cult of genius in architecture which mr silber believes led inevitably to the triumph of the absurd wright wished to impose his egotistical vision on individual clients but the swiss french architect who called himself le corbusier sought to impose his vision of high residential towers and high speed roadways meant to obliterate all traces of the corrupt world that gave us world war i on entire cities like algiers and paris both of which fortunately for their futures rejected the architects entreaties for large scale rebuilding "when an architect " writes mr silber "longs to trample over the lives of hundreds of thousands to enact a plan he believes is more real than his fellow men who must live with his plans while he need not we can see that it is a short step from pure architecture to cruelly absurd abusive and debasing dictatorship " le corbusier himself undertook little large scale "urban renewal " not so his postwar acolytes who devastated swaths of established cities all over the world in homage to the masters absurdist vision the great enablers of genius architects have been nonprofit corporations especially museums and universities where "decisions are made by persons who are not spending their own money who take no personal financial risk and who often lack the knowledge and experience in building necessary to ensure that the needs of the institution are met " such clients become the gullible victims of jargon spouting architects and their critical sycophants mr silber comes down especially hard on daniel libeskind the architect who won the competition for the replacement tower at the world trade center site mr libeskind had claimed that the angled incisions or cuts on the surfaces of his jewish museum in berlin referred to locations where jews flourished in pre nazi times yet later when he designed the royal ontario museum in toronto he used similar patterns of surface cuts only this time they served to make in the architects words a "crystal a structure of organically interlocking parts prismatic forms" that "asserts the primacy of participatory space and public choreography " of course no one quite knows what he means mr silber writes "how many times one wonders will libeskind be able to impress clients and critics with his metaphysical spin doctoring of senseless contrivances " mr silber eloquently describes the absurdities of buildings such as steven holls simmons hall dormitories at mit a profoundly ungainly structure that the architect himself said was meant to resemble a sea sponge its an example of what nonprofit institutions allow themselves to be talked into by architects whose "theoryspeak" proves irresistible to boards of culturally insecure trustees a recurrent theme of mr silbers is genius architects talent at verbal persuasion often a combination of jargon and bullying for mr silber no one does it better than frank gehry whose "misconception that architecture has no distinct purpose or consequent limitations that distinguish it fundamentally from painting and sculpture has led him to impose on clients works that are profligate in cost and grotesquely unaccommodating to their purpose " which brings us back to the stata center "the piece de resistance of absurdity in architecture " the ray and maria stata center opened in cost mit &# million which was at least twice what was budgeted even without calculating the expense of the buildings opening four years behind schedule as mr silber notes mit originally defended the building by saying it served the universitys need "to be associated with fresh and exciting things" that might appeal to potential donors but it is fundamentally absurd to use a building constructed with huge cost overruns as a lure for donations robert campbell the boston globes architecture critic wrote in praising the stata center that it "looks as if its about to collapse " that and its teetering walls and random curves are a metaphor said mr campbell for the creativity of the scientific research that goes on inside the building the building though reminds mr silber of the mother goose rhyme about the crooked man the crooked cat and the crooked mouse all living in the crooked house he does not believe it is philistine to say so clients mr silber admonishes "should not forfeit their dignity as persons and allow themselves through vanity gullibility or timidity to be seduced theoryspeak celebrity and self proclaimed genius cannot cover the naked absurdity of much contemporary architecture " mr morrone is the author of "the architectural guidebook to new york city " see related letter "letters to the editor but architects must build" wsj dec
