upstart mining challenger fortescue may dent bhp rio tinto grip on iron ore industry perth australia bhp billiton has its hands full persuading investors to back its &# billion bid for rival mining giant rio tinto it also faces another test in the person of andrew "twiggy" forrest the australian entrepreneur is trying to develop one of the worlds biggest iron ore mines and challenge bhps and rios grip on the industry if his plan succeeds it could undermine some of the promised synergies of the bhp rio deal and help cool prices of iron ore a key ingredient in steel and one of the critical commodities behind chinas economic boom mr forrests perth company fortescue metals group ltd started construction last year on the mine project which the company expects to produce million metric tons of iron ore a year with deliveries to china starting in may fortescue aims to later expand output to as much as million metric tons about double what bhp billiton now produces in doing so andrew forrest hopes to emerge as a major new competitor in an industry that is dominated by three companies bhp rio and brazils cia vale do rio doce which together control about of the international trade in iron ore on nov fortescue announced it had discovered an additional one billion metric tons of iron ore in western australia that is on top of the billion it already has identified the next day mr forrest filed a new application with australias national competition council for the right to transport some ore on rail lines now controlled by bhp and rio he also asked australian authorities to review the bhp rio transaction if it occurs on grounds that it might be anticompetitive bhp and rio tinto have resisted the idea of sharing their rail lines which are running at full capacity bhp adds that its shareholders should be able to fully benefit from infrastructure the company paid for itself for all his ambitious plans mr forrests company has yet to deliver any significant quantities of ore and some analysts suspect he is simply trying to capitalize on the interest spurred by the bhp rio deal to drive fortescues share price higher either way fortescue shares soared nearly to a&# us&#

the market volatility underlines how iron ore is emerging as the hottest commodity in the bhp rio deal chinese officials are worried that further consolidation of the iron ore market could lead to higher prices and threaten the growth of their steelmakers that could lead china to bankroll challengers such as mr forrest the surge in fortescues value also could send a signal to rio tinto shareholders that their companys iron ore assets are being undervalued in bhps current bid emboldening them to hold out in hopes of a higher price at a minimum some analysts said the emergence of a new player such as mr forrest could alter the competitive landscape in an industry that is key to the bhp rio deal "the last thing the remaining iron ore companies want is another supplier out there throwing a spanner in the works " said gavin wendt a resources analyst at fat prophets a sydney advisory firm indeed "once mr forrest starts to get big he can really start to threaten" iron ore producers by helping bring prices down said peter arden a melbourne research analyst at ord minnett an australian investment firm most of the worlds exported iron ore comes from two places brazil and a desolate stretch of western australia known as the pilbara bhp and rio dominate the pilbara predecessors of modern day bhp and rio began developing the region in the s and built the rail lines needed to haul the ore to the coast their expansion was slow in part because demand was relatively weak with chinas economy now sizzling iron ore prices have more than doubled over the past three years and miners are having trouble keeping up with demand analysts believe prices which are set annually in private meetings between miners and steelmakers could rise another to next year bhp said it has allocated several billion dollars in recent years to develop new supply from the pilbara and it is studying plans to lift production to million metric tons by combining with rio which also is expanding its production will lead to efficiencies that will allow it to make more iron ore available bhp said more efficient operations would account for a significant portion of the &# billion in annual savings and other benefits bhp expects from the deal some chinese officials and analysts suspect bhp also is trying to get more control over pricing mr forrest and others argue that to prevent that from happening bhp and rio should be forced to share any benefits from transportation facilities to other efficiencies with other suppliers alex wilson contributed to this article
