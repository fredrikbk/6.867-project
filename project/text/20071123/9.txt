bond insurer cifg to receive capital infusion of &# billion may be model for sector hurt by credit turmoil in the first sign of relief for the troubled bond insurance industry financial guarantor cifg holding said it will receive a &# billion capital injection from controlling shareholders of its french parent so it can preserve its imperiled triple a credit rating the plan which the controlling shareholders announced yesterday provides a road map for other bond insurers whose businesses reputations and share prices have been hit hard in recent weeks the large size of the infusion which doubles cifgs capital and underscores the urgency and hefty amount of funds required to stabilize the industry raises the stakes for other guarantors seeking capital to remain competitive cifgs capital injection will come from banque populaire group and the caisse depargne group two french cooperative banks that own controlling stakes in cifgs parent natixis a french investment bank listed on the paris stock exchange natixiss share price had tumbled since early october even though less than of its revenue comes from cifg investors have been dumping the stock over fear of its exposure to u s subprime mortgage debt through the subsidiary the announcement was a relief to shareholders and natixiss stock soared yesterday banque populaire and caisse depargne will make their financial support which has been approved by the three major ratings firms "in the form of capital and quasi capital" available to cifg "in the coming month " and are completing their purchase of natixiss stake in cifg "as quickly as possible " they said in a news release bond insurers which guarantee payment of interest and principal in the event of default by the issuer have recently emerged at the center of the credit market turmoil rating firms have warned that they will downgrade guarantors that fall short of capital necessary to absorb potential losses in their portfolios of mortgage loan pools known as collateralized debt obligations or cdos rising defaults on u s subprime mortgages have prompted a flood of cdo downgrades causing the value of bond insurance policies to fall in value on the guarantors balance sheets while the insurers emphasize that downgraded cdos dont necessarily translate into losses recent news that fimalac sas fitch ratings and moodys corp s moodys investors service are re evaluating the bond insurers capital levels intensified fears that the guarantors could lose their coveted triple a ratings if any triple a rated guarantors lose their ratings it could wipe out their businesses and lead to downgrades on the hundreds of billions of dollars in debt securities that they insure ranging from water and sewer bonds to cdos in turn bond investors such as retirees mutual fund holders and hedge funds would be hurt while closely held cifg is smaller than its publicly traded peers such as ambac financial corp and mbia inc its capital infusion plan may serve as a potential model for other bond insurers including financial guaranty insurance co or fgic and security capital assurance fitch and moodys had named cifg and fgic as among the most likely to fall short of capital guidelines and face downgrades as of oct cifg had direct exposure to residential mortgage backed securities of &# billion most of which were backed by subprime mortgages plus an additional &# billion in cdos of which "a significant proportion" are backed by subprime mortgages according to fitch cifg had &# billion in "claims paying resources " a rough estimate of capital according to its web site as of sept fgic said it had exposure to about &# billion in subprime mortgage backed securities and &# billion in claims paying resources thomas abruzzo a managing director and credit analyst at fitch said cifg and its owners "were very proactive in arranging this plan " "because of this capital infusion were able to reaffirm their rating and they were able to get ahead of any negative commentary resulting from our analysis " he said cifgs plan includes the issuance of subordinated debt that the two banks will convert into equity some form of reinsurance that could involve credit default swaps and long term debt the goal of the plan is to transfer all of natixiss exposure to cifgs risk to french banks controlling shareholders while saving the bond insurer from a downgrade the french banks plan to put capital into cifg is likely to up the ante for fgic the closely held fgic which guaranteed about of all new public finance debt in has been in discussions about how much to tap its investors for capital according to people familiar with the matter private equity firms blackstone group and cypress group each bought stakes in fgic in while mortgage insurer pmi group inc took a stake general electric co fgics former owner retained a stake while civc partners a chicago private equity firm owned some investors are considering injecting about &# million and more if necessary like cifg these investors are considering a mix of pure equity and reinsurance according to people familiar with the matter fgic couldnt be reached to comment
