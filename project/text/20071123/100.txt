weekend journal taste houses of worship how kosher was your turkey some jews demand better treatment for birds yesterday new york city households served turkeys that were not only free range organic and raised on a nearby family farm but also kosher for that their guests can give thanks to simon feil a year old actor who has devoted the past years to starting kosher conscience a "kosher ethical meat co op " the co op which people have expressed interest in joining when it begins regular poultry and beef deliveries in a few months will offer kosher meat that has been treated humanely "at every stage " he says judaisms taboos on pork and shellfish as well as the requirement to separate meat and dairy products are well known even among gentiles yet for many contemporary american jews the taboos can feel arbitrary cumbersome and devoid of meaning only say they keep kosher homes at the same time some jews who do find spiritual meaning in the dietary laws have become frustrated that kosher food production does not always reflect their values amid reports that animals destined to become kosher meat are raised in the same conditions as their nonkosher counterparts along with recent allegations of abusive labor practices and unsanitary conditions at agriprocessors one of the worlds largest kosher slaughterhouses some jews are re examining the laws governing what is "fit" to eat "we are not in any way changing the traditional meaning of the word kosher but are asking what does it mean to be kosher in the st century " explains leah koenig editor of jcarrot org a blog on jews food and contemporary issues "food thats drenched in pesticides or grown with unfairly paid migrant workers is that consistent with jewish values " the blog is one of many projects launched by hazon a manhattan group at the forefront of what it calls a "new jewish food movement " since hazon has helped start nine jewish community supported agriculture programs csas nationwide and one in israel in which individuals buy shares in a local farm in exchange for a weekly portion of the harvest hazons second annual jewish food conference next month will feature the slaughter of a goat to spark discussion about kosher meat all of this has met a groundswell of interest among a range of people from modern orthodox to those who have little other connection to organized jewish life hazon received applications this year from jewish groups wanting to start csas rabbi hillel norry whose conservative atlanta congregation started a csa this spring says "for a lot of people kashrut begins to take on more meaning when its part of a holistic way of thinking about food " in that vein activists in the conservative movement are working to create a heksher tzedek or "justice certification " to assure consumers not only that food is ritually kosher but that its production met other standards too is "ethical eating" a jewish value judaisms sacred texts have much to say on the treatment of animals not to mention employees "the responsibility for having an appropriate work environment from hours to pay schedule are part and parcel of jewish tradition as much as the laws of kashrut " says rabbi kenneth brander dean of yeshiva universitys center for the jewish future for centuries rabbis and scholars have puzzled over the reasons for keeping kosher beyond simply that god commanded it some have argued that the laws particularly the ban on pork were about health while others have claimed that kosher slaughter is more humane than other methods religious leaders and scholars today tend to point to kashruts effect on keeping jews from mixing excessively with members of other religions and on reminding jews that everyday life is holy david kraemer a professor at the jewish theological seminary and the author of "jewish eating and identity " says kashrut observance has historically reflected the times and places where jews have lived for example while ashkenazi jews once waited only one hour between eating meat and dairy in th and th century germany and poland when prof kraemer says jews were relatively well accepted by the larger society many adopted longer waiting periods to emphasize their piety and separateness prof kraemer applauds the recent efforts to bring ethics into discussions of kashrut "if this is who we are people who care about the source of our foods and the way animals we consume are treated which i think we do then we will generate eating principles that are expressions of our identity " but rabbi avi shafran the director of public affairs for the fervently orthodox agudath israel of america is concerned that some people are "subjecting the word kosher to a subtle redefinition " "there may be a plethora of considerations people can or even should take into account when buying their food " rabbi shafran wrote in an email "but kashrut is determined by the torahs ritual laws and is not dependent on whether factory workers were unionized an animal was hoisted or pesticide traces are above or below a certain parts per million measurement " jack wertheimer a professor of american jewish history at the jewish theological seminary supports the effort to bring together "an early st century sensibility with a commitment on the part of some at least to a far larger tradition of observance " but he wonders whether all those aligned with the new food movement are actually committed to kosher dietary laws as "a set of commandments that comes from outside of us and doesnt always have a rational explanation immediately available to us yet nonetheless we observe " not surprisingly many officials in the kosher foods industry prefer to stick to a narrow definition rabbi menachem genack ceo of the kashrut division of the orthodox union the largest kosher certification agency in the u s says matters of health safety and workplace conduct are "not trivial " but their enforcement is better left in the hands of federal and state governments atlantas rabbi norry disagrees "kashrut has got to mean more than a symbol on a package " ms wiener is a columnist for the jewish week
