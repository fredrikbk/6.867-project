weekend journal tastings the wine of the moment year after year how beaujolais nouveau survived some higher prices and a temporary downslide our daughter media just started college so she couldnt understand why she was standing in line at a m last week to register for next semester our daughter zoe is putting the finishing touches on her applications to colleges which will respond in april we need to call disney world next month to make dinner reservations for the fanciest restaurants next june we havent gotten around to finalizing any plans for spring break which means weve probably missed the boat quite literally does it sometimes seem to you like us that youre always living in the future thats why beaujolais nouveau is such a treat its the ultimate carpe diem wine meant to remind all of us to enjoy the moment we have been rushing out to buy nouveau on the third thursday of november every year for more than three decades now its a special way to celebrate the new harvest welcome the holiday season and consider the blessings of today over those years nouveau became a big deal for a while and more recently has been on a downslide partly thats because wine geeks love to sniff at nouveau because it isnt serious wine as though wine has to be serious and too many merchants have picked up that attitude when we were calling shops to see which nouveaux they carried we were greeted less than warmly at most with the nadir coming from an exceptionally chilly merchant in manhattan us can you please tell me which nouveaux you have in the store clerk the nouveau also is probably less popular because its no longer the first wine of the vintage that youre likely to see with wines from the southern hemisphere so popular now and the harvests there taking place early in the year weve been seeing wines for months other countries have gotten in on the act too with harvest wines like mionettos charming novello from italy which is particularly exuberant and tangy this year and a good buy at about &# but the biggest reason for nouveaus slipping popularity wed guess is that prices have gone up while quality has gone down nouveau used to be a consistently drinkable joy at reasonable prices in the past few years though prices on some nouveaux have risen to as high as &# which is ridiculous while far too many of the wines have tasted insipid or worse when nouveau is bad it can have flavors of anchovies metal salt or bananas and too many weve had over the past few years have been bad we understand that nouveau is a cash cow for winemakers but even cash cows have to be fed from time to time and it has been clear for a while that many vintners were taking nouveau and its customers for granted as usual we bought every nouveau we could find for a quick blind tasting we feared the worst since as a rule we dont much enjoy drinking anchovies metal salt or bananas but we are back with very good news the nouveau is excellent the best since at least wine after wine was charming and fun with none of the negatives we feared and while the prices are still too high they appear to have moderated a bit this year its almost as if the nouveau producers listened to consumers realized that they were hurting themselves and acted positively imagine that the nouveau you are most likely to see is georges duboeuf which is fine because once again this year it was jammy and charming we often find duboeuf nouveau a bit too smooth and round without the just from the field tastes that we like but its certainly always pleasant and a real crowd pleaser our best of tasting this year antonin rodet is the most spot on nouveau we have tasted in some years it took us back to why we became nouveau fans in the first place with the kind of super fresh just the fruit maam tastes that we love over the years weve visited many wineries during or just after the harvest and have tasted their fresh juice and this wine reminded us of those visits what could be better the importer baron francois of new york city says rodet made cases of this of which were imported and distributed in maryland new jersey and new york so if you have been turned off by nouveau or if you have never tried it now is a good time to pick up a bottle nouveau is great with thanksgiving leftovers remember that you shouldnt drink nouveau after the end of the year in which it is released not that it will suddenly turn to vinegar of course but the whole purpose of this wine is to celebrate the season for the rest of the year stick with "real" beaujolais which remains one of the most versatile best value wines on store shelves its time for our semiannual reminder of who we are and what this column is about we have been studying wine and drinking it together since longtime hard news journalists we began writing this column in and became full time wine writers in we have also written four books about wine we buy the wines we taste for this column at retail stores all over the u s the journal pays for the wine we dont accept free wine meals or trips we dont meet with winemakers when they visit new york city and we attend only those events that are open to the public the index that often appears with this column isnt a "buying guide " we dont think you should have to go into a wine store with long lists of what to buy and what to avoid and in any case just because we liked a specific wine doesnt mean you will rather by tasting large samplings of various kinds of wine we hope to give more general advice for instance you really should try a ribera del duero from spain and a muscat canelli from the u s but wed urge caution with lower priced shiraz from australia and chardonnay from the u s if you make the mistake of focusing too narrowly on specific labels that have been reviewed by us or by others you are likely to pass right by some of the small production under the radar wines perhaps unusual varietals from unusual regions that are often some of the best most interesting wines in the store we provide an index of our favorites merely to give you some idea what various kinds of wine can taste like at their best and approximately how much they cost if the wines we describe sound good to you ask a wine merchant for a similar wine establishing a relationship of candor and trust with a merchant is fundamental to an enjoyable journey along the road of wine there are undiscovered gems at every good wine store let a good merchant be your guide to them you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name and where youre from we cannot respond to all questions and comments but we do our best melanie grayce west contributed to this column the dow jones beaujolais nouveau index in a tasting of beaujolais nouveau these were our favorites we prefer to serve these straight out of the refrigerator and then let them warm on the table while we drink them we have listed the prices we paid but prices are wild on these and tend to start going down quickly after release nouveau should be drunk before the end of the year in which it is made we didnt see some of our previous favorites this year including bouchard which was last
