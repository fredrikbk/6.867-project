pakistan alerted u s it planned emergency rule as his government battled democracy protesters and an islamist insurgency pakistani president pervez musharraf startled his countrymen this month by imposing emergency rule and jailing thousands of opponents the move wasnt a surprise to the u s in the days before the nov announcement the generals aides and advisers forewarned u s diplomats in a series of meetings in islamabad according to pakistani and u s officials one of gen musharrafs closest advisers said u s criticism was muted which some senior pakistanis interpreted as a sign they could proceed "you dont like that option you give us one " the adviser says he told his american interlocutors "there were no good options " he adds but a u s official familiar with the discussions says the talks were part of "intensive efforts" to dissuade gen musharraf from declaring a state of emergency "there was never a green light " the u s official said yesterday the generals difficulties eased a bit as pakistans supreme court ruled against a challenge to his re election last month as the countrys president gen musharraf who purged most of the courts judges after he declared emergency rule had been expected to step down as army chief once the court ruled in his favor pakistans attorney general said wednesday that the general could do so as early as saturday but challenges to his rule by mainstream political rivals and islamist rebels are likely to continue meanwhile one of his opponents former prime minister nawaz sharif now in exile in saudi arabia is expected to get the go ahead today during a meeting with the saudi king to return to pakistan according to ahsan iqbal a spokesman for mr sharifs pakistan muslim league n he said mr sharif who was forced back into exile following a brief return to pakistan in september would likely come home within days in time to contest parliamentary elections on jan mr sharif and another former pakistani premier benazir bhutto control two of the countrys biggest political parties in the past few days the pakistani government has begun to release many of those it detained but has yet to say when the emergency might be lifted it has made little headway in defeating insurgents in the countrys northwest and many pakistanis fear their problems could increase as the january elections approach the bush administration has staked its hopes of taming radicalism in afghanistan and south asia on its marriage of convenience with gen musharraf but american policy in pakistan has been beset by mixed signals and missed opportunities calls on the administration to engage more with politicians outside gen musharrafs sphere were rarely heeded say current and former american officials billions of dollars in u s aid went to pakistans military rather than to build up its civil society a decision that widened a rift between washington and the moderate pakistani forces the white house now says it wants to empower as a result during pakistans recent blowup the u s has found itself in a bind unhappy with the general but limited in its ability to influence him a growing number of current and former bush administration officials now say the u s waited too long to shape an alternate approach to pakistan "weve been ignoring those who are rejecting musharraf " says xenia dormandy who headed the national security councils south asia desk in the white house from through "unless we encourage them well have even more problems five years down the line " there are signs the administration is shifting its attention to pakistani political forces outside gen musharrafs orbit such as ms bhutto as well as conservative islamic leaders but with few existing relationships on which to build the chances of success are uncertain pakistans most powerful institution the military enjoys the strongest ties with the u s government but the partnership is suffering as anti military and anti american sentiment in pakistan fuels an islamic insurgency that continues to capture new territory many u s counterterrorism officials fear this instability is empowering al qaeda and the taliban which take refuge in the border region between afghanistan and pakistan one big reason the u s finds itself at an impasse is the foreign policy style of president bush the terrorist attacks of sept were masterminded by osama bin laden from afghanistan next door to pakistan the u s saw strengthening its alliance with pakistan as key to defeating al qaeda mr bush built his pakistan policy around a relationship with gen musharraf in much the same way his relationships with russian president vladimir putin and afghan leader hamid karzai shaped his policy toward their countries that set the u s on a track of bolstering its counterterrorism and strategic objectives by upholding the generals rule at the expense of democracy and human rights in an interview former prime minister bhutto who returned from self imposed exile last month after reaching a tentative deal with gen musharraf to help guide pakistan toward civilian rule said the fight against extremists cant be separated from the struggle for democracy "we differed on the view that military was a problem not a solution " she says of her disputes with the u s "its a contradiction to believe a democratic evolution can take place under a dictatorship " mr sharif the former premier deposed by gen musharraf in says the u s s attitude changed after adding "i dont think president bush should go against the wishes of million people of pakistan " state department officials deny the u s has undercut pakistani democracy they say the bush administration has consistently pressured gen musharraf to repeal the state of emergency and hold free elections they also say washington never gave gen musharraf a signal that it would acquiesce in his declaration of martial or emergency law "we believe that the path of political moderation is the best way forward for pakistan " deputy secretary of state john negroponte said saturday in islamabad today even gen musharrafs allies say the state of emergency has backfired the curbs on constitutional freedoms prompted protests by lawyers and journalists and led to a breach with ms bhutto who at one point was gen musharrafs potential political partner in a new government in most american officials and many pakistani citizens welcomed gen musharrafs rule after he seized power in a bloodless coup the administrations of ms bhutto and mr sharif had left pakistans economy in bad shape and its government riddled with corruption they hoped he would clean up pakistan in retrospect there were signals early on that the general was straying from his stated commitment to democratization in pakistan held parliamentary elections but there was widespread evidence of voter fraud and electoral tampering by the military says robert grenier the central intelligence agencys station chief in islamabad from to the immediate result was the weakening of secular pakistani political parties such as ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party and strengthening of gen musharrafs party and the countrys islamist factions he says the bush administration didnt raise a fuss signaling to the military leader that washington wasnt going to push him for democracy "we might have had more marginal influence today if wed put down a marker" back in mr grenier says an ambitious u s aid program to reform pakistans political and education systems largely served to strengthen islamabads military and counterterrorism operations say current and former u s officials in all the bush administration has distributed nearly &# billion to pakistan since analysts at washingtons center for strategic and international studies say as much as of this went into pakistans armed forces in and pakistans military and intelligence services captured hundreds of al qaeda operatives including its one time chief of military operations mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed early on u s diplomats recognized that these funds were benefiting pakistans military at the expense of its police judiciary and other public institutions "i advised to give more aid to the police and to education" in cables sent to washington says wendy chamberlin who served as u s ambassador to pakistan from to "but this didnt happen " today ms chamberlin argues that in the places where american development aid largely wasnt distributed such as pakistans tribal areas islamist charities and taliban officials are largely filling the void as washingtons relations with gen musharraf strengthened its ties to leading opposition figures withered ms bhutto saw her stock plummet in the late s after corruption charges were filed against her and her husband asif ali zardari her minister of investment u s diplomats meanwhile viewed mr sharif exiled in saudi arabia as in league with hard line islamist political parties ms bhutto found herself persona non grata in washington according to u s officials u s trips usually included meetings only with desk officers at the national security council or state departments south asia division from ms bhuttos political partymany senior u s officials remain skeptical of ms bhutto viewing her party as too beholden to the countrys old land owning class and believing she would be unreliable in the war against al qaeda they also suspect her recent negotiations with gen musharraf were aimed largely at clearing her name of various corruption allegations ms bhutto says she is driven by a commitment to democracy this spring the state department with reservations seized on the idea of a political marriage between ms bhutto and gen musharraf the goal was a peaceful transition from military to civilian rule but many pakistanis viewed it as a way to perpetuate military rule albeit with civilian cover washingtons isolation from pakistans opposition proved costly when a political crisis erupted in march after gen musharraf suspended the countrys chief justice u s diplomats voiced support for an independent judiciary but the u s s ties to gen musharraf led to criticism that it wasnt doing enough to rein him in in august gen musharraf was leaning toward imposing emergency law but was warded off by a late night call from secretary of state condoleezza rice say u s state department officials on oct days ahead of the emergency declaration gen musharraf met with key aides and members of his political party at the residence of prime minister shaukat aziz to discuss options some voiced concerns that martial law could upset the economy and unwind the steps gen musharraf had taken to free up pakistans media according to attendees as the meeting broke for dinner around midnight of the who attended voted to go forward with the state of emergency arguing the negative impact on gen musharraf would be limited some predicted he would easily weather international criticism the prospect of u s opposition in particular wasnt raised according to mushahid hussain sayed the secretary general of the ruling pakistan muslim league q who was one of the five to vote against the emergency ms rice and the u s ambassador to islamabad anne patterson issued follow up warnings to the general by this time however he was preoccupied by the threat he saw from the supreme court which was set to rule on whether he could continue in power while also remaining head of the army and not on any potential rebukes from washington since the emergency declaration the bush administration has hinted it may be altering its stance toward gen musharraf ambassador patterson has held meetings with leading opposition leaders including maulana fazlur rehman the deputy chairman of a coalition of six conservative islamist parties she has also met with the armys deputy commander gen ashfaq kiyani in a signal to some that washington has put out feelers to other powerful pakistani generals traveling to pakistans financial capital karachi this week ms patterson extolled press freedoms during a stop at geo tv a station curtailed by martial law president bush meanwhile offered his strongest support yet for gen musharraf since the emergency telling abc news tuesday that pakistans leader "truly is someone who believes in democracy " state department strategists say they are continuing to try to forge a political marriage between gen musharraf and ms bhutto they say they are hoping to see political temperatures cool after which the pair could meet publicly to outline an agenda that appears unlikely before elections in january which ms bhuttos party and others may choose to boycott ms bhutto says shes no longer interested in allying with gen musharraf "my question is if the u s which is giving more than &# billion in aid cant get him to lift emergency rule whats the point of my negotiating with him " zahid hussain contributed to this article
