investors shun small oil firms even for companies with the cash in hand many are struggling to secure access to vital equipment in a world dominated by global giants such as exxonmobil corp and bp plc tony oreilly jr chief executive of irelands providence resources plc said his company has only been able to drill one well this year despite having several good prospects because of the difficulty of securing rigs london as the credit crunch bites risk averse investors are taking flight to quality energy stocks and hammering many small oil and gas companies that potentially could trigger a wave of consolidation that could see two thirds of energy listings on londons alternative investment market vanish industry executives say ninety dollar a barrel oil may have helped such companies to weather the worst effects but the sector is still in for a rough ride as investors shun companies struggling to execute projects in an overheated market "weve seen a material shift from investors " said simon ashby rudd executive managing director of corporate finance at tristone capital ltd adding they are favoring medium size companies that have oil and gas production leaving smaller more speculative exploration stocks in trouble the collapse of the market in subprime u s mortgage securities this summer has prompted many banks and investors to shun risky investments as quickly as they had gobbled them up even as previously staid markets such as interbank lending have seized up the high risk oil and gas sector has avoided the worst of it "banks generally view lending to the oil and gas sector as much more secure because you have a hard asset there to take security over " said john hamilton executive director of oil and gas at dutch investment bank abn amro bank ltd the rise in the oil price close to &# a barrel last month has also helped he added "its not quite as negative as it has been in other sectors but it should become a more conservative lending environment " mr hamilton said a more conservative approach from investors in aim listed oil and gas companies has begun to have a significant impact quite apart from the credit crunch as the oil price rose from &# a barrel in to about &# currently roughly new oil and gas exploration companies were listed on aim for several years investors couldnt get enough of them the oil price has stayed high but the huge exploration boom it stimulated has left everything from drilling rigs to geoscientists expensive and hard to come by "in we drilled a well offshore equatorial guinea in meters of water and it cost us &# million i dont think anybody is drilling deep water west africa now for less than &# to &# million and there are wells over &# million " said john doran chief executive of roc oil other industry costs have suffered similar inflation even for companies with the cash in hand many are struggling to secure access to vital equipment in a world dominated by global giants such as exxonmobil corp and bp plc tony oreilly jr chief executive of irelands providence resources plc said his company has only been able to drill one well this year despite having several good prospects because of the difficulty of securing rigs other executives operating everywhere from india to angola described problems finding the right people and equipment investors are realizing that the smaller pure exploration companies simply dont have the resources to execute their business plans said mr ashby rudd of tristone "the average capitalization on aim at the end of was &# million &# million is simply not big enough to be active on the international stage it will cost &# million to drill a well in the central north sea " he said "you cannot have your entire capitalization used on three wells if you drill your first two wells and they are dry which statistically they will be your share price will be in the toilet as wham energy found out " he said wham energy plcs share price almost halved shortly after listing on aim in when its first well came up dry the company struggled on for another unprofitable months before agreeing to be bought for about half its original market value by venture production plc in august the shares of wham energys fellow aim listed explorers have consistently underperformed compared to better capitalized companies with their own production such as venture a report published last month by ernst &amp young said half of small oil companies on aim are trading below their issue price investors are starving these companies of capital of them have less than &# million in net cash the report said "the capital raisings that have occurred in have been from successful companies " such as imperial energy which produces barrels of oil a day mr ashby rudd said "a lot of smaller companies have not been successful and have not been able to capitalize " "if capital markets arent open they are going to run out of money within months that is what is driving the mergers and acquisitions market " mr ashby rudd added in addition to the wham energy transaction cairn energy plc last month bought aim listed explorers medoil and plectrum petroleum "we believe that somewhere in the region of two thirds of aim listed oil and gas companies will disappear over the next two years they will be replaced by more mature companies who are in the wings and better capitalized " said mr ashby rudd a report by equity analyst tim heeley at investment bank daniel stewart published last week identified companies such as europe focused explorer ascent resources plc as being in the most difficult position with about &# million on the balance sheet but without proven reserves twenty three other aim listed companies are in a similar situation the report said companies such as united kingdom north sea operator nautical petroleum which has million barrels of proven and probable heavy oil reserves but is likely to face high development costs and will need to raise additional cash have a mixed outlook the report said large reserves are themselves no guarantee of success as russian gas operator victoria oil &amp gas plc has discovered "with million barrels of oil equivalent they should be well positioned however constant problems both technical and political have prevented value add for investors and the stock currently sits at of its listing price " mr heeley said most likely to survive the current turmoil are small companies such as faroe petroleum plc well capitalized with limited reserves but operating in low risk environments with growing production to generate cash flow mr heeley gave the company a "buy" rating mr ashby rudd said imperial energys latest capital raising was fulfilled within minutes and tristone raised &# million for faroe petroleum last month "weve been involved in seven financings in the last two weeks so the market is there for good companies " he said
