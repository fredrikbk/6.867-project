the mossberg solution simple cells basic phones put to the test it includes a few of the extra functions found in normal mobile phones like an alarm clock calculator and the capability to send and receive text messages perhaps most people who buy the coupe wont use it for texting but its nice to have the built in option the cellphones that so many of us carry around in our pockets every day are packed with functionality they can be used for web browsing watching tv purchasing digital music gaming bluetooth synching capturing photos and videos instant messaging and gps navigation oh and they also make phone calls it seems that this last attribute the ability to make and receive calls on a cellphone is overlooked and underestimated by many manufacturers but believe it or not there are plenty of people out there who simply want to use their cellphones for calls period these individuals range from college students who frequently damage or lose their phones to wary first time buyers to senior citizens whose kids or grandchildren insist they use a cellphone about a year ago greatcall inc introduced its jitterbug cellphones which were aimed squarely at the senior set with large keys a free operator service and the phones own number prominently displayed on a sticker it seems that greatcall was on to something verizon wireless recently followed the companys lead by introducing its straightforward no frills coupe a cellphone that offers many of the helpful traits found on jitterbug phones like large screen fonts but without a lot of extras verizon simultaneously unveiled two calling plans designed specifically for seniors and was followed a month later by at&amp t and its own monthly plan for those and over at&amp t also has an uncomplicated phone of its own in the works for this week i tested verizons &# with a two year contract coupe www verizonwireless com against greatcalls &# jitterbug dial www jitterbug com to see how the two stacked up i found the jitterbug more comfortable to use for longer phone calls because of its cushiony earpiece which blocks out external sound and helps the phone rest easier between your shoulder and ear during conversations and jitterbugs mantra of simplicity will appeal to cellphone newcomers but for those who have been using cellphones and are familiar with the way they work jitterbugs nonconformist features like yes and no buttons in place of send and end and the use of a dial tone whenever the clamshell shaped phone is opened can come across as too basic to the point that theyre confusing one example many standard cellphones redial the last number called when the send button is pressed twice but redialing on the jitterbug requires navigating through five screens to redial the last number the coupe is the smaller of the two and blends in with other cellphones it includes a few of the extra functions found in normal mobile phones like an alarm clock calculator and the capability to send and receive text messages perhaps most people who buy the coupe wont use it for texting but its nice to have the built in option the jitterbug doesnt have any of these features right now this cellphone only comes in shiny black with a blue border around its outside display screen an included charging cradle adds a touch of convenience the coupe also has some fun features that give it a more personal touch including a choice of ringtones and wallpaper designs for the main screens background after seeing low grade camera lenses on nearly every digital device that ive picked up recently the coupe looked a little naked without one three red buttons labeled i c and e for in case of emergency are positioned just below the phones screen and can be assigned names and numbers to work as shortcuts to those most often called a specially marked "" button on the phones keypad is designated specifically for emergencies though this must be held down to use and even then asks if the caller definitely intended to call a speaker button is also clearly labeled on the coupes keypad and pronounced volume adjustment keys line the phones side on screen fonts appear larger than those found on regular cellphones verizons well known network is sure to be a draw for potential buyers especially because any plan used with the coupe includes free calls to other verizon wireless users though any of this carriers plans work with this basic phone the nationwide plus plan made its debut with the coupe in hopes of appealing to those ages and up a single line plan allows anytime minutes and night and weekend minutes for &# monthly the two line plan offers roughly double the minutes to be shared for double the price these plans arent exclusively usable with the coupe greatcalls jitterbug comes in two &# models the dial with a numeric keypad and the onetouch with just three large buttons labeled operator tow and ive tested both in the past but this time around i looked at the dial because its most comparable to verizons coupe the jitterbug dial phone comes in black or white and its buttons and all of its on screen lettering appear considerably larger than the verizon coupes its number keys glow bright white and are encircled by yellow borders while the coupes digital keypad is black with glowing blue numbers colors that arent as distinctive unlike the coupe jitterbug doesnt come with a charging cradle though greatcall has plans for adding cradles in a free operator service can be reached from jitterbug phones by pressing " " this operator greets users by name places calls on the users phone saving you the trouble of dialing and can add numbers to a phones contact list if a user doesnt want to or cant do this the jitterbug can be pre programmed with names and numbers i ordered mine with five pre programmed numbers a luxury that nervous new cellphone owners might find worthwhile things get difficult when you try to enter your contacts even though each number key has three or four letters assigned to its key as on all phones adding a contact involves using jitterbugs clumsy system of choosing one letter at a time from the screen youre better off using the free operator service for this jitterbug phones let users store only contact names and numbers while verizons coupe will store many first time cellphone owners will be content with but again options are good the jitterbug and coupe each have small screens on their outer shells that display the time date and phone numbers of incoming calls but the coupe displays its remaining battery power both on this outer screen and inside on its main screen while the jitterbug only flashes battery status on the screen if the battery reaches a certain low level or if you navigate to a special "phone info" screen behind the scenes greatcalls jitterbug phones run using networks set up by other carriers i never had any trouble dialing out or receiving calls a variety of calling plans can be used with jitterbug phones ranging from &# monthly for pay as you go at cents a minute to &# monthly for minutes add on packages of minutes and sharing plans are also available if youre familiar with cellphones the jitterbug will be a confusing step back for you even though its free operator service and comfortable earpiece are pluses some people will prefer the jitterbugs larger fonts and number keys to the verizon coupes smaller more stylish build still the coupe is a good option for people who have at least some familiarity with technology and cellphones each in its own way does a good job of sticking to the basic task of handling phone calls edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
