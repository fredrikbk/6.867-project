from miles davis to bjork theyve loved stockhausen its also a gorgeous piece with the recorded sound of a boy soprano expanded without emotion into a ravishing choir stockhausen is one of the many iconic people on the cover of "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band" hes in the last row just behind w c fields and his huge electronic piece "hymnen" "anthems" was the inspiration for "revolution no " on the white album heres a paradox a classical composer dies and very likely hes mourned with more genuine distress among pop and jazz musicians or at least among some of them than he is in the classical music world that composer was karlheinz stockhausen a german who died at age on dec and certainly he was one of the most surprising even provocative figures to emerge in classical music during the past years he started as a radical modernist one of the composers who emerged in europe in the years after world war ii and tried to compose as if no music had ever been written before in those years the s he and pierre boulez looked like the joint leaders of the european musical avant garde and not surprisingly if they wanted to do something never heard before to the world at large their work seemed inexplicable it seemed locked into mathematics and abstract forms though when you look at some of the statements stockhausen made at the time he seems almost delirious talking about an ecstatic musical universe that forever expands he wanted music to proceed in measureless moments each without any past or any future and he worked not just with musicians but with electronic sound creating in a piece called "gesang der j&amp uuml nglinge" "song of the youth" which probably did more than any other work to establish electronics as a legitimate artistic medium its also a gorgeous piece with the recorded sound of a boy soprano expanded without emotion into a ravishing choir and then came the s classical music on the whole bypassed what happened back then orchestras didnt drape themselves with flowers composers didnt turn into hippies except stockhausen while mr boulez his former colleague turned respectable becoming a world famous conductor stockhausen composed a piece called "stimmung" "sounding" for six singers who sit for an hour chanting a single chord and even further into what now looks much like hippie terrain he wrote a set of pieces called "aus den sieben tagen" "from the seven days" in which musicians improvise music based on verbal instructions most of them mystical "play a vibration in the rhythm of the universe " toward the end of the s stockhausen toured the world with a small ensemble eventually playing every day at the worlds fair in osaka japan hed become a kind of superstar tall he was foot magnetic inspirational every note he composed was recorded by the german classical record label deutsche grammophon there were even two lps of stockhausens greatest hits it was at that time that jazz and pop stars began listening to him the beatles for instance stockhausen is one of the many iconic people on the cover of "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band" hes in the last row just behind w c fields and his huge electronic piece "hymnen" "anthems" was the inspiration for "revolution no " on the white album and then there was miles davis who first heard stockhausen in the s and never stopped talking about him once on tour in germany he told his audience to give up on beethoven "youve got stockhausen now " stockhausen along with james brown was a major influence on a dizzying miles davis album "on the corner " released in funk and the classical avant garde together at last davis and stockhausen met they even recorded together though the results have never been released frank zappa loved stockhausen so does bjork and so do many jazz musicians and many creators of the latest strangest most radical electronic dance tracks but in the classical world stockhausen though a major figure in music history books seemed half forgotten when he died thats partly his own fault his mysticism took him over he said hed contacted beings from another star and in effect had channeled their music late in the s he embarked on a huge cycle of operas seven of them hours of music in all and though some were produced the project as a whole seemed too much for the classical world to swallow especially when one of the works called for a string quartet in which each instrumentalist is suspended in the air from a helicopter stockhausen also withdrew his cds from deutsche grammophon and made them available only from him at exalted prices with no chance even to buy them online you had to send him a check in germany that just about removed his music from circulation though theres a healthy trade in his old lps on ebay thus the paradox when a meditative nourishing new cd of "stimmung" emerged this year it took me back to the s and i happily reviewed it right here in these pages most of my classical music friends had barely even heard of the piece but with a young jazz musician i happened to meet i could have discussed it for hours mr sandow is a composer critic and consultant whos writing a book on the future of classical music
