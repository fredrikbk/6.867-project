feds new rules on mortgages draw hostility concerns about the u s mortgage crisis and turmoil in global credit markets intensified with u s policy makers seeking to clamp down on the practices that created the crisis and europes central bank pouring an unprecedented half trillion dollars into an effort to soothe markets concerns about the u s mortgage crisis and turmoil in global credit markets intensified with u s policy makers seeking to clamp down on the practices that created the crisis and europes central bank pouring an unprecedented half trillion dollars into an effort to soothe markets the federal reserve proposed new rules that would sharply curtail the kinds of high risk mortgages largely responsible for the global credit crunch but the proposal drew a lukewarm and occasionally hostile reaction from lawmakers and other critics who called for more aggressive action the feds proposal came as european officials tested a new approach to the fears of default that have reduced the availability of credit world wide the european central bank hoping to avert a year end meltdown in europes money markets swamped the markets with billion euros &# billion in two week loans to banks one of the largest sums a central bank has ever lent in a single shot the ecbs heavy lending pushed down europes short term interest rates as intended but wasnt applauded by everyone "theyve confused the market and created a lot of volatility " said erik nielsen european economist with goldman sachs in london in washington the feds proposal was greeted with jeers from influential democrats in congress and in a signal of the fast changing nature of the political debate former clinton treasury secretary lawrence summers called for a &# billion to &# billion stimulus package including universal tax rebates if the nations economy shows no sign of improvement by early next year democratic lawmakers pounced on the central bank for having failed to act before the current wave of home foreclosures and for not seeking bigger changes in mortgage industry practices they noted the feds proposal comes too late to help many homeowners and that it addresses a market for risky mortgages or subprime home loans that has largely dried up one big test of the feds overall response will come today when the central bank announces the results of an auction of as much as &# billion in low rate day loans to banks the auction was designed to encourage banks to lend to each other greasing the engine of the nations financial system a successful auction would be a sign that the feds efforts are gaining traction at least until then the harsh reaction to the feds proposal represents a setback for chairman ben bernanke who is trying to maintain credibility on capitol hill at a time when congress is scrutinizing the central banks monetary and banking policy decisions until now mr bernanke has won plaudits for his flexible approach to regulatory matters since becoming chairman in february at the same time lawmakers including rep barney frank a massachusetts democrat and chairman of the house financial services committee have threatened the central bank with legislation that would make other regulators equal to the fed in consumer protection authority over banks the threat of more than a million foreclosures in a presidential election year has supercharged the policy debate rather than forestalling more aggressive congressional action as some banking executives and central bank staffers had hoped the feds move may have incited it it could also affect treasury secretary henry paulsons effort to revamp the way the u s handles mortgage regulation which is currently shared by the fed and several other agencies mr paulson described that system monday as a "patchwork quilt " if the treasury makes headway it is expected to unveil a plan early next year democrats who have questioned the feds commitment to protecting consumers may see an opening to reallocate some of its authority "we now have confirmation of two facts we have known for some time one the federal reserve system is not a strong advocate for consumers and two there is no santa claus " rep frank said yesterday "people who are surprised by the one are presumably surprised by the other " years of lax lending by banks and other institutions have led to a surge in mortgage defaults over the past year as home prices have fallen from their peaks at the top of the recent housing boom unless lenders greatly step up efforts to restructure loans moodys economy com forecasts that three million home loans will go into default in the months ending in mid and about two thirds of those will result in foreclosures the feds proposed rules which would touch almost every corner of the mortgage market would ban lenders from making subprime loans "in a pattern or practice" that disregards a borrowers ability to repay "from sources other than the homes value " that provision is aimed at preventing lenders from assuming that rising home prices will compensate for a buyers stretched personal finances the rules also would bar lenders from making high cost loans that rely on unverified income or assets and lenders would have to set up "escrow" accounts to ensure that subprime borrowers property taxes and home insurance were paid such accounts are common on prime loans but subprime lenders have often skipped this precaution in addition the fed proposed rules that apply to both prime and subprime loans used to finance homes occupied by the borrower as opposed to investment properties among other things these rules would clamp down on payments to mortgage brokers that can give unscrupulous brokers a way to squeeze excessive profits out of a loan "unfair and deceptive acts and practices hurt not just borrowers and their families but entire communities and indeed the economy as a whole " mr bernanke said before voting to issue the proposal "they have no place in our mortgage system " the public will have days to comment before the fed finalizes the rules the proposal falls short of the more sweeping changes sought by consumer groups and senior democrats democratic leaders including rep frank and senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd made clear they plan to push ahead with their legislative plans to tighten regulation of the mortgage industry sen dodd said the feds moves amount to "a clear signal that legislation is necessary to help protect homeowners from abusive and predatory lending practices " for instance sen dodd has said the fed should prohibit prepayment penalties on all subprime loans instead the fed proposed that prepayment penalties on subprime loans should expire at least days before a loan resets to a higher rate sen dodd said he plans to "re examine" legislation he introduced last week on mortgage lending practices because he is now considering taking more power away from the central bank his displeasure with the fed could also derail the hopes of fed governor randall kroszner who was renominated for a year term at the fed in may his current term ends jan mr kroszner and two other nominees need dodds approval before facing a senate confirmation vote "it is unfortunate that so many consumers have had to go over the cliffs of foreclosure to get attention " said jim carr chief operating officer at the national community reinvestment coalition which represents local groups that promote affordable housing the feds proposal wouldnt assign any liability to wall street firms that market securities based on loans that turn out to be unfair or deceptive there are bills currently being considered in congress however that would do just that a fed official said the central bank lacks legal authority to do so the feds overall response to the housing bubble is becoming a sensitive topic now that the repercussions are clear the late edward gramlich a fed governor from to recalled earlier this year that he proposed in or around that the fed use its authority to send examiners into the offices of certain consumer finance lenders to tackle the growing problem of predatory lending alan greenspan then fed chairman opposed the move mr gramlich said mr greenspan has confirmed his opposition more recently mr greenspan told national public radio there was little the fed could have done short of a sudden increase in interest rates that would have popped the housing bubble and also "broken the back of the economy " yesterday the fed was clearly aware of the intense scrutiny it was under for the first time in the central banks history it allowed television cameras to record audio and video from the entire meeting the banking industry generally supported the feds approach the american financial services association called the proposal "measured " while the independent community bankers of america said it was an "important step " the american bankers association however said that some parts of the proposal were too rigid and "could make it harder for bankers to tailor products for their customers " though the feds proposal would apply to all subprime lenders the central bank wouldnt be alone in enforcing it a final rule would make it much easier for state attorneys general the federal trade commission and private lawsuits to go after those who violated the new policies the subprime market addressed by the proposals is now a fraction of its former size it mushroomed in the first half of this decade as lenders rushed to grab the higher profit margins available on such loans at the peak of the housing market in lenders granted about &# billion of subprime loans they accounted for a fifth of all home mortgages that year according to trade publication inside mortgage finance competing for this business lenders loosened their standards often requiring no down payments and no proof of income for years home price gains masked the repercussions of these decisions because borrowers who fell behind could easily sell their homes for more than they owed or refinance with even easier terms as home prices flattened out and began to fall last year defaults jumped investors who had been eager to buy subprime loans from the lenders recoiled from the market leaving little money available for them now lenders are making only a trickle of subprime loans guy cecala publisher of inside mortgage finance says subprime lending is running at an annual rate of about &# billion or around of the mortgage market the subprime market "is never going to be the size it was " said thomas kelly a spokesman for j p morgan chase &amp co s mortgage operations mr kelly said chase continues to offer subprime loans but borrowers need to show better credit scores and verifiable income and make a down payment generally at least like most lenders chase has stopped making subprime loans that "reset" to a much higher rate after two to three years at a lower introductory rate
