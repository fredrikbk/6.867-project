interest groups gain in election cash quest analysis shows giving to parties has dipped beyond swift boating during the election cycle such outside groups spent at least &# million on presidential and congressional races one fifth as much as was spent by national political parties according to the journal analysis of campaign data provided by the federal election commission and two nonpartisan organizations that track political spending washington one of the defining features of the presidential campaign was the devastating attack on sen john kerry by an obscure group called the swift boat veterans for truth in the years since such independent political groups have only grown stronger and they are poised to play an even bigger role in the elections political groups unaffiliated with the two major parties account for an increasingly large share of spending on federal campaigns of the total in up from just in according to an analysis of campaign finance data by the wall street journal they now are horning in on crucial campaign activities once dominated by the parties such as buying ads and getting out the vote in iowa independent groups are whipsawing voters with a range of conflicting messages an organization called common sense issues has funded automated phone calls backing former arkansas gov mike huckabee and criticizing his chief republican rivals the club for growth an antitax group is working to defeat mr huckabee with attack ads on the democratic side an organization called the american federation of teachers afl cio committee on political education has spent &# on radio ads in iowa backing sen hillary clinton an environmental group called friends of earth action is running ads against sen clinton over the past four years the national democratic and republican parties have raised and spent less on elections than during the prior four years when adjusted for inflation at the same time independent political groups have more than doubled their spending and have begun to rival the parties as an election season financial force the journals data analysis shows the shift largely the result of campaign finance laws intended to curtail big money donations to parties could further polarize the american political landscape because the republican and democratic parties aim to appeal to broad swaths of the electorate they tend to be moderating forces in politics that isnt true of the independent groups which range from the sierra club and the u s chamber of commerce to fringe groups like swift boat veterans for truth which disbanded after the election they often pursue narrower agendas or causes further out on the political spectrum the nonprofit groups are financed by wealthy individuals corporations labor unions and other interest groups unlike the national parties they face no limits on how much money they can take in from contributors they often dont have to disclose their donors names until months after an election if at all during the election cycle such outside groups spent at least &# million on presidential and congressional races one fifth as much as was spent by national political parties according to the journal analysis of campaign data provided by the federal election commission and two nonpartisan organizations that track political spending during the midterm elections these outside groups spent about &# million almost two thirds as much as was spent by the republican and democratic parties the data indicate candidates themselves still account for the biggest piece of spending a bit less than half overall the amount of money poured into each two year election cycle continues to climb data from the fec and several groups that track campaign finance indicate that total spending during presidential election cycles rose from &# billion in to &# billion in to &# billion in this year and next it is expected to hit &# billion political strategists say nonparty political organizations date back many years the nations founding fathers in fact considered it inevitable that outside political factions would attempt to influence the government the growing clout of such groups is an unintended consequence of a law intended to reduce the influence of money in politics the bipartisan campaign reform act of championed by arizona republican sen john mccain took aim at so called soft money donations to political parties soft money had become a major source of funding for both parties which used the donations to support individual campaigns the law barred the parties from accepting large contributions from wealthy individuals corporations labor unions and other interest groups the law elevated the importance of "bundlers" fund raisers who gather contributions from friends employees and family and pass them on in lump sums to political campaigns some bundlers had previously given soft money to national parties the law also prompted donors to turn to political organizations not tied directly to the parties many of them offshoots of established special interest groups there are several distinct classes of independent political groups each taking its name from the section of the internal revenue service code under which it is organized most are known as organizations although groups are recognized as political they are prohibited from explicitly calling for the election or the defeat of candidates consequently they often promote or attack candidates without instructing people to vote for or against them another class of independent groups is growing even faster and is flying further under the radar these groups are organized under section c of the tax code which gives tax exempt status to nonprofit groups one category called "social welfare " is governed by section c those groups can urge people to vote for or against a candidate so long as campaigning isnt their primary purpose and they dont accept money from corporations or labor unions labor groups are governed by section c business groups by section c these c organizations dont have to disclose their donors data from two nonpartisan organizations that track campaign finance the center for public integrity and the center for responsive politics show that election cycle spending by organizations rose from &# million in to &# million in to &# million in spending dropped to &# million for the midterm elections spending on midterm elections typically runs lower than on presidential elections the new groups are pulling in money that the major parties used to receive before the crackdown financier george soros donated more than &# to the democratic party since then he has given at least &# million to the organizations american financial group inc chairman carl lindner previously donated more than &# million in soft money to the republican party in he gave about &# to a c group called common sense ohio which sought to re elect several republican senators in the last four years mr lindner has donated &# million to outside groups backing republican candidates according to campaign finance documents because the irs doesnt require c organizations to detail election spending or to list contributors its difficult to track their political activity the journal analyzed data on separate c groups active in elections from to culled from a variety of sources the data show that the organizations spent at least &# million on the elections nearly twice what they spent in the c organizations are likely to become even more important in the election after the election the fec sought to crack down on organizations that violate the irs rule against calling for the election or the defeat of any candidate now several large groups are setting up c social welfare organizations which are allowed to back candidates explicitly scott reed a republican strategist says that for political campaigns using c organizations is "now the most effective way to go because donors are safe and dont need to be disclosed " the club for growth the antitax group used to use a structure for its election work but the fec fined it earlier this year for stepping over the line barring explicit voting recommendations during the current election cycle the group is shifting the work to a c unit which carries fewer restrictions the new structure will make the organization "bigger better and more effective " said its president pat toomey in a letter to members "we now have a significant new ability to run advertisements that directly call for the election or defeat of candidates " another advantage mr toomey noted is that "unlike the past your donations to the club will not be disclosed to the public " the league of conservation voters an environmental advocacy group that was also fined by the fec for its spending has made a similar move another environmental group defenders of wildlife started a c organization before the election partly to help wage a campaign to defeat california republican rep richard pombo then the chairman of the environment committee in the u s house the group spent &# million mr pombo lost the election rodger schlickeisen the groups president says it plans to spend &# million this election on campaigns against four candidates including rep don young the alaska republican who once was chairman of the same environment panel while independent groups have been building clout the national political parties have been losing election spending power in the national parties raised &# million in soft money which funded about half of their budgets for that years election cycle figures used in this story have been adjusted for inflation over the last four years following the ban on soft money the national parties have had about &# million less to spend on campaigns an drop during the presidential election the republican and democratic parties paid for of advertising in the largest cities according to a study by the wisconsin advertising project at the university of wisconsin in that figure fell to outside groups accounted for of the advertisements in the presidential campaign double the amount of according to the project democrats have led the charge toward using independent political organizations soon after the law took effect several democratic strategists including harold ickes a former top official with the democratic party and steve rosenthal who had run political operations for the afl cio met for dinner at beducis restaurant in washington they worried that the republican party would adjust better than the democrats in to the loss of soft money because it controlled the white house and because president bush knew how to rake in campaign cash mr rosenthal recalls the democrats decided to create and coordinate a set of organizations such as america coming together and the media fund which would essentially act like a shadow democratic party the democratic strategists raised &# million from wealthy liberals trial lawyers labor unions and other traditional backers of the democratic party and spent it on the campaign according to campaign finance records the democratic national committee spent &# million on the election according to campaign records all told since the campaign finance law took effect the organizations that support democratic candidates have spent nearly three times as much money on elections than those backing republicans according to the campaign finance institute one reason for the disparity is that corporations once the largest source of soft money donations to the republican party havent poured much money into s campaign finance lawyers who advise organizations say that corporations are concerned about getting involved with groups that run afoul of campaign finance rules democrats are expected to hold that lead during the cycle last month two democrats launched fund for america a group that plans to raise at least &# million to back the democratic presidential nominee republicans say they are recruiting donors to match that amount because they have their own agendas outside organizations sometimes clash with one another the national parties even the candidates they support abortion rights advocates say democratic party officials sometimes bristle when they fund political advertisements in support of candidates because the ads focus attention on an issue that can alienate some voters naral pro choice america plans to spend &# million on the election cycle double its budget for it hasnt yet endorsed any presidential candidate sen clinton has been both the beneficiary and the target of considerable spending by independent groups friends of the earth action an environmental group backing former sen john edwards is attacking her for not taking a stand on a global warming bill emilys list an organization that backs democratic candidates who are pro choice has spent nearly &# so far to support her in iowa on the republican side the antitax club for growth has clashed with the republican party several times last year the group campaigned against republican sen lincoln chafee of rhode island because he had voted against several tax cuts mr chafee won his primary anyway but lost to a democrat in the general election this year the group has been attacking mr huckabee for supporting tax increases as arkansas governor "call mike huckabee " one ad instructs viewers "ask why he supported all those taxes " common sense issues inc the group backed by american financial groups mr lindner in is funding automated phone calls to iowa voters touting mr huckabee and spreading negative information about his rivals mr huckabee said the mudslinging approach of common sense issues "violates the spirit of our campaign " patrick davis a former republican party consultant who is managing the independent campaign says that he hasnt spoken with mr huckabee "therefore we dont know what the spirit of his campaign is " t w farnam contributed to this article
