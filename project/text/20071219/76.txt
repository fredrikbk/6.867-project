older airbus jets get high tech rudder checks the rudders of about older airbus jetliners are being subjected to repetitive ultrasonic and other enhanced inspections the first time airlines and safety regulators have resorted to such recurring high tech procedures to determine the integrity of composite parts on airliners already in service the rudders of about older airbus jetliners are being subjected to repetitive ultrasonic and other enhanced inspections the first time airlines and safety regulators have resorted to such recurring high tech procedures to determine the integrity of composite parts on airliners already in service the stepped up inspection program recommended by airbus months ago and then reaffirmed by the european aviation safety agency through a mandatory directive calls for the first enhanced rudder checks to be completed within six months or flights some inspections on certain planes must be repeated every flights a relatively short compliance schedule for checking structural integrity of primary flight structures the enhanced inspections including ultrasound x rays and other techniques stem from a march incident in which an air transat airbus a suddenly lost its rudder over the caribbean while flying from cuba to quebec there were no injuries and the plane returned safely to cuba but as a result the planes manufacturer canadian air safety investigators and european regulators began investigating what if any additional inspection requirements were necessary to safeguard the integrity of such rudders used on early model airbus aircraft while the changes primarily affect a relatively small number of older twin engine as and as they nevertheless represent a significant break from longstanding airbus developed maintenance standards for composite materials before the incident airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co and european regulators maintained that simple visual inspections combined with a mechanics manually tapping on the surface of the composite rudders were adequate to detect any potentially hazardous internal flaws or structural weaknesses but now for the first time high tech inspections methods are being required and must be repeated during the life of a what airbus described as a "limited number" of airbus jets to assure long term rudder integrity a spokesman for airbus u s operations said only a small number of affected aircraft are flown by u s carriers spokesman clay mcconnell said about a and a aircraft are covered by the added inspections along with wide body airbus a and a jetliners mr mcconnell said airbus changed its rudder manufacturing process before the incident the issue of how to inspect composites is significant because both airbus and rival boeing co increasingly are relying on composite parts to improve the fuel efficiency and reduce maintenance costs for their newest airliner models
