business world a backdating sentencing mr reyess case featured all the ordinary lineaments of backdating however plus one a claim that he conspired with brocades human resources department to keep its finance department "in the dark" about the use of so called lookbacks to price employee options even as prosecutor tim crudo and colleagues insisted times during their closing argument that brocades finance department was deceived about backdating the sec was preparing civil cases against two former brocade cfos heads of the finance department for participating in benefiting from and concealing backdating law school is the cure for a "skull full of mush " according to john houseman in "the paper chase " on balance a salutary confirmation has been the legal systems handling of last years business crime of the century the widespread "backdating" of stock options instead of hundreds of criminal cases only a handful have been filed and everywhere you look judges have been handing down decisions noting the absence of evidence of shareholder harm but the exception proves the rule and gregory reyes today is scheduled to hear his punishment for felony convictions related to options backdating at brocade communications a company he once headed mr reyes didnt benefit from backdating he didnt have any discernible motive to overpay his underlings who did though of their options expired underwater anyway as the prosecution pleasantly conceded his motive was to attract talent in a hot silicon valley job market where competitors were dangling rich option packages too and the valley wide practice was to dish out these options without expensing them on a companys income statements so far mr reyess story is not different from those of hundreds of executives who have not been charged and probably never will be charged including apples steve jobs mr reyess case featured all the ordinary lineaments of backdating however plus one a claim that he conspired with brocades human resources department to keep its finance department "in the dark" about the use of so called lookbacks to price employee options weaved in the courtroom then was a story not only at odds with the publicly known facts but now the prosecutions key witness has been openly recanting to everyone in sight including friends business associates and journalists former brocade human resources employee elizabeth moore has been telling acquaintances three of whom have come forward under oath that she testified untruthfully out of fear for her job and under pressure from prosecutors mr reyes last week sought a new trial based on ms moore and shes not the only reason to conclude hes entitled to one even as prosecutor tim crudo and colleagues insisted times during their closing argument that brocades finance department was deceived about backdating the sec was preparing civil cases against two former brocade cfos heads of the finance department for participating in benefiting from and concealing backdating the lawyer for one mike byrd wondered aloud how the government in one case can claim the former cfo didnt know about backdating and in another case claim he did good question why it all began how it started we still dont know but somehow an idea circulated in silicon valley that backdating was a way to issue "in the money" options without expensing them take mr byrd he came to brocade from maxim integrated products where he also served as cfo and where backdating also allegedly took place backdating was evidently a silicon valley folkway sure enough in a final twist the reyes prosecutors amended their closing arguments after the fact to acknowledge that mr byrd was aware of backdating after all poof so much for any imputation of intrinsically guilty behavior on mr reyess part as the national law journal notes with exemplary precision "stock options backdating is not illegal it is the failure to properly account for backdating as an expense to the company that got so many in trouble " the argument from steve jobs greg reyes and dozens of others that they didnt understand the "accounting implications" of backdating certainly does tax credulity then why engage in the backdating rigadoon why not just create "in the money" options outright a likely answer executives understood better than the media that later came along that option expensing involves a meaningless non cash expense of no materiality to a companys share price whether the option is "in the money" or "at the money" at the nanosecond it is granted they never imagined being hauled up on criminal charges for taking the liberty of imposing a coherence on accounting rules that was lacking in the letter punishment should fit the crime dozens of executives have lost jobs over backdating a few have been asked to disgorge money and sign regulatory settlements that dont require acknowledgment of wrongdoing even the trial lawyers have been unable to make a meal out of this scandal thanks to an absence of demonstrable shareholder harm the great flaw in the reyes prosecution which was the first of its kind was the prosecutions attempt to fulfill the media image of backdating rather than focusing on the venial offense it was the government has suggested mr reyes should face years judge charles breyer in a recommendation recently unsealed proposed months some law bloggers think it not impossible mr reyes will receive a suspended sentence lets hope so because unless we plan to send steve jobs and a hundred other executives to jail for backdating it would be grossly disproportionate to inflict jail on mr reyes
