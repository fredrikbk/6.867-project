pressure grows on plantations while huge swaths of land continue to be torn up in the race to develop new plantations the plantation industry which is second only to the energy sector in its culpability for carbon emissions is coming under increasing pressure from environmentalists to adopt more sustainable practices singapore as global demand for plantation commodities continues to surge the race to develop new plantations shows no sign of letting up but while huge swaths of land continue to be torn up in the race to develop new plantations the plantation industry which is second only to the energy sector in its culpability for carbon emissions is coming under increasing pressure from environmentalists to adopt more sustainable practices and as prices for plantation commodities continue to rise the companies enjoying record earnings from them may soon run out of excuses not to invest in improved sustainable practices analysts say "the truth is these companies are enjoying record profits from the current commodities boom and they are going to find it increasingly difficult to make excuses not to work within a much tighter environmental framework in the years ahead they can no longer blame costs and a lack of resources " said christie robert managing director of qa plus asia a malaysia based agriculture and plantation consultancy firm conservationists say the continued development of new plantations is no longer an acceptable way to maintain a healthy balance between supply and growing demand and that the industry needs to look at ways to increase output total global demand for vegetable oils for example is expected to hit million tons by a jump of from while demand for natural rubber which has surged in recent years due to a growing appetite for car tires most notably in china and india is likely to hit million tons a year by up from around million tons in consumption of papermaking fiber in china alone is expected to reach million tons a year by according to a recent paper by the center for international forestry research prices have risen in tandem with growing demand rubber prices are currently around higher than they were in december palm oil prices hit a record on the bursa malaysia derivatives exchange in november pushed up by soaring demand and near record crude oil prices although observers within the plantation sector maintain that the industry is moving in the right direction and learning from its mistakes most agree the industry will need to embrace more effective sustainable working practices in the years ahead "the palm oil industry has taken to heart the concerns of the ngos nongovernmental organizations and it is setting its house in order " said dorab mistry director of godrej international ltd part of indias godrej group "the implementation of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil for example is a clear step in the right direction clearing and planting practices will be subjected to stricter regulations in the future but i believe the plantation industry will be successful in explaining its point of view " he said the roundtable on sustainable palm oil is a body consisting of nongovernmental organizations and palm oil companies aimed at making palm oil more environmentally friendly but plantation companies must now start looking at realistic ways to expand output in the years ahead without reverting to straightforward land expansion analysts say increasing yields through improved plantation management more intensive research and development programs the implementation of carbon trading systems and cash incentives for producing countries to replace forest already lost to plantation expansions are some of the measures currently under way or being discussed the potential for increasing annual yields per hectare within the natural rubber industry for example is huge yields now range from around kilograms pounds per hectare a year to around kilograms per hectare "the major plantation companies are in a far better position to utilize maximum yields than smallholders many of whom have a lack of scientific knowledge and resources " said suharto honggokusumo president of the rubber association of indonesia better managed plantations not only serve as models of sustainable agriculture but have the added benefit of enhanced economic performance he said indonesia the worlds second largest natural rubber producer is undertaking a major replanting program to replace around hectares acres of older lower yielding rubber plantations with high yielding clones at a cost of &# per hectare the completion of the program is expected to make indonesia the worlds biggest natural rubber producer by similarly the palm oil industry has huge scope to increase output in other ways than by simply increasing acreage according to some industry analysts malaysias palm oil yield average remains at tons to tons per hectare per year much lower than the to tons per year achieved by the top performing companies in the face of increasing environmental pressures the need for all parties to work together to maintain a healthy balance between future supply and demand is now more important than ever analysts say "there is a definite need to work together both to enshrine sustainable practices but also to ensure prosperity for the large populations who reside in the countries that rely on the production of plantation commodities " says godrej internationals mr mistry
