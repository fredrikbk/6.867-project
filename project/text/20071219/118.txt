will likely soothe short term tensions the maneuver wont eliminate fears about the depth of european banks subprime exposure in a massive effort to stave off a year end money market crisis the european central bank yesterday swamped markets with billion euros &# billion in two week loans to banks the largest sum the central bank has ever lent in a single shot in a move reminiscent of preparations for the yk changeover at the end of the ecb is mounting an all out assault against any chance that year end scrambling for cash could add unwelcome stress to an already fragile money market "the enormity of the sum is an indication of just how stressed commercial banks were " said james nixon euro zone economist with societe generale in london ecb policy makers arent aiming their relief at any specific bank but they worry that european banks still have undisclosed losses related to the subprime mortgage problems in the u s mr nixon and other analysts noted that while the funds will likely soothe short term tensions the maneuver wont eliminate fears about the depth of european banks subprime exposure "this isnt solving the problem " he said "its just postponing it " european markets initial response was positive two week interbank rates fell to between and close to the ecbs policy rate for overnight loans that rate spiked friday to the ecb two week funds were offered at the ecbs move is the latest salvo in the global central bank effort announced last week aimed at coaxing banks to lend more readily particularly to each other banks and investment houses around the world hold securities linked to u s subprime mortgages which are going into default at rates much higher than anticipated but precisely who holds the securities and what they are worth is now in doubt with banks and markets uncertain which banks hold these securities banks have been persistently reluctant to lend to each other for longer than overnight many banks are holding on to cash to bolster year end balance sheets which they know will be scrutinized by rating agencies investors and other banks for its part the u s federal reserve this week began auctioning off as much as &# billion in day loans to banks under a new lending operation called the term auction facility results of that auction are to be disclosed at a m est today a second auction of as much as &# billion this one for loans for days is scheduled for tomorrow the bank of england meanwhile added &lt pound&gt billion &# billion in funds for three months to united kingdom money markets yesterday at a minimum bid rate of lower than the rate it set on previous interventions the fed launched the lending operation because banks have been reluctant to borrow directly from the fed either because such loans carry a stigma or because the current rate on such loans isnt attractive analysts will watch results of the fed auction closely to see how much banks sought and at what rate the funds were lent "the best news for the fed is if banks have gotten to a point where they see it as a take it or leave it proposition" that is as an option but not one they have to rely on said lou crandall chief economist at wrightston associates a wall street research firm "the most reassuring outcome is if you get bids for the rate at which banks are willing to borrow that are down near the minimum " he said "thats a sign that banks are happy to take the funding but dont need it if you need it youll give yourself some insurance and submit a higher rate at which to borrow " j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp were among the big banks to bid for funds in the auction but bank of america chief executive kenneth d lewis said last week that the charlotte n c bank is likely to be outbid by others who need the money more and are willing to pay a higher rate officials of a few large banks said they bid for funds but they wouldnt disclose details or permit the names of the banks to be published at least one bank ceo said his bank bid for funds but at an interest rate so low that the bank doesnt think it will actually get any borrowing since august banks have been reassessing the risks involved with all types of lending including loans to other banks a fact that distinguishes this credit crunch from past crises in which banks simply scaled back their lending to traditional customers "you dont usually see it in terms of banks cutting back on lending to other banks " says david fanger chief credit officer for financial institutions at moodys investors service the rating company "it does appear that there is a bit of cash hoarding " banks have reason to conserve cash income from securitizations in which banks package loans into investment vehicles that are sold to investors has dried up because investors are reluctant to buy loans in the current environment cash rich money market mutual funds over the past five months have reduced their willingness to lend to banks mounting defaults threaten to sap banks capital cushions mr fanger describes the pullback in interbank lending as "a bit of an overreaction " but not entirely irrational "given the degree of uncertainty and continuing concerns about where the next losses are and what the next shoe to drop will be that certainly drives the cautious behavior " he said current conditions could persist "it is more than getting past year end " mr fanger said "its a question of greater clarity " that might not come until the spring when auditors comb through banks financial statements in advance of their annual reports that process "could provide better disclosure and greater clarity to the market but it might not " the ecb move wasnt universally hailed "theyve confused the market and created a lot of volatility " said erik nielsen european economist with goldman sachs in london "why did the ecb choose to abandon their auctions and go for all out liquidity injection i honestly dont know but they must have been terribly worried about the lack of liquidity during the last weeks of the year " he said lowering the rate at which the ecb lends to banks directly the european equivalent of the feds discount rate from its current would have been less disruptive mr nielsen said but ecb policy makers are reluctant to brandish new tools to combat resurgent market tensions worrying such moves could ignite market fears that the central bank sees a crisis ecb policy makers had prepped markets for yesterdays move saying late monday the central bank wouldnt set a ceiling on the bids it would accept in todays auction the ecb previously had estimated banks would need billion euros for routine business over the next two weeks the enormity of the borrowing demonstrated how jittery banks are about having enough cash on hand at year end policy makers at both the ecb and the bank of england anticipate more clarity next spring when banks report audited results for edward taylor in london david
