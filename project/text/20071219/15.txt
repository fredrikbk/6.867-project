business now even borrowers with good credit pose risks while profit margins on these loans to risky borrowers seemed tempting the banks chief executive believed the default risks were too hefty to justify housing speculators who loaded up on sunbelt condominiums in and hoping to flip them at a profit are especially likely to walk away from oversized mortgages says guy cecala publisher of the trade publication inside mortgage finance in bethesda md no matter what their credit scores he says "if theyve got no money down and a &# loan on a property thats worth &# it isnt difficult for them to walk away or to mail their keys in to the lender " kenneth lewis acted far ahead of the competition in when he got bank of america out of the business of issuing subprime mortgages while profit margins on these loans to risky borrowers seemed tempting the banks chief executive believed the default risks were too hefty to justify it took a while for mr lewis to be proved right but bofas payoff has been huge the big charlotte n c bank has largely sidestepped the subprime mess emerging despite taking some hits on investments it made in securities tied to subprime loans with the highest net income of any u s commercial bank this year meanwhile some of its rivals have sustained multibillion dollar losses from subprime lending so what is mr lewis worrying about today in an interview last week with wall street journal editors he expressed concern that even borrowers with strong credit scores might turn out to be default risks if housing prices keep tumbling in other words what is being portrayed as a credit quality problem with the riskiest of the mortgage market could spread to a much wider cross section of home loans such jitters mean that cleaning up the subprime mess may be just a prelude to resolving deeper problems with mortgages in general investors cant be sure yet how any financial institution even a stalwart such as bofa will sort out its home loan portfolios lending norms have eroded making it hard to know who is really a "good" borrower "theres been a change in social attitudes toward default " mr lewis says bankers typically have believed that cash strapped borrowers would fall behind on their credit cards car payments and other debts but would regard mortgage defaults as calamities to be avoided at all costs that isnt always so anymore he says "were seeing people who are current on their credit cards but are defaulting on their mortgages " mr lewis says "im astonished that people would walk away from their homes " the clear implication at least a few cash strapped borrowers now believe bailing out on a house is one of the easier ways to get their finances back under control because of lax lending standards in the past few years many homeowners never amassed much equity in their homes sizable down payments became a rarity as many buyers borrowed close to of the purchase price through a blend of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit others kept refinancing their mortgages as property prices climbed taking on bigger loans and draining the equity value of their homes as a result there is a new class of homeowners in name only because these people never put up much of their own money they dont act like owners committed to their property for the long haul they behave more like renters ducking out of an onerous lease in the midst of a housing slump such behavior was highlighted in a page one journal article this week about the housing quagmire in corona calif one couple bought a home for &# in and then refinanced it for increasing amounts as property prices soared eventually ending up with an &# mortgage and extra cash for personal expenses the couple then bought a cheaper home in texas and stopped making payments on the corona home in june as the countdown to foreclosure continues it looks increasingly likely lenders will be stuck with that house housing speculators who loaded up on sunbelt condominiums in and hoping to flip them at a profit are especially likely to walk away from oversized mortgages says guy cecala publisher of the trade publication inside mortgage finance in bethesda md no matter what their credit scores he says "if theyve got no money down and a &# loan on a property thats worth &# it isnt difficult for them to walk away or to mail their keys in to the lender " in such an environment credit scores dont really provide a definitive gauge of how hard a borrower will work to avoid default says mark zandi chief economist of moodys economy com inc a west chester pa economic research firm a better test he says is how much equity owners have in their home if they have a lot at stake default becomes almost unthinkable without much equity the commitment to keep paying the mortgage no matter painful that may be begins to dwindle how did banks lending standards get so far off course familiar answers include a race for market share a herd mentality and the apparent profitability of risky lending in boom times lenders also may have grown too fond of credit rating data that were cheap meticulous and not well suited to a fast evolving market if so its another reminder that when it comes to customer data precision is nice but relevance is better what lenders really needed to know was something harder to pinpoint the true depth of homeowners commitment to their properties healthy banks such as bofa have plenty of time to absorb such lessons and regroup what is surprising is how few lenders opted for prudence when there was still time to save their portfolios even though the rickety underpinnings of the subprime market were in plain sight
