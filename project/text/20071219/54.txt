indian imports of lng may rise strong economic growth is also fueling higher energy demand and the country is trying to reduce urban pollution by encouraging motor vehicles to switch to compressed natural gas and by promoting city gas networks for domestic cooking and heating new delhi india is likely to boost liquefied natural gas imports in mid even though its biggest gas discovery in recent years will come onstream at about the same time india which imports more than of the crude oil it uses is also heavily dependent on imported gas which accounts for about a quarter of the total gas available in the country national gas usage in india is likely to grow many industrial users would be happy to make the switch from oil based fuels like naphtha whose prices have gone up about this year strong economic growth is also fueling higher energy demand and the country is trying to reduce urban pollution by encouraging motor vehicles to switch to compressed natural gas and by promoting city gas networks for domestic cooking and heating on the supply side there is plenty to be optimistic about although there is no danger of running a surplus reliance industries ltd indias biggest company by market capitalization is expected to start commercial gas output from its big find in offshore eastern indias krishna godavari basin in the middle of production will build up to million standard cubic meters a day in the same volume as total output from all of indias gas fields now indias biggest lng terminal dahej which is run by petronet lng ltd will start bringing on line additional capacity making it able to handle million metric tons million short tons a year by the end next year double current levels petronet will need to hunt out additional spot cargoes or short term deals to make use of this extra capacity as long term supply wont flow in until for some six months from mid dahej will have spare capacity of around million metric tons on an annualized basis said petronet chief executive officer p dasgupta dahej now processes about five million metric tons annually of lng bought from qatars rasgas under a long term supply contract these term supplies are due to be increased to million metric tons annually from dahej already takes an additional million metric tons annually from rasgas under short term deals and may extend these to import a further metric tons by next december the remaining dahej capacity could be used for importing about lng cargoes through spot and short term contracts mr dasgupta said but he wouldnt talk about possible sources of this gas more potential supply will come from a five million metric tons annual capacity terminal in dabhol on the west coast which is due to be fired up in may initially running at to capacity using spot market lng cargoes the only other fully operational terminal in india is a shell india facility in hazira also on the west coast which exclusively processes spot lng cargoes this million tons a year plant has boosted imports in recent months to between two and three cargoes from two a month but is still working slightly below capacity on top of all this will be the large inflow of gas from reliances krishna godavari reserves which will be piped ashore at an initial rate of million standard cubic meters a day the government says overall domestic gas output in the april march fiscal year will rise to million standard cubic meters a day but this wont be nearly enough to meet potential demand "even with the kg basin gas the deficit projected by the government is huge " said mr dasgupta average demand in the year ending march is seen at million cubic meters a day and india will need as much as million cubic meters of gas daily by or "the demand is building up ahead of reliances gas which could benefit lng importers a large number of consumers in the industrialized northern and western regions of india are switching to gas and away from liquid fuels " said a senior executive from a gas company "customers will obviously prefer reliance gas but it wont be enough lng terminals will continue to run at full capacity even when domestic production picks up " apart from their limited regasification capacity indian lng importers were until a few years ago held back by the reluctance of the heavily regulated power and fertilizer sectors to pay market prices for gas power generators and fertilizer companies indias biggest gas users get gas at below market values from state run oil and gas groups as mandated by the government but falling volumes of the regulated portion of gas output coupled with rising demand means that indian consumers today are willing to pay market prices said sanjay kaul an energy and resources adviser at business services firm deloitte "price is no longer that big a problem now for consumers its the availability of gas" said a petronet official "people have been coming to us asking for any amount of spare gas but we have none and we are working above our nameplate capacity " he added "every molecule of gas available in the country will get sold only that cheaper gas will sell first and then the imported gas " mr dasgupta said "users are willing to pay the price they are paying " india is also trying to line up long term gas deals and multinational pipelines gas distributor gail india ltd wants to tie up term gas for the dabhol terminal from algeria australia and qatar and according to the government is close to reaching a deal with algerias sonatrach petronet is trying to buy term lng from exxon mobil corp s share in the australian gorgon project to feed another terminal a five million metric tons a year facility in the southern coastal city of kochi which is due to be commissioned in indian efforts to buy gas through international pipeline routes including from myanmar iran and turkmenistan have yet to show results
