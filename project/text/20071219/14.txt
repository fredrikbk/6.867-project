bawdy scene from the life of one of americas leading business buccaneers in then in his s cornelius vanderbilt spent his days sailing schooners up and down the hudson river transporting cargo and paying passengers the arrival a few years earlier of the first steamships clanking loudly and belching flames and smoke provoked scorn from sailors who waved their hats in condescension and "sometimes also turned their backs bent down and revealed their bare ends to the dignified ladies and gentleman who had paid lofty prices to flirt with the future cornelius sometimes made such a salute " so writes edward j renehan jr in his fascinating biography of the man nicknamed "the commodore " the image of vanderbilt dropping his drawers is a fitting one for the way vanderbilt built a fortune by flouting societys conventions while navigating the shifting tides of american commerce first small boats known as periaugers then schooners then his own fleet of steamships and finally the railroads that eventually replaced most of them along the way this uneducated gutsy and often callous man laid the foundations for what mr renehan describes as "the greatest private fortune the world has ever known " stately reminders of the familys pre eminence can be found in manhattans grand central terminal tennessees vanderbilt university and such grand palaces as newport r i s breakers and north carolinas biltmore house when cornelius died in his assets were &# million a sum that in todays dollars is about three times that of bill gatess estimated wealth cornelius left the bulk of his estate to just one son william henry vanderbilt known as billy and small amounts to his nine other surviving children billy increased the fortune to just above &# million an amount mr renehan writes that exceeded the contents of the u s treasury at the time yet by when vanderbilt heirs gathered for a reunion there was not a millionaire among them mr renehan tells us perhaps the founding entrepreneurs harsh treatment of his own family foreshadowed such a dissipation of the family fortune vanderbilt married a first cousin once removed sophia johnson whom hed known since their childhoods on staten island but he spent many nights cavorting with the easy women of the new york waterfront infecting himself and his wife with syphilis when sophia protested about moving her large household from staten island to washington place in greenwich village he had her committed to an asylum incarcerated for three months she was released apparently after agreeing to the move vanderbilt was also bullying toward his children routinely belittling them and their abilities unfairly as it turned out in the case of billy who proved to be a ferociously able businessman vanderbilt was just as ruthless in his business dealings his brazen defiance of an early steamship route monopoly he hid in a secret compartment of his steamboat to elude the constables who tried to arrest him for his unsanctioned runs became legendary as mr renehan writes vanderbilt "staunchly opposed any monopoly he himself did not personally control " he once helped free an ice trapped ship by crawling out on wooden boards over the frozen water the press relished such antics including vanderbilts boat races along the hudson for money and made him into a robin hood like figure of the new york harbor vanderbilts scrappiness barely subsided as he aged he once throttled a well known fighter named james "yankee" sullivan years vanderbilts junior outside a lower manhattan saloon in a melee he built his fortune by delivering reliable transport at a low price though not always with a keen sense of customer service one group of his steamship travelers were so outraged by the poor service that they purchased space in the new york times to vent their anger calling vanderbilt "the most successful most penurious and most heartless millionaire that ever disgraced our country " vanderbilt waged brutal price wars with rivals and in later years as his empire expanded to railroads manipulated stock to get his way his battle against jay gould pitting vanderbilts new york central against goulds erie railroad was notorious for its ruthlessness and financially dodgy one upmanship unkempt and ill mannered vanderbilt was shunned by much of the polite society of the day not surprisingly he channeled only a small fraction of his wealth to philanthropy focusing instead on racing horses and dabbling in the occult as he grew older after his wife sophias death he became entangled with a pair of sisters the free love advocate victoria woodhull and the spiritualist healer and sometime prostitute tennessee claflin who became a regular fixture at washington place "the servants " mr renehan writes "grew used to finding her rosy and tousled in the commodores bed in the morning " vanderbilt set up both of the sisters in business as wall streets first female stockbrokers an enterprise that soon collapsed vanderbilts son billy orchestrated for his father an apparently loveless marriage with the familys piano teacher as a kind of "insurance and place holder" against corneliuss further entanglements with claflin banished from washington place after the marriage the sisters began publishing woodhull &amp claflins weekly a champion of womens suffrage free love vegetarianism and the legalization of prostitution the commodore backed the paper which made history by publishing for the first time in america karl marxs "communist manifesto " since the commodore was barely literate it is not likely that he grasped the irony mr renehans book moves along nicely most of the time but drags through the tiresome detail of monopoly busting and share manipulation its brightest moments are those that illuminate the vanished world of new yorks waterways with "oysters a foot long" and cannonballs flying across bows when vanderbilt died in one observer commented that "hed seen a score of waterfront whores genuflect as vanderbilts funereal vessel slipped her moorings and eased off carrying one of their most reliable customers away from manhattan forever " a fitting tribute indeed ms flynn siler a wall street journal writer is the author of "the house of mondavi the rise and fall of an american wine dynasty "
