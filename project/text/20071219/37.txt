fcc votes to ease media ownership rules blasted by consumer groups concerned the media ownership change will lead to a new wave of consolidation the cross ownership decision sets the stage for a battle on capitol hill by democrats and a few republicans determined to prevent it washington federal regulators narrowly voted to allow companies to own newspapers and television stations in the nations largest media markets easing rules that have restricted cross ownership for more than years calling the proposal a "relatively minor loosening of the ban " federal communications commission chairman kevin martin pushed through a plan on a partisan vote to allow media companies to own both a newspaper and tv station in those markets it also approved a new set of requirements for companies seeking to own both print and broadcast properties in smaller markets and gave permanent waivers for media companies that currently own newspaper and tv stations as the commission loosened one rule it was tightening another it approved a national cap on the number of subscribers a cable operator may serve one fcc commissioner republican robert mcdowell predicted yesterday that "the cap is sure to be struck down by the court " since an appeals court dismissed a similar restriction in comcast corp is the only company large enough to threaten to brush up against the cap in a prepared statement comcast executive vice president david cohen said the company remains "highly confident that the federal courts will agree that the commissions decision is not supported by the record and that this cap is unconstitutional " blasted by consumer groups concerned the media ownership change will lead to a new wave of consolidation the cross ownership decision sets the stage for a battle on capitol hill by democrats and a few republicans determined to prevent it a court challenge is also likely similar to one that took place four years ago when the fcc last attempted to loosen media ownership rules in that instance the court tossed out most of the fccs changes arguing the agency hadnt made its case throughout the almost month long media ownership debate media reformers have been far more passionate about lobbying against the changes than media companies have been in defending them one reason is that for several years mr martin has shared media companies belief that the cross ownership rule isnt necessary in the internet age and that the ban was hurting newspapers more than it was helping consumers "i believe the time has come to act and i believe todays very modest relaxation of the one rule not relaxed since is appropriate " he said another issue is the evolution of the media landscape which has found media companies such as belo corp and others more likely to spin off their newspaper properties than to add more in a research note yesterday lehman brothers media analyst anthony diclemente noted that "that a relaxation of the media ownership rules should not result in much further media consolidation nor do we expect another round of the consolidation driven expansion that occurred in the late s " the fccs new rule will allow a company in the largest markets to own both a newspaper and a radio or tv station in order to do so there must be at least eight media outlets in the market and if the transaction involves a tv station it cant be one of the four largest stations in that market in smaller markets firms can apply for a waiver from the rule though they will have to prove under a new test that it would be in the public interest the decision to approve permanent waivers created some consternation among consumer groups and some lawmakers of those waivers involve transactions that predate the rule that instituted a cross ownership ban and had therefore been exempted from the old rule permanent waivers will benefit companies including gannett inc and media general inc which faced the prospect of having to sell media assets in certain markets across the country "the granting of unprecedented relief to media general and gannett reflects a triumph of lobbying over substance " said andrew j schwartzman president of media access project despite last minute lobbying by news corp to receive a permanent waiver from the new rules the company was unsuccessful the company owns two tv stations in the new york city market and the new york post the company has a permanent waiver for one station but only has a temporary waiver for the other news corp also owns dow jones &amp co publisher of new york based wall street journal which is considered a national newspaper the fccs decision could prompt a fight in congress and just hours after the fcc vote democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama of illinois issued a written statement lamenting the agencys vote he was among senators who wrote asking the fcc to postpone the vote and threatening to block any changes the bush administration is backing mr martin and threatening to oppose any congressional action
