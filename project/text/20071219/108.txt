stupid intelligence on iran the release earlier this month of "key judgments" from the national intelligence estimate including the bald assertion "that in fall tehran halted its nuclear weapons program" has caused both astonishment here at home and consternation overseas where it has resulted in confusion about americas policy goals and steadiness let us stipulate that the intelligence community has acquired evidence sufficiently persuasive to lead it to reverse its prior judgment that iran was hard at work developing nuclear weapons for that it has been praised particularly in traditional intelligence quarters for "speaking truth to power " and thereby dissipating some of the distrust generated by its faulty earlier judgments on iraq the nies about face on irans nuclear weapons program represents a reversion to an earlier style of intelligence analysis featuring a renewed determination not to get beyond the "hard evidence " but as we shall see this has led to a decision not to consider several crucial elements that lay behind the presumed decision in tehran clearly the key judgments in the nie were overstated and that in turn may reflect the very late decision to declassify the key judgments written in a kind of shorthand and thus incautiously phrased the crucial decision hidden in a footnote was to define the "nuclear weapons program" which had been halted to mean only "irans weapon design and weaponization work and covert uranium enrichment related work " thus it excludes irans overt enrichment program monitored by the international atomic energy agency we have long understood that the production of fissile material whether overt or covert remains "the long pole in the tent" in the development of a nuclear capability thus the nie defines away what has been the main element stirring international alarm regarding irans nuclear activity yesterday tehran announced its bushehr nuclear power plant will be operating at full capacity by the end of next year yet even though russia supplied the nuclear fuel for bushehr the iranians insist on maintaining their "civilian" uranium enrichment program weapon design and weaponization at least for the simpler weapons is a far less demanding and less time consuming task than uranium enrichment let us examine what else has not been considered the nie asserts "that iran halted the program in primarily in response to international pressure" and that "indicates that tehrans decisions are guided by a cost benefit approach " now what might have constituted the principal elements in that "international pressure" to induce tehran at least temporarily to halt its covert weaponization program the american invasion of iraq resulting in the seizure of baghdad in days time something that had widely been suggested could not be accomplished the earlier destruction of the taliban regime in afghanistan another display of american military prowess the decision of col moammar gadhafi to abandon his nuclear program and to renounce and make amends for terrorism the exposure and partial demolition of the a q khan nuclear technology network khans confession and his confinement by the pakistani government to his home does it not seem likely that tehran took notice of these events and may have been intimidated by them into more circumspect behavior the nie argues that "tehrans decisions are guided by a cost benefit approach " given those successful american actions those who guide decisions in iran may well have decided that the potential costs of being caught with a clandestine program had risen sharply and that the presumed benefits of early clandestine weaponization efforts could safely be deferred in brief since the "long pole in the tent" remains the production of fissile material iran likely decided that the prudent course of action was to pursue an open enrichment program ostensibly to produce fuel for nuclear reactors it is a course that had been chartered by north korea and arguably was legitimate under the nonproliferation treaty this central path to obtaining fissile material the focus of international concern has been treated in the nie as quite distinct from the "nuclear weapons program " still the achievements of american arms and american policy during that period were undoubtedly noted in tehran why not mention them in the nie as possibly influencing tehrans decision in the answer in brief is that it would have been speculative and in violation of the renewed commitment of the intelligence community to stick to the "hard evidence " there was no intercept there was no agents report that such calculations were indeed the source of irans switch so in order to avoid the kind of speculation that had gotten the intelligence community into trouble in its judgments regarding iraq these realities were left up to the imagination of others and the intelligence community stuck to what it had evidence for what was obvious about events in and around should have been obvious at least to the american media the media lord knows have no inhibitions about engaging in speculation or urging us to "connect the dots " or feeling any obligation to limit themselves to hard evidence the nie almost begged for others to follow up on the nature of "international pressure" and the calculations behind irans "cost benefit approach " but the american media today almost reflexively treat any development as a setback for the administration of george w bush so the media quite clearly ignored the obvious that a surprising decision by tehran in to halt the covert weaponization effort likely was a tribute to the successes of american policy and arms during that period thus administration policies and actions that likely induced caution in tehran could be characterized ironically enough as an administration defeat little more need be said about the process by which what might have been heralded as a victory was transformed into a defeat and echoed overseas but a few words do need to be added about the intelligence communitys decision to restrict its key judgments to "hard evidence " many in the intelligence community embrace this as a return to virtue yet in itself it has severe drawbacks as in this case reading the key judgments may now require something akin to cliffs notes listing other relevant events and considerations that may be necessary in interpreting an estimate limited to the hard evidence exclusive reliance on hard evidence not infrequently results in deliberately blinding oneself to the most obvious explanation of what has occurred the classic example of this failing occurred during the vietnam war when intelligence analysts stubbornly refused to accept that enemy supplies were pouring through sihanoukville ostensibly on the grounds that there was no hard evidence actually there was an agents report that revealed the activity but it was dismissed as insufficient intelligence based on hard evidence requires supplementation by other forms of intelligence "failures of imagination " to which the commission referred can come in a variety of modes mr schlesinger is
