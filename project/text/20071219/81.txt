paulsons dangerous precedent the reality is that the ultimate lenders are really individual investors many in retirement who unwittingly participated in subprime lending through the purchase of collateralized debt obligations and other forms of securitized mortgage products by the fund managers they trusted with their money treasury secretary hank paulsons rescue plan has landed amid the wreckage of the mortgage market unfortunately the proposal lacks balance the treasury secretary has effectively given borrowers a unifying voice borrowers preserve their value proposition under the plan as they are able to "freeze" attractive rates and enjoy the future benefits of potential property appreciation investors however will not be able to enjoy the original value proposition and could face significant further losses on the positive side the plan aims to minimize foreclosures and protect borrowers of good character who got into trouble it appropriately recognizes that there is a social and economic cost if foreclosures rise home values will further deteriorate a paulson type plan is necessary given the current financing structure of home loans with most being done through securitizations which can be divided among thousands of investors scattered world wide it is next to impossible today for most homeowners to speak directly with their lenders by setting up rules of the game for mortgage servicers albeit voluntary ones the proposal provides a framework for overcoming the challenges faced by borrowers and lenders still the paulson plan is fundamentally flawed because it all but ignores the losses that "real world" investors pensioners retirees k participants money market investors and many others are experiencing there has been a tendency in the media to portray the lenders as solely investment banks when in fact they directly hold a very small percentage of the mortgage securities the reality is that the ultimate lenders are really individual investors many in retirement who unwittingly participated in subprime lending through the purchase of collateralized debt obligations and other forms of securitized mortgage products by the fund managers they trusted with their money the retired schoolteacher who invested in a bond fund for retirement income did not intend to participate in reckless subprime lending transactions mr paulsons plan with its "freeze the teaser" component to lock in low initial rates for borrowers has the effect of violating the sanctity of financial contracts this is a troubling and potentially dangerous precedent for the government albeit under the auspices of a "voluntary" program from a practical and indeed a fear of litigation standpoint many servicers simply wont implement this program since they have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their investors they cannot and should not be expected to sit still and accept the plans "voluntary" call for lower payments with no offsetting benefits it would be as simple and create less litigation risk for servicers and trustees for investors and borrowers to agree to freeze existing payments but not the underlying contractual mortgage rate the difference between this frozen payment and the contractual payment would be capitalized as negative amortization unpaid interest that is calculated and added to the total loan amount assuming housing prices appreciate investors could recoup some or all of this negative amortization borrowers should have incentives to refinance out of these modified loans into stable fixed rate loans including those from the federal housing administration the most effective way to do this is to offer to return the negative amortization to the borrower if the refinancing occurs within a specified window such as the first three years of the modified loan in fact the paulson plan as now constituted provides no incentive to refinance the modified below market rate loan into a fixed rate loan without refinancings however the government and other market participants will need to again address the number of "frozen" loans in the coming years when the extended deadlines expire rather than being solved problems will just be postponed with the negative amortization component if the borrower fails to refinance the loan he would still be able to live in the home and the economic disruptions of foreclosure would be avoided lenders and investors would have lower costs than they would from foreclosure and both could potentially gain from future property appreciation the likelihood of higher home buying costs throws another wrench into the paulson plan lending institutions will tilt to more restrictive lending requirements and or impose a "lending premium" to take into account the new risk that future loans will not be repaid as projected this will raise borrowing costs and shut out of the market renters and young couples who are on the cusp of buying the key to any effective mortgage rescue plan is to provide balanced workable and fair incentives to both borrowers and investors such an approach will benefit both parties and sustain home values while solving problems sooner rather than later mr dachille is chief executive officer of first principles capital management he formerly served as a managing director for j p morgan chase &amp co
