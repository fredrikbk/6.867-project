common sense tip for a down market make the most of losses i buy at intervals of declines in the nasdaq and sell at intervals of increases the median decline and rise in bear and bull markets although long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate at the federal level those taxes too can add up with additional state and local levies smartmoney when is a loss a gain with stock indexes falling on continuing credit fears and renewed worries about inflation and recession the question is especially timely with just two weeks left in it may be time to make the best of a losing situation of course losses are always gains for short sellers if they happen to be short those stocks that are dropping its a risky strategy that transforms gains into losses and not one that i have the stomach for even so last weeks declines gave me the perverse pleasure of selling shares at a loss thereby generating tax deductions i recognize that this isnt the same as turning a loss into a gain but at least it mitigates some of the pain the bigger the loss the bigger the tax break since losses can be used to offset realized capital gains and once those are used up they can offset up to &# in ordinary income and then if you still have more losses on the books they can be carried forward to be used next year depending on your federal bracket and how much you pay in state and local taxes that can mean getting back as much as cents on the dollar if you have short term capital gains which you do if this fall you followed my whole foods market wild oats merger arbitrage strategy they are taxed as ordinary income you can deduct short term losses against those gains i have substantial long term capital gains and you do too if youve followed my system i buy at intervals of declines in the nasdaq and sell at intervals of increases the median decline and rise in bear and bull markets although long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate at the federal level those taxes too can add up with additional state and local levies why pay even reduced capital gains taxes if you can offset the gains with long term losses last week i went through my portfolio and ruthlessly sold everything with a loss the total didnt amount to all that much but every little bit helps i find this exercise also adds some useful discipline i still want to own some of these stocks and after more than days have passed i can buy them back any sooner than that would be considered a "wash sale" and id lose the deduction this forces me to reanalyze some holdings i might otherwise take for granted were not at a selling point now so i put the sale proceeds back into the market buying stocks ive earlier recommended in this column including avon products and syngenta both have substantial exposure to overseas economies a theme that ive embraced and that i expect to continue in a corollary to tax loss selling is failing to sell a stock that has risen in value in order to avoid a capital gain in my view this is nearly always a mistake the size of a stocks gain in your portfolio most likely has absolutely nothing to do with its prospects and should thus be irrelevant to your decision to sell or hold a close friend of mine clung to his shares in citigroup this year because he didnt want to pay capital gains taxes their value has since dropped by nearly half and his losses are much larger than they would have been had he sold the shares and paid the tax moreover if he had losses to offset the gain he wouldnt have paid tax at all remember there are far worse things than paying taxes you have to pay only if you make money which isnt such a bad problem to have james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
