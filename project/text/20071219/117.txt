tax report irs combats its in house snoops the government said she disclosed confidential information such as social security numbers birth dates and bank account information of at least individuals to someone outside the irs and was paid about &# for the information curiosity may be a good trait for a tax collector but some internal revenue service workers are taking it too far despite repeated warnings by irs officials over many years irs employees still are getting nabbed for snooping through confidential taxpayer records without authorization in some cases irs workers were curious about an ex spouse or neighbor but in at least one case an employee was paid by an outsider for information that was used by identity thieves according to interviews with treasury officials and a new report hundreds of irs workers were disciplined in the year ended sept for breaking the rules and some have even faced prosecution illegal browsing has long been a problem at the irs even after congress enacted tough taxpayer privacy legislation in the late s government officials and lawmakers take the issue seriously since the confidentiality of taxpayer records is considered a bedrock principle of the u s tax system snooping has persisted even though irs officials frequently warn workers in strong terms not to tap into the agencys computers to look at confidential taxpayer information without an official tax administration purpose although the number of browsing cases is tiny compared with the irss overall work force the number went up in the latest year officials at the treasury inspector general for tax administration or tigta say they opened investigations in fiscal up from the prior year and the highest since a taxpayer privacy law was enacted browsing violations "continue to be a major concern to both tigta and the irs " says j russell george the agencys inspector general "taxpayers depend on a tax system that protects the confidentiality of the information they provide to the irs these cases can impact the integrity of the entire tax system " during the latest year there were "adverse administrative actions" against irs workers including firings and suspensions a tigta official says thats up sharply from such actions the prior year in each year there also were "successful prosecutions" in cases over the past decade treasury investigators have opened more than investigations as a result there have been cases in which workers have been disciplined and there have been "successful prosecutions " so why do irs workers risk their careers and possible prosecution for a peek at someone elses confidential tax data the reasons are varied investigators say some irs workers were caught peeping at tax records of an ex spouse a neighbor someone with whom theyre having an affair or a celebrity but in some cases the motives are more complex one case involved josalyn johnson who worked as a tax examining clerk at the irss philadelphia service center the government said she disclosed confidential information such as social security numbers birth dates and bank account information of at least individuals to someone outside the irs and was paid about &# for the information she entered a guilty plea last summer to unauthorized disclosure of tax return information and exceeding authorized access of a government computer says her lawyer michael engle her sentence included three years probation a &# fine and a &# special assessment why did she do it "there was an element of coercion or duress " mr engle says he says someone intimidated her including threatening her with bodily harm into cooperating he says her home had been burglarized which she took as a sign that she needed to cooperate "the motive was she was scared of this guy and what he was going to do and she acted in large part out of fear " says mr engle in another case an irs employee accessed tax return information about the ex husband of an individual with whom the man had a "personal relationship " the tigta report says the result the man was sentenced to probation for two years and ordered to participate in mental health treatment the irs says that taxpayer privacy is "a high priority" and that the agency "does not tolerate unauthorized employee browsing" and recently improved its detection systems unauthorized access investigations during "involved less than " of employees with computer access to taxpayer return information the irs is continuing to explore ways to reduce the number of violations while browsing offenses have grown they arent the only type of cases that worry law enforcement authorities recently former irs agent robert rosner was charged in an indictment with soliciting a bribe from a taxpayer the indictment alleges that mr rosner while working for the irs contacted the head of a small business in new york to discuss an audit mr rosner asked the victim to treat him to lunch which the victim did over lunch mr rosner told the victim he would terminate the irs audit of the company if he was paid &# "the victim agreed to pay the bribe " the indictment says and mr rosner later told the victim he had closed the audit attempts to reach mr rosner and his lawyer werent successful cases in which an irs agent asks for a bribe from a taxpayer are "very rare " says timothy camus tigtas assistant inspector general for investigations "any taxpayer who believes that an irs employee has attempted to extort something from them is encouraged to contact tigta " mr camus says at tigtas web site www tigta gov or by calling
