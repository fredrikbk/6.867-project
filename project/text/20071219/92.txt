preservation hall in all its forms in his book song for my fathers a new orleans story in black and white tom sancton a new orleans native and former time magazine paris bureau chief offered this reflection upon returning to preservation hall i placed my hands on the wrought iron gates and peered into the carriageway new orleans three distinct groups lined up on st peter street just off bourbon street one recent sunday evening the first awaited tall cocktails called "hurricanes" at pat obriens bar the second had signed up for a "ghost tour" through the french quarter the third sought passage through the iron gates at better known as preservation hall once inside that last group sat in a dusty room on benches and narrow floor cushions sans food or beverages seeking to drink in only traditional jazz and to commune with a singularly haunted spot around larry borenstein first began inviting musicians to perform in the art gallery hed created within a c building once a private home in the french quarter but when allan jaffe fresh out of wharton business school and his wife sandra took over the operation in the place became a full time music hall dedicated to a style that was then as now threatened with extinction mr jaffe hired standard bearing players and paid full union scale a rarity in those days he began making recordings and assembled bands that toured under the preservation hall name always a strong tourist attraction the hall has also held special appeal for some locals occasionally with life altering effect in his book "song for my fathers a new orleans story in black and white " tom sancton a new orleans native and former time magazine paris bureau chief offered this reflection upon returning to preservation hall "i placed my hands on the wrought iron gates and peered into the carriageway it looked just like it had on that hot summer night when my father first took me there more than forty years earlier and opened the door to the most profound experience of my life i immediately fell in love with the music the people and the funky atmosphere and decided to become a jazz musician myself " mr sancton who once studied clarinet at the feet of one of preservation halls masters george lewis still plays his instrument now a visiting professor at tulane university he occasionally performs at preservation hall billed as "tommy" often sitting in the same chair mr lewis once occupied for those whove never visited the place the touring band is the face of preservation hall yet good as the group is little can rival for instance the two beat to the bar swing conjured by drummer joe lastie on his stripped down kit theres more to preservation hall than just music theres a sense of place and purpose history and context all this comes alive through "made in new orleans " a fascinating new boxed set created by ben jaffe the year old son of allan and sandra who has run the hall and all its associated activities ever since he graduated in from the oberlin conservatory of music in ohio most will purchase "made in new orleans the hurricane sessions" for its track cd of old and new recordings and its companion dvd but many will end up treasuring the package as much for the accompanying memorabilia publicity photos and casual snapshots business cards and invitations even the first artist contract issued by the hall in &# per musician and double for the leader punch miller mr jaffe created collectors editions the number signifying the local area code each of which contains some original photos and an unreleased seven inch vinyl recording he sold them for &# initially only in new orleans through the annual jazz &amp heritage festival and at the hall the collectors edition and a deluxe edition &# sans only the original photos and bonus seven inch disc are now available nationwide mr jaffe plays tuba in the preservation hall band as did his father but arriving for an interview at a favorite coffee shop on his bicycle his unruly tangle of dirty blond curls swaying in the breeze he didnt look much like a traditionalist "my father was always conscious of the tender tension between the past and present in new orleans and in this music " he said "the name preservation hall never meant that things should not evolve " indeed the new cd masterfully blends old and new some tracks predate even the halls name via recordings by street poet painter and singer sister gertrude morgan while others introduce both new voices and new repertoire clint maedgen sings a version of ray daviess "complicated life " a song made famous by the british rock band the kinks yet theres fascinating continuity from say the dvds gorgeous c s clip of george lewis playing "red wing" to the current bands version of "last chance to dance " the studio trickery that mixes banjoist carl leblancs vocal on "over in the gloryland " recorded last year with a instrumental version emphasizes this point like mr jaffe trumpeter john brunious who has led the preservation hall band since was born into this tradition as a boy he watched paul barbarin who didnt read or write musical notation hum "bourbon street parade" as his father also a trumpeter transcribed even today mr barbarins song is a staple of the preservation hall repertoire "we all have our own styles " mr brunious said recently after a performance "but we strive most of all to play the music as correctly as we can to keep the music honest and going strong " preservation halls traditions its very existence are important keys to recovery in new orleans "there arent too many places left near bourbon street where you can play traditional jazz " said trombonist glen david andrews whose lazy six band often plays there on sundays "and playing this one means that youre authentic " the hall has aided rebuilding in more direct ways too shortly after the floods mr jaffe co founded a musicians relief effort now known as the renew our music fund supporting the new orleans music community with everything from gig subsidies to "community leader" grants that fund was in turn instrumental in creating sweet home new orleans an umbrella organization helping musicians and other tradition bearers with a range of services including relocation and housing assistance "it always comes back to what the musicians want and what the music needs " says mr jaffe sounding quite a bit like his father as glimpsed on the new dvd during a episode of the "brinkley news hour " "jazz here on bourbon street is what people seem to think is going to sell drinks " allan jaffe says on camera "what were trying to do here is just present the music the way they want to play it the people come here to hear just the music and i think the men realize this the men play it the way they want to play it and the people hear it " mr blumenfeld is working on a book about cultural recovery in new orleans he writes about jazz for the journal
