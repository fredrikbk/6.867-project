nbc to use cable international shows with the hollywood writers strike cutting off traditional supply lines for new scripted television shows nbc executives said yesterday that they will fill out the networks prime time schedule with reruns from sibling cable network usa and with shows that are being produced outside the u s with staffs of "international writers" independent of the writers guild of america with the hollywood writers strike cutting off traditional supply lines for new scripted television shows nbc executives said yesterday that they will fill out the networks prime time schedule with reruns from sibling cable network usa and with shows that are being produced outside the u s with staffs of "international writers" independent of the writers guild of america coupled with the return of nbc late night hosts jay leno and conan obrien on jan these moves should do much to help insulate the network from the effects of a protracted strike the executives said nbc is a unit of general electric co s nbc universal which also owns a string of cable channels including usa bravo and sci fi executives at other broadcast networks are contemplating similar moves including working with overseas production studios and using nonunion writers if the strike drags on much longer according to people involved in these discussions hopes that the strike already six weeks old would end soon have faded since the alliance of motion picture and television producers which represents the studios walked out of the last round of negotiations on dec since then both sides have been trying to position themselves for a long standoff the writers have announced plans to try to negotiate independent deals with studios while the major media companies have sought to find ways of working around the writers yesterday walt disney co s abc announced that its late night show "jimmy kimmel live" will return without writers on jan following the similar announcement from nbc on monday until now the networks had been expected to soon run out of fresh episodes of their most popular prime time shows forcing them to revert to unscripted fare such as reality and game shows which often draw lower ratings but nbc said it has a slate of never before seen episodes of new and returning scripted shows for january and february including "lipstick jungle " "medium" and "law and order special victims unit " because of the strike the network has only partial seasons of all the shows meaning it will still run out of new material by early spring unless the strike is resolved to fill the void starting in march the network will air reruns of "monk" and "psych " two usa dramas one about an obsessive compulsive detective the other about a fake psychic detective on sunday nights in prime time nbc and usa executives said the program exchange was in the works before the writers strike began nov "this is something weve been talking about doing for a while " said marc graboff co chairman of nbc entertainment and universal media studios "the strike has accelerated it " other broadcast networks are considering picking up cable programming as well bridging the once vast divide between the two television universes at a conference this month cbs corp chief executive leslie moonves said the cbs network would consider picking up programs including the serial killer drama "dexter " from its sibling premium cable network showtime the strike has already begun to interrupt the development season for shows for next year but a new nbc strategy in which the profit starved network partners with outside production studios giving up international distribution rights in order to share the cost of high quality scripted dramas is providing an extra level of protection two shows produced under these terms "robinson crusoe" and "fear itself " are continuing production now unaffected by the strike "we have writers working on those shows right now " said ben silverman co chairman of nbc entertainment and universal media studios the network has episode orders of each meanwhile the fate of the awards show season is in jeopardy on monday night the writers guild of america said it denied two requests from the companies that produce award show telecasts one to use writers for the golden globes and another to allow the use of clips during the oscars nbc which airs the golden globes and abc which airs the oscars declined to comment the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which administers the oscars said the guilds denial doesnt affect its ability to air the clips although it does affect the conditions under which the clips can be broadcast dick clark productions inc which produces the golden globes telecast said it "will attempt to reach some type of agreement" with the guild that would allow writers to work on this years show the statement comes days after david lettermans production company worldwide pants inc which wholly owns the cbs talk shows "the late show with david letterman" and "the late late show with craig ferguson " said it would seek an interim deal that would let the shows return to air with their writing staffs sam
