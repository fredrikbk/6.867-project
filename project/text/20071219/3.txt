an expansion a quaker could love its the back of the house operations that have pride of place and account for most of the projects &# million cost space for conservation labs storage research facilities and staff accommodations including elegant offices formerly the boardroom and the presidents lair from the art deco days assigned to the museums director anne dharnoncourt and its chief operating officer gail harrity philadelphia they dont build them like they used to visitors awed by the ornate art deco exterior and the swank lobby of the landmark former fidelity mutual life insurance headquarters repurposed as the recently opened perelman building of the philadelphia museum of art cant help but feel let down by the plainness of the new gallery spaces that have been annexed by architect richard gluckman to the rear of the former financial palace the square foot addition to the original square foot building looks like what it was designed to be a no frills functional facility brought in at reasonable cost flamboyant architectural statements were not envisioned for this low key but essential project the addition provides square feet of modest windowless gallery space the old section of the building with its generously proportioned windows now features a spacious high ceilinged gallery well suited for displays of large scale sculpture but its the back of the house operations that have pride of place and account for most of the projects &# million cost space for conservation labs storage research facilities and staff accommodations including elegant offices formerly the boardroom and the presidents lair from the art deco days assigned to the museums director anne dharnoncourt and its chief operating officer gail harrity the closest approximation to a "wow" space in mr gluckmans design is its skylit "galleria" a glorified corridor bridging the gap between the two architectural eras its cream colored walls consist of smooth brick from the rear of the old building on one side and the more textural rough cut concrete blocks of the new addition on the other the monotony of the long neutral passageway is relieved by alcoves for art including works by jacques lipchitz toshiko takaezu and aristide maillol whose bronze nude is on loan from the buildings benefactors ruth and raymond perelman a jaunty inward tilt at the top of one end of the new wall which creates more space for the costume and textiles study gallery on the second floor is the new constructions only architectural fillip i visited the philadelphia museum on opening day of its "renoir landscapes" exhibition in the main building but the most excitement i witnessed in the galleries that day was not among the impressionists but among the furniture kitchenware and gadgets at the collab gallery devoted to modern and contemporary design enlivening this relatively compact densely installed showroom for all kinds of attractive stuff was a constant buzz of ecstatic exclamations as visitors marveled that familiar everyday objects from grandmas eames chair to moms chemex coffee carafe to sisters iphone were curator certified treasures that this proved such a revelation to so many indicates how under the radar the design collection had been in the museums sprawling main building that collection formerly claimed a mere square feet of dedicated gallery space compared with in the new facility similarly costumes and textiles had been allotted little more than a closet now they have square feet on the perelmans main floor where you can try to picture how famous former owners like rosalind russell and jacqueline kennedy once looked in designs by three philly natives james galanos gustave tassell and ralph rucci they have an additional square feet in the study gallery on the upper level a third gallery currently showcases a large selection of philadelphias important trove of photographs by alfred stieglitz this also boasts a local connection a subsection of the show displays images given to the museum by dorothy norman a philadelphian who was stieglitzs lover and a photographer herself more photographs as well as prints are displayed in a tiny easy to miss gallery to the right of the main entrance featuring recent acquisitions the most expansive and dramatic new exhibition space favored by ample sunlight from the large windows of the original insurance building now features contemporary sculpture from the permanent collection ranging from picassos "man with a lamb" to an exuberantly colorful sol lewitt floor piece chatting with me in the perelmans cafe joseph rishel the museums senior curator of european painting told me that hed like to see a future "potpourri" exhibition in that space drawing cross cultural connections among diverse permanent collection works from around the world creatively experimental shows such as envisioned by mr rishel may be the key to positioning the perelman as an alternative destination for off the beaten track museumgoers despite its understated charms this new outpost of the main museum which majestically overlooks it from a nearby hill is unlikely ever to be a major crowd magnet only about annual visitors are expected about one tenth of the main buildings draw the perelmans galleries were moderately well attended during my visit with tour groups periodically arriving on the shuttle from the main building a short but inconvenient journey on foot because of pedestrian challenging traffic while the design gallery may be the popular favorite the sunlit library in the perelman is clearly the directors pick in new york recently to tout the perelmans opening and the main buildings coming exhibitions ms dharnoncourt exulted in the librarys greatly enhanced ability to provide state of the art public access to some books and periodicals which are housed in four times the space theyd had before not only a research haven the library also includes display cases for rotating exhibitions of rare books and manuscripts its main reading room is adorned by four bronze figurative reliefs representing the four elements that had been designed by paul manship in for the at&amp t building in new york but look as if they had always belonged between the large windows in their current abode whats best about the library is that unlike some other museum research centers philadelphias is not just for serious scholars and specialists but also welcomes casual knowledge seekers who can also browse through its offerings in an online catalog curators and conservators who are among the staff members decamping to the new facility couldnt be happier with their new digs sara reiter who cleans and restores costumes and textiles proudly showed me the new equipment in her conservation lab which will allow her to treat items from the collection that would formerly have been sent out to private practitioners not all of the object collection of costumes and textiles has yet arrived from its cramped storage space across the street nor has the move of prints drawings and photographs yet been completed the study rooms for these collections are to open by appointment next fall although up and running the perelman is still a work in progress as is the philadelphia museums original site a new garage to be topped by a landscaped sculpture garden is under construction and an ambitious frank gehry designed renovation and underground expansion with new space for contemporary art and special exhibitions is in the early planning stages with about &# million of the perelmans &# million cost still to be raised coming up with some &# million for the gehry project will likely prove a daunting challenge in the meantime the successful realization of the perelman building was a strong first lap in philadelphias cultural construction marathon ms rosenbaum writes on art and museums for the journal and blogs as culturegrrl at www artsjournal com culturegrrl
