martins double vision the new rule passed along party lines at the five member federal communications commission will allow media conglomerates to own television stations and newspapers in the same market and other unspeakable combinations fcc chairman kevin martin braved left wing outrage yesterday by lifting the three decade old cap on media cross ownership the new rule passed along party lines at the five member federal communications commission will allow media conglomerates to own television stations and newspapers in the same market and other unspeakable combinations one of the two democratic commissioners called it a "brazen" disregard of congress etc etc so why on the very same day did mr martin turn around and vote with the democratic commissioners to impose caps on the size of cable companies when it came to the cross ownership rules mr martin said "we cannot ignore the fact that the media marketplace is considerably different than it was" when those rules were first imposed on this point mr martin is certainly correct access to the news is no longer limited to a choice between one of three network affiliates on the one hand and a newspaper or two on the other between the panoply of cable news outlets and the internet it is far fetched that any company could monopolize a local media market populists in congress and in the blogosphere amusingly enough may bray about media consolidation but the real story of our age is information fragmentation as mr martin correctly observed many of those same forces are at play in the cable industry but when it comes to the market share of cable companies mr martin seems to feel that he both can and must ignore the changes in the market as well as a appeals court ruling that struck down a cap very much like the one mr martin voted to reimpose yesterday perhaps were mistaken to look at the substance of mr martins two step however maybe this is about politics the press loves a good story about the press so chairman martin can be pretty confident that the media cross ownership controversy will lead the news today and the cable cap will be relegated to a footnote that begins "separately the commission also voted " near the end of any story that bothers to mention it the rule bars any one cable company from controlling more than of the national subscriber base the argument for such a rule is that a cable operator that commanded too much market share could keep competing cable channels off the air and unduly control programmers access to households these days though the tv watching market is in some ways less concentrated than ever when congress first asked the fcc to look at this question in cable operators owned more than half of the channels they offered today they own less than according to commissioner robert mcdowell in the court of appeals for the d c circuit wrote that the fcc might some day be able to justify a cap on the market share of any single cable company the largest today has a share however the number of cable channels has since ballooned satellite has doubled its market share and now the phone companies are starting to offer tv too but never mind all that mr martins animus toward the cable business is by now a matter of public record and yesterdays action can only be understood as part of his personal campaign to make the industrys life as hard as possible the d c circuit is almost certain to strike down this rule as it did the last time but by then there may be a fresh face as fcc chairman and the only winners will be the lawyers who billed the hours
