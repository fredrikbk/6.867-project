changes in store for czech tv prague central european media enterprises and modern times group ab may see their dominance of the czech republics million euros &# million annual television advertising market wane when new stations arrive with the start of digital broadcasting in six new commercial channels already licensed start transmission next year and will challenge the current commercial television duopoly of cetvs tv nova and mtgs tv prima which together hold about a market share "we think the new channels will take ads from incumbent stations though it will take time " said hana doleckova television marketing manager at the prague unit of advertising sales company arbomedia ag the switch to digital tv broadcasting from analog also taking place in poland hungary and slovakia removes barriers to entry by multiplying the number of television channels that can broadcast on a given frequency changes in the czech republic are dramatic compared with other countries in the switch to digital the number of commercial stations here will quadruple "the emergence of new channels will inevitably lead to a dilution of audience share as smaller niche channels attract some viewers from more mainstream schedules " said romana tomasova head of cetvs corporate communications however ms tomasova said cetv doesnt anticipate "a major impact on advertising revenue " as its channels offer a mass audience to advertisers she didnt elaborate by contrast the prague unit of media and advertising monitoring agency taylor nelson sofres plc or tns expects advertisers to quickly switch to the new channels "we expect the new stations will attract advertisers in a very short time period one or two months maximum " said robert bartusek head of tns pragues client services "the big advertisers will spend a significant part of the tv budget in new digital stations " independent czech production house febio sro is investing about one billion koruna &# million in starting its own full format television channel next year after having made more than programs over the past years for czech television broadcasters says petr sladecek head of development and strategy at febio febio tv aims for an eventual share of viewers and says the new channels should cut tv novas market share to about in from today mr sladecek said "there is room for competition on the supply side " he added calling the czech market currently "one of the least competitive markets in europe " hungary and poland each have several nationwide commercial stations while the czech republic only has two of the new stations two will be full format while four will be niche stations catering to particular demographic groups helping advertisers to target their audiences "im convinced the full format channels dont have a chance" of competing with the niche players in targeted advertising said jiri balvin general manager at ocko a czech and slovak popular music channel owned by german publishing company rheinisch bergische druckerei &amp verlagsgesellschaft gmbh mr bartusek of tns added that mobile phone operators and consumer goods companies will be more interested in the new full format stations while local and medium and small budget advertisers will also partly relocate from nova and prima leading advertisers have already purchased most tv advertising time for arbomedias ms doleckova said so the first negative financial impacts to tv nova and tv prima would likely come in tv nova which garners nearly of czech television advertising spending accounts for the lions share of cetv earnings together with sister station markiza in slovakia in cetvs czech and slovak operations contributed of total revenue of &# million and of earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization or ebitda this year cetvs guidance indicates they will contribute as much as of revenue and of ebitda ms tomasova of cetv said any losses in advertising at tv nova would be "really negative for cetv " said josef nemy analyst at komercni banka in prague the banks latest recommendation on cetv from june is "sell " with a target price of &# "a bigger decrease could erase part of expected improvements in tv novas advertising and expectation plays a high roll in cetv share price " he said it has taken the czech government several years to put a legal framework for digital broadcasting in place it passed the digital broadcasting bill into law this autumn some observers express skepticism as to whether the new stations will really impact the local market so cetvs and mtgs stock prices have until now ignored the developments cetv also will launch its own thematic digital channels which is an opportunity for it to expand said grzegorz litynski analyst at kbc securities in warsaw kbc has a hold recommendation on cetv and a target price of &# both tv nova and tv prima announced in october that they would increase prices for advertising in by while state controlled public broadcaster ceska televize or czech television will lift prices next year by analysts say that once the new stations are fully up and running it will be more difficult for publicly traded cetv and mtg to lift prices mr bartusek of tns said he expects that tv nova and tv prima will be forced "maybe in a year " to offer better prices to keep the biggest advertisers despite rate increases television ad spending should be flat on the year or register only a minor increase in as advertisers scale back television promotions say tns and arbomedia "flooding the market with television advertising isnt efficient now and advertisers are looking at different media " mr bartusek said since the s when cetv and mtg won tenders to become the countrys first commercial broadcasters their stations have enjoyed largely unchallenged positions in the local ad market czech law allows commercial stations to devote of broadcast time to advertising while on czech television only of broadcast time can feature ads to be sure the majority of czech households arent yet covered by digital land to air transmissions so a large investment in infrastructure development needs to be made before digital television can overtake analog in the face of expanded competition the incumbents are already making changes to their operations to try to maintain viewership and revenues tv nova recently reintroduced erotic films on friday nights and is going to expand its multichannel strategy to reach various demographics it has moved to a ratio from the standard ratio to provide a widescreen look and better imaging the analog broadcast licenses of tv nova and tv prima are valid until so the czech government may have trouble phasing out all analog television broadcasting by two years before the european commissions target date of "thats the basic reason why the state cant move forward with full digitalization " said vaclav zak chairman of the czech broadcasting council the state awarded additional digital broadcast licenses to current commercial operators as compensation for switching off their analog broadcasting but the stations have yet to say when they will phase out analog broadcasting to make room for more competing channels "the government will need our analog frequencies back but the timing depends on the technical switch over plan which we have not seen yet " said cetvs ms tomasova mtg declined to comment margit feher in budapest and malgorzata halaba in warsaw contributed to this article
