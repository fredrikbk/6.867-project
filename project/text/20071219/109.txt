rising tide dissent slows chinas drive for massive dam projects local critics scuttle hydropower plants the right to say no in other countries public debates over dam projects have proved to be turning points in how a society treats environmental issues says andrew mertha a politics professor at washington university in st louis and author of a forthcoming book on chinese dams china isnt ending its love affair with dams which have played a central role in chinese government policy since the communist party took power in dujiangyan china around b c a chinese official here designed an ingenious system of earthworks that tamed the flood prone min river and distributed its water to farmlands legend has it that he needed the assistance of a god to complete the task the waterworks still stand today guiding the river at the point where it pours down off the tibetan plateau and into the fertile plains of sichuan province now they have become one of the key battlegrounds in chinas rethinking of the costs and benefits of its massive dam network seeking to control floods and produce clean energy chinas central planners have presided over a relentless dam building drive the countrys large dams represent nearly half the worlds total but growing numbers of chinese citizens are criticizing the environmental and social upheaval caused by the structures and many point to the ancient dujiangyan waterworks as a less intrusive way to control rivers just upstream environmentalists and sympathetic government officials managed to scuttle a proposed extension of a large dam in arguing that the project would have diverted water away from the ancient site now opponents are turning their attention to a plan to build a series of hydropower plants on a nearby river the only one in the region that hasnt yet been dammed dams have emerged as one of the few legitimate subjects of vigorous public debate one thats testing the limits of the publics role in shaping policy in this authoritarian country beyond dujiangyan other proposed dams in places like tibet have been put on hold or scaled back after public outcry "times have changed engineers need to raise their awareness of environmental protection " says lu youmei the former head of the embattled three gorges dam project and now chairman of the chinese national committee on large dams a major dam engineering organization in other countries public debates over dam projects have proved to be turning points in how a society treats environmental issues says andrew mertha a politics professor at washington university in st louis and author of a forthcoming book on chinese dams in the u s for example a government proposal to build dams on the colorado river in the area of the grand canyon unleashed an outpouring of opposition in the government abandoned the plan many scholars now date the decline of large scale dam building in the u s to that event while often touted as a way to provide clean energy and restrain floods large dams also cause social dislocation as whole towns are uprooted to make room for their reservoirs dams can also result in complex and sometimes unpredictable environmental changes stopping a rivers flow changes its ecology and can allow pollutants and silt to accumulate more easily nowhere have the costs of dam building been more visible than at chinas three gorges the worlds largest and perhaps most notorious hydropower project begun in the dam forced the migration of millions and led to high unemployment in the region deadly landslides pollution and other environmental problems many of these problems were predicted by the projects critics in the s but those who spoke out against three gorges which had been endorsed by chinas top leaders often saw their careers suffer as a result last september after years of suppressing criticism chinese officials frankly acknowledged a series of problems and said the three gorges project could lead to "catastrophe" if its issues arent quickly addressed government officials had laid the groundwork for that admission with a gradual reconsideration of their dam building approach the shift is part of a broader move by the current chinese leadership to soften a growth at all costs economic philosophy with greater attention to society and the environment in its latest five year plan published last year the governments new policy is summed up in the ungainly phrase "orderly development of hydropower on the basis of ecological protection " it represents a retreat from the previous slogan to "actively develop hydropower " which was essentially a government blessing to any and all dam projects china isnt ending its love affair with dams which have played a central role in chinese government policy since the communist party took power in the pace of dam building has actually accelerated in recent years as the booming economy has increased demand for the clean electricity that turbines mounted in dams can supply one hydropower engineer trained in the s hu jintao is now chinas president even many experts critical of individual projects still believe that hydropower is one of the only ways china can meet its energy needs without causing massive pollution the argument is more over how dams will be built than whether they will be built at all "this is the most concentrated and most active period of dam building in chinas history " says liu dehong a former maritime safety official who this year petitioned the government to slow down the pace of dam construction planners need to consider the impact of dams on local people and the environment he says to avoid any negative consequences "we should not have a great leap forward in this area " mr liu says referring to chinas disastrous forced industrialization of the s which led to a famine that killed millions some chinese are particularly protective of dujiangyan located in the west of sichuan province and at the edge of the tibetan plateau every day tourists stroll through a tree filled park before coming to a view of a large river splitting in two that division is the handiwork of li bing an ancient magistrate credited with creating dujiangyan using little more than stone bamboo and rope he cleaved the min river into two channels in such a way that flood waters are automatically diverted in plans were finalized for a dam to be built upstream although some articles which appeared mostly in overseas media warned the dam could harm dujiangyan domestic opposition never gathered steam construction on the zipingpu dam began in march and finished last december in april local officials held a large meeting to discuss plans for another dam which they said was needed to regulate the flow of water from the reservoir at zipingpu into the dujiangyan waterworks by then unesco the united nations cultural arm had named dujiangyan a world heritage site meaning china would get u n help in preserving it for posterity and publicity to boost tourism revenue this time the plan sparked an immediate backlash one major opponent a new chinese government bureaucracy created by the unesco designation and charged with preserving the sites cultural value opponents said the dam would irrevocably damage li bings ancient design by altering the water flow and would also be close enough to be visible to tourists the threat of the dam impinging on the heritage site shifted the ground of the debate from technical and environmental issues to the preservation of a national treasure the cultural officials proved sympathetic and granted dozens of interviews to the press helping create a storm of media coverage opposing the project that led to a surprisingly quick decision to abandon the dam by august it was officially suspended "from the perspective of the local authorities allowing the public to participate didnt have a very good result " says ai nanshan a professor of environmental sciences at sichuan university around that time mr ai and other academics founded the chengdu urban rivers association a nonprofit group that advocates keeping rivers in their natural state and has kept an eye on dujiangyan the national environment for dam projects was also beginning to turn similar protests over planned dam projects were unfolding elsewhere in sichuan and in neighboring yunnan province opponents highlighted forced relocation and damage to the environment and spectacular scenery in yunnan they won a suspension of dams planned for the nu river in january the state environmental protection administration responded to the large number of reports of environmental problems with dams it issued an urgent notice calling attention to problems at many dams and requiring projects to undergo environmental impact assessments it blamed a surfeit of dams for causing some rivers to run nearly dry environmental officials followed up in february with new rules requiring public comment on the environmental impact of projects including dams yet there is a huge industrial and political establishment devoted to dam construction in china and critics still face long odds dujiangyans engineers are now focused on a mile stretch of the baitiao river the only one of the six local rivers fed by the ancient waterworks that has not already been built up with dams engineers argue the plan which would add a whole series of small dams and hydropower plants would help expand the area dujiangyan can irrigate by adding modern hydraulic technology mr ai of the chengdu environmental group says he first learned of the baitiao river development in april when one of the groups volunteers stumbled across a document describing it on a sichuan government web site it was a request for public comment but the environmental group discovered it just a day before the comment period expired the scholars swung into action they sent letters to the government questioning the economic and engineering logic behind the development borrowing a page from their last successful campaign they argued that development could damage a priceless piece of chinas heritage but this time opponents are handicapped by the fact that the planned developments are well downstream from the dujiangyan waterworks itself and would never be seen by most visitors mr ai argues that at least one free flowing river should be preserved in the dujiangyan area to help maintain the spirit of li bings original design "its like cutting off your foot how can that not hurt the rest of your body " he asks others say the planned dams could hurt water quality by making the river stagnant the river currently helps supply drinking water to roughly million people in and around the city of chengdu dujiangyan officials say they are listening but want to plunge ahead "i think we cant just have opposition every time someone says power plant " says sun longke chief engineer of the dujiangyan administration bureau the baitiao river project has gone through a thorough impact assessment he says and opponents fears are unfounded in august the leaders of the project met with mr ai and other critics at a chengdu restaurant and both sides said the discussion was cordial the project leaders curbed their plans a bit the number of planned hydropower stations has been cut to from and a mile segment of the river will be entirely free of dams mr sun says a spokeswoman for the sichuan provincial government said leaders are still looking closely at the project and have not given it final approval while opponents of the baitiao river project doubt they will succeed in killing it they hope they can establish precedents for how chinas government should relate to its people "the question isnt whether a single project should go forward or not the question is whether there is a transparent process to decide things that affect the public interest " tan zuoren a writer active in the opposition to the baitiao project says at one of chengdus tea houses where intellectuals often gather "we are training the government ordinary people have a right to say no " kersten zhang and shai oster contributed to
