sign up for the e mail here the th congress is close to wrapping up its first year by passing budget war funding energy and terror insurance packages defined by the democratic majoritys requisite compromises with the white house by a to vote the senate approved a &# billion budget for most of the federal government but not the pentagon though it includes &# billion to fight the wars in iraq and afghanistan a result that led minority leader mitch mcconnell to call it "a very successful conclusion of this years congress " as the new york times notes once again the democrats efforts to close the war in iraq ended "with a whimper " and a failure to pass a withdrawal timeline for u s troops the los angeles times adds "as they have all year senate republicans prevented the move to set dates by which the president would have to begin and complete bringing american forces home " even as democrats yielded to the white houses demand for more money the paper says the omnibus spending bill still faces a vote in the house but democratic leaders there have conceded it will almost definitely pass since neither side likes the prospect of opening an election year with a budget clash that shuts down the government and barring any surprises roll call points out congress should be able to adjourn for the year some time today outside the main ring of legislative pugilism there has still been plenty of business to finish the senate approved a six month delay in a pay cut scheduled to hit doctors who treat medicare patients as well as a temporary extension for a high profile childrens health insurance program as the washington post reports but senate leaders werent able to find a way to pay for changes in the alternative minimum tax though the chamber has already passed a measure to prevent the amt from hitting some million additional households next year while house democrats wanted to offset the &# billion cost with a tax "patch " enough republicans and some democrats in the senate opposed it to stave off a tax increase the post reports the house approved one bill already passed in the senate a seven year extension of a government insurance program created after that "commits washington to paying for most of the damage in the event of a terrorist attack " as the n y times explains and congress gave the treasury what the wall street journal describes as "a second legislative tool to help cope with the crisis in subprime mortgages" essentially tax relief for low income families suddenly facing high bills because of debt forgiveness and the house passed the long rancorous energy bill in time to send it to the presidents desk this morning the bill which raises fuel efficiency requirements for cars boosts support for biofuels and envisions an end to the still ubiquitous incandescent light bulb among its many other functions was praised for accomplishments so far flung they rival those of the omnibus spending package as house speaker nancy pelosi put it as cited by the post "it is a national security issue it is an economic issue it is an environmental issue and therefore a health issue it is an energy issue and it is a moral issue " more revelations on tale of the cia tapes a federal judge yesterday rejected justice department objections and said he would hold a hearing friday to "explore whether the u s had violated a court order to preserve evidence when the cia destroyed videotaped interrogations of two terrorism suspects in " as the los angeles times reports u s district judge henry kennedy was responding to a request from yemeni prisoners who have challenged their detention at the military prison at guantanamo bay "much of the evidence against the defendants consists of accusations by other prisoners whom the lawyers think may have been coerced " as the times explains meanwhile the new york times citing current and former bush administration and intelligence officials reports that at least four senior white house lawyers took part in discussions with the cia between and about whether to destroy the tapes "the accounts indicate that the involvement of white house officials in the discussions before the destruction of the tapes in november was more extensive than bush administration officials have acknowledged " the times says among those who took part were former attorney general alberto gonzales who was white house counsel until early david addington then counsel to vice president dick cheney and now his chief of staff and harriet miers who succeeded mr gonzales as white house counsel insurers to offer plan for covering individuals the insurance industry today plans to recommend ways for individuals to obtain coverage even when they already have health problems in an acknowledgment "that too many people simply cannot obtain health insurance on their own " the new york times reports under the proposals to be made by the trade group americas health insurance plans it would be harder for insurers to cancel policies or deny coverage the times says premiums for people with pre existing health problems would also be limited under the plan "the effort is meant to help address the problem of million americans without health coverage " the times adds "and it signals a willingness by insurers to abandon practices that have seemed aimed at excluding all but the healthiest individuals " bailing out a bond insurer merrill lynch bear stearns and other major banks are negotiating a rescue plan for aca capital holdings the struggling bond insurance company that guaranteed &# billion in mortgage securities two people briefed on the situation tell the new york times "the insurers woes could force the banks to take on billions in losses they had insured against the times explains and aca capital "which lost &# billion in the most recent quarter has been warned by standard &amp poors that its financial guarantor subsidiary may soon lose its crucial a rating " if that happened the banks would have to take back billions of losses on securities insured by aca "the troubles at aca could also serve as the first real test for credit default swaps the tradable insurance contracts used by investors to protect or hedge against default on bonds " the times adds cornering christmas trees the danish public prosecutor for serious economic crimes has charged the countrys christmas tree growers the continents biggest exporters of yuletide trees with organizing a cartel at a time when prices this year have risen the financial times reports authorities cite the
