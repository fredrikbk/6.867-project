before senior brass can receive bonuses in an acknowledgment of the most difficult period in bear stearns cos year history chief executive officer james cayne and other senior executives are expected to forgo bonuses for this year people familiar with their plans say the expectation comes as bear prepares to announce tomorrow its first quarterly loss ever an outcome certain to curb pay for the firms employees this is a turnabout for bear which over the years has used its generous merit driven compensation system to recruit job candidates it calls psds those who are poor smart and have a deep desire to be rich bears current executive compensation plan adopted in mandates that the firm hit a minimum return on equity level before senior brass can receive bonuses bear just barely met that roe standard this year one of the people familiar with the matter says and executives could draw on a small bonus pool in a nod to the firms dispiriting end of year results the executives decided not to take the pay this person says a move that should be finalized today during a scheduled late afternoon gathering of bears board of directors meanwhile at goldman sachs group inc another year of record earnings has fattened paychecks for the firms person work force where the average employee took home &# in compensation top executives who were informed of their pay early this month will take home tens of millions of dollars and according to people familiar with the figures chief executive lloyd blankfein is expected to receive close to &# million elsewhere on the street firms are dealing with complex dynamics morgan stanley which today was expected to report a quarterly loss had an otherwise robust performance marred this fall by a trading bet on subprime or risky mortgages that went bad at merrill lynch &amp co where &# billion in write downs from losing mortgage holdings forced the companys ceo to leave his successor john thain must somehow use his shallow compensation pool to prevent valued players from leaving when the firm needs them most to an industry where heavy hitters depend on year end bonuses not base salaries for most of their annual incomes these decisions are hugely significant many midlevel and senior level wall street employees decide whether to keep or exit a job based largely on their past years pay viewing the size of their bonuses as an indication of their value to their firms knowing this brokerage firms try to reward not only their top performers but also the workers they think they will need the most in the coming year now the firms that are struggling must fight a battle on two fronts the lack of financial resources they would normally use to keep valued employees happy and the need to beat back more deep pocketed competitors who will try to pick off their biggest talent at a time when their employers are most vulnerable except for goldman sachs "this is probably the most tortured period of negotiations that most people in top management have gone through in their corporate lifetimes " said michael holland chairman of holland &amp co a new york investment company "one of the problems here is that nobody knows how deep the rot is in the nonperforming portfolios and to what extent that will have an impact on their business in and " mr holland said one way of coping with shrinking revenue is to pay a greater percentages of bonuses in stock to which employees become entitled over a period of years says brad hintz an analyst at sanford c bernstein &amp co in so doing companies can avoid booking the expense of that compensation until those stock grants usually options actually vest or mature this wont be the first time wall street executives have been forced to get creative when herbert allison ran human resources at merrill lynch in the late s the firm introduced packages of compensation tied to return on equity targets that were nicknamed herbies employees were dismayed by the system in when the return on equity was relatively low but the following year it jumped to and bonuses ballooned mr allison later became merrills president before leaving in by forgoing their bonus pay executives at bear are hoping to increase their ability to compensate key players within the firm tomorrow when bear announces fourth quarter results analysts expect the firm to report a write down from losing mortgage holdings of at least &# billion based on the companys own prediction and a loss of at least &# a share according to thomson financial that dispiriting outcome the capstone to a year in which two internal hedge funds collapsed and wiped out &# billion in investor money has no doubt shrunk bears bonus compensation pool drastically forcing tough decisions on how to pay people the downturn at
