for &# million over a missing pair of pants but a number of readers floated a surprising and rather mysterious nominee loyola l an anonymous commenter on this blog and when the nominees were put to an unscientific vote on this blog loyola l won in a landslide so who or what is loyola l he or she isnt a practicing lawyer but is purportedly a second year student or "l " at loyola law school in los

schools a comment from last summer was typical "two years ago i stupidly enrolled in loyola law school thinking it would lead to a decent job " he wrote "now im in massive debt and have been taught a hard lesson students from tier schools arent allowed to have good jobs despite all the money and work we put into the education " some readers have little patience for ll claiming hed have better job prospects if he complained less and worked more but many readers have empathized with ll and have thanked him for exposing what they felt was a hidden truth about the legal job market while so called

&# an hour without benefits ll and his fans blame their law schools for failing to warn them about the harsh realities of the legal job market "lls story is the story of my life and i suspect the lives of thousands of other lawyers " wrote one blog reader in supporting lls nomination another voter thanked loyola l "for blowing the lid off of the law school hustle and exposing this sad over saturated profession for what it really is " a third added "ll represents tens of thousands of lawyers who are struggling to survive " the increasingly tough legal job market and the debate about

journal at the time that the school makes no guarantees to students that they will obtain jobs for the majority of students and alumni he says loyola "turned out to be a good investment " "its expensive to go to law school and there are times when you second guess yourself as a student " he said as for ll while hes presumably a "l" by now he still clings to the moniker and anonymity in responding to a call to identify himself he said "outing myself would only add to the current difficulties in my life " gather around for lawsuit fun looking for a last minute holiday gift for the
