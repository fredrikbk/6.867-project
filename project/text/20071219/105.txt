the most gripping political drama yet in post apartheid south africa ended yesterday when the african national congress in power since picked a controversial zulu politician to lead the party under different management the continents strongest democracy and largest economy can build on its recent successes or like so many of its neighbors fall off track much about jacob zuma gives cause for concern the year old anc stalwart with little formal education and a "pro poor" populist agenda is now in line to succeed his rival thabo mbeki who lost his bid to stay atop the anc and must give up the nations presidency in months this "zunami " as his supporters dubbed their mans improbable comeback from legal troubles acquittal on rape charges last year and a still lingering corruption case alarms the business and ruling establishment south africa has mocked prophets of doom before and could again in spite of many shortcomings rising crime and corruption the aids epidemic persistent poverty and poor schools it boasts what few other african countries can safeguards against shoddy leadership include a new widely respected constitution independent courts and other strong institutions a vocal if small opposition to the powerful anc and the habit of free and fair elections perhaps more important a decade plus of political and economic freedom has given birth to new constituencies with a vested interest in continued stability and fast economic growth south africa is a modern western and an african country in one offering up great contrasts between wealth mostly white and now indian "colored" and black too and poverty largely black even with the economy expanding consistently around annually per capita income rises less than a year leaving many blacks feeling shut out of the recent boom the average black household earns a quarter of an average white one this proportion hasnt budged since a prominent young black executive jimmy manyi compares the countrys economy to irish coffee white on top lots of black below white dominated businesses arent doing enough to "drive transformation " he says by promoting blacks into the middle class mr zumas talk of more aggressive economic redistribution taps into this frustration his precise plans are vague what little can be gleaned makes him a hero to the ancs hard left and unions a so called "coalition of the discontented" who cant abide mr mbeki and the new black millionaires around him mr zuma is robert mugabe lite to his detractors yet mr zuma would be foolish to mess with the formula that put the economy on the mend though unemployment is stubbornly high at overwhelmingly among blacks progress is visible to the eye and in statistics four million south africans entered the middle class in the past decade last year new cars were sold clogging up traffic in the bigger cities townships like soweto bustle with commerce when nelson mandela took power the conventional wisdom was that the anc would bungle the economy that hasnt happened the anc dropped soviet influenced dogma about nationalizing industry and building a command economy during the long watch of finance minister trevor manuel budget books were balanced taxes lowered and borrowing avoided in an interview earlier this year in cape town mr manuel noted that "it helps to have read marx" to debate economic policy in the anc yet from the start the majority led government moved to bring a south africa isolated under apartheid into the global economy with an emphasis on "growth and redistribution " as in other mineral rich countries rising commodity prices helped but growth is driven as well by domestic increasingly black demand and the financial and construction sectors the new phenomenon of the last years is the rise of the "buppies " to see where south africa is headed keep an eye as much on mr zuma as on these black urban professionals the political debate hasnt kept pace with these changes opening up space for mr zuma "the hardest thing has been explaining that the dividends will accrue later " mr manuel said just how hard was clear at this weeks raucous anc meeting president mbeki and his ministers were heckled in a break with the ancs tradition of hiding dissent mr manuel one of the longest serving finance ministers in the world isnt likely to stay on in a zuma led government which would make foreign investors antsy in a political system so dominated by a single party voting members of the anc of the population have decided the fate of millions by selecting a new leader unless mr zuma gets tripped up by the corruption case beforehand his presidency will be closely scrutinized for signs of backtracking "everything that has been so painstakingly built would then just crumble " mathatha tsedu the editor of the black newspaper city press told me before the vote but of late mr zuma has acknowledged this concern by reaching out to business in south africa and abroad pledging no radical shifts a pluralistic economy and lively media can hold him to his word like turkey or poland south africa is also a democracy passing through a difficult adolescence with mr zumas emergence it becomes harder to say what itll grow into but enough people have done well out of the new era of freedom including critically within the black majority to make one guardedly optimistic regardless of who is in charge mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe see related letter "letters to the editor both hope and fear in south africas succession" wsj dec
