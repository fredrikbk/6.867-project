public relations most of them in big organizations but technology has not only given rise to mobs of small shops between the coasts it has also turned the humdrum news release into a reviled variant of spam for reporters offered a chance to disseminate "relationship advice" from a porn star rocker power couple or to cover "the top reasons label printers make great gifts " the delete button is
