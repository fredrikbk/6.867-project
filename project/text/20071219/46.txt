making it harder to tell exactly how much people are paying for homes buyers sellers and other market participants typically monitor fluctuating home values through sale records that legally have to be listed with county clerks but incentives offered to buyers ranging from free cars or furniture to cash rebates are making those prices less reliable as a sign of what buyers actually paid netting out the giveaways and that may be misleading lenders and people shopping for homes some real estate lawyers and appraisers warn kb home in january sold a new townhome with green siding in the denver

recent years as sellers found it harder to unload homes says jonathan a goodman a lawyer in boulder colo who gives seminars to real estate professionals on how to avoid fraudulent transactions fannie mae the nations largest investor in home loans sent a memo to lenders this month warning them to watch out for "practices that may distort or artificially inflate" house prices such as payments from sellers or builders that effectively rebate part of the recorded price incentives to buyers are becoming more common in a glutted market for builders an incentive can mask a discount that might lower the value of nearby homes the company is still trying to sell or avoid angering previous buyers who paid more for buyers cash from the seller can finance a down payment one risk of these transactions is that they can mislead other buyers into overpaying for similar houses nearby or give owners of nearby properties an exaggerated notion of their home equity lenders can make loans on the basis of an artificially high value increasing the danger of losses from any default the national builder lennar corp for instance last year offered buyers in certain florida communities vouchers to purchase mustangs from a local dealership lennar said the voucher was deducted from the recorded sales price of the homes a few months ago a small builder in tacoma wash offered a &# harley davidson to buyers of a &# home one buyer skipped the harley and instead took a &# incentive from the builder which reduced the sales price of the home but in other cases " the incentive is not always public knowledge " said an agent involved in the sale jeff jensen of windermere professional partners tacoma its impossible to determine how frequently such deals distort recorded prices because public records dont usually contain information about incentives but the practice appears widespread mr goodman examined all metropolitan denver home sales in a real estate agents database for the months ended march and found that of the homes sold for at least above the listing price sometimes there are legitimate reasons for paying more than the asking price such as when sellers agree to make major home improvements but mr goodman figures that at least two thirds of those sales involved manipulations that disguised the true value giving cash back to the buyer isnt fraudulent if the payments are clearly disclosed to lenders and to investors who buy loans from lenders but mortgage fraud experts say the rebates often are designed to fool lenders into making bigger loans than they otherwise would in estimating the value of a home appraisers rely on prices recorded at county courthouses for similar nearby houses sold recently before using the price from a recent transaction as an indicator of another homes value appraisers or buyers should check with real estate agents or others involved in that transaction to find out whether incentives skewed the price says jeffrey otteau president of otteau valuation group an east brunswick n j appraisal firm but that information can be hard to obtain he and other appraisers say and agents and builders arent required to divulge information about past sales to appraisers distorted prices also can fool computer programs known as automated valuation models or avms that estimate home values based on sales of nearby properties and other factors lenders often use avms to check appraisers work or in some cases as a cheaper substitute for a human appraisal zillow com and other web sites consulted by people shopping for homes also rely on avms zillow com estimates the value of the townhome in parker at about &# or about above the net price paid by the buyer a spokeswoman for zillow said the company "looks at many homes in

"purchase a property in the next days with little or no money out of pocket " a spokeswoman for los angeles based kb confirmed that the company provided an "incentive" to the buyer of the home but
