deals in its wake a legal drama unfolding in a pair of courts in tennessee and new york could offer clues about the obligations of banks to make good on promises to their clients the dispute which centers on whether ubs ag should be forced to finance a &# billion retail acquisition has prompted allegations of fraud a showdown between a goldman sachs group inc banker and a ubs banker and accusations that the swiss bank is leaving a client in the lurch to deal with its own business problems "there are two explanations for whats happened " says steven m davidoff assistant professor of law at wayne state university law school who specializes in mergers and acquisitions "one is that ubs was defrauded and wronged the other explanation which is increasingly supported by whats going on in the market is buyers remorse " the case in question involves indianapolis athletic shoe specialist finish line inc and its planned &# billion acquisition of nashville tenn based shoe and hat retailer genesco inc in june finish line beat out rival foot locker inc in an auction for genesco whose stable of stores includes johnston &amp murphy lids and journeys the deal featured the kind of elements that would be impossible in todays credit markets finish line planned to put little of its own cash in the deal just &# million while ubs committed to finance the remaining &# billion purchase price the big commitment came at the wrong time within weeks credit markets began to buckle and genescos performance worsened genesco shareholders approved the deal in mid september but ubs refused to close the transaction citing the retailers poor financial performance eventually the commitment was "abandoned " as described in one internal ubs email produced at trial inside ubs the deal became a great source of worry according to trial exhibits the bank would have a hard time selling the debt it was underwriting wiping out an expected &# million fee the transaction "has gone from the biggest fee generator to the biggest loss making deal " wrote one ubs banker on the transaction "our deal is apparently the biggest financial risk the firm currently has " wrote ubs banker mark tashkovich to a group of colleagues genesco on sept filed a lawsuit in tennessee chancery court seeking to force ubs and finish line to consummate the deal then in november ubs took the unusual step of suing both its client finish line and genesco in u s district court for the southern district of new york for ubs genescos "disastrous" condition coupled with finish lines own earnings difficulties would render the combination insolvent the bank alleged in a lawsuit that asked the court to void its financing commitment ubss move came as the bank was reeling from its exposure to mortgage related securities earlier this month the bank took a &# billion write down in connection with the assets those losses were centered in the banks fixed income unit not its investment bank where the genesco financing deal was done for genesco and its lawyers at boies schiller &amp flexner this was the reason that ubs pulled back alleging in a court filing that "defendants themselves have missed projections " ubs declined to comment ubss decision to turn to the courts raised eyebrows in part because just weeks earlier its counsel told the tennessee court in an oct hearing that it was ready to fund the deal if need be "the last thing i want to say on behalf of ubs is were here with our client " the banks lawyer joseph frank of latham &amp watkins said "we are in the business of lending money we agreed to lend &# billion for this property for this transaction we have no problem giving &# billion for what the parties bargained for if thats the case were here to fund " in the tennessee case which concluded yesterday after a week of testimony finish line and ubs argued that they were justified in abandoning the deal because genesco had experienced a "material adverse change" in its business they pointed to the companys unexpected second quarter loss disclosed aug but the most damning claim from ubs and finish line was that they were defrauded they claimed that genesco withheld crucial financial data from may that showed a steep decline in the companys business the fraud allegations caught the attention of the u s attorneys office in new york which last month issued subpoenas the investigation is continuing finish lines fraud case came out in part via testimony from ubs managing director evan winkler who said that a genesco banker from goldman sachs david friedland withheld information on repeated telephone calls in one internal goldman sachs email mr friedland told his team that it shouldnt "bend over backwards" to provide them with "every little thing let them chase us for stuff and be a little busy with other calls buyers et cetera " genesco denied any such accusations saying that finish line and ubs were given open access to its books may was typically the retailers worst month its executives said and often not in line with the companys overall performance in a given year in addition genesco argued that its performance was poor but didnt amount to substantial deterioration from the first quarter or justify the defendants claim of a material adverse change its lawyers argued "a short term hiccup should not suffice " genescos counsel overton thompson iii told the court in an opening statement last week "genesco is in the midst of a blip that is caused by general economic conditions " indeed finish lines own financial performance has declined in recent quarters without backing from ubs finish line wouldnt be able to fund the buyout if the court forces finish line to proceed even without ubs finish line executives say the company could face solvency problems
