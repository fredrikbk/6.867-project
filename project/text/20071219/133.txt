agents etc serving as volunteer lay leaders i was thoroughly entertained by your article "house of cards how the subprime mess hit poor immigrant groups" page one dec which seemed confused in a tug of war between sympathy for the "poor" immigrants and barely concealed contempt my mind is clear these problems all stem from our governments ridiculous notion that caveat venditor let the seller beware has replaced caveat emptor let the buyer beware this creates a universally false sense of security in all business dealings since everyone assumes that big government keeps all hustlers honest except of course for those hustlers typified by "poor" immigrants naira costa was cunning and stealthy enough to sneak into san francisco illegally from brazil marry a man who made &# a month which added to

should read "cheaters how immigrants and the pentecostal church in one community helped fuel the subprime loan mess " i am confused as to why any of the players here should be viewed as victims the borrowers knew better and may have intended to profit through fraud when something is too good to be true it translates across language barriers jo matchett little rock ark soario santos and his family are friends of mine and i also know naira costa and samir abdelnur i am therefore deeply saddened by your emotionalist appeal that plays on well known and deeply seated stereotypes the poor innocent immigrant being ravaged and taken advantage of by the smooth talking "everyone knows he is a farce" man in power at the time that ms costa and mr abdelnur bought their home they had not been members of nor had they attended message of peace for over three years mr santos had no ecclesiastical or any other type of undue influence on the couple as a deacon of a church they didnt attend the article claims that "church officers" approached churchgoers about buying homes like any other church message of peace has people of all professions mechanics painters real estate agents etc serving as volunteer lay leaders outside of mr santos none of them are included in the lawsuit nor is there any complaint against any of them more to the point no church officer nor staff member has ever solicited churchgoers for any business nor worked in real estate while serving as officer or staff because of his long history of service and honesty we know mr santos as a hard working man a good

requirements they are the only group within the refinancing and home purchasing business that doesnt have any of these requirements brokers work on commission and have no fiduciary responsibility to anyone many buyers like the ones you cited are new to the home buying process they are sold one deal by the broker only to find the terms have changed when they go to closing or worse yet after they
