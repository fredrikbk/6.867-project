succeeded with only one tax shelters that helped clients shield hundreds of millions of dollars from taxes less than two years after mycfo began selling them in the internal revenue service said they were bogus mycfo ceased independent operations five years ago but it still casts a shadow a bank that underwrote some of its tax deals has admitted that they were shams former clients hit with back tax bills are fighting the irs two ex clients have alleged that mycfos tax deals were fraudulent two lawyers who worked with mycfo are under tax fraud indictment for their work on similar tax shelters the manhattan u s attorneys office which has charged more than a dozen people in connection with tax shelters said in a court filing last april that it had "an ongoing criminal investigation" involving "various former employees of mycfo " the financial backers and board members of mycfo were silicon valley royalty they included james h clark co founder of netscape communications and silicon graphics john chambers of cisco systems inc thomas jermoluk former chairman of excite home and former netscape boss james barksdale the firms outside legal counsel was larry sonsini lawyer to silicon valleys stars the firm was mr clarks idea mr doerr led its financing and took a leading role on the board in typical silicon valley fashion board members were closely involved with strategy and operations according to company documents and legal papers reviewed by the wall street journal the documents show that directors pushed ahead with the tax shelter business despite signs that all wasnt right with the product mr doerr praised the head of the firms tax strategies group in a email for "not only delivering on your original business plan but going beyond to make up the revenue shortfall from the recurring business " mycfo "has my full support and the full support of my partners" at kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers the venture capital firm that financed mycfo he added mycfos story shows how the sudden wealth spawned by the technology boom had hidden impacts that still echo in silicon valley "there were year old clients making hundreds of millions of dollars it was intoxicating " says james phillips mycfos former chief investment officer "the accountants and cpas wanted their share too " at the time tax shelters were a lively business dozens of national law and accounting firms sold these strategies byzantine transactions that often involved foreign currencies and offshore middlemen mycfo selected a few tax shelters and refined them for a clientele dripping in capital gains some of californias leading industrialists were customers ray irani chief executive of occidental petroleum corp did a tax deal through mycfo company records show so did ariba inc co founder boris putanec and val vaden co founder of financier benchmark capital mr jermoluk the former excite home chairman was both a founding financier of mycfo and a shelter customer for fees of about &# million he acquired ostensible losses to offset as much as &# million of taxable income according to company documents and a deposition by his former accountant kevin mcauliffe mr jermoluk declined to be interviewed about mycfo as did messrs doerr and chambers messrs clark and barksdale didnt respond to email and phone requests for interviews a lawyer for the former directors told a tax client last october that they "categorically denied misconduct or malfeasance of any sort " the lawyer david york predicted mycfos main tax package ultimately "will survive a substantive tax law analysis" in court a spokeswoman for mr sonsini said his law firm did basic legal work for mycfo that didnt include reviewing its tax offerings messrs vaden and putanec declined to comment while occidental said dr irani wouldnt comment "on what is clearly a personal matter " mycfos main tax shelter sold to clients was called cards for custom adjustable rate debt structure each involved an ostensible year bank loan to a foreign party for &# million to &# million mycfos client then assumed the loan and after some complex swapping of collateral claimed a loss for tax purposes of nearly the full amount of the loan others besides mycfo also marketed cards the irs in march ruled cards invalid largely as a result mycfo sold its name and client list and liquidated its tax business the irs said cards failed a basic test of legitimacy it lacked any real economic purpose other than to lower taxes the agency added that clients were never really at risk for the supposed &# million or more in loans most mycfo shelter clients are challenging the irss action in federal court in san jose but two broke ranks and alleged the shelters were fraudulent in civil racketeering suits they filed against big banks that underwrote their cards deals they claim they were misled to believe the shelters loan structure was actually a viable credit facility from the start there were internal warnings mr mcauliffe a former ernst &amp young tax partner who was one of mycfos first hires said that when the firm was just gearing up in some of its accountants wanted to shun tax "elimination" deals he warned mr jermoluk and chief executive art shaw that mycfo was relying too heavily on tax shelters for revenue mr mcauliffe said in a deposition for a tax clients lawsuit in san francisco superior court but he said the founders were talking about an initial public offering and his warnings went unheeded amid ipo "fever " mr shaw ceo of advertising firm netblue inc didnt return calls seeking comment mycfo had obtained the cards strategy from a san francisco investment boutique called chenery associates which also provided it to others chenery had done a cards deal for an aircraft leasing company which registered it with the irs as a tax shelter the irs requires corporations to register such tax driven deals its rules for when individuals must register a deal theyre using as a shelter are less strict mycfo officials said their clients would never accept a transaction they had to register as a tax shelter chenery associates owner roy hahn later testified in a deposition for san francisco superior court a lawyer for chenery removed the obstacle he wrote an analysis saying that cards wasnt a tax shelter under relevant irs rules the lawyer graham taylor then at leboeuf lamb greene &amp macrae wore multiple hats he also represented mycfo in refining the tax strategy court documents show and when mycfo signed up cards clients it arranged for them to hire mr taylor as their lawyer for fees of roughly &# per client he supplied many of them with letters saying that if the irs found their deductions invalid they shouldnt owe penalties because they had relied on "an opinion from reputable counsel " that counsel it turned out was a co inventor of cards raymond j ruble then at law firm brown &amp wood the law firm got &# each time a client used cards chenery paid this out of its share of the tax clients fee chenery also agreed to pay of its own fee into a ruble family trust according to court records and mr hahns testimony mycfo directors had several briefings about tax shelters minutes of board meetings show one in mid led to a marketing delay while the firms general counsel reviewed the matter three months later the irs in connection with a similar shelter warned that "an artificial loss lacking economic substance is not allowable " within weeks mycfo decided to go ahead with marketing cards it quickly signed up clients for fees totaling &# million as those deals were closing in late mr ruble from brown &amp wood emailed mycfo an article in which a prominent tax analyst called cards a blatant tax dodge mr ruble said the analyst had "totally missed the boat on business purpose " which he said lay in financing opportunities as the tech bubble deflated mycfo imposed layoffs and spending cuts but not on the tax strategies group mycfos growing reliance on tax shelters for revenue was discussed at a board meeting in august at that meeting the boards compensation committee messrs doerr and clark approved stock options for employees giving a third of them to the firms top two tax strategists one director asked if mycfo would have an obligation to refund clients fees if the tax deals were unwound "it was basically gosh is this kosher " says someone who was there "then they read the attorneys comfort letters and everyone shut up " mr doerr was a booster for the firms tax strategists in response to mr doerrs email lauding the tax team for its performance which he sent on sept minutes before the first plane struck the world trade center the tax teams leader reported landing &# million more in fees five days after mr doerr replied "this is awesome news particularly during a week marred by national tragedy please keep me posted " but some of mycfos accountants and client service people were in revolt according to mr mcauliffes deposition in late he and several colleagues refused to sign shelter clients tax returns until mycfo agreed to indemnify them for any personal liability one client was claiming a tax loss greater than his net worth "it was only a matter of time until the irs came down pretty hard " mr mcauliffe testified in january the irs offered a broad tax shelter amnesty it would waive penalties for any taxpayer who owned up to using a questionable shelter mycfo staffers disagreed over what to tell clients about this and whether to discourage them from taking the amnesty ultimately the firm sent out what general counsel steve debenham in an email about a draft to a colleague called "a cya letter " for "cover your a " it said the irs appeared to be focusing on the packages offered by major accounting firms which "may be less credibly supported by a substantive economic justification " mr mcauliffe mocked that distinction in an email to colleagues "same law firms similar or same promoters same tax effect " he said wondering if mycfo was "smoking our own dope again " he also dismissed the idea that mycfos clients were penalty proof for relying on reputable counsel "you bought your opinion you bought your comfort level letter " he said later in his deposition mr debenham and mr mcauliffe both declined to be interviewed two months later the irs ruled that cards was an improper shelter mycfos board discussed the ruling by phone mycfo by this time was little more than a tax shelter brokerage according to documents prepared for the meeting if it closed its shelter business it would forgo &# million in revenue in the next three months and be in the red instead of closing the tax business mycfo tried to revive it by hiring a veteran of kpmg an accounting firm that was especially active in selling tax shelters the employee randall bickham brought a pipeline of tax deals worth a projected &# million in fees the board also explored selling the company mycfo documents show deutsche bank ag which had worked with mycfo on several cards deals expressed interest in acquiring the firm for &# million to &# million but backed away citing potential tax shelter liability bank of montreal agreed to buy mycfo for &# million but it too backed out over the same concern mycfo documents show in october bank of montreal finally purchased just mycfos name client list and some other assets it paid &# million about a third of the sums the kleiner perkins founders and others had put in bank of montreal now has a private banking unit called harris mycfo inc which declined to comment directors assigned the rest of mycfo to a liquidator they gave mr bickham the former kpmg man a &# million contract paid in advance to maintain files and assist clients in "controversy issues" with the irs in mr bickham was among those charged by the manhattan u s attorney with tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the irs the charges relate to work he did while at kpmg he has pleaded not guilty and declined to comment also charged was mr ruble the cards co inventor he was cited for tax shelter work he did for others mostly kpmg mr rubles law firm had fired him after discovering the deal he had with chenery to funnel of chenerys fees into a ruble family trust by that time mr ruble was at sidley austin which had absorbed brown &amp wood sidley austin and kpmg both faced civil litigation over tax shelters which they settled last year for &# million including legal fees mr taylor the lawyer who helped mycfo refine the shelters and assisted its shelter clients was indicted in a tax shelter matter in utah both he and mr ruble have pleaded not guilty and both declined to comment federal prosecutors also investigated a german bank that helped arrange some of mycfos tax shelters in a deferred prosecution deal reached last year the bank bayerische hypo und vereinsbank ag or hvb agreed to a &# million penalty and admitted that the cards deal contained "fraudulent and illegal elements " the banks confession didnt mention mycfo but it said "all parties involved" knew the cards credit facility wasnt a legitimate long term loan and would be unwound in about a year to generate "the phony tax benefits sought " said hvb in a statement of admitted facts "the transactions were prearranged by the promoters and had no purpose other than generating tax benefits for the clients involved "
