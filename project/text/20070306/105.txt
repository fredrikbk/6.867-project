the evening wrap libby is found guilty online edition after days of deliberations that included sometimes mystifying signals from inside the jury room former vice presidential chief of staff i lewis "scooter" libby was convicted today on charges of obstruction lying and perjury bringing to a close a weeks long trial that had kept washington transfixed by a parade of celebrity witnesses including senior reporters and current and former members of the bush administration a jury found mr libby guilty on four of the five counts that he faced including one count of obstruction of justice one count of making false statements and two counts of perjury he was found not guilty of one count of lying to investigators who were looking into whether a crime had been committed in the leaking of former central intelligence agency worker valerie plames identity to the press though special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald never charged anyone with leaking the occupation of ms plame the wife of prominent bush administration critic and former ambassador joseph wilson and though he learned early on that it was former deputy secretary of state richard armitage who outed the operative he elected to bring a perjury case against mr libby after the verdict was read mr fitzgerald said that its "sad that we had a situation where a high level official person who worked in the office of the vice president obstructed justice and lied under oath we wish that it had not happened but it did " though mr libby could face up to years in prison when he is sentenced in early june federal sentencing guidelines are likely to shorten any potential jail term considerably and the defense said it would file a motion asking for a new trial should that fail mr libbys lawyers said they plan an appeal "we have every confidence that ultimately mr libby will be exonerated " defense lawyer theodore v wells jr said critics of the prosecution complained that amid his frustration over being unable to unearth any criminal wrongdoing in the leaking of ms plames name mr fitzgerald brought an overzealous perjury case when there was no underlying crime today mr fitzgerald said from the courthouse steps that "any lie under oath is serious" and if "people dont come forward and tell truth we have no hope of making the judicial system work " the legal process following the verdict will take time to play out and mr libby will remain free as his case winds through the courts some who found fault with the case had preemptively called on president bush to issue a pardon of mr libby should he be found guilty and democrats were campaigning against such a move virtually from the instant that the verdict was read senate majority leader harry reid said in a statement that the president must "pledge not to pardon libby for his criminal conduct " asked by reporters about a pardon white house spokeswoman dana perino said at a briefing today she was "aware of no such request " but didnt appear to rule out the possibility theres no question pardoning mr libby would be politically sensitive given his cases locus in questions about intelligence leading up to the iraq war that aside mr bush hasnt exactly scooped out the pardons during the course of his presidency since taking office the president has pardoned people fewest of any president who has served at least seven years in office since a strong
