business technology virtualization is pumping up servers software that enables use of fewer machines may cut hardware sales software maker mobius management systems inc knows about server sprawl by the middle of last year the company had amassed about of the midsize machines for testing and development at its headquarters in rye n y "we were taking over what formerly were peoples offices and making them data centers " says joshua clark a mobius systems administrator so the company took a new tack instead of buying more servers mobius used technology from a start up called virtual iron software inc of lowell mass that lets each server run multiple programs at once and exploit more of its computing capacity in roughly eight months mobius managed to get rid of servers the bulk of them were so called x servers which take their name from the chip technology used by intel corp and advanced micro devices inc it also canceled plans to purchase an additional three dozen x servers this year says mr clark other computer users are making similar moves cutting the cost of buying and maintaining servers and reducing energy bills needed to keep them running but the trend exploiting software that uses a technique called "virtualization" could be starting to take a toll on computer makers there was a surprising slowdown in unit sales of x servers in the fourth quarter according to two prominent research firms gartner inc and idc for example idc found that sales grew just to million units compared with growth in the third quarter that is the worst performance for the market segment since the dot com bust and idc analyst matt eastwood lays the blame largely on virtualization "its a fact " agrees thomas bittman a gartner analyst though companies will still buy servers virtualization "is absolutely going to have a slowing effect" on server sales others are more skeptical about the reason jeffrey hewitt another gartner analyst suspects that customers in the fourth quarter were taking time to ponder a confusing transition to four processor chips that are just hitting the market tom kilroy a vice president who helps runs intels digital enterprise group insists sales of server chips were very good in the quarter "we beat our plan " he says and paul miller a vice president of marketing for server maker hewlett packard co says his company adds virtualization friendly features such as greater memory and specialized management software that boost prices for its machines "the revenue growth is outpacing the unit loss if you will " mr miller says international business machines corp echoes that sentiment h p led the market for x servers in the fourth calendar quarter with a share of revenue according to market research firm idc ibm and dell inc tied for second place each with sun microsystems inc is another big player in servers still no one is disputing that virtualization is hot vmware the emc corp unit that helped invent the category reported an jump in revenue and recently announced plans to offer of its shares to the public microsoft corp now sells virtualization software and a rival called xen is being offered on the same open source basis as the popular linux operating system virtualization is an idea that originated on mainframe systems in the s but it has been rejuvenated by the rapid spread of x servers which usually run one primary application program and an operating system as a result many machines operate at just to of their capacity vmware of palo alto calif responded by developing a layer of software that sits between the hardware and the operating system it allows servers to run "virtual machines" a combination of application software an operating system and other resources that act like a real server multiple virtual machines can run on each server simultaneously using different versions of microsofts windows or variants of linux if one virtual machine crashes others on a system keep going companies also use virtualization to move applications among sets of servers reacting quickly to changing computing needs a forrester research survey last year found that of north american enterprises with or more employees were using or trying out virtualization up from in usage tends to be heaviest in large companies idc estimates that of u s companies with or more workers are using the technology compared with for those with fewer than workers servers running virtual machines still accounted for only about of all servers shipped last year idc says but customers already report substantial cost savings and changes to their computer purchases david siles chief technology officer for kane county in illinois in the fall of was managing roughly servers scattered across departments too many for his three person staff to handle things got so bad he says that people were running servers in broom closets and under desks when it came time to retire those machines mr siles used vmwares technology to consolidate the countys computing operations on just new physical servers he estimates the move will save &# to &# a year in electricity bills the new machines are running at roughly of their capacity versus no more than before the shift "we hardly ever buy a new server " mr siles says "the last server i bought was almost a fiscal year ago " gentry ganote chief information officer for golf &amp tennis pro shop inc which owns pga tour superstores reduced his need for new machines by using virtual irons software and compact hewlett packard computers called blade servers another plus his small staff needs only about a half hour to set up a new virtual machine versus a week or more to install a standard server "virtualization is less about cost savings than you might think though that is an important factor " says frank gillett an analyst at forrester research "its more about flexibility " the news isnt all negative for hardware makers some customers who need the very highest computing performance such as for web search or financial transactions may be slow to use virtual machines analysts say while some are buying servers with added memory and networking features intel amd and their customers are developing technology to accelerate virtualization that could command higher prices no one sees any slowdown for virtualization software least of all those who have experienced the benefits craig liess a server administrator for trucking company central transport international inc in warren mich used vmware to replace its underutilized servers with virtual machines on six computers he calls virtualization one of the biggest developments in the server field of this decade "anything that can be in a virtual machine will be " mr liess says "if any large organization is not looking at this they are really missing the boat "
