asbestos related litigation the bull case private interest though some analysts are skeptical of an lbo and dow hasnt commented others see the mere talk of such as a positive sign "whether fact or

dows international revenue growth is strong helping offset a slump in u s sales triggered by downturns in the home building and auto industries both of which rely on chemicals dow derives of its sales from outside the u s and demand is higher in areas such as asia and latin america for its more profitable specialty chemicals and products such as styrofoam and polyurethane overseas markets are "more than compensating for weaker housing and automotive sectors in the u s " wrote william young at credit suisse dow chemical also serves a broad base of industries from food and packaging to personal and household care which stabilizes demand for its products noted standard &amp poors analyst richard oreilly dogging dow dows shares trade at an attractive valuation analysts say some say the stock

balance the outlook is poor for dows primary chemicals and plastics segments which contribute about of its revenue these basic chemical products such as plastic ingredient ethylene have lower profit margins and are more vulnerable to economic cycles than specialty chemicals such as latex kevin mccarthy at banc of america securities says the environment for these basic chemicals has peaked

hoard saying the company needs to do more in the way of share buybacks higher dividends or acquisitions mr koort says dow which ended with nearly &# billion in cash needs to make a "game changing" acquisition to help stabilize its business one potential target is general electrics plastics business but citigroups p j juvekar says he doesnt expect dow to make a run for it given the expected cost of &# billion buybacks and dividends are another issue "considering that dow has not implemented a large share buyback while also refraining from substantial dividend boosts raises questions about optimal use of cash " wrote hsbc analyst hassan ahmed he says the companys "extreme reluctance" to repurchase shares has hurt its stock price in the past few years dow did announce a &# billion buyback plan in october but mr ahmed says the purpose was to "offset dilution rather than return cash to shareholders in a significant way " lingering litigation though its acquisition of union carbide made dow the largest u s chemical firm baggage came attached primarily in the form of asbestos which union carbide supplied to manufacturers as of the end of dow had &# billion set aside for pending and future claims related to asbestos in the next years "the uncertainty related to asbestos litigation the bankruptcy filings of many other companies involved in asbestos litigation and the possibility of large jury awards could continue to weigh on dows stock " wrote mr juvekar asbestos cases are currently continuing in california among other states according to the law firm representing union carbide there are also lingering concerns about the disaster at union carbides plant in bhopal india where more than people died and hundreds of thousands were injured following a
