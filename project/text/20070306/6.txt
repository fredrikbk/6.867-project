a new battleground for computer security web services such as google yahoo become hackers target case of the stolen passwords the changing interests of the internets troublemakers are creating fresh dangers for consumers making web sites they know and trust potential sources of pc misery for years computer viruses that crippled personal computers were typically spread through old school email programs usually using attachments now web based applications increasingly are in the crosshairs of hackers and web technology often poorly guarded is providing ample opportunity for mischief putting major players like google inc and yahoo inc in the security spotlight google has evaded the nasty public tussles with virus writers and hackers that have plagued large software makers such as microsoft corp whose size and dominant technologies have made them attackers targets of choice but google is finding itself on the defensive as its web based products become more popular and its vision of software as an online service blossoms experts say security problems are inevitable in software which has grown more complex and isnt always built with adequate attention to potential problems but web applications both relatively new and extremely popular appear to be headed for a period of worsening malicious attacks and programming fumbles until software makers fully grasp the security issues and respond to them in a sign of the possible trouble to come the web sites of last months super bowl hosts the miami dolphins and dolphin stadium were hacked in late january and used for at least a week to infect visiting pcs with a password stealing program of the new software vulnerabilities documented by symantec corp in the first six months of were in web applications finding errors in web software and exploiting them to create successful attacks is easy experts say because the applications are complex and many web software developers bent on getting products finished and released quickly can have poor security practices moreover the open nature of internet connections means attacks easily bypass standard defenses like firewalls and antivirus software rising attacks could increase the need for consumers to add to their panoply of security programs a technology known as "intrusion detection " which to date is more often used by companies but is available for instance in symantecs new consumer product for computer security called as an emblem of the webs future google is apt to get plenty of attention information about security flaws that hackers can leverage to infiltrate the pcs of users of its products has been surfacing more frequently as the companys expansion beyond web search makes it more attractive to both professional security researchers and malicious attackers security software maker watchfire corp recently announced it found a serious security hole in google desktop the companys web connected downloadable software for finding files inside personal computers google says it is rolling out a fix for the problem which can allow hackers to take full control of targeted pcs and the data stored inside them news of the find quickly sparked more bug hunting within days another and possibly worse vulnerability in desktop was unearthed and posted online by robert hansen chief executive of sectheory llc as were a handful of flaws in google com itself shortly after that two bugs were revealed in yahoo programs one that could expose a users email addresses and real name and another in yahoos video service that could have allowed an attacker to impersonate yahoo and steal private information yahoo says it expects to fix the problems quickly and that it doesnt believe they have been exploited by hackers google in particular "is a very valuable target for the malicious individual " says danny allan director of security research at watchfire "web applications are much less mature than typical software applications " he says "because of that there tends to be more vulnerabilities and more problems " douglas merrill googles chief information officer concedes that flaws have and will be found in google software but says the company takes extensive measures to prevent them and quickly fixes problems he says the company has absorbed hard lessons learned by other software makers and has made security an integral part of its software development process and therefore minimizes security holes web software is "a new kind of science " he says mr merrill also points out that google has an advantage when it comes to fixing vulnerabilities because aside from a few exceptions like desktop google applications reside on its own servers rather than customer pcs "i know how to update our data centers quickly " he says some security professionals say that many researchers are hesitant to look for vulnerabilities in google software a fact that could hurt google customers security industry research has been an important check on software makers like microsoft and has led to improvements in industry security practices but most google bug hunting calls for running commands on google servers which some think lies in a legal gray area and should only be done with permission from google "the malicious researcher is under no such obligation " says mr allan of watchfire googles mr merrill says the company has publicly thanked researchers on its site for information about flaws in its products suggesting it is unlikely that google would prosecute researchers for intruding on its servers "theres built in market forces for google to do the right thing " says ed skoudis who teaches hacking to security professionals for the sans institute and co founded penetration testing firm intelguardians llc of washington d c "the last thing they want is a google samy worm " he says referring to a virus that spread inside myspace news corp s social networking site in oct many security experts say theyre concerned about googles security practices they say they have little insight into how it writes or tests code for security problems and are troubled by its tight lipped approach to disclosing flaws and fixes they note that if it sustained a serious attack google might be the only one to know mr merrill pointing to googles secure coding practices and extensive testing says "the state of the technology the state of the science is improving and we are at the forefront of that improvement " he also notes that google like other companies is subject to state laws requiring disclosure of security breaches that expose sensitive consumer data regarding security flaw disclosure mr merrill says google hasnt provided much because consumers its primary users to date often arent tech savvy enough to understand security bulletins and find them "distracting and confusing " also because fixes google makes on its servers are invisible to the user notification hasnt seemed necessary he says "its kind of hard to imagine us being more of a target " mr merrill says "our user trust is the most important thing we think we have and well go to great lengths to protect it " some ways for consumers to guard against viruses aimed at web based applications be careful not to click on suspicious links in spam emails or those on blogs or other community oriented internet pages many web attacks leverage security holes in internet browser software so be sure to keep your browser programs up to date with the latest patches consider using an intrusion detection program
