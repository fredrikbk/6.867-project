the daily fix cinderella is staying at home after vcu tops george mason online edition last years cinderella isnt going to the ball for a while it looked like george mason would return to the ncaa mens tournament which the team electrified last year with a run to the final four having blitzed no hofstra and no old dominion all that stood between no george mason and the colonial athletic association championship with its ticket to the big dance was virginia commonwealth and the patriots led with about two minutes left but vcu is ranked no in the caa and the rams showed why putting up unanswered points nine from sophomore eric maynor and ending the patriots dreams "if the ncaa mens basketball committee took gallantry into account george mason would be a lock for a bid this coming monday " john feinstein writes in the washington post "sadly for the patriots gallantry counts far less than the ratings percentage index for minutes this weekend mason was the mason of march a year ago for two minutes it was the team that struggled for much of this season " of course the joy of sports is there are always new cinderellas on espn com kyle whelliston looks at the symbol vcu invoked in its run to the ncaas "it doesnt appear much like a potent talisman " he writes "its just a chain of gold colored carabiners linked together each with a swath of athletic tape labelled with a pair of initials in smudged black sharpie the chain lay almost exclusively on the virginia commonwealth bench all throughout the weekend at the caa tourney until it found itself around vcu senior guard jesse pellot rosas neck monday night at around p m eastern time " as mr pellot rosa explains the chain was the brainchild of vcu coach anthony grant "coach sat us down before the conference tournament he said everybodys got a job to do everybodys got to be committed to their roles thats what this symbolizes everybodys got their own personal link " your big dance primer joining virginia commonwealth with tickets to march madness are gonzaga which claimed its eighth west coast conference title in nine years by beating santa clara and niagara which topped siena for the metro atlantic athletic conference title thats nine slots of reserved for conference champs filled with the mid continent horizon league and sun belt tournaments to wrap up today the at large slots will be filled come selection sunday ryan howard of the philadelphia phillies lit up the national league last year winning the mvp award for a homer rbi season in the new york times michael sokolove dissects mr howards swing his childhood his relationship with the philadelphia fans and everything else as part of a profile of a steroid free slugger to root for at least the fix devoutly hopes mr howard is clean these days cynicism infects everything and everyone its a great read but the fix particularly enjoyed mr howards remarkable recall of his at bats "i unpacked my laptop and we watched a sort of greatest hits collection a compilation of his home runs that the phillies had copied onto a dvd " mr sokolove writes "he enjoyed it what player wouldnt but what struck me was how much he remembered he came to the plate times last season and saw pitches yet now he recalled pitch sequences from months before he doesnt keep a notebook as some hitters do but it seems he doesnt have to this is a pretty good ab he said as we watched him step in for his at bat against the new york mets guillermo mota he was mixing it up pretty good fastballs change ups inside outside after eight pitches including several foul balls the count was full mota threw a change up and howard barely managed to foul it off that was a tough pitch nasty he said here comes the fastball now the next pitch was indeed a fastball which howard hit over the center field fence for his th home run " in the philadelphia daily news bill conlin considers another tribute to mr howard "this is about a special bat two special fans and a special baseball player " he writes "this is about a burnished excalibur a swinging sword lovingly handcrafted in brass by a year old phillies fan between bouts with carpal tunnel syndrome this is about joseph l pellicone jr a year old follower of the club that has given him a lifetime of highs lows and all the stops in between a paoli local of emotions its about a father and son and their shared passion " in mits doria holbrook won the division national title in three meter diving in she lost it to kendall swett of lake forest college then she heard ms swett was transferring to tufts which practices with mit the arch rivals were going to share a pool and a coach a situation neither was sure would work nationals is this week in houston in all likelihood one woman will come back the winner the other runner up in the boston globe amalie benjamin writes how thats now ok with the rivals having become teammates and friends "they argue their differences swett the art history major proclaiming her love for colors anointing herself a hippie holbrook the mechanical engineering major a self proclaimed redneck engineer who likes guns and things that blow up " writes ms benjamin "swett the age group diver who fought through years of injuries in her teens to emerge in division holbrook who turned down a division pole vaulting scholarship to purdue to attend mit and started seriously diving about six months before winning a national title but that doesnt explain enough as they finish each others sentences sip from the same plastic cup of lemonade ask each other questions and probe for answers " sticking with the globe bella english sat down with the new england patriots bill belichick to survey a difficult season that saw the cerebral coachs reputation tarnished mr belichick isnt one for gabbing with reporters or gabbing with anybody but ms english manages to extract enough from the coach for an interesting portrait of a complex man "it has been said that athletes dont come to new england to be loved they come to win " she writes "belichick seems to embody this truth he is an unsentimental man in an unsentimental sport his critics call him arrogant his friends say hes shy evil genius or misunderstood mensch " speaking of the patriots the miami dolphins sent wide receiver wes welker mr belichicks way yesterday for a pair of draft picks part of a makeover that also included waiving tight end randy mcmichael and qb joey harrington seven offensive players who started at least one game last season are now gone including the teams two top receivers "words that hit a football fans ears like nails on a chalkboard have begun to barnacle onto the hull of the dolphins " writes the miami heralds greg cote a columnist who fears no minefield of metaphors "words such as housecleaning overhaul and the ultimate expletive rebuilding this is not the mind set most fans might wish for in the quick fix nfl after the ignominy of five consecutive seasons out of the playoffs chased by a ticket price hike nor is this the mind set fans were sold in the transition from outbound coach nick saban to new boss cam cameron so what are we to make of miamis new direction does the club have one " ohio state has enjoyed greg odens glorious freshman season because of a rule change raising the nbas minimum age requirement to from mr oden is widely expected to jump to the nba but the detroit free presss drew sharp argues his year was far from wasted "despite demands on odens time and the fishbowl existence he leads on campus there remains simplicity to his life thats no different from any college student " mr sharp writes adding "will one year at ohio state make oden a better player than one year of rugged unlimited practices with nba players perhaps not but it might make him a more mature year old when he takes the next step and you cant place a monetary value on that " tip of the fix cap to reader max eveleth found a good column
