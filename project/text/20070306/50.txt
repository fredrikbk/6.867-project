gop protectionists as the gop stumbles around washington trying to be the party of herbert hoover its sad to see so many republicans drifting so far and so fast from the reagan model that helped pave the way for the great non inflationary economic and jobs expansion of the past years sen lindsey graham r s c threatens china with a tariff for daring to tie the yuan to the dollar rep tom tancredo running for president is miffed at president bush for trying to design comprehensive immigration reform legislation the president wants a guest worker program that could help alleviate border problems in the southwest but mr tancredo is a sissy compared to my old pal duncan hunter the congressman from san diego hes also running in the gop primaries as an unambiguous hoover like protectionist and anti globalization candidate then theres my other old friend pat buchanan railing against japan and toyota for having the chutzpah to sell so many cars in the u s even going so far as to build manufacturing plants right here under our noses mr buchanan resigned from the gop a few years ago because republicans werent tough enough on trade tariffs and immigration for his so called "economic nationalism" model his answer to the competition faced by u s automakers from abroad is to bash japan and to accuse those of us who believe in classical free trade policies of being "fanatics" who cause u s manufacturing to move offshore adam smith and david ricardo are spinning in their graves in the interest of full disclosure im on the advisory board of toyota north america and now drive a hybrid lexus but i also believe that the real answer for u s auto companies is a decrease in tax rates lower costs of labor and greater flexibility in future union contracts the attack on a trading partner like japan is misguided when the real enemy of american jobs and auto production comes from washington and detroit having driven american automobiles for of my years my long term and short term solution to the profound challenges faced by u s manufacturers is to reform the complex confusing and confiscatory u s tax code and to ease the onerous regulatory burden that undermines our ability to compete in the global economy the suggestion that japan manipulates its currency for trade advantages even though the yen has appreciated against the dollar by since is misleading the same attack could have been made against the u s when the fed lowered the federal funds rate to in in order to boost the economy every central bank manipulates its currency to some degree in that they control the printing of the supply of money that determines the value of their currency protectionists claim that the trade deficit threatens the dollar and causes it to fall further de industrializing america and diminishing our freedoms in reality the trade deficit is just the other side of what president reagan correctly called the capital account surplus which reflects foreign investment leading to increased production output and job creation in the u s as a case in point since coming to america years ago toyota has invested more than &# billion in our domestic economy and set up manufacturing plants it has "insourced" more than jobs since and just announced an th plant with more u s jobs toyota pays close to &# billion in wages to american workers overall since the recession according to david malpass of bear stearns the u s economy has created million jobs japan only as for the legacy health costs and pension costs for u s auto workers protectionists would better spend their time lobbying for detroit to move to health savings accounts and defined pension contribution plans defined benefits pension plans are far too costly for auto makers as economist arthur laffer has written and lectured about for years protectionist views on trade resemble al gore on global warming pessimism permeates their arguments and they misuse statistics to drive their propaganda on these very important issues mr buchanan for example argues that the u s is witnessing the passing of our nation as the greatest industrial power the world has ever seen nonsense half the wealth our nation has ever produced was generated in the last years or so with the recent passing of milton friedman and ronald reagan weve lost two great champions of the free enterprise and free trade policies that helped lay the groundwork for the last two decades of low unemployment and low inflation fostering the growing class of working families who own stocks bonds and property the answers to our challenges in todays global marketplace can be found in sound money lower tax rates on capital and labor an easing of regulatory burdens and the welcoming of foreign investment and trade with nations like japan isolationism and protectionism are not worthy of st century america mr kemp is founder and chairman of kemp partners and former secretary of housing and urban development
