insurance rates and maximum ages are regulated by the states and can vary in new york for instance term life insurance policies cant be sold to consumers past the age of although a spokesman for the department of insurance says regulators are considering revising that rule and the premiums for disease survivors are contingent on a number of conditions such as the stage of the cancer and the results of subsequent tests but overall this represents a significant expansion of life insurance coverage say insurers and financial planners life insurers cite updated information from the national life expectancy tables on which all life insurers base their rates these tables created by actuarial groups in conjunction with insurers and regulators show that policyholders are living longer overall insurers also recently have amassed much larger amounts of data on the life expectancy of the oldest elderly and of disease survivors that helps them to judge the risk of insuring those groups more accurately actuaries and others say these findings along with insurers own research and improvements in early disease detection and treatment helped spur companies to expand coverage craig

applicants and policyholders garrett hall is at an age when many people dont expect to need life insurance anymore except that hes a newlywed whose bride is and a year ago they purchased a new home together in suburban atlanta so last month he also bought a &# year term life insurance policy from genworth financial inc using insure com an online broker he pays &# a month "we have a large

policies to year olds in some states in only about six insurers did according to accuquote the online insurance broker the lowest priced &# million year term policy for a year old applicant shown in accuquotes database costs &# annually in it cost nearly &# several companies also sell these policies to year olds w weldon wilson chief executive officer of swiss re life &amp health america inc a unit of swiss re which insures primary insurers says policies issued to older applicants have grown to of the overall market from nearly zero in "a lot of the shift is baby boomers hitting older ages and people becoming focused on the transfer of wealth grandparents also are actively involved and wanting to provide for their families " he said for cancer patients a big challenge in getting life insurance had been the long wait they often have had to wait five years or more after treatment before qualifying for life insurance then they usually had to pay higher "impaired risk" rates for another several years some insurers would allow former patients to eventually return to standard rates if they remained cancer free before the new program at the hartford took effect a woman who had been treated for breast cancer would have had to be disease free for several years after that she would have paid &# annually for the first five years for a half million dollar year term policy under the new program she could pay &# "and she has the ability to get coverage right away " says dr davidson many life insurance policies sold to older people are for estate and tax planning purposes and business succession plans say insurers and financial planners wealthy individuals often give away a portion of their estate to charity to reduce estate taxes then buy an equivalent amount of insurance whose death benefit is income tax free so that they can still pass their heirs the full value of their estates says john bragg a consulting actuary in atlanta who also underwrites for insurers of very wealthy clients in recent years some older people have also been buying new life insurance policies for amounts generally over &# million intending to sell the policies to investors in a secondary market the policies are sold at higher prices than their cash surrender value and the investors continue to pay the premiums in order to collect on the death benefit a report by sanford c bernstein &amp co estimated that such transactions in rose to between &# billion and &# billion based on policies face value from an estimated &# billion in the practice worries many insurers and regulators who believe that speculation could destabilize insurers and undermine their ability to pay the death benefits of people who bought insurance primarily to protect loved ones but others including some consumer advocates say selling unwanted policies in a secondary market is legitimate if both the owner and the beneficiaries consent but many ordinary policies are for baby boomers who are making life changes at older ages and find themselves needing extra coverage at a time when previous generations would have been cashing in a policy letting it lapse or having their heirs collect reginald williams a retired u s army sergeant in hampton va says he bought a term policy a few months ago to provide for his wife delores so that she can remain in their home if he dies first although they purchased their home years ago theyve refinanced it several times and will have a mortgage for another decade he had cashed out several paid up whole life policies to help pay for his three daughters college educations and his wife doesnt have survivor rights to his retirement money he says "once i expire then my retirement money expires " he says "i wanted her to be secure " when youre buying some things to keep in mind not all products are available in all states for instance new york wont allow term policies to be sold past the age of especially at older ages medical tests play a big role so you wont know the premium until all reviews are completed if youre denied a policy shop around insurers rules vary financial planners even suggest trying again a year or two later as rules and rates change constantly
