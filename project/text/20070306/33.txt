do you cut and run or stay in your job after an acquisition paul j higgins a star sales vice president for travelers life &amp annuity believed he would keep making good money once metlife bought the citigroup unit soon after the deal was unveiled in early metlife flew mr higgins and colleagues to orlando fla for a weekend of plentiful promises food and booze officials told them that they were underpaid and would benefit from being metlife employees "it sounded good " mr higgins recollects subsequent letters assured the travelers staffers that the insurer would adjust their annual sales targets so uncertainty related to the purchase wouldnt hurt their compensation he says but metlife reneged on its pledges and mr higgins made at least &# less than he should have that year he claims in a lawsuit filed last december "without the broken promises i probably would have been looking to find other employment sooner than i did " he adds in an interview he quit metlife a year ago and now works for a boston insurance brokerage "metlife intends to vigorously defend itself" against the litigation a company spokesman says amid the latest frenzy of acquisitions you may soon have to decide whether to depart after your employers takeover but dont resign without carefully assessing the situation many people ignore warning signs that a merged workplace is no longer the right fit because they overestimate their own value to the company "everyone thinks they are the reason their employer got acquired especially since theres always warm and fuzzy talk in the beginning from the buyer " jokes dave campeas head of recruiters princetonone in princeton n j acquirers tend to favor their fellow staffers over unknown quantities employed by a target "you may only be kept until youre done closing an operation down thats why you should always have a healthy plan b " suggests kate zabriskie founder of business training works in port tobacco md yet jumping ship prematurely can be costly especially if youre eligible for a retention bonus months after the transaction closes staying put at least temporarily gives you a chance to explore your internal prospects while testing waters elsewhere as mr higgins learned the most overlooked clue may be a buyers initial promises unless incoming management offers you an employment contract "assume its bait and switch "" says his attorney pamela a smith an employment specialist in newton mass a small software firm in californias silicon valley plans to combine with two larger players the president to be of the enlarged enterprise has offered the small firms chief marketing officer the same spot there despite such assurances the marketing man will keep his options open "you have to be ready to execute a job search before youre executed " he explains another clear danger sign exclusion youre left out of integration meetings critical email or informal hallway chatter your calls go unanswered for days the new owners blame the acquisition upheaval accept their excuse only "if being ignored affects everyone at your level "" mr campeas advises the recruiter cites two vice presidents at a midsize pharmaceutical maker who expected to flourish when a bigger rival finished its takeover early last year they had overseen development and marketing of the targets sole commercial drug but "they became yesterdays news as soon as the ink dried on the completed deal "" mr campeas says "they immediately became unplugged from what was going on new management no longer asked their opinions on day to day or strategic decisions "" the men lost their positions in november your likely role in a combined company also gives clues to your status if the buyer keeps your operation autonomous "i would expect my job to continue to be pretty much the same "" says richard harrison an associate management professor at university of texas "i would also be sensitive to whether my job was in an area like accounting that may be combined in the interest of efficiency " certain purchasers deliberately assign acquired staffers the most difficult or unpleasant tasks so theyll quit and forfeit severance getting invited to a "change management" session may augur a switch to a position "youre not going to like " ms zabriskie cautions you also should get information about your new boss by contacting suppliers rivals and former lieutenants discovering hes an arrogant jerk will signal its time for serious job hunting how you view the inevitable culture clashes may be a less obvious hint that you should take a hike heed your outrage over the elimination of prized perquisites such as free coffee tuition subsidies or casual attire "if you like to work by yourself and the culture of this acquiring company is team oriented that may not be the way you want to operate " notes mr harrison co author of a book about corporate culture and even if you find the culture compatible he warns you remain at risk because you come "from the wrong side of the merger " e mail me at joann lublin wsj com to see past managing your career columns please go to careerjournal com
