at the heart of stubbss works are his animal subjects souls george stubbs frick museum through march new york walking through "george stubbs a celebration " currently on view at the frick museum until march i found myself thinking that if the folks at peta were savvier theyd eschew the familiar images of suffering laboratory animals and use instead in their publicity campaign stubbss astonishing portrait of "a monkey" the image that greets you as you enter the show organized by the fricks chief curator colin b bailey together with associate curator denise allen the exhibition which opened at the walker art gallery in liverpool and moved to londons tate britain includes paintings artfully chosen and displayed to represent the range of stubbss achievement at the high end of that range are works such as "monkey " in which the sensitive rather delicate primate offers us a peach and gazes at us with a wistful expression that makes it impossible to imagine or maintain that such an animal might not possess a complex consciousness and a soul born to a family of leatherworkers in liverpool stubbs was an early champion and practitioner of anatomical dissection his book "the anatomy of the horse " is still in print although he received lucrative commissions from wealthy aristocratic patrons he was regarded even in his own time as a mere painter of animals and of genre scenes not unlike caravaggios stubbss reputation went into freefall immediately after his death and his standing has recovered only within the past hundred years not until the mid th century did the efforts of british art historians and the american collector paul mellon himself an equine enthusiast inspire a long overdue critical re evaluation of stubbss work in fact to dismiss stubbs as an animal painter is rather like calling monet a painter of flowers so much more is involved in the art and in the vision that produced it for stubbs we feel the specificity and individuality of his subject is always of primary importance regardless of whether the animal is pampered and posed like the thoroughbred "molly longlegs" or in mortal danger like the horses he portrayed being attacked by lions the two most exotic beasts are included here "the duke of richmonds first bull moose" a depiction of a rare specimen imported from north america and "the lincolnshire ox " a mammoth creature allegedly six feet tall and weighing pounds shown with his owner who purportedly won the ox in a cockfight in both works the creatures seem remarkably sentient and aware of the loneliness of their anomalous situations when stubbs turns his attention to the human animal his paintings often take on a nuanced and subtle narrative as understated and evocative as a chekhov short story in the "reapers " we intuit that some sort of drama is occurring among the two men and two women in the paintings foreground a bit of theater for which the busy laborers have no time or particular interest anyone who has ever been a parent or a child will be struck by the way that stubbss "thomas smith huntsman of the brocklesby hounds and his father thomas smith former huntsman with the hound wonder" conveys the complicated bonds and divisions between generations as it contrasts the virile energy and tempered impatience of young thomas smith with the slumped posture and reflective slightly mournful expression of his father like his near contemporary william blake stubbs explored the ways in which technical and scientific innovations could be deployed to serve the purposes of art experimenting first in metal his "horse devoured by a lion" is done in enamel on copper and then together with josiah wedgwood by searching for ways to produce a painting that would be as weighty and permanent as sculpture the brilliantly hued "lion and lioness" is made of baked enamel on earthenware finally though what makes stubbs so extraordinary and the current exhibition so instructive and pleasurable is neither his technical virtuosity nor his anatomical knowledge after seeing the stubbs show its worth spending some time in the fricks marvelous permanent collection and in particular taking a look at rembrandts "the polish rider " for all the passion and genius with which "the polish rider" is painted its titular subjects horse could be furniture a mere conveyance an essentially generic beast that exists solely to speed our hero across the surface of the painting rembrandts stallion could hardly be more unlike stubbss horses and dogs or for that matter his monkey and moose and ox placed confidently and skillfully at the center and heart of the paintings each of stubbss subjects is a fully realized being entirely itself and wholly unlike any other creature on earth ms prose writes about art for the journal
