politics &amp economics beijings budget balancing act poor get more help but spending plan stays conservative beijing chinas premier is trying to get his nations &# trillion economy to change course that requires him to maneuver very deftly wen jiabao delivering his annual report on the work of the government to the legislature yesterday promised a significant boost in state spending on social services as well as a smaller budget deficit that combination demonstrates the balancing act his administration is performing as it tries to spread the benefits of chinas booming economy more widely in the country without disrupting that growth the administration of mr wen who took office in has been trying to put more resources into neglected areas notably agriculture education health care and environmental protection yet it is doing so without going on a spending spree that could add fuel to an economy expanding at an annual rate of more than officials say the main risk now isnt a slowdown or recession but a surge in bank lending and corporate investment that could weigh down the economy with far more factories and property developments than are needed yesterday the government unveiled new commitments to chinas worse off citizens last year it canceled a tax that had been levied on farmers for decades and promised free elementary and secondary school for million children in rural areas this year tuition and other school fees will be eliminated in all rural areas benefiting million households mr wen said a new welfare system providing a basic cost of living allowance to the poorest rural households will also be rolled out nationwide and a new rural health care service will be expanded there were also promises of new roads and cleaner drinking water "we will effectively shift the focus of state infrastructure development and development of social programs to the countryside " mr wen said in his speech delivered to thousands of delegates to the national peoples congress in beijings great hall of the people mr wen said the drive to strengthen the social safety net is central to raising living standards and in turn to helping consumer spending become a more potent force for sustaining economic growth currently even basic services are out of reach for many households so called public schools charge a battery of fees for children to enroll and state hospitals demand up front payment in cash for medical treatment the millions who cant afford to pay lose out while it raises spending on rural areas and social services the government will put less money in total into the economy the budget deficit for at billion yuan &# billion or of chinas gross domestic product was smaller than the original plan for a deficit of billion yuan or of gdp the budget for calls for the deficit to fall to billion yuan or an expected of gdp in part that reflects chinese officials conservative instincts when tax revenue last year came in much higher than expected the government didnt spend all the extra money billion yuan was set aside to start an emergency fund "we can never start spending money hand over foot just because revenue has been relatively good recently " the ministry of finance said yesterday in its report on the budget another constraint economists say is that while the government might have the financial means to lift spending it doesnt have the capacity to effectively monitor and direct a lot of new money mr wens administration must deal with a troubling legacy with the dismantling of the planned economy over the past three decades the institutions that used to provide housing food and medicine to the population have been demolished because of that history chinas spending on social services remains extremely low by global standards spending on health care by central and local governments totaled just billion yuan in or about of gdp according to the world bank developed nations spend an average of of gdp for china to achieve a similar level it would have had to spend trillion yuan last year health care spending is indeed set to increase this year but china cant make up such a big gap all at once the government is following its usual path of trying out new programs in one or two provinces working out the kinks and then rolling them out to a broader swath of the nation one important consequence of the new wave of social programs is a stronger role for the central government in providing or at least funding social services that is a reversal of the previous tendency for local governments to shoulder most of the burden in one example the ministry of finance said that "policy changes will result in the central government replacing local governments as the main source of funding for prevention and treatment of major communicable diseases " and through crackdowns on the confiscation of land and on environmental pollution problems that have spawned serious social unrest the central government is also gradually curbing the power of local authorities
