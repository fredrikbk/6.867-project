fcc eases way for entrants into video field washington efforts by telecommunication companies such as at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc to compete head on with cable operators in the provision of video and broadband service were made easier by the federal communications commission yesterday the agency released new rules that aim to standardize the process for new entrants to the video market to get a license from local governments given that new entrants use internet technology to provide video service the fcc also hopes its new rules will speed up broadband deployment across the country in the majority of states companies wanting to enter the video market must apply for a license from the local government a process that phone firms have said is costly and time consuming the fcc doesnt have the authority to create a national system but chairman kevin martin believes it does have the ability to limit the behavior of local governments the new rules state that local authorities must decide on a franchise application within days if they dont within that time frame the license will be deemed granted in addition they can no longer make extraordinary requests from applicants for the deployment of hardware or for requests unrelated to the provision of video service justifying this the fccs final order points to evidence submitted by verizon which claimed that in parts of the country it has been asked to provide a number of unrelated services to get a license these included the purchase of streetlights wiring for churches installation of cellphone towers and cellphone subsidies for town employees the rules adopted in december and posted on the fcc web site yesterday are likely to be met with a legal challenge from state and local authorities the rules were voted for along partisan lines at the fccs december public meeting with the three republicans mr martin and commissioners deborah taylor tate and robert mcdowell defeating democratic commissioners jonathan adelstein and michael copps "the sum total here is an arrogant case of federal power riding roughshod over local governments " said mr adelstein in a statement accompanying the final order
