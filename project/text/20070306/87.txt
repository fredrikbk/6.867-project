scarcity of ads endangers newspapers book sections sometime this spring the los angeles times is expected to announce that it is folding its highly esteemed sunday book review into a new section that will combine books with opinion pieces that would reduce to five the number of separate book review sections in major metropolitan newspapers still published nationwide down from an estimated to a decade ago the reason not enough ads book publishers in recent years have moved away from buying ads in standalone book review sections in favor of paying to stack mounds of books in the front of chain bookstores some small literary publications such as the new york review of books are showing growth but the book review as a separate section is endangered not only at the los angeles times but at other major newspapers like the washington post chicago tribune san francisco chronicle and san diego union tribune the new york times book review is an exception "in our ad revenue from books was up almost " says todd haskell vice president business development for the times the figure refers to the book review section plus the paper as a whole "our book review is a vibrant part of the sunday newspaper and will continue to be " says mr haskell "we arent backing off an inch " in an era of targeted marketing publishers say the best time to reach readers is when they are in the stores with money in their pockets looking to make an immediate purchase but with a sea of titles in the stores the average square foot store in the barnes &amp noble inc chain now stocks between and titles the only way for publishers to stand out is to pay for real estate in the front and pile those books up high "you want to see your books in prominent places " says tom perry associate publisher of bertelsmann ags random house publishing group "such co op advertising is where marketing dollars are going that might otherwise have been spent on advertising " however mr perry notes that random house on occasion advertises in the new york times book review when it is searching for what he described as a "traditional book buyer " one publisher says that chain bookstores can charge &# or more per book to stack titles in desirable locations such as on a table at the entrance or in a display featuring new nonfiction titles even those who say they still support book section advertising say its only effective as part of a larger marketing effort michael pietsch publisher of lagardere scas little brown imprint says advertising in book reviews can help drive sales if the author is well known and if its done in conjunction with online campaigns readers in san francisco have shown themselves responsive to new writers mr pietsch says as a result little brown often sends them there and supports their visits with ads in the san francisco chronicle a property of hearst corp "we can see the effectiveness of advertising when we do it in conjunction with other promotions " he says new york publishing houses have always cried poverty when it comes to advertising every book requires a different ad as in the movie business but the publishers dont have the studios deep pockets and unlike other advertisers publishers cant do brand building no one buys a book because it comes from random house or simon &amp schuster as the ads dry up some of the remaining book sections fight for survival "you constantly have to justify your existence " says oscar villalon who edits the book section at the san francisco chronicle "why we dont bring in ads " "we rarely get ads from publishers and i would not shy away from the use of the word rare " says arthur salm books editor for the san diego union tribune which is owned by copley press inc at washington post co jabari asim deputy editor of book world the posts weekly book review section says "overall its pretty bad its very frustrating " in california messrs salm and villalon both say their cause wont be helped by the los angeles timess plan the thinking is to introduce a tabloid format that combines the weekly book review section with current an opinion section that runs on sunday the page section to be introduced on april will appear with the thinner saturday paper which will make it not only stand out more but also save money on printing costs because circulation is lower that day than on sunday word of the timess plans for the book review was first reported on the web site laobserved com the los angeles times is undergoing budget pressures as its parent tribune co struggles with restive shareholders demanding a sale and at tribunes hometown flagship the chicago tribune book section had no publishing ads at all in its page book review section feb but still is intact "a book review section is a small but important symbol of the support of literacy " says jim warren the tribunes managing editor features it vexes mr warren that many new york based publishers prefer to advertise in the new york times book review while ignoring regional reading communities "the last industry in america to go to for any wisdom about marketing is book publishing " he says "to say there wouldnt be a benefit to advertising in one of the last standalone sections in a vibrant bookselling city is an absurdity too gross to be insisted upon " the shift away from traditional advertising hasnt helped the industry sell more books bookstore sales in dropped to &# billion from &# billion in according to preliminary estimates from the u s census bureau total retail sales during the same period rose to &# trillion most newly published books dont get any consumer advertising at all instead publishers employ publicists to spread the word to readers through interviews reviews and book signings increasingly publishers are also using independent bloggers to convey news of new titles which helps to pinpoint specific interest groups the new york review of books owned by nyrev inc and bookforum both saw their sales increase in "we tend to publish reviews of books that might not otherwise get reviewed so when publishers have the right title they advertise here " says danielle mcconnell executive publisher of bookforum a unit of artforum international magazine inc in addition to ads from some traditional new york publishers the magazine is also supported by academic presses and art book houses carlin romano the literary critic at philadelphia media holdings llcs philadelphia inquirer says that part of the problem is that newspapers often dont have a sales person who understands the intricacies of the book business even when publishers have money he says they go the new york times book review or the new yorker both of which are national some publishers do feel remorse and concern its hard to generate word of mouth if readers dont see reviews "over the years ive argued that regardless of whether we think an ad is selling a book maybe we should help preserve some review space " says mr perry of random house despite this mr perry says that random house prefers to advertise when a book is already a best seller and the publisher has something new to say about it the inquirer which had a page section in the early s folded its review into another section in frank wilson the papers book review editor says that he has proposed that the paper restore its standalone section "i think its time to relaunch " mr wilson says "i dont understand why newspapers when they want to cut space they immediately think of depriving people who like to read " mr wilson says his plan calls for using new technology to franchise such a section to other papers nationwide that could add reviews for local authors "i think it will enhance revenue if we can hit cities " he says sarah ellison
