politics &amp economics trials of nuclear rebuilding problems at finland reactor highlight global expertise shortage olkiluoto finland a two millimeter welding oversight is one of the many setbacks plaguing construction of a billion euro or &# billion nuclear power reactor in this finnish coastal village the first to be built in europe in years the glitches highlight how an unexpected challenge is holding back a global effort to revive the nuclear industry an acute shortage of skilled manpower finnish regulators noticed a few months ago that panels of the steel cage that will encase the reactor were being welded together with a gap of seven millimeters about a quarter of an inch instead of the five millimeter space required by design specifications the mistake meant frances areva sa and germanys siemens ag the companies in charge of the project had to conduct strain tests to make sure the welding would hold causing delays and irritating regulators "areva should have detected the wider gaps " says jukka laaksonen director of finlands nuclear safety watchdog stuk "you cant play with specifications in the nuclear sector " a long string of technical and regulatory problems have overrun the projects schedule and budget completion is expected months after the original mid deadline areva will book a million euro &# million charge according to the french government the companys controlling shareholder and siemens says it has so far lost several million euros the troubles illustrate how hard it will be to resurrect the worlds nuclear industry which sank into a prolonged slumber after accidents at three mile island in the u s in and chernobyl in ukraine in even as countries try to slash their dependence on fossil fuels the heart of the problem is that a fall in orders after those accidents has stripped the global industry of much know how and discipline "the industry isnt ready for a construction boom " says mr laaksonen many nations are eager to develop new sources of energy as the price of crude oil has soared this decade and a scientific and political consensus has accepted evidence that fossil fuel emissions are a prime contributor to climate change oil natural gas and coal combined account for of the worlds energy diet and most oil and gas is found in volatile regions such as the middle east africa and states of the former soviet union nuclear power which emits no global warming gases and whose main raw material uranium is abundantly available accounts for of global energy supply but that share is expected to decline to by according to international energy agency forecasts as overall demand outpaces the addition of fresh nuclear capacity unless the industry can seize the moment to repair its safety reputation and start expanding again there are nuclear reactors in operation world wide but most were built in the s and s finland last constructed a nuclear plant in the late s and areva np the areva led joint venture at olkiluoto hasnt been a lead contractor since the s excluding olkiluoto reactors are currently being built mainly in asia but all are using old designs that western european and u s nuclear safety regulators wont allow france which has reactors including the latest built in europe is better placed than others in terms of nuclear competence but even there many skilled nuclear engineers have retired or shifted to other businesses over the past two decades state run utility company electricite de france which operates all the countrys reactors recently ordered a th facility beyond needing extra power edf wants to preserve in house nuclear expertise "we must benefit from transfer of competence between generations " chairman pierre gadonneix said at a recent news conference the setbacks at olkiluoto are being closely watched in china and in the u s which are considering building several nuclear reactors in february china signed a draft agreement to buy four reactors from westinghouse a unit of toshiba corp of japan china is also in talks with areva to purchase two others similar to the one being built here in the u s various consortia formed by nuclear engineering companies and utilities have started a lengthy licensing process with the u s nuclear regulatory commission in order to start construction early next decade the megawatt olkiluoto reactor was ordered by finnish power company teollisuuden voima oy in december to meet growing electricity demand from the countrys paper mills work began slowly because areva and siemens had to first complete a detailed design for the new model of reactor the biggest snag happened in september though workers struggled with a concrete mix that because of the frost wasnt fluid enough to be poured into the reactors base slab measuring about feet thick areva np and its local subcontractor long argued over solutions and eventually opted to add slightly more water than what the design specifications required the nuclear watchdog immediately ordered a two month suspension of construction work "inspection showed that the slab is perfectly strong but we should have been informed of the changes in advance " stuks mr laaksonen said areva said that early on it didnt realize it had to inform stuk of minor changes to materials areva nps project manager philippe knoche adds that in the beginning areva had trouble coordinating with subcontractors some of which had no experience in the nuclear field relations with subcontractors are now much smoother mr knoche says another problem at olkiluoto and for industry officials banking on a global nuclear renaissance is procuring heavy forgings these crucial parts can be supplied only by a handful of factories mainly in japan and france forgings are used to make the enormous steel pot that hosts the nuclear chain reaction as well as in making pressurizers steam generators and complex pipes "its unclear how fast we can re create forging capacity " mr knoche said "the know how is in peoples heads and there arent that many who master the technology " at olkiluoto problems securing a steady supply of forgings are causing more delays late last year areva np realized that eight pieces of forgings long pipes measuring about a meter in diameter werent up to snuff because grains in their metallic structure were preventing ultrasonic inspection of the forgings as a whole "we are going to make them again " mr knoche said areva nps headaches over the steel cage to encase the reactor arent over either late last year a storm blew part of the steel ring slightly off its wooden wedges causing bends in the lining "we had to prepare a page memo on how we will fix the ring " mr knoche said in helsinki the finnish regulators chief says the memo is a sign that arevas attitude towards regulation and specifications is improving "theyve learned the lesson " he said
