carroll who by way of her precocious broadway debut in "house of flowers" and tony award winning turn in s "no strings" startled with her talent as well "and theres a lot of that desire i still hold on to but im so much better my dear i used to travel with pieces of luggage now im down to six "i do have a bit of a shoe fetish " she acknowledged "you can learn a lot about people if you look at their shoes " so what can we learn about you ms carroll "that i spend too much money " and what if she does ms carroll has a right to it all the baubles and bangles and beads and blahniks a fact that

and sidney poitier is there a drama queen in the house dial d for diahann when her turbulent romance with mr poitier went south she checked into the plaza hotel to commit suicide armed with two sleeping pills and a peignoir purchased specially for the occasion she rethought the plan when the suite she had in mind wasnt available "it was divine intervention " said ms carroll whose renditions of songs like "come rain or come shine " "some of these days " "a sleepin bee" from "house of flowers " and "the sweetest sounds" from "no strings" serve as notes and commentary on her patter "there are so many misconceptions about my life " added ms carroll who by dint of the sitcom "julia" made history as the first african american actress to star in a television series "people will say to me so what about the daughter you had with sidney poitier and i had never had a child with sidney poitier " in fact ms carrolls daughter is a product of her first marriage to talent manager monte kay "or theyll say how old is the child you had with vic damone my child with vic damone " she repeated incredulously not that ms carroll has an ex to grind "i think weve all reached an age where the good memories hang around longer than anything that was negative " she said quietly in the tone of someone who has logged considerable time in psychotherapy "i dont think at this age were really interested in hurting each other i genuinely care deeply about david and sidney " the show has given ms carroll more than just a chance to set the record straight about her personal life its provided a new creative outlet one she craved after reluctantly bowing out of a broadway bound revival of "on golden pond" with james earl jones her "claudine" co star "i had never walked away from a project in my life " said ms carroll but shed suffered considerable wear and tear a broken fibula among other injuries during her run as norma desmond in the toronto production of the musical "sunset boulevard "and the doctor said i would be on steroids for the entire run of on golden pond i could not be on steroids because im a cancer survivor i had to back away " this was a new skill set for a woman accustomed to moving in one direction at one speed fast forward its true of her personal life ms carroll has tended to say "i do" first and ask questions later and certainly true of her professional life the very few times shes taken a break "my career sort of slaps me on the hand and says where have you been weve been sitting here waiting for you what do you think this gift is for nothing this gift is for you to take care of " the elder of two children ms carroll was born carol diahann johnson and grew up in the bronx and harlem her father was a subway motorman her mother a housewife "i had lovely doting parents " she said "and everything that was done in our family was to move me as far along as possible when i think about the love that surrounded me i get very tearful i have spent the greater part of my life understanding what that means what validity that gave me what dignity "my parents laid down a path for me saying that if i was in an uncomfortable position in my work i should understand there was a door marked exit you never stay where someone is trying to rob you of your happiness or of who you are there are other things to do in the same profession but dont stay there " such awareness didnt do much to temper ms carrolls anger at losing out on parts solely because of her skin color at the studio chiefs who said "are you out of your mind why would you propose this " when her agents put her name forward "but it doesnt serve you well to repeat the negative things that have happened to you " she said "i would like to be doing films i want a judi dench career but im a black american living in the united states so its not terribly realistic " added ms carroll who questions how different things will be for the next generation of african american performers among them the stars of "dreamgirls " beyonce knowles and jennifer hudson "i bought tickets to dreamgirls one night to be supportive but then i turned around and went home i havent seen it yet but in my heart i have seen it ive lived it i think of all the movies with only black actors and its disappointing " she said referring to her appearance with dorothy dandridge harry belafonte and mr poitier in films like s "carmen jones" and "porgy and bess" in "what i mean is that the lot where the films are made is not open to us once our little piece for is over its over once our little piece in was over it was over what do beyonce and jennifer hudson do now i want to see what happens next " credit her parents credit her psychiatrist but ms carroll is accentuating the positive "i worked all the time and im not complaining because i think its a fantastic thing for a black american woman to say in this profession " she continues to work after more than years in the business she had a guest shot last season on "greys anatomy " and her "both sides now" tour is booked into may "after that well see " said ms carroll cautiously her career it seems has suddenly come up against stiff competition the joy of playing to a full house is undeniable "its like a love affair a serious love affair" but the joy of playing with her two grandchildren is indescribable "recently i was in the park with my little ones and my four year old granddaughter was afraid to come down the sliding board i said nana is right here darling she wanted me to come up there with her and i said nana cant climb up you come down " no way finally up nana went sat down next to the child and the two of them slid down together "my granddaughter gave me a big hug and a woman came over and said how does it feel that she has no idea that you are diahann carroll "and you know " said ms carroll with a smile "it felt great " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
