taking stock in china last week the shanghai stock exchanges composite index unexpectedly dropped the largest one day decline in years surprisingly to those of us inside china leading stock markets around the world followed the drop in same day trading in new york the dow jones industrial average tumbled and the nasdaq their sharpest falls since while chinas trade and production have a big global impact the sell off in the sseci is a watershed event that marks the beginning of the integration of chinas financial markets into the wider world the sell off itself was most likely just a natural burst of volatility in a richly valued market not a sign of the chinese economys direction and the global markets perhaps overreacted still the event demonstrates how interconnected the world has become and why every country should manage its affairs to avoid unnecessary disturbances to the rest of the world so how can china avoid excessive stock market swings in an earlier era the government would cool an overheated stock market by issuing warnings and taking administrative measures such as forbidding certain funds from investing in stocks but china now boasts a trillion dollar plus market with a market capitalization equal to of chinese gdp were the government to intervene now as it did before it would likely cause unnecessarily large volatilities with serious results for the economy and in an era of rapid change it is far more difficult now to know whether the market is actually "overheating " government intervention will most likely either stunt an otherwise healthy growing market or come so late that the damage is already unavoidable a better alternative than government intervention to ensure the smooth functioning of chinas stock market is to build in a self adjusting mechanism the first step is to continue to strengthen chinas institutional investor base according to the latest figures from the shanghai stock exchange institutional investors already own close to of its floating market capitalization but thats not enough since most individual investors have little idea how to value stocks they tend to bid up prices too high in a bull market and drive them down too low in a bear market institutions can value stocks far better and can over the medium to long term align prices much more closely with the fundamentals thats why china should approve more new mutual funds increase quotas under the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme so more overseas institutions can enter the market and allow more insurance and pension money to be invested in stocks and yes hedge funds should be legalized the second step is to introduce short selling and stock index futures without a short selling mechanism investors can only make money when the market goes up that puts a huge bias on bullish comments and trading behavior it would help to create more balanced views and trading patterns if investors could make money even in a declining market the technical preparations for both steps are already done but their implementation has been delayed repeatedly for the sake of waiting for the "proper time " when the market was rising last fall it was feared that allowing stock shorting would kill a nascent bull market so reforms were delayed until january after entering the new year the market rose further and the sseci quickly closed in on the level and it was feared this time that introducing short selling would cause big drops in the market this is another classical example of how opportunities are lost when government is put in charge of making this kind of market decision a third step is to loosen government control on initial public offerings it has long been the practice in china to pace ipos carefully in order to drive up the market but this often leads to a supply shortage of new shares and elevates ipo prices which tends to enhance the overall market price to earnings ratio already many ipos are priced at more than times earnings the natural stock price adjustment through supply and demand is thus hindered its time to introduce an ipo process where the pace is set by the market not dictated by the government lastly chinas qualified domestic institutional investor program the primary vehicle for chinese investors to invest overseas via mutual funds should be expanded so far a total of &# billion in international investing quotas have been distributed among participating institutions but less than half that amount has been taken up by investors thats because under current regulations qdii funds largely can only invest in overseas fixed income products the lower returns on these investments and the appreciating chinese currency encourage people to keep their money at home if the investment scope of the qdii program is expanded to include stocks investors surely will be more enthusiastic given the increasingly large price gap between domestic and overseas shares for example securities firms are trading at times earnings in china whereas in overseas markets the best international securities firms are trading at less than times earnings given a free choice many domestic investors would opt for international firms some argue that chinese institutions dont yet know how to invest in overseas stocks but this can be solved by linking up with international money managers compared with the last bull market from to chinas institutional investors are far stronger and this gives us some hope that the current bull run can last longer however the majority of investors are still individuals and more and more first time stock investors are getting into the market given the huge amount of savings and low interest rates among other factors in china there is good reason to believe that the market can still go too high unless steps are taken to increase market flexibility the market is now too big and complex for any able government agency to fine tune and engineer a soft landing the government is better advised to improve the market and rely more on its inner mechanisms than on its own ability to intervene mr fang is deputy director for financial services in the shanghai metropolitan government and was deputy chief executive of the shanghai stock exchange from to the views expressed here are his own
