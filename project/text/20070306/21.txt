can we talk for years ive experienced the feelings you wrote about in the work &amp family column "dealing with the dead zone spouses too tired to talk" personal journal feb and i thought it was just a personal quirk of mine as did my husband the difference im a stay at home mom its not just those who work in paying jobs who have busy stressful days and need to decompress its my husband who is the chatty one when he returns home from work having been out in the world meanwhile ive been dealing all day with bickering children household tasks school activities errands and chauffeur duties without two minutes to take a deep breath and gather my thoughts after the children are in bed i need to withdraw into a quiet zone to get some privacy and try to maintain a sense of self the emergence of the "dead zone" phenomenon is an unfortunate result of the hectic nature of daily life in our modern world regardless of how or where one spends his or her days carol obrien phoenixville pa how interesting that "high earning managers" like the ones you profiled have the capacity to talk to loads of people throughout the work day but at the very moment they leave the office theyve hit some magical cutoff point in their ability to talk cant they even summon up the energy and civility to exchange greetings hugs and small talk with their families isnt the long commute alone in the car with the cell phone turned off or on public transportation with a good book enough time to decompress yes executive jobs are stressful but these whiners should put their "stress" in perspective perhaps they need to live a day in the life of a coal miner or an inner city cop the immediate danger of these occupations might be a reality check suzanne dimoff bethesda md your column identified a common and serious situation the lack of personal time to nourish family relationships as a psychiatrist i wonder at the socially strained lives we have created what you describe couples hitting upon strategies so they can talk minutes a day is far more sad than creative were supposed to be free were supposed to be rich are we third world citizens probably have more discretionary time something that in my view has become our most precious commodity the question for me is not how to squeeze in that stop watch chat but why have we chosen lives where that is needed peggy finston m d prescott ariz
