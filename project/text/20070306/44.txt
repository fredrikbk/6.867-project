fixing no child left behind the no child left behind education law is up for renewal this year and an independent commission recently released some recommendations for improvement not to be outdone the white house has also put out its own "blueprint" for strengthening the law the legislation could use a serious reworking but any fixes wont go far enough unless they do more to expand public and private school choice nclbs political bargain was that in return for a big increase in federal education spending the government would hold schools more accountable for results in the classroom six years later taxpayers have done their part since overall nclb funding has risen by and federal spending on title i schools serving low income students has gone up nclb and the bush administration also deserve some credit for shifting the terms of the education debate the law has focused attention on learning gaps between students of different races and economic backgrounds that persist even at some of the nations best public schools the laws requirement that schools test annually in grades and report both averages and the results of racial and economic subgroups has made it much more difficult for administrators to hide the fact that all students arent learning nclb has been much less successful in bringing pressure to bear on states and school districts that fail to implement the law thats especially true of the school choice provisions which are the best way to get the attention of the education bureaucracy unfortunately the bush administration abandoned its voucher proposal very early in the negotiations what passed was a watered down version of public school choice which in theory allows a child in a failing school to transfer to a better public school or get free after school tutoring from private providers in practice however the education department has too often allowed school districts to skirt even these limited choice provisions either by granting exemptions or looking the other way it took a formal complaint from the alliance for school choice before secretary margaret spellings did anything about los angeles failing to notify parents of their transfer rights as required under the law so far shes sent the district a sternly worded letter and the chicago public school system which has been repeatedly labeled "in need of improvement" and thus should be banned under nclb from offering its own after school tutoring has been given a waiver to do exactly that so while it would be nice if the bush administration enforced its own law the larger lesson is that school choice "lite" turns out to be no substitute for the real thing to be fair some of these problems are structural even if more school districts were implementing nclbs transfer provisions there often isnt enough room in decent schools to handle all the children who qualify for a transfer and many of the private after school tutoring services allowed under the law are simply employing the same teachers from the local public school system who are failing the kids during regular school hours theres also the problem of allowing each state to develop its own standards and tests to determine proficiency in reading and math the administration was deferring to federalist principles on an issue thats traditionally been handled at the state and local level but the reality has been a "race to the bottom " with some states constructing easy tests to avoid federal penalties "if youre in oklahoma right now youre told that or of your schools are doing fine " says frederick hess who follows education at the american enterprise institute "and if youre in massachusetts youre told that to of your schools are doing fine but if you look at the actual achievement data it suggests that kids in massachusetts are doing far better than kids in oklahoma " some education reformers are now calling for "national standards" to address this problem but we tried national history standards in the s and the politicized results werent pretty unless of course you favor a history curriculum that downgrades the founding fathers while playing up the working experiences of midwives in th century nebraska rather than force a national test on states the best compromise here may be to require them to benchmark their own assessments against the national assessment of education progress naep a federal standardized test that already exists and that most educators agree is fairly rigorous "so people at least have a common metric by which to judge the rigor of the state assessment " says mr hess its worth considering and we wish we could say the same about the commission on no child left behind which was funded by private foundations and co chaired by former governors tommy thompson and roy barnes but the panels report is more interested in tinkering than fundamental change and its recommendations dont include the one that would make the biggest difference school vouchers the administrations proposed fixes are bolder and potentially more consequential president bushs budget sets aside &# million for "promise scholarships" for low income students in schools that have consistently underperformed for five years the scholarships would average about &# and "the money would follow the child to the public charter or private school of his or her choice " thems fightin words for the democrats who now control congress but mr bush has the bully pulpit as well as the moral authority from five years of evidence on failing schools we hope his administration uses them to explain why real school choice is essential to any reform in k education
