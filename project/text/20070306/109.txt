the middle seat what frequent flier miles really get you our test of six major airlines found significant differences in seat cost and availability are some airlines more miserly than others when making discounted frequent flier award seats available it would appear so i recently checked available award seats on routes for various summer and fall travel dates found that delta air lines inc and us airways group inc often required more miles than other major carriers amr corp s american and ual corp s united were the most generous with coach seats available at their lowest award levels on of trips checked continental airlines inc and northwest airlines corp fell in the middle us airways however offered its lowest priced award on only two of itineraries delta on zero for a june trip from philadelphia to san francisco and back american united and continental all had mile coach seats available while us airways offered nothing cheaper than miles between seattle and london for a later september trip american and united both had their lowest priced awards available but delta northwest and us airways offered nothing less than mile coach seats double their lowest price travelers have long complained about the paucity of available frequent flier award seats and program changes that effectively raised the mileage cost of "free" seats airlines have added new more plentiful categories of "unrestricted" awards in recent years but at double or more what had been the standard mileage price this spot check on availability while far from a comprehensive inventory does show what consumers are up against when trying to score seats in recent years more miles have been chasing fewer seats a resurgence of fare paying customers has left fewer seats empty yet there are more miles in circulation because airlines have found selling miles to credit card companies can be lucrative for summer travel to europe seats at the standard or mile levels were virtually impossible to find in our sampling but airlines routinely had mile unrestricted seats available for trips to london paris frankfurt and brussels ditto for hawaii a check of three routes to the islands for a june trip found no seats at the standard mile level but plenty of seats at double the price airlines are by and large free to run their frequent flier programs as they see fit the department of transportation suggests but doesnt require that carriers offer to of available seats in a market any time they advertise a sale price or frequent flier award most airlines do report the total percentage of travel bought with some sort of frequent flier award including upgrades and double mileage tickets and totals ran from to carriers wont say how much of that is for awards at the lowest price levels however craig bruya of seattle tried unsuccessfully last week to find two business class seats on united to paris for a late april trip at uniteds mile "saver" price level curious he looked for such seats all the way to the end of november and found none if "there isnt a single open seat then they really dont have a saver program " says mr bruya who ended up paying united miles for two business class tickets asked about mr bruyas frustration a spokeswoman for united suggested that customers can buy a coach ticket for trips like his and try to use miles to upgrade to business class frank purno of atlanta is on a waiting list for business class seats at deltas "skysaver" level for a trip from atlanta to rome with his wife scheduled for a november departure hes willing to pay miles for each seat but not the miles per seat delta wants for unrestricted business class "you would think eight months in advance i could get seats " says mr purno "it just frustrates the hell out of you " delta says it believes that it actually has been more generous with "saver" award availability than competitors but that they do sell out quickly for summer months the airline has already booked skysaver awards in business class between atlanta and rome the route mr purno wants thats of available business class seats says jeff robertson managing director of deltas skymiles program availability does change mr robertson notes and customers should check often for available seats airlines load schedules days in advance and thats when award seats first become available but if seats dont sell delta may make more of them available for awards days or even days before departure he says "im absolutely convinced our skysaver availability is better than other airlines " mr robertson says airlines have made more tools available to consumers to help find cheap seats five of the big six international carriers now have seat availability calendars posted online that can help users spot cheap seats delta the lone holdout promises a calendar within a "few weeks " also some airlines give their elite level fliers access to a greater inventory of award seats even at the cheapest levels calendars also can make it painfully apparent how little availability there is for a seattle london trip checked on feb us airways had no seats at its lowest mileage level between april and nov almost a seven month drought continental was better with only about a four month absence between may and sept american actually had some mile seats still available on that route for midweek flights in june july and august us airways says while it does offer its lowest priced frequent flier tickets even in business class during summer months it does have numerous blackout dates and other limits on availability "us airways strategy is to sell less discount revenue inventory in advance than other airlines " says tom trenga vice president of revenue management one quirk of the system to remember when trying to book awards always check for discounted business class and first class tickets which sometimes can be better values and even lower priced than unrestricted coach tickets on several routes checked including new york los angeles philadelphia san francisco and providence r i phoenix us airways offered mile coach tickets and mile first class tickets between denver and orlando american offered a mile coach ticket and a first class ticket priced miles less at miles delta also offered a first class ticket cheaper than its best coach price for the dates checked airline executives know customers are angry ideaworks a consulting firm asked frequent flier program executives attending a vancouver british columbia conference last week what frustrates customers most and said limited availability of "saver" awards at the same time more than half said they didnt increase availability last year that may change a bit this year said they will increase availability at least selectively this year after all if customers get so frustrated that frequent flier miles lose their allure airlines wont sell as many miles to hotel telephone and credit card companies "there is an acknowledgment that something has to be done " says ideaworks president jay sorensen
