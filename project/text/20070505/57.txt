pursuits leisure &amp arts bold attacks and sweeping phrases but mstislav rostropovich was more than a world class cellist mstislav rostropovichs unexpected death last week at the age of has left a genuine void in the classical music world he was still fully in harness both as the most iconic cellist since pablo casals and as an impassioned conductor especially of russian music in a century of great cello playing his stands out for instance in his recordings of the six bach solo suites cornerstones of the cellists repertoire rostropovichs great hearted interpretations bristle with bold attacks and sweeping phrases less austere than the majestic casals more rambunctious than the dulcet fingered hienrich schiff or the introspective yo yo ma rostropovich could spin out an unbroken line of golden purity where he felt it appropriate as in the slow movements of the dvorak and saint saens concertos drama and expression however were the foundation of his playing a child of stalinist russia he knew privation self sacrifice and fear and in works like the two shostakovich concertos the schnittke concerto the two penderecki concertos brittens sonata op cello symphony op and three suites for unaccompanied cello all of these works written for him his playing was colored and sculpted by this experience indeed if by choice his tone wasnt always purely beautiful it was always meaningful born in baku azerbaijan in he was the younger of two children in a interview in new york he told me in his idiosyncratic richly accented english that his mother a peripatetic pianist and conservatory professor had tried to abort him because she felt that a second child would be too great a burden "like confession " rostropovich said "my mother tell me one day excuse me my son but im sorry she asked very famous gynecology professor not for operation but something liquid to get rid of me from inside but i stay in there " in fact rostropovichs mother carried him for months and years later he used to joke with her "mother you had me for extra month why not make for me a beautiful face and mother always smile and say my son i was too busy making you beautiful hands " rostropovichs father an erstwhile casals student was "a genius cellist " in his sons words "when i was years old father give me a little cello but i was crazy to become conductor i say father i want to conduct and father says to me no first make career as performer because only when orchestra trusts you as performer can you conduct " the elder rostropovichs sudden death from heart trouble in was a terrible shock to the year old "it was the most difficult time in my life " he recalled "it was during war and we had nothing but hunger " music offered the sole avenue of comfort entering moscow conservatory at in during the harsh days of world war ii rostropovich studied with some of the pre eminent figures in soviet music especially dmitri shostakovich he recalled "when i come to shostakovichs class i put my cello under piano it was orchestration and composition all together we play together piano four hands shostakovich had phenomenal knowledge of all music he memorized it all phenomenal for first time in my life i hear name of mahler who was not known at all in russia but for shostakovich mahler was an idol " ironically shostakovich had wanted rostropovich to focus on composition rather than cello nevertheless he composed two cello concertos for his "slava " and he conceived of the haunting cello harmonics in his second trio with rostropovichs playing in mind "i know and love several great composers in my life " rostropovich said "but shostakovich always first in my heart " this deep emotional link was always apparent in his interpretations of shostakovichs symphonies indeed his interpretations as conductor were occasionally criticized for sacrificing technical precision to emotion but the american conductor andrew litton who was rostropovichs assistant conductor at washingtons national symphony orchestra from observes that "no one i ever worked with knew better than slava how a conductor should comport himself on the podium he may not always have been able to carry that physical ideal out himself or with the greatest stick technique but we musicians always knew what he meant to convey because the music came out of every pore " like shostakovich rostropovich was a man of tremendous conscience whose refusal to toe the official party line compromised his standing in the soviet union in his open letter to leading soviet newspapers and magazines supporting the banned novelist and nobel laureate aleksandr solzhenitsyn and deploring recent restrictions on cultural expression brought down the wrath of soviet authorities and led to his eventual self imposed exile in the west from when he and his wife the eminent soprano galina vishnevskaya were stripped of their soviet citizenship until in rostropovich played a bach suite on the demolition site of the berlin wall as a show of political thanksgiving in he marked the dissolution of the soviet union by touring there with his washington based national symphony and in he flew to moscow to lend his support to boris yeltsin that year he also founded the washington based nonprofit vishnevskaya rostrpovich foundation vrf to improve the state of childrens health care in russia and other former soviet states http www rostropovich org cellist conductor mentor and humanitarian rostropovich was a unique personality truly larger than life surely his greatest musical colleagues would agree that we will never know his like again mr scherer writes on classical music for the journal
