cross country radio free washington seattle letting the government regulate political speech is dangerous but letting interest groups regulate the political speech of their opponents is surreal yet that was the law in washington before the state supreme court ruled last week that my radio commentary and that of a colleague did not have to be listed as "in kind" campaign donations as required by a lower court the case vividly illustrates how interest groups employ campaign finance laws to chill the speech of their opponents and because washington states campaign finance law is based on federal law it is likely to have repercussions across state lines the controversy began two years ago when the state legislature passed a cent gas tax on the final day of its session and added an "emergency clause" to prohibit voters from voicing approval of the tax through a referendum i had spoken out against the tax as a host of an afternoon show on kvi radio kirby wilbur the morning drive host also opposed the tax on the air we both decided to support the drive to put an initiative on the ballot that would pass a separate law repealing the tax but initiatives require signatures and there was only days to collect them we used our shows to encourage people to donate their time and money the response was overwhelming about volunteers came out and in less than three days raised &# in the end more than people signed the initiative within the month about two weeks before the signature deadline prosecutors in san juan county the city of seattle and two neighboring suburbs filed a complaint against the campaign organization "no new gas taxes" nngt claiming that our broadcasts were really "in kind" donations this was not mere bookkeeping state law prohibits donations to initiatives of more than &# in the last three weeks of a campaign the law doesnt make a distinction between cash and "in kind" donations so with our speech likely to be valued at more than &# prosecutors were really asking for us to be gagged of course the local governments themselves had a financial interest in the outcome of the election if the gas tax was allowed to stand local jurisdictions would receive millions in fresh tax revenue and the lawyers doing the legal legwork for the local governments were attorneys from the seattle law firm foster pepper pllc that is the same firm as the court noted that "serves as bond counsel for the state of washington and supported a political committee opposing the initiative " the lawyers and the governments had a financial stake in the outcome of the case and the upcoming election whats more foster pepper was tapped to prosecute the case "on behalf of washington state " for the first time in state history a law firm fully involved in one side of a campaign with an economic interest at stake was given legal authority to prosecute political opponents foster pepper in its role as prosecutor demanded all emails and phone records from nngt along with campaign correspondence and their campaign plan they also wanted emails and radio tapes from fisher broadcasting parent company of kvi the lawsuit was heard by judge christopher wickham in the thurston county superior court in october after hearing such damning testimony as mr wilbur and i referring to the campaign as "we " as in "were going to qualify this initiative if people keep signing it at this rate " judge wickham ruled against us and ordered nngt to catalog and report the financial value of our broadcasts by the end of business that day we suspected one aim of our opponents was to pressure the corporate management at fisher broadcasting into ordering an end to on air initiative advocacy instead fisher refused to budge and encouraged us to keep talking about whatever we wanted the company spent thousands of dollars in unbudgeted legal expenses without comment or complaint meanwhile at the low budget nngt campaign tens of thousands of dollars were diverted from advertising to attorney fees the campaign to repeal the gas tax was outspent in cash donations almost and fell short in the november election but the battle wasnt over the institute for justice an arlington va based conservative legal foundation with a local chapter entered the case on behalf of nngt and appealed to the state supreme court the case was litigated last june between the ijs william maurer and foster peppers mike vaska who has been mentioned as a possible candidate to be the u s attorney for western washington the decision handed down by the moderately liberal washington supreme court was decisive "the prosecutors argue and the trial court agreed that wilburs and carlsons broadcasts supporting the initiative fall outside the laws media exemption we reject the prosecutors argument " the law clearly defines commentary the court continued as a "media exemption" and while "the term commentary is not defined we believe that it plainly encompasses advocacy for or against an issue candidate or campaign whether that involves the solicitation of votes money or other support indeed such activities are a core aspect of the medias traditional role " the court helpfully pointed out that an in kind donation would constitute free advertising spots to a campaign during commercial breaks foster pepper essentially argued that content and commercials were one and the same an argument the court flatly struck down it also opened the door for nngt and the institute for justice to request reimbursement of legal expenses by the governments that probably thought there was no downside to signing onto the case if a court that tilts more leftward than the u s supreme court soundly rejects attempts to use campaign finance laws to regulate commentary on the airwaves perhaps we can expect the u s supreme court to exercise the same impatience with similar mischief under federal campaign finance laws much is at stake if they do more is at stake if they dont mr carlson broadcasts a daily show on am kvi in seattle and radio commentary on komo
