venezuela isnt a threat to the u s i wish to correct your suggestion that the venezuelan governments purchase of oil reserves along the orinoco river is an affront to u s energy interests "how chavez aims to weaken u s " leading the news may it is important to note that our state owned oil company pdvsa created in hasnt moved toward full nationalization of the orinoco belt reserves but rather a model of shared ownership pdvsas purchase of a stake in the reserves doesnt expel private capital and private companies are being compensated for any purchase certainly revenues from oil are increasingly directed toward development in other sectors such as human capacity building through social programs in health and education this reflects the current administrations concern with undoing past injustices by reducing poverty in no way have these policies prevented pdvsa from making the kinds of long term investments in oil production and exploration that will ensure its continued viability to do so would be foolish considering the company is crucial to our own development toward this end pdvsa has set aside &# billion for investment in these areas over the next six years as your article alludes increased trade between china and venezuela is indeed a strategic response to the need to diversify our economic exchange and pursue partnerships with strong markets wherever they exist the u s has pursued this relationship with china as well venezuelas interest however comes from our commitment to economic integration particularly among latin american markets as initiatives like the bank of the south demonstrate as well as fairer negotiations with other global powers including the u s rather than recoiling from the international financial scene venezuela is consolidating its recent economic gains and fiscal responsibility as is evident from our recent repayment of loans to the world bank and the imf venezuela isnt a threat to the u s nor does it seek to "weaken" the country with which it still conducts the majority of its economic exchange if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery the u s should take increased trade between venezuela and china as a compliment bernardo alvarez ambassador of venezuela to the u s washington
