no fundamental flaw in jobs survey process i disagree with many of the points made about the monthly employment statistics in "the jobs miscount" review &amp outlook april the bureau of labor statistics monthly survey of employers does not use old statistical techniques it uses state of the art survey design and modeling techniques that were implemented as part of a comprehensive redesign completed in in that process bls consulted with the american statistical association as well as several top private survey organizations in the redesigned survey firms of all sizes are fairly represented more than have fewer than employees as is the full range of industries in both the "old" and "new" economies due to improved collection methods and better sampling techniques monthly revisions to first published data are far smaller than they once were revisions averaged about a month between and over the past four years they have averaged closer to once a year bls revises the sample based survey data based upon more comprehensive counts of employment that are available from the unemployment insurance system with a significant lag most years this revision is or less while the most recent such revision was larger our extensive research into potential sources of the revision does not lead us to believe that there is a fundamental flaw in the survey process bls is continuing to explore ways of reducing the revisions to the survey data we are committed to producing the most accurate and timely job estimates possible philip l rones deputy commissioner bureau of labor statistics u s department of labor washington
