pursuits style mothers day gifts he shops she shops can a gift of the month club outshine personalized gifts for mom our columnists face off a guys ideas by alan murray when it comes to mothers day my sentiments are with anna jarvis who campaigned to make it a national holiday a century ago according to legend ms jarvis was arrested for trying to stop women from selling flowers at a mothers day festival "i wanted it to be a day of sentiment " she said "not profit " but alas times change hand picked wildflowers will probably no longer do the trick mothers day is a time when all men need to remember there are certain things we can never do and certain burdens we will never bear for that we must pay for your own mother of course sentiment may still go a long way a collection of family photos or a bouquet of flowers with a hand inscribed note can elicit the same sort of gratitude she showered on you the first time you gave her an ill shaped pottery bowl from your fifth grade art class for the mother of your children however the bar may be higher below my suggestions none of these by the way can replace the traditional mothers day brunch which is a must at our house flower a month club there are a number of these that are readily available online at a cost of about &# a month you can buy three months worth or a whole year and remind the mothers in your life of how special they are year round monthly croissants is she allergic to flowers williams sonoma offers a variation on the theme three months of croissants from pastry chef jean yves charon in may shell get a dozen plain croissants made with butter and thin layers of yeast dough in june shell get croissants filled with premium callebaut chocolate and in july shell get mini croissants the pastries will last in the freezer for three months and thawed overnight before baking the cost &# while were at it you can do chocolates instead through givechocolate com for about the same price as the flowers and croissants birthstone necklace redenvelope com has an attractive gold necklace with a family tree that can hold the birthstones of up to five children the cost depends on how many birthstones you need and the quality of the stones blue nile also has birthstone necklaces online singing slide show brookstone offers up a high tech photo frame that automatically scrolls through selected digital images and plays music you download with each current cost &# and a womans point of view by laura landro anna jarvis would probably roll over in her grave to learn just how commercial mothers day has become consumers are expected to spend nearly &# billion on the holiday this year showering moms with clothes jewelry and flowers according to the national retail federation but mothers day has also become a much more inclusive holiday over the years so there are more mother figures to shop for the mothers day card display at hallmark has something for everyone in addition to the usual cards for mom aunts sisters and grandmothers there are also cards for birth mothers adoptive mothers stepmothers "any mom" and even "anyone " as a stepmother myself i was intrigued to learn that a proposal to declare a national stepmothers day the sunday after mothers day actually made it to the senate floor a few years ago but the idea never got any traction perhaps because in todays extended and blended families it really isnt necessary you can personalize gifts for different mother figures without taking anything away from your own mother on mothers day here are some suggestions a classic locket alan is always right to think of jewelry and a birthstone necklace is nice but i love the idea of a classic locket with a personal photo hidden inside redenvelope offers pretty lockets in heart shapes ovals and squares that open up to display three or four different photos about &# to &# if you think thats too kitschy theres also a necklace with chinese characters for the words "mother" and "daughter " cookies for a cause the goodies alan suggests are always welcome but better to tug moms heartstrings with a box of customized treats that help a special cause for children delectable edibles mydelectableedibles com creates beautiful hatbox shaped gift boxes with goodies like triple chocolate cookies unforgettable chocolate chunk or "not just" oatmeal cookies you can also order cookies in special shapes to reflect her favorite things such as high heeled shoes for the fashion plate or a combination of daisies and bumblebees for the gardener owner cristina desmelik wright whose son has juvenile diabetes donates part of each sale to the juvenile diabetes research foundation alan responds if i gave these to my wife id probably end up eating them personalized purse love the singing slide show idea but for a more portable memento have her favorite photo the grandkids her bulldog or even a childs drawing imprinted on a handbag tote or cosmetics case bagettes com seals photos and other art onto satin and canvas fabric with a high tech imaging process from &# to about &# if she isnt the type to give up her prada handbag for a tote with a photo personalizationmall com will put a photo on almost anything accent pillows afghan throws beach towels mugs and mouse pads alan responds i cant bring myself to buy purses i just cant get my head around why women need so many of them the shower curtain with photos is an original idea but isnt it a little creepy having your family watching you in the shower photo album thanks to online photo services such as shutterfly com and snapfish com you can also be your own vanity publisher making a hardcover book of photos with text customized for each of the special mothers in your life for prices starting at as little as &# each snapfish
