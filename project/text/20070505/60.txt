pursuits picks online music yahoo now offers lyrics to songs but that still leaves some gaps if youre still trying to translate the mumbling lyrics of radioheads thom yorke theres a new site designed to help yahoo music last week launched a free lyrics component to its music site working with digital media company gracenote the site aims to counter some of the problems of many existing lyrics sites these sites often illegally post words without permission from the songwriter they are also notorious for deluging visitors with pop up ads and containing spyware for yahoos site gracenote spent three years developing a wide ranging lyrics database with a team of more than people it worked with publishers to license lyrics for more than songs about of yahoos online music catalog including songs without lyrics sources gracenote tapped to decipher difficult lyrics ranged from internet fan sites and message boards to radio station djs and linguists yahoo and gracenote split the ad revenue and then gracenote uses an electronic payment agent to pay the songwriters the lyrics appear on yahoos artist pages along with biographies photos and music videos and the lyrics are integrated into yahoos music search engine so a single search for the phrase "lets dance" yields song results for everyone from david bowie to barry manilow there are some drawbacks because gracenote has to license the songs legally pop hits dont appear on yahoos site as quickly as they do on illegal sites r&amp b crooner ne yos "because of you " which was no on billboards hot chart this week has yet to appear on yahoos site even though it appeared on the charts two months ago some popular acts are still missing material in the case of the eagles gracenote has to contact each member of the group to receive permission so it is still working to complete the bands catalog but for fans who are still stumbling through bob dylans songbook or a difficult verse from an early jay z song the site is easy to search and navigate how to find it go to music yahoo com email us at pursuits wsj com
