pursuits books tales from inside the beeb bernie goldberg british style a former bbc reporter questions the political predilections of a media enterprise that is unrivaled in its global reach can we trust the bbc by robin aitken continuum pages &# despite the quagmire wallow of cnn international which makes cnn domestic look like the michael savage show the rolling news network founded by ted turner is still seen around the world as believe it or not "american " the truly globalized broadcaster remains the bbc in spring when i was at the hyatt in amman jordan the bbc was the channel that the big shot saudi sheikhs and gulf businessmen preferred to watch over breakfast in the eighth floor executive lounge a few days after i stopped for lunch at a cafe in fallujah iraq and in what felt like a faintly parodic courtesy to the only western imperialist in the joint mein host made a great show of switching the tv from al arabiya to the beeb i certainly wouldnt have asked him to it was an endless succession of sneering interviewers with skeptical eyebrows arching extravagantly out of frame as they grilled former assistant deputy assistant secretaries of state down the line from washington about how badly everything was going three out of four questions seemed to begin with "but surely you dont seriously expect us to believe " a couple of weeks later channel surfing back in london i found myself mesmerized by a game show on bbc in which the four male contestants had to remove the brassieres of the four female contestants without using their hands i used to be able to do this myself but frankly im a little rusty and was eager to bring myself up to speed yet as miscellaneous noses and teeth nuzzled and gnawed at clasps and underwiring i found myself oddly distracted talk about a public service the government exacts a levy from the citizenry in order to fund shows in which blokes compete to be the fastest at getting the bras off the birds thats to say in the united kingdom anybody who owns a tv set is obliged to pay an annual license fee of some &# in order to fund the bbc and save britain from the lowbrow morass of american style commercialized broadcasting with its endless parade of idiotic soaps and witless quizzes according to the beebs defenders like those ladies embonpoints quality broadcasting is not self supporting so lest you consider defaulting on the poll tax fleets of "tv detector vans" roam the land to catch you in the act of watching telly without a license big brother is watching you watching "big brother " when a chap writes a book called "can we trust the bbc " i think its a safe assumption that the answer is unlikely to be "yes " so i trust you wont regard it as a plot spoiler if i reveal that at the end of his brisk tome robin aitken a beeb journalist for years reveals that no you cannot trust the bbc at least not if youre of a broadly conservative disposition on the european union on the iraq war on northern ireland on islam on america the bbc trends not merely well to the left of the conservative party but well to the left of tony blairs new labour away from the news its "creative" side is expressed mainly through the usual dreary provocations such as "weddings and beheadings " its laugh a minute drama about an islamist snuff video cameraman scripted by hanif kureishi britains oldest most promising young writer and a man wholl never run out of beeb commissions the bbcs privileged position in british life makes its bias of a slightly different order from any u s networks the british broadcasting corp had a television monopoly until the s a local radio monopoly until the s and a national radio monopoly until the s but it didnt get where it is today without the ability to adapt as broadcasting was opened up to characteristically british over regulated competition the bbc massively expanded it currently operates eight national tv networks nine national radio networks the "national region" stations in scotland wales and northern ireland local stations and an asian network plus the bbc world service which can be heard in capital cities around the world international tv networks and international radio services in different languages including kyrgyz and kinyarwanda unlike the shrunken unmanned royal navy the sun never sets on the bbc empire as mr aitken points out of people listen to it every week and thats just in afghanistan the bbc is the worlds most popular internet news site and the third most popular site in the u s last year i was having a drink with australias great foreign minister alexander downer and as one does we got into an argument about burkina faso i demanded to know whether the minister could in fact name the countrys present head of government he confessed that alas he hadnt been paying as close attention to the affairs of burkina faso as he might pulled out his blackberry went straight to the bbc and read out their comprehensive and authoritative page on the nation "burkina faso is a poor country by west african standards" which is a mind boggling concept no other broadcaster has such a reach when those butch voices announce the evening news from the abc cbs nbc "world news headquarters " you cant help noticing its heavy on the headquarters very light on the world news as for pbs and npr i take a malicious pleasure in the humiliations inflicted on public broadcasting in this country whenever i see the floundering host in front of the silent phone bank urging us to call now because otherwise well be denied quality programming like the thrice weekly peter paul &amp mary reunion concert and dont forget for a pledge of only &# youll receive this bonus gift of a bill moyers snood no insulated bbc panjandrum has to sully his lips with so desperate a pitch so robin aitkens argument rests on the spider man proposition that with great power comes great responsibility in the american scholar lincoln gordon explained that the bbcs privileged position brought with it certain "beliefs appropriate to a british national institution in domestic affairs they are the monarchy the constitution the british empire and christianity abroad peace sought through the machinery of the league of nations " seventy years on that list prompts a mirthless laugh from mr aitken "only in the bbcs respect for the league of nations successor the united nations is there any obvious continuity " he writes otherwise the bbc today is antimonarchist and anti imperialist and the only constitution it believes in is the one giscard destaing devised for the european union it is avowedly secular and contemptuous of organized religion with the exception of islam which is more organized than most when one tv host made some observations about the arab worlds penchant for suicide bombing amputations repression of women and a generally celebratory attitude to none of which is factually in dispute he was yanked off the air immediately and permanently when however the bbcs principal current affairs morning man called the catholic churchs attitude to aids "outrageous" and "wicked " his words apparently complied with bbc standards of "impartiality " when their arts pundit offered the pensee that "brooklyn born" jewish settlers on the west bank "should be shot dead" because "they are nazis" and "i feel nothing but hatred for them " he too remained at his post though the bbc did remark on its web site that "his polemical knockabout style has ruffled feathers in the u s where the jewish question is notoriously sensitive " "the jewish question" much of what mr aitken recounts will be familiar to readers of disaffected american broadcasting insiders such as bernard goldberg but if in the u s the soi disant msm act in support of the democratic party in britain the bbc has in essence declared itself britains official opposition party and the market cannot correct an entity constitutionally protected from it after a brisk trot through the beebs one sided coverage of europe ireland and the war on terror mr aitken concludes wanly that they need to "hire more journalists from right wing newspapers " that wont happen and it would make little difference if it did the correct answer is to split up the beeb a broadcasting behemoth funded by compulsory levy is unjustifiable in an age of ever multiplying narrowcast niche markets the bbc is the most zealous proponent of a multicultural society except when it comes to a monolithic national broadcaster and even mr aitken cant quite bear to kiss it goodbye mr steyn is the author of "america alone the end of the world as we know it" regnery
