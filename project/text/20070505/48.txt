pursuits books why english isnt as easy as a b c spellbound by james essinger delta pages &# suppose you moved to a country where consumers had to pay for imports from britain in pounds from europe in euros from china in yuan from mexico in pesos and so on you needed a local currency too for products of domestic origin now also suppose that you came across a book that purported to explain what a delightful arrangement this was no place else had half as interesting a monetary system might you not think the author had chosen a tough row to hoe "spellbound the surprising origins and astonishing secrets of english spelling " by james essinger arouses similar skepticism "our marvel and wonder at our heritage as users of the english spelling system " the author writes "have not worn off in years and surely never shall we are destined to be spellbound by english spelling forever " thats one way to look at it its an innocently through rose colored glasses way mr essinger is in love with the history of writing his enthusiasm is contagious when he is discussing say how the stylized pictures of egyptian hieroglyphics are able to represent much more than the things the pictures look like or how farsighted king alfred the great was in promoting anglo saxon writing about a particular translation of alfreds into anglo saxon mr essinger writes charmingly "its one of those pieces of writing that make you realize with completely fresh awareness that history isnt merely some dry formal chronicle of the past but that it consists of the accounts of the lives of real breathing living people who simply happen no longer to be alive " in "spellbound" there is also material more directly relevant to contemporary language for instance mr essinger explains convincingly why our verb inflections are as simple as they are "i speak you speak he speaks " and why our nouns have no grammatical gender when languages intermingle their grammars tend to become simplified for the sake of mutual comprehension middle english was essentially a hybridization of anglo saxon and norman french and in the process of blending the two languages some grammatical elements got stripped away mr essinger is keen on the oddities of our spelling words like "heir " "honest" and "hour" start with "h" because norman french in turn was influenced by classical latin even though the french never sounded the letter they were only too happy to keep writing "h" where the romans had written it "pauper" and "poor" differ because we borrowed "pauper" directly from latin whereas we adapted "poor" from its norman french descendant "povre " we write "drought" and "night" like that because chaucer and his contemporaries pronounced them something like "drocht" and "nicht " and samuel johnson having chosen to base his enormously influential dictionary on a "perusal of our writers" rather than on a consistent spelling system of his own devising has a lot to answer for "i have often been obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom " johnson reported in his preface "thus i write in compliance with a numberless majority convey and inveigh deceit and receipt fancy and phantom " im afraid i dont delight in such quirks the way mr essinger does spelling is the main thing holding our language back from becoming a true global lingua franca among alphabetically written languages english may be the least phonetic on the planet many more people speak it as a second or foreign language than have it as their mother tongue most of them dont give a hoot about the historical and cultural baggage that written english hauls around they just want to do business learning to write any language tends to be harder than speaking it and when you throw in that english words as similar on the page as "bough " "cough " "dough" and "enough" dont even come close to rhyming it seems to me were begging to have our spelling "system" overhauled by tough minded non native speakers mr essinger is dismissive of spelling reform he is right that attempts at comprehensive reform have thus far been failures the ones that use only the letters of our alphabet seem predestined to fail because spoken english contains more than sounds but thats what the symbols of the international phonetic alphabet are for mr essinger thinks that "purely phonetic writing looks absolutely horrendous " well i for one think ipa looks great you know those runic looking pronunciation symbols in dictionaries thats it or a variant thereof the books coverage of subjects i know well can be inexact for example mr essinger says the number of english words is "probably" "in excess of including technical terms " whereas according to the publishers of the oxford english dictionary there are at least "a quarter of a million distinct english words " without including technical terms and "spellbound " which was originally published in britain last year takes much more of a british point of view on spelling than an american one the books language and spelling have been americanized for this edition but a number of cultural references have not so for instance the author writes "we make jokes today about rural people speaking of such very plain things as mangel wurzels in guttural rural accents " we do as i said certain aspects of "spellbound" arouse skepticism ms wallraff writes the word court and word fugitives columns for the atlantic monthly and is the author of three books on language
