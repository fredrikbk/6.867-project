the weekend interview with tzipi livni move over olmert haifa on wednesday tzipi livni gave a press conference calling for ehud olmerts resignation in the wake of the winograd commissions sharp critique of his performance during the lebanon war she also announced she would be challenging him in the kadima party primary elections mr olmert fumed but stopped short of firing the minister of foreign affairs aware of her popularity within the party and striving to keep his government above water many israelis by contrast found ms livnis soft tone and refusal to step down a symptom of political weakness still she is determined to keep alive both kadima and the chances for israeli arab peace amid the political tsunami that washed over israel in the last four days this is something of a feat in an interview given prior to the release of the winograd report which lambasted prime minister olmert defense minister amir peretz and former chief of staff dan halutz ms livni told me why she ought to stay in power she has a peace seeking vision for israels future which she has consistently pursued since her appointment in march and throughout the days of war with lebanon despite current accusations of wishy washiness she is still considered by many voters to be the stuff prime ministers are made of if not now a little later assuming kadima survives ms livni has the distinction of being israels least hated leader widely trusted and considered a spotless and serious stateswoman the president is suspended and faces likely prosecution on rape and both prime minister and finance minister are suspected of corruption ms livnis slate by contrast is glaringly clean a good number of israelis have considered her a viable heir to mr olmert and now in the eye of the storm many of her party members and supporters still do yet the country is on a political roller coaster more than protesters flocked to tel avivs rabin square on thursday calling for messrs olmert and peretz to step down minister livni was not targeted and significantly the rally did not demand new elections the reason is clear benjamin netanyahus likud is poised to win them his support rose to in recent polls but many israelis fear his leadership no less than they despise mr olmerts this concern is echoed by prominent voices world wide germanys foreign minister steinmeyer on behalf of the eu said on thursday that "israels internal crisis must not be allowed to jeopardize the efforts to resuscitate the middle east peace process " if the polling box stays comfortably far ms livni faces four alternative futures mr olmert may survive and oust her he may survive swallow his pride and keep her in the cabinet setting his sights on mending both army and peace process shimon peres could take over if mr olmert is forced to resign or ms livni would take the prime ministerial helm herself the last three options leave ample room for her international vision to push onward this weekend therefore ms livnis views are still deeply relevant to israels future we met in her modest one day a week tel aviv office somewhat slumped after a heavy lunch with eu ambassadors ms livnis energies promptly resurfaced as she recalled addressing a cheering kadima audience she told them she had left likud last year because she couldnt support a political platform dominated by the word "no " "my colleagues and i established kadima because we were sick and tired of likuds political fallacies both ideological and procedural we wanted to spell out what likud knows but due to militant members of its electoral assembly cannot utter the principle of two states for two nations the kadima platform is based on a paper i originally drafted for the likud i took it from my computer deleted the title reaching agreement in likud and typed platform instead " ms livnis document won voters confidence last march scoring a historical victory for the newly founded party shortly after it was deprived of its natural leader ariel sharon ms livni misses him personally and politically "he belonged to a generation of leaders whose commitment to israel and to the jewish people was obvious to the public even when they erred " she told me his heirs by contrast must prove their worth "kadima represents a huge portion of the israeli public that is sitting on the fence between left and right" she says "we must regain its trust " center parties have never done well in this opinionated country but ms livni thinks the middle road will prevail "it is a worldview not a bunch of nondeciders my vision of israeli society and economy is clear and focused " in effect her economic views are consistent with kadimas social minded but essentially free market stance far more urgent for most israelis is her international outlook can she get talks with the palestinians going can she jump start the peace process cashing in on american support while courting a helpful european input will israels strongest female politician since golda meir deliver the goods which all her predecessors golda most of all failed to bring home born in to a seasoned right wing family her father was knesset member for likud tzipora livni trained as a lawyer and worked for mossad married with two children she entered israeli parliament in netanyahus list in and held several ministerial posts under sharon her rise to political stardom was swift and relatively painless her political views shifted from right to center early in the new millennium the longtime hawk who at years old demonstrated against henry kissingers mission to get israel out of the sinai and the golan heights became a supporter of major territorial compromise buttressed by a vital condition that not one palestinian refugee be repatriated into the jewish state as part of the final deal "the establishment of israel" she says "has removed the jewish problem from world agenda a palestinian state must do the same for all palestinians residents of the territories and exiles alike it is the only solution for the refugee problem " can this be anchored in the newly awakened saudi peace initiative ms livni draws a clear demarcation she would give her blessing to the saudi plan in fact she did so from the day it was broached in as long as the palestinian "right of return" is off the agenda "any border disagreement can be solved by negotiation" she says demography is another matter this statement not only matches a near consensus among jewish israelis it also reflects a constitutional credo ms livni and i have met during the lively debates of the public council of the israeli democracy institute a powerful independent think tank drafting a written constitution for the country and closely associated with legislators of all political shades this ambitious project is based on israels self definition as a "jewish and democratic state" though some israelis this writer included would prefer to change the order of the adjectives ms livni is committed to both tags along with "a strong protection of individual rights " put together "these are the israeli values that every immigrant should memorize just like the american values in the u s " not all israelis would agree i retort ms livni thinks that the solid center is on her side so by implication is the political left "the real political fault line runs between those who accept the jewish and democratic principle and such religious groups who demand jewish presence in as much of the land of israel as possible for them each passing day is a net gain for me every decision must substantiate israels dual value vision therefore the land must be divided into two nation states " unlike her former likud friends she chose to face reality avery large palestinian minority within israels final borders would kill off either its jewish or its democratic character a generous territorial compromise is her way to square the ensuing circle this was kadimas initial raison detre before it slalomed into lebanon and corruption charges till recently israel did not officially respond to the saudi peace plan a mistake "we ought to have put our concept on the table years ago " ms livni concedes "by neglecting to do so we lost opportunities of launching a viable process " her tenure at the ministry of foreign affairs is marked by an effort to advertise a clearer israeli stance "there is a pragmatic muslim arab world which conceives iran as the primary threat rather than israel and its west bank settlements the fundamental solution we can offer these countries is based on two equilibriums a palestinian state entailing a non repatriation solution for the palestinian refugees and a border agreement entailing israel dealing with the jewish settlements " the oslo accord negotiated by yitzhak rabins labor led coalition was therefore a dire error "leaving the refugee issue hanging out for separate negotiation is our worst case scenario the two state concept incorporates the solution for the refugees problem israel agrees to a major border compromise in return for a clear international statement about the non return of the refugees we have accomplished this with the bush administration and i have asked for a similar statement from the europeans my interlocutors tell me it makes sense " ms livni is convinced that an independent peaceful palestine is in israels best interest "i want to accomplish a viable palestine it is in our interest because the palestinian nation state would vouchsafe the jewish nation state " are moderate muslims part of the solution "oh yes they are crucial for strengthening the palestinian moderates who are unfortunately weak " in recent months ms livni has publicly called for immediate dialogue on a prospective palestinian state based on a new common denominator iranian shiite ideology is now a shared enemy and middle eastern extremism no longer stems from the israeli palestinian struggle "the camps and the alignments have changed the solution depends on israelis moderate palestinians and pragmatic arabs and muslims working together the two nation state concept is the touchstone of moderation " like many israelis ms livni feels that television is the enemy of peace promoting subtlety "the electronic media does not generate moderation neither al jazeera television nor the internet insofar as it serves al qaeda public opinion has become a tool for extremists and muslim moderates are afraid to speak up " another good reason i tell ms livni to cultivate every bud of european muslim moderation she consents then lashes out against what she calls "attempts to theologize the conflict i cannot solve a religious strife " she says "but i can solve a conflict between nations " the road map is of course a starting point although ms livni regrets its vagueness on the refugee issue territorial compromise furthermore demands mutual flexibility "we must explain mainly to europe that a wholesale return to the border is no magic solution it would bust the dream of a palestinian state because there was no geographical or political connection between gaza and the west bank so amendments would be necessary and both sides would appeal for them i believe in bilateral negotiation " "is europe a helpful member of the peace brokering quartet " i ask most israelis are painfully suspicious of the old continents true feelings toward the jewish state ms livni is quick to praise the eus new presence in the middle east after all the deployment of european forces in lebanon last summer is partly credited to her diplomatic performance "yet israels image among the european public is remote from reality " she adds "european leaders told me they must take their own public opinion and media on board some eu members impatient to move on might soften the conditions imposed on the palestinians and speed the process in the wrong direction if they tell the palestinians they need not recognize israels existence then we are back to " for the german chancellor though ms livni has nothing but praise "angela merkel is a leader with strong values like myself she refuses to accept that one mans terrorist is anothers freedom fighter she has a moral backbone " nothing of the sort can be said of vladimir putin "russia is recently edging away from american positions and from the quartet it aims for independent policies softer on iran accommodating to hamas " a pause and then a small concession to israeli frankness "russias wish to play a different game vis a vis the americans is not helpful " what of the u s after president bush israeli commentators suggest that a democratic white house would pull some carpet from under our feet on this ms livni is the diplomat again "i take the american outlook i have discussed here to be bipartisan " at close quarters ms livni is very much the sharp and likeable sabra gal that middle israel cannot dislike she has genuine and refreshing faith in israeli society and economy the recent corruption investigations are a healthy sign she says norms are changing and a painful cleanup operation would leave the country stronger its ethical standards even higher this utterance is no lip service israelis have good feelers for fakes and ms livnis optimism strikes even her political rivals as authentic asked to comment on the outstanding performance of the israeli economy throughout these years of crisis her face lightens up "this is amazing indeed war in lebanon political dramas and investments keep pouring in i ascribe it to the human quality and originality of a group of israelis our economic policy has remained stable despite the frequent government changes we have not tilted between ideologies but kept a consistent middle path the israeli public grumpy as it is has faith in its economy so do international investors " significantly israels stock exchange did not even blink during this weeks winograd mayhem ms livnis particular strength is the solid optimistic almost old fashioned israeli faith in her moral vision widespread public trust has been her greatest asset ironically her greatest liability is the party she co founded fraught from its infancy by an unending tide of drama ariel sharons stroke mr olmerts lebanese misadventure labors unsuccessful chief as coalition partner the string of probes and investigations and now the winograd showdown if kadima sinks it is hard to see how ms livni will remain afloat if kadima survives however ms livni may yet be called upon to navigate the ship of state through the worlds wildest water course "minister " i asked at her office door "could israeli politics do with a female touch " she started with the usual retort "i didnt enter politics to represent female issues" and so on but then something occurred to her "you know " she said "when talking to women who are foreign ministers not always of course i find fresh angles different thinking our conversations are deeper " and with that we said goodbye ms oz salzberger is the leon liberman chair of modern israel studies at monash university and a senior lecturer in history at the university of haifa
