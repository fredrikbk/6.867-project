after the revolt creating a new ceo a trio of new leaders is quietly redefining the top job a lower profile a shorter leash new york jim mcnerney chief executive of boeing co got his job after harry stonecipher was fired in today he is quick to point out the limits of his own power "im just one of eleven with a point of view " he says referring to his board of directors "i have to depend on my power to persuade " mark hurd who followed carly fiorina as chief executive of hewlett packard co avoids talking as she famously did before her ouster about a vision for the high tech giant "im not a big vision guy " he says "i think it was einstein who said vision without execution is a hallucination " and martin sullivan who succeeded the imperious hank greenberg at american international group after an accounting scandal doesnt mind the fact that he now has to share power with a non executive chairman robert willumstad something his predecessor never would have tolerated "everything has changed " he says these men represent the new post revolutionary generation of power in corporate america they are the products of an unprecedented bout of executive bloodletting the firings of ms fiorina mr greenberg and mr stonecipher which took place within five weeks in february and march of were the leading edge of the spate of ceo sackings that signaled one of the most profound period of corporate change since the s it was the end of the old order now a new breed of ceo is emerging from the wreckage messrs mcnerney hurd and sullivan are helping to forge the template the three men are less powerful than their predecessors they are on shorter leashes more beholden to their boards of directors and more susceptible to the influence of a broad range of outsiders regulators accountants attorneys general hedge fund managers union bosses proxy advisory services trial lawyers public pension funds and nonprofit activists "being a ceo is now not just about financial results " says mr hurd "its about a whole set of other dimensions that are more difficult to quantify and more difficult to control and deal with we have more constituencies more requirements than ever before the pressure is higher and the tenure is shorter " yet these three have been surprisingly successful in turning their diminished positions into solid results in the wake of scandals at enron worldcom and the like public outrage drove a host of legislative regulatory and other changes ceos were put on notice and other players stormed in to fill the breach some business leaders have argued those changes are leading to a weakening of the public corporation and predict a decline in american competitiveness as a result they complain that corporate power has been taken from the ceo and given to a host of other players unworthy of the task labor unions and their allies for instance have used their pension fund power to attack companies that pay high executive salaries witness thursdays close shareholder vote on a measure to give verizon inc shareholders an advisory vote each year on the ceos pay package unions and other activists are also pushing to make it easier to nominate their own candidates to company boards and hedge funds and other investors have challenged companies to disgorge cash or change their strategies as carl icahn will do at mondays annual meeting of motorola inc in addition trial lawyers and attorneys general are making new fortunes and careers out of second guessing business leaders theres a "war against the corporation " complains ex pfizer chief henry mckinnell who was forced out of office in part over complaints about his pay "if i were starting over id probably move to china or india " grouses hank greenberg mr greenberg who was the prototype of the imperial ceo spent three decades building aig from a specialty insurance company into a global powerhouse before being charged by then new york attorney general eliot spitzer with manipulating his companys books mr greenberg and others point to the rapid rise of private equity giant pools of capital that buy up companies and take them out of the public securities markets as a sign of the times "i talk to a lot of senior executives who are ready to do something else " says tom neff u s chairman of the executive search firm spencerstuart "private equity is on their agenda it could drain talent that might be considered for public company ceo jobs " behind all the hand wringing is this fear that the public corporation which was the great wealth generating machine of the th century may be dying a slow death in the st a closer look at how messrs mcnerney sullivan and hurd have handled the job however provides a more upbeat picture at hewlett packard for instance mr hurd put his head down and focused on streamlining the companys organization and then holding managers accountable for results while ms fiorina gave dozens of speeches her last year in the job he has stayed out of the limelight the results are in the numbers earnings per share have nearly doubled in two years time and the companys stock price has gone from &# to &# a share at boeing mr mcnerney has taken a similar approach not changing the companys strategy focusing on doing a better job executing that strategy he moved quickly to settle boeings disputes with the government choosing to pay a higher price up front rather than face a prolonged fight that might lead to a lower settlement later he focused on operations and watched a surge in airline sales that has helped the companys stock rise by in two years at aig mr sullivan is getting the company through the huge legal fallout from from its use of certain insurance products to improve its books he did so without destroying the companys entrepreneurial culture earnings last year stood at &# per share up from the companys stock price has risen slightly to be sure much of that performance can be attributed to timing and luck or to the actions of others or even of their fired predecessors both mr hurd and mr mcnerney for instance have benefited greatly from the failings of their major competitors dell inc and airbus and despite their diminished power the three ceos are still extremely well paid a flash point for some critics after leaving his former job at m co mr mcnerney exercised some &# million in m stock options and boeing agreed to pay him another &# million in restricted stock to make up for payouts that would have been due from m in the future last year each of the three men made roughly &# million in total compensation the three ceos talk freely about concepts like "corporate citizenship" and "social responsibility " but they dont see that as conflicting in any way with good business says mr mcnerney "today good business is generated by good corporate citizenship your stance on the environment your stance on governance your stance on ceo pay " their own conclusion the reports of the demise of the public corporation are greatly exaggerated "more and more people are saying private is good " says mr sullivan "but i certainly dont believe the public company model is broken " ceo sackings were unheard of in the s s and s and used sparingly in the s but in early they suddenly became the business equivalent of the guillotine the tool of choice for advancing the revolution and reining in corporate power the scandals earlier in the decade left ceos weakened and left once sleepy boards of directors on notice that it was their job to take charge two big factors helped drive this change in board behavior one was the rise in executive sessions at which the independent directors of a company could deliberate without the ceo and other managers present this changed the personal dynamics of the board a series of such meetings among hps outside directors held in december and january of and without ms fiorinas knowledge laid the seeds of her demise and mr greenberg was ousted at a hour meeting of the outside directors he had hand picked held in new york while he was aboard his yacht in florida meanwhile a series of court decisions sent a wake up call to directors by demonstrating they could be held financially liable for actions of the company in the past directors had been protected by insurance policies that covered such lawsuits but at enron and worldcom directors were forced to make multi million dollar payments out of their own pockets those judgments came down in the winter of just before ms fiorina mr greenberg and mr stonecipher were fired in the two years since other victims have included top executives at financial powerhouse morgan stanley retailer home depot inc health care giant unitedhealth group inc and three lions of the pharmaceutical industry merck &amp co pfizer inc and bristol myers squibb co ms fiorina once hailed as the most powerful woman in business faced a fractious board at hewlett packard which lost faith in her management style and what directors saw as her arrogant disregard for their opinions mr greenbergs hand picked board of directors turned against him only after aigs accountant refused to sign the companys securities filings so long as he remained at the top mr stonecipher ran afoul of his own ethics campaign at boeing by having an affair with an executive there and showing stunningly poor judgment by sending explicit emails to her during work hours other executives before him had done much the same with minimal consequences but in an emotional board meeting directors asked boeings ethics officer bonnie soodik this question "how can you administer an ethics program for employees if its perceived that your ceo is above the rules " shaking and with tears welling in her eyes ms soodik responded "i cant " today their successors have been forced to redefine their job in the new post revolutionary environment and each has come up with some similar tactics perhaps most surprising is that all three have focused more on ground level operations than on high level strategy the favorite playground of many ceos in the past asked whether he had changed the companys strategy mr hurd responds "well we have one " he says strategy at hp "had become too high level the important thing for us is to be able to take strategy down to where you can seamlessly move from strategy to operations " if the strategy isnt clearly driving operations he says "my argument is that you dont have a strategy " asked whether he had changed aigs strategy mr sullivan answers "in many respects not really " says mr mcnerney "the strategy hasnt changed at all but the devil is in the details " he says for instance he gets weekly briefings on progress of the companys new "im probably a lot more deeply involved than my predecessors were on those things " "execution is the new strategy " says walt shill global managing director of the strategy practice at consulting firm accenture the firm has studied large companies that changed ceos in the past three years and found a tendency among them to shy away from high level strategy discussions and focus on ground level operations "for many years strategy was about determining the future and making big bold moves " mr shill says "now its hands on getting your hands dirty and delivering the results people arent looking to be on the cover of business magazines anymore " "in many ways " he adds "boards are now looking for boring ceos " while that may suit the current environment a challenge for the future is whether these new operations focused ceos can come up with the kind of grand plans that can generate future growth for these giant companies all three men also have made concerted new efforts to show they are good "corporate citizens" in part as a response to pressures from some shareholder activists aig which faced the harshest legal attack set up a board committee to deal with public policy issues headed by richard holbrooke who served as president clintons ambassador to the united nations among other things the board has adopted a new policy on climate change all three also emphasize the importance of transparency in the organization theyve moved away from the closed door backroom decision making that characterized many companies in an earlier era "i think weve opened up the culture a bit internally " says mr mcnerney "were not afraid to talk about things i think what happens in all successful institutions is you begin to believe everything you say to yourself it morphs into a form of arrogance and so youve got to discuss that " since mr mcnerney came aboard boeing has been overtly transparent about briefing reporters and analysts about the progress on the at least once a quarter the top program management holds detailed briefings and at each earnings conference call mr mcnerney fields questions himself he has made it very clear to the troops that he wont tolerate a situation like what occurred at airbus when months after the fact they revealed serious problems with the a that had been known in the ranks but not shared upward like other ceos the three executives still have their complaints with the new environment mr hurd recently fought againsty a measure that would allow outside groups to nominate directors on the hp proxy ballot the measure was filed by the american federation of state county and municipal employees after the hp board became embroiled in a controversy over a leak investigation that included obtaining the private phone records of certain directors employees and reporters " "what im against " he says "is that special interests come in with nominees and that creates a lot of effort and consternation that i dont think the shareholder wants us spending our energy on " reflecting his new approach of working with outside constituents however mr hurd reached out to shareholders and others in his campaign against the measure in march before the annual meeting he wrote a letter to around of hps largest shareholders urging them to vote against the proposal and he personally talked to the top dozen or so shareholders for a half hour or more each at the annual meeting he said he would speak with the h p board about possibly meeting with pension fund sponsors of the proposal the measure was voted down adapted from "revolt in the boardroom the new rules of power in corporate america " by alan murray copyright by alan murray published by collins an imprint of harpercollins publishers used by permission
