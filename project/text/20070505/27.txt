getting a leg up on the competition at jockey college a new kentucky academy trains home grown riders with derby ambitions lexington ky two years ago jason truett was the starting second baseman on his high school team in mckee ky when a teacher said it was time to face facts "you arent going anywhere in baseball " at feet inches tall and pounds mr truett decided to chase a dream that seemed more realistic in september he enrolled in the first class at the new north american racing academy the nations only college degree program focused solely on turning out jockeys students will graduate next year with an associate degree in equine science six of the students including mr truett had never been on a horse "these kids hardly touched a horse in a petting zoo " instructor reid mclellan says part of the kentucky community college system the jockey school here is trying to reverse a trend that will be on display today at the kentucky derby in louisville only nine of the jockeys set to race were born in the u s down from of a decade ago in only three american jockeys ranked among the biggest prize money winners jockey schools are common outside the u s young american riders typically learn by working up a grueling ladder of so called backstretch jobs rising before dawn to clean stalls walk horses and hope for a chance to get in the saddle but that system is a failure says chris mccarron the new schools executive director because many jockeys dont learn proper racing techniques or know enough about horses "if you were to drive fast cars for a few months and then try nascar theyd laugh you out of there " says mr mccarron who retired as a jockey in with wins including two in the derby three years after touching a horse for the first time mr mccarron won races in one season convincing him that professional riding is a teachable skill students progress from sitting still to starting stopping turning loping galloping and all out racing they also get course work intended to help them deal with reporters manage money and prepare for life after racing persuading students to put up with classes that start at in the morning and barn chores that go on late into the afternoon is tough applicants also are told they should weigh no more than pounds with their clothes on some parents react skeptically when told about their kids desire to ride pound thoroughbreds at miles an hour tuition runs about &# for the two year program one mother vicky hoefman of venice fla asked mr mccarron "can you really make a living as a jockey " top riders can earn more than &# million a year before their agents cut but the average u s jockey makes just &# to &# a decent living requires winning a lot of races the seven young men and four young women in the class of looked shaky at first after learning to get on a horse some of the students sat rigidly hoping just not to fall off but after mastering some basics with tamed mustangs they started switching to thoroughbreds in late october each student takes care of two horses their names drawn out of a hat in a drafty white barn students rake hay from stalls and talk soothingly whenever anna roberts a quiet year old from franklinton la brings an apple to eat she shares bites with tux and polo the training horses in barn once had just as much potential as their young riders do many turned out to be misfits or losers the biggest horse a hunter jumper called junior used to crash through jumps "he hates the world " jessica oldham of lexington ky said while brushing ed bowen a brown horse known as eddie in the barn that smacked her with his tail the year old horse used to be trained by todd pletcher who has five kentucky derby entries today it was ridden by edgar prado last years derby winner on barbaro which broke a leg in the preakness and was euthanized in january eddie is remembered mostly for bolting from the paddock before a race in and colliding with a bike rack north american racing academy students ride for about an hour a day after mr mccarron pulls up in his white lexus he writes each days riding assignments on a board marked "wanna be jockey " chewing gum constantly he helps warm up the horses which do laps in the barn before being steered to a nearby track the teachers and students dont talk about it much anymore but fear of falling off a horse is constant everyone has hit the dirt with injuries ranging from a broken ankle to wounded pride mr truett missed a class last month because he was at the emergency room he has had a sprained ankle and a black eye "in the beginning it shakes you up a little " he says now "i feel like this is why god made me feet pounds " mr mccarron usually tells students who have fallen to get back on their horses to toughen the students up the retired hall of fame jockey holds mandatory afternoon workout sessions using a mechanical horse called the equicizer that looks like an oversized spring loaded hobbyhorse one day mr mccarron jerked down on the mane of ms oldhams fake horse "thats a long way to fall aint it " he said eating habits are a source of constant attention at dinner one night corey mongan a former education student from hagerstown md ordered two dozen chicken wings two beers and a slab of chocolate cake "oh my god did you eat all those " the waitress asked he vowed to cut back after his birthday two students have already given up on being jockeys of those remaining brad wilson of burlington ontario is probably the most advanced rider he could get some mounts now if he dropped out the teachers say "im eager to get out there but its soon " he says the promise that mr mccarrons connections will lead to good racing opportunities is a big lure for students to stay until graduation "theyre not all going to make it " says retired jockey steve cauthen who won the triple crown in but even if they wash out as riders he adds the program will give the students a chance at other jobs "in the racing business down the road " before leaving for a two week break timed to the derby the young riders lined up on their mounts bunched together on the track with mr mccarron dispatching them from his radio the students took off as a group for the first time ever he told them to control their speed and make specific maneuvers with the horses mr mclellan held his breath as the horses circled the track breathing hard and sending dirt flying from their hoofs it was still just a practice exercise but everyone there felt for a moment that real racing wasnt so far away "its crazy how well it went " said jackie davis of saratoga springs n y riding instructor aimee knarr responded "its cause you guys are good "
