the move sparked an outcry among the countrys urban secular elites hundreds of thousands of whom took to the streets in protest in istanbul and ankara last sunday it also prompted the countrys strongly secular military to hint that it would step in to prevent mr erdogans ally foreign minister abdullah gul from becoming president that would be a serious mistake says the economist turkeys secular democracy is especially welcome in a big and strategically important country but if turkey has to choose the process of democracy is more important even if it means enduring a "bad ineffective corrupt or mildly islamist" government algerias brutal civil war in the early s which came about after the government annulled the islamist partys electoral victory offers a lesson in what can happen when the popular will is suppressed it is understandable why secular turks would feel uneasy at the prospect of "creeping islamization " but there is little evidence the ruling party would overturn the secular order part of what worries turkeys liberal elites is the migration from rural areas to cities of a new religiously oriented entrepreneurial class their emergence threatens the economic and

turkey say that the prospect of another military coup the armed forces have overthrown several governments in the past seemed remote until recently mr erdogans call for early general elections in july helped to defuse tensions for now but a sudden move by the armed forces cant be ruled out the economist may technology china companies encounter unexpected global hurdles chinese technology companies have sought to become truly global players during the past several years but many of them have found the international marketplace tougher to crack than they expected the difficulties facing chinas technology hopefuls stem in part from poor timing and management missteps says businessweeks bruce einhorn makers of liquid crystal display panels used for computers and tv sets moved into the

innovation trying to zap the problem of dangerous space debris outer space is clogging up with trash and scientists are worried the debris shed from thousands of launches poses a collision hazard for future missions a little garbage could do a lot of damage at high speed the debris is hurtling through earths orbit at five miles per second to tackle the problem engineers have proposed a range of solutions that involve either capturing the flotsam or coaxing it back toward earth where it would burn up in the atmosphere some scientists suggest sending into orbit enormous gel like panels similar to those already used to capture space dust for study alternatively ground based lasers might be used to dislodge objects from orbit some have suggested putting the lasers directly into orbit
