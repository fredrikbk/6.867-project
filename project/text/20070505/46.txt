pursuits books liberated by skepticism the culture wars of the late renaissance by edward muir harvard pages &# finding the roots of opera in the history of science is a task that would daunt even a polymath of renaissance stature yet in "the culture wars of the late renaissance " edward muir plausibly explains how the skepticism taught by a professor at the university of padua in the early th century fostered a musical revolution in neighboring venice and much else besides could art really imitate nature followers of cesare cremonini did not think so elaborating their masters philosophical skepticism into a "profound rhetorical skepticism" that "eroded confidence in artistic norms and rules " cremoninis thinking mr muir shows helped to free up the whole idea of what the arts might do composers and librettists under the influence of cremoninis disciples felt themselves set loose from convention they made a place for "pure voice utterly disconnected from the text of the libretto a practice that led to the musical lyrical and emotional excesses so characteristic of early opera " mr muirs exhibit a is monteverdi specifically "lincoronazione di poppea" a work that is still in the repertory today such iconoclasm wasnt confined to music mr muir claims that cremonini and his friendly rival galileo a fellow padua faculty member "shared a profound skepticism about both received knowledge and the certainty of any claims to absolute truth " cremoninis skepticism was religious too and included doubts about the immortality of the soul his naturalistic philosophy in mr muirs reading implied sexual freedom among much else his followers questioned all sorts of conventions writing books that attacked the authority of the roman catholic church argued for the equality of men and women and celebrated taboo sexual practices such outlandish ideas would have gotten cremonini into huge trouble had he left venetian territory which was galileos mistake but he stayed put when venice chose to expel the jesuits in as part of a larger jurisdictional dispute with the papacy it rid itself of romes most effective agents for the next several decades venice became a haven for skeptics and libertines because of the lagoon citys importance as a commercial and publishing center its rebellion in thought and conduct commanded the attention of all of europe ironically the promiscuity to which the venetian atmosphere gave license was provoked by "one of the most rigid marital regimes known to history " notes mr muir laws against inter class marriage and a desire to keep inheritances intact led aristocratic families to limit the number of their legitimate offspring compelling many of their sons to remain bachelors and their daughters to become nuns by mid century venice was forced to sell titles of nobility to replenish its aristocracy and finance resistance to the turkish threat needing stronger ties with rome it re admitted the jesuits in ushering in a period of cultural conservatism that marked the end of the "renaissance project " mr muir approvingly calls venices skeptical and libertine period a "proto enlightenment " but he gives the defenders of orthodoxy their due he acknowledges that the jesuits were not mere reactionaries but "just as committed to learning and to understanding the implications of aristotle for theology of the new science for biblical authority and of humanism for education " the renaissance progressed in italy and elsewhere by blending skepticism and piety outright free thinking and church guided reason "the two sides " mr muir states "reveal parallel tendencies in western culture " we are undergoing a "culture war" today of course but it is hard to find even a rough correspondence between the renaissance version and our own despite the title of his book mr muir doesnt even try nor should we to do so would require us to compare cesare cremonini with say ward churchill the jesuits of padua with focus on the family and monteverdi with sheryl crow these are not comparisons from which either side in todays battles can draw much consolation mr rocca is an american writer in rome
