desperate heroic missions of world war ii dont apply to iraq however stirring bruce berkowitzs account of the ill equipped torpedo pilots at the battle of midway may be "certified madness " editorial page april it fails in its application to the iraq war for a crucial reason while the u s entered world war ii underprepared and u s navy ensign george gay and others in the armed forces fought in the first years of the war with inferior equipment and training franklin roosevelt and the nations leaders called upon americans to sacrifice and strive in order to close the gap with the axis powers a unified front of war bonds rations and diverted industry supercharged the war effort and turned america into a superpower today george bushs "keep shopping" brand of sacrifice ensures that our soldiers will remain short on the gear and preparation theydeserve as they continue to fight the iraq war michael fee oakland calif mr berkowitzs doubts about legislating a paper trail of military accountability are not supported by the tale of ensign george gay and the ill fated ill trained and ill equipped members of torpedo squadrons eight and six their mission was to sink japanese vessels with torpedoes they failed utterly at that their sortie was launched by desperate commanders in a desperate battle commanders prepared to throw any and every weapon they had at an enemy and it was the right decision the squadrons succeeded as a diversion but that outcome was a inadvertent happy accident a combination of japanese folly and american dumb luck relying on an inept enemy is strategically unwise dumb luck is no tactic hurling ill prepared troops into certain death will not achieve shock awe or victory perry glasser haverhill mass mr berkowitz argues that we would never have won world war ii if we had insisted as rep john murtha does that before being deployed our troops should have all the training and equipment to complete their mission does mr berkowitz or anyone else sincerely believe that the self absorbed grandchildren of tom brokaws "greatest generation" could have won world war ii even if they had been properly trained and equipped to be sure among those grandchildren are quite a few good men and women who have volunteered for military duty and who now stand tall for the rest of america in deployment after deployment with great courage and remarkable dignity alas the overwhelming majority of their fellow citizens the ardent advocates of our foreign wars prominently among them have deftly avoided military service as did a previous generation during vietnam there are not enough patriotic men and women willing to go to iraq or afghanistan in the first place not among the pro war families in the administration not among the civilian leaders of the pentagon not among the intellectual gurus at the american enterprise institute who dream up ever new foreign fields to conquer and not among the thousands of college students who still verbally support the war in iraq but are content to let others fight it mr berkowitz should tell us why it is so rather than attacking the quite reasonable request of a genuine american patriot and warrior rep murtha uwe reinhardt woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs princeton university princeton n j mr berkowitz has it right except for his assertion that john murtha has good intentions his unbridled disdain for president bush has exposed rep murtha as woefully petty in his efforts to undermine the presidents efforts to solve the turmoil we face in iraq and the entire middle east in his nakedly partisan political gamesmanship former marine murtha has all but dishonored the credo "once a marine always a marine " peter j trohatos kettering ohio
