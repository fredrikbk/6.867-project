two big vendors of financial data weigh a merger thomson eyes reuters in move that confirms high interest in sector the race to dominate the global market for business and financial information has kicked into high gear looking to secure their place in an increasingly competitive arena reuters group plc and thomson corp are in detailed talks to combine people familiar with the matter said a deal would be worth more than gbp billion or about &# billion both companies provide sophisticated financial information and analytical tools plus business news to financial institutions and traders world wide their talks come in a week that put the spotlight on the value of business news with news corp s surprise &# billion bid for dow jones &amp co representing among other things an effort by news corp to become a major force in online financial news the burst of takeover activity shows that as more and more general news becomes available free online financial information especially analytical tools to slice and dice bond and stock data remains a lucrative product the customers for it include well heeled wall street traders and big financial institutions among them hedge funds and investment banks and as they increasingly deal in complex financial products such as exotic derivatives their need for real time detailed financial data increases "you can take that information and typically make money off of it whereas you cant really take information about your local school board or your police department and make money " said chris roush director of the carolina business news initiative at the university of north carolina financial information and news is the bulk of the business for reuters as well as for thomson which acquired a newswire just last year reuters shares rose more than friday to pence equal to &# on the london stock exchange after it said it had received a "preliminary approach " it cautioned that there was no certainty it would lead to a bid for the company thomson shares fell to &# thomsons thomson financial division provides data on companies takeovers and the financial markets mainly for investment bankers and wealth management advisers its datastream database has a list of economic statistics reuters provides prices for the foreign exchange bond and stock markets its biggest customers are traders and salesmen in investment banks who use reuters for trading currencies bloomberg lp meanwhile is the worlds most popular source of information about the bond markets in recent years its expanded its stock market and foreign exchange data too the bloomberg email service is widely used by traders to communicate with investors wholl often say "bloomberg me" when they want someone to email them information thomson is strong in the u s where many of its financial and legal products and services have market leading positions reuters is relatively weak in the u s but strong throughout the rest of the world by product thomson has a better reach into money managers hedge funds and other investors reuterss strengths are in providing foreign exchange data to the so called sell side the institutional sales teams at large commercial and investment banks even as the two companies business booms though both reuters and thomson face a classic business dilemma they are mid tier players threatened by the fast growing bloomberg bloomberg and reuters each have roughly a share of the market to provide financial data analytics and news to traders and other investment professionals according to reuters estimates dow jones newswires publishes business news but dow jones no longer provides financial data and analytical tools in direct competition with bloomberg et al dow jones online is a big player online the no financial news and information web site after portals yahoo finance msn money and aol money &amp finance in march unique visitors in the u s went to dow jones sites according to nielsen netratings more detailed financial information has lately become available free on various web sites which also offer stock quotes and some financial modeling tools but they dont offer the sophisticated real time data and analystics of the data terminal business dominated by bloomberg reuters and thomson for instance stock quotes on free web sites are typically delayed by minutes although cnnmoney and other financial sites have been pushing stock exchanges to give them up to the second data for news traders often want to have at least two news wires running on their terminals so they can check another version of the same story this also helps ensure that they see important headlines as quickly as possible "clients need to make snap decisions and reuters and bloomberg compete to get news headlines out first " said jason page head trader for churchill capital a small brokerage firm based in monaco mr page uses a bloomberg terminal but also has access to reuters news "a few seconds can make a huge difference on price " mr page said "its hugely important to watch the news and see how the prices move " reuters was founded in by paul julius reuter who initially sent share prices from paris to london by carrier pigeon although widely known for the reports from its journalists around the world the company makes most of its money from selling data to banks and investors reuters ceo tom glocer has been trying to shift the company into more sophisticated products with higher profit margins aimed at hedge funds and other traders he is a former mergers and acquisition lawyer at davis polk &amp wardwell in new york who took over as reuters ceo in after several years of cutting costs mr glocer has been trying to accelerate revenue growth by taking reuters into new markets such as programs that trade shares automatically reuters estimates that of trading volume on the london stock exchange is now automated on monday reuters launched a product that culls news articles scores them for how positively or negatively they portray companies or industries and then trades stocks based on the rankings selling companies with low scores mr glocer wasnt available for comment following an email he sent to reuters staff friday saying that "reuters has received a proposal from a third party which may lead to a merger acquisition or other transaction involving reuters " to succeed a bid would need to be welcomed by reuters because of its complex share ownership rules any attempt to buy more than of reuters can be vetoed by independent trustees of something called the reuters founders share company the trustees objective according to the firms annual report is to protect the "independence integrity and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of news and information " some other media companies also have arrangements designed to protect their independence such as dow joness two classes of shares some with much more voting power than others thomson corp meanwhile is controlled by the thomson family through its investment company woodbridge co which holds about of thomsons shares thomson was long run by family scion ken thomson one of canadas richest men who died last year at the age of thomson and reuters would be a complementary fit and people familiar with the matter say thomsons approach might not run into resistence from the reuters founders share co the two companies discussed a merger last year but the talks broke off after news of them leaked and neither side had yet committed to combine said people familiar with the situation thomson was once one of the most prominent players in british and canadian media owning the times and sunday times papers in britain and canadas globe and mail newspaper thomson shed the newspapers in the s and s to concentrate on legal medical and financial publishing selling british papers in to news corp the thomson family continues to hold a stake in the globe and mail thomson had abandoned daily journalism altogether until last year when it bought afx news ltd the financial news arm of agence france presse to be its own news service thomson executives said they wanted articles written by their own journalists to prevent customers from turning elsewhere for news including web sites like yahoo which publishes reuters stories in the s thomson representatives sat on the reuters board as clients and shareholders of the reuters news service the companies however no longer have board ties helping spur the current talks is an imminent cash infusion for thomson it is nearing the end of a months long auction of its textbook publishing business final round bids are due in a week valued about &# billion a merger agreement between thomson and reuters could attract attention from antitrust authorities because it would reduce competition there are only three main services of the full financial data analytics that traders want bloomberg reuters thomson bloomberg is the most expensive of the three operating at the highest end of the market the service comes at one price and subscribers get everything bloomberg offers bloomberg accounts are all heavily password protected and some users use a fingerprint reader to gain access to their terminal the subscribers to bloombergs terminals can access financial data online radio and television news and a mix of analytic and trading tools the terminals which years ago were separate clunky machines that sat next to computers today are often no more than software that runs on a regular personal computer new york mayor michael bloomberg a onetime salomon brothers trader founded the closely held firm though he no longer runs it having started off by selling data on bonds it moved quickly into other financial instruments and then built a news service as bloomberg has added services to its terminals unlike competitors it has resisted putting much of its content on its free web site bloomberg "is not for sale and not pursuing acquisitions " a spokeswoman said friday reuters has been trying to move further up from the middle of the market to the higher end its service is runs on microsoft windows operating systems thomson offers its different services a la carte and therefore operates at the bottom of the industry it is also largely geared to more back office functions at schottenfeld group a proprietary trading firm in new york chairman rick schottenfeld said thomson has several helpful market data services he cited streetevents which provides transcripts of quarterly earnings calls and other presentations by executives of public companies as well as first call which repackages wall street research mr schottenfeld said he wasnt happy about the prospect of thomson bidding for reuters because this could take away clients ability to play the two vendors off against each other when negotiating for services although the free web offerings might not eat into the high end of the market they make it possible for financial services companies to reduce the number of terminals they need many banks already have analysts and other employees whose work doesnt depend on real time data share a terminal dow jones online is a big player online the no financial news and information web site after portals yahoo finance msn money and aol money &amp finance in march unique visitors in the u s
