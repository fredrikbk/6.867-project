pursuits classical music fugue for man &amp machine classical musicians have bitterly opposed replacing human players with computers in the orchestra pit now a small group is breaking ranks and arguing that its the best hope for revitalizing the art cue the laptop paul henry smith a conductor who studied as a teen under leonard bernstein hopes to pull off an ambitious performance next year conducting three beethoven symphonies back to back in a live concert "doing beethovens symphonies is how you prove your mettle " he says but mr smiths proof comes with the help of a computerized baton he will use it to lead an "orchestra" with no musicians the product of a computer program designed by a former vienna philharmonic cellist and comprised of over a million recorded notes played by top musicians amid all the troubles facing the classical music world in recent years from declining attendance to budget cuts none has mobilized musicians more than the emergence of computers that can stand in for performers musicians have battled with mixed success to keep them out of orchestra pits in theaters ballets and opera houses now a new alliance of conductors musicians and engineers is taking a counterintuitive stance that embracing the science is actually the best hope for keeping the art form vital and relevant they say recent technological advances mean the music now sounds good enough to be played outside the touring musicals and cirque du soleil shows it is typically associated with among their arguments aspiring composers who couldnt otherwise afford to have their creations performed by an orchestra can now commission a high quality computer generated recording for a fraction of the price for communities facing the loss of their orchestra it could be a way to keep performances in town even if it means a computer stands in for half the players critical to the push are new strides in computerized music the latest software lets users pick from a massive library of digitally stored sounds assemble them into a complete symphony and layer on texture and nuance picture a chef with an infinite variety of ingredients to choose from when creating a four course meal even some experts now find it hard to tell the difference at the request of a wall street journal reporter david liptak chair of the composition department at the eastman school of music listened to a second passage of a beethoven symphony created on a computer as well as three versions recorded by live orchestras on his first try at identifying the computerized version mr liptak guessed wrong he says the difference became clear when he heard a longer clip listen to the four sample passages at wsj com in computerized music sparked a big battle in new yorks broadway theaters musicians went on strike for four days partly because producers had raised the idea of replacing some players with "virtual orchestra" computer programs musicians unions have largely kept virtual orchestras out of broadway orchestra pits but on londons west end they have been used in productions such as "the sound of music" and cameron mackintoshs revival of "les miserables " they have also been used in some u s touring musicals but theres a big difference between theatrical productions where the performers are mostly hidden from view in an orchestra pit and symphony concerts where concertgoers expect to see the musicians front and center so far the technology hasnt been used in traditional orchestra settings although some advocates say it could be used to bring classical music to small towns without resident symphonies computers are also being used in some more experimental classical performances in toronto this fall an audience filled a concert hall to hear bachs "goldberg variations " performed by glenn gould who died more than two decades ago a company called zenph studios mounted the performance with a computer controlled yamaha grand piano that replicated the finger styling of the piano great marin alsop incoming music director of the baltimore symphony orchestra says she supports the technology as a way for composers to get their music heard but doesnt think it should replace working musicians "it can be a great tool for moving up the ladder " she says "but its a slippery slope " headquarters for the high tech music movement is the house in hamden conn where mr smith lives and works as a teenager mr smith spent summers studying under conductors like bernstein at the tanglewood institute and lukas foss at the eastern music festival in greensboro n c he received his bachelors and masters degrees in music from oberlin and brandeis in he took a break from music to launch an internet company and later worked in web development at yale in he bought his first edition of digital orchestration software for about &# and set out to pursue a new career mr smiths studio is set up in a room that used to belong to his year old daughter whos bunking for now with her year old brother a silver keyboard is positioned in front of a computer monitor on his desk to limit street noise and add a listening room for clients mr smith is planning to move the operation to a downstairs studio which holds stacks of old music scores mr smith has used computer programs to record themes for nike and adidas commercials soundtracks for independent films and works by composers he calls his business the fauxharmonic orchestra his main focus now is recreating beethovens symphonies on computer for a planned live performance which he says he may conduct with a controller for the nintendo wii he is making slightly unfinished recordings so that on stage he will be able to interact with the music modulating tempo and emotion he says he has not yet secured a venue but his goal is a fall performance preferably in asia where he says attitudes toward combining technology with high culture are more open at work on beethovens symphony no mr smith starts up a computerized rendition of the piece which hes downloaded free online it sounds roughly like a cellphone ringtone using a mouse he selects a five second snippet of a violas part which begins playing over and over in a loop "this is what annoys everyone in the house " he says with another click he launches a digital library of recorded notes for a single note there can be dozens of inflections to choose from mr smith selects "appassionata legato " or impassioned and smooth the tinny tones are replaced with the sounds of a viola which he tweaks further five minutes have elapsed and he has created five seconds of realistic sounding viola music next hell need to repeat the process for other instruments including the flute oboe and bassoon beethovens seventh includes musical parts performed by as many as players for mr smith this will be a work of art but thats clearly not the view of the person who put an anonymous posting on mr smiths web site "this man is evil this project is evil die in hell " mr smith responds that the advance of computerized music is inevitable and that musicians are better off taking control of it than leaving it in the hands of producers and executives "the genies out of the bottle and you cant just outlaw it " he says he has founded a group called the digital orchestra league aimed at bringing together leaders in virtual music two of the leagues board members are controversial figures in the music world frederick bianchi and david b smith co founders of realtime music solutions their company is the maker of sinfonia a computer system that replaces some live musicians in the pits of cirque du soleil shows teresa marrin nakra another league member is considered a pioneer in digital orchestra technology she is best known for an invention dubbed the "conductors jacket " which she began designing as a ph d student at the massachusetts institute of technology the "jacket" a cyclists jersey embedded with a dozen sensors maps conductors movements and physiology it measures everything from the flexing of a bicep to the electrical conductivity of the conductors skin a gauge of excitement used in lie detectors with the data ms nakra has created software that recognizes these movements and translates them to control a piece of music keith lockhart conductor of the boston pops and the utah symphony has donned the jacket in performances to help gather data he says hes interested to see where the technology will lead but has some reservations about its uses "what makes an orchestra extraordinary is not just one persons creative take on a composition but watching the interaction between musicians and the conductor and each other " he says "thats subtle but once you start removing it from the scene thats when you start forgetting it was there " last year mr lockhart strapped on the jacket for a performance of the overture of mozarts "marriage of figaro " but this time ms nakra also placed sensors on five of the musicians he was conducting as well as audience members the goal was to see how precisely mr lockharts movements matched his players and how the emotional peaks of the music affected them physically ms nakra is still crunching the data the first two minutes of the piece alone fill feet of paper with spiky lines but already she can see points where heart rates raced during passages mozart intended to be loud this is a difficult time for american orchestras their numbers have dropped slightly in recent years to about since nine orchestras have shut down while about five have opened or resumed according to the american symphony orchestra league meanwhile more graduates are filing out of music schools some finding few openings at traditional orchestras are turning to less traditional pursuits from film scoring to marching band music for a budding composer the economics of a virtual orchestra are compelling matthew fields who has a doctorate in composition from the university of michigan but now works as a computer programmer and writes music on the side has spent &# on a professionally produced recording by musicians last year he commissioned a recording from mr smiths fauxharmonic orchestra for his complex six minute work "fireheart " for about &# as a composer getting players interested in his work is essential for building a reputation mr fields says without the recording the piece "would simply be dismissed as unplayable and unworthy of playing " he says music experts and even the biggest advocates of virtual orchestra technology say a trained ear can typically tell computer generated classical music from the real thing daniel kellogg a professor of music composition at the university of colorado at boulder said he had no trouble recognizing a recording made by mr smith as the work of a computer in part because the woodwinds sounded the same every time "there wasnt enough imperfection " he said mr smith says the technology still has limitations but points to its dramatic improvement in recent years and says he expects that it will rapidly become more realistic one of the people most responsible for recent strides in computerized music is herb tucmandl formerly a cellist with the vienna philharmonic he commands a small army of software engineers recording technicians and freelance classical musicians all working on the vienna symphonic library his digital archive of notes and musical patterns a single note a violin playing a c sharp for instance is recorded hundreds of times engineers edit that selection down to a few dozen mr tucmandl pays musicians he knows from the philharmonic as well as other viennese soloists and chamber musicians for the recordings he says it took two years to record the samples for a solo violin spanning three hour sessions for a musician this would seem to be the ultimate conflict of interest helping to build a computer program that could one day eliminate ones own job but johann schodl a year old austrian musician who has recorded trombone euphonium and other horn parts for the library says he doesnt see it as a threat to his livelihood live performing gigs are still relatively abundant in europe mr schodl says he was paid about &# for each three hour recording session for the digital library he adds that he has often made more in a week of recording for the program than he would in a typical week of rehearsals for a european orchestra there have been other benefits too for mr schodl such as mastering the control to emit a perfect note while also quelling the sound of wind from his horn or his tongue "it made me a better player " he says listening test experts judge virtual music we played four samples of beethovens symphony no for two professors of music three were recordings of orchestra performances conducted by roger norrington fritz reiner and david zinman the fourth was created on computer by paul henry smith we asked the professors to guess which was the computer recording the results are below david liptak chairman of composition department eastman school of music rochester n y first guess incorrect picked the live performance conducted by mr norrington as the computer generated recording mr smiths was his second guess verdict mr liptak zeroed in on the "false" tone of the clarinet in mr smiths recording when he heard a longer sample he said that it was easy to catch evidence that it was synthetic stephen croes dean of music technology berklee college of music boston first guess incorrect mr croes also picked mr smiths as his second guess verdict "im not surprised at all that i could be faked out " he said "the modern musician has tools that are so powerful and theyre looking for how to defeat all those giveaways "
