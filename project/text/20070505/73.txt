standing up condi weve never doubted condoleezza rices charms as a diplomat nor her appeal as a dinner companion then again were not islamist theocrats and therein lies a foreign policy lesson ms rice was in egypt this week to attend a regional conference on iraq also present were the foreign ministers of syria and iran the first of whom walid al moallem has been implicated by a u n investigation in the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri but that didnt deter ms rice from parleying with mr moallem privately on thursday leaving one to wonder why the white house bothered to denounce house speaker nancy pelosis visit to damascus last month as a "really bad idea " but the moallem meeting was just an hors doeuvre to ms rices main course a "social" encounter with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki according to press accounts ms rice planned to approach mr mottaki at a diplomatic dinner thursday night after exchanging pleasantries with him earlier in the conference surprise surprise by the time ms rice arrived at the dinner mr mottaki had already left the hall without touching his food on the excuse that hed been offended by the dress of one of the evenings entertainers this isnt the first time a u s effort to engage iran diplomatically has ended in a snub just ask bill clinton at the u n s millennium summit in september the president was scheduled "accidentally" to bump into his iranian counterpart mohammad khatami in the u n hallway but mr khatami never showed up leaving the president of the united states to wander the corridor like a jilted date theres a pattern here contrary to the view that iran is just another "status quo" power seeking to have its interests recognized by the u s the mullahs have consistently rebuffed every american attempt to engage them diplomatically typically mr mottaki took the opportunity of the conference to blame the u s for the "continuation and increase in terrorist attacks in iraq" as if iranian made ieds had nothing to do with that ms rice is trying too hard to negotiate with people who only have contempt for her and america
