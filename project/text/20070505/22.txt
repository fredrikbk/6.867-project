hot topic the new europeans the changing of the guard in europes biggest countries is a chance for the continent to renew itself thats the good news heres the other kind this fresh crop of leaders doesnt look well placed to pull it off new political management will be in place by summer whomever the french elect tomorrow the next president is going to be a younger face tony blair plans to set a date next week to give the keys to downing street to chancellor gordon brown germany and italy chose new leaders in the past months all are different and britain is the one economic standout but this foursome sets the pace in europe france is a good test case its socioeconomic troubles are nothing unusual for old europe from stagnant growth to a debt ridden welfare state to restive underemployed young muslims but the political barriers to tackling these problems are highest in france the presidential election pitting center right nicolas sarkozy against socialist segolene royal might provide a mandate for change according to an ipsos survey on the day of the first round of voting april the three main issues were unemployment purchasing power and economic insecurity in the runoff sego and sarko have proposed very different solutions ms royal would bump up the minimum wage already the highest in the oecd by and spend lavishly on social programs she wants to make life easier for business but the bulk of her program is old school socialism if ms royal is the vision of a reassuring but untenable past mr sarkozy promises an uncertain tumultuous possibly brighter future he mixes free markets and protectionism yet emphasizes "action" and "rupture " the man wants to shake france out of its doldrums the woman to softly nudge even france may be ready at last to abandon statist orthodoxy mr sarkozy got in the first round the highest score for a right wing candidate since and heads into the runoff with a nine point lead in the polls french voters are saying something must truly change but will it germany gives a half reassuring answer the "sick man of europe" a few years back a nickname today applied to france the worlds third largest economy notched a recent high of growth in and saw joblessness last month fall to its lowest level in five years the previous governments limited welfare reforms helped but the real credit goes to germanys private sector global competition free capital flows and the single european currency have forced deutschland ag to go around the politicians and get its act together german companies restructured outsourced aggressively and won wage concessions from unions now the worlds biggest exporter can take better advantage of globalization last year exports grew and investment driving the revival since consumption was up only likewise in italy the private sector bypassed a shambolic state to pull the country out of recession look at the turnaround at fiat europes last watershed election was margaret thatchers in thanks to her and the reagan revolution as well as globalization politicians today matter less in spite of mr browns penchant for stealth taxes and regulations new labours commitment to leave thatcherite reforms in place means that investors have little to fear from the change of leadership in an economically vibrant britain the nordics ireland and spain are all doing well after opening up their economies in recent years alas in the "big three" the pols have a central role to play mainly to undo the policy mistakes of the past whether for lack of conviction or political will theyre falling short content with high approval ratings chancellor angela merkel has shelved her promises of flat taxes the easing of firing restrictions and an overhaul of the health system her one big move was a three point increase in the vat this year showing that continental politicians can still do plenty of damage retail sales are down in the first quarter italys prime minister romano prodi pushed through some deregulation but also a big tax increase frances next president inherits an arguably tougher situation exports and market share abroad are falling and the french outsource less than germans or italians france lags germany on labor and welfare liberalization which along with regulation and high taxes stifles innovation and economic growth capital and skilled workers are moving out of france the campaign may have culminated in a clear left right split but with little room for free market ideas in a telling moment in wednesday nights presidential debate mr sarkozy declared in his concluding statement that his priority was "to protect france from delocalisation " or outsourcing he didnt provide details along the lines of ms royals tax on companies that move operations overseas in france both left and right have pushed statism as well as market reforms when convenient but neither has yet embraced anything even resembling a thatcherite agenda until a political consensus emerges in the big three that competition is the surest route to job creation lower prices and higher wages dont hold your breath for a genuine european economic renaissance
