pursuits food &amp drink eating out crepes on a plane can all business class airlines remake the airplane meal history does not record what orville wright ate if anything in the skies above kitty hawk n c in indeed as someone no more habituated to flying than anyone else back then he probably thought he wouldnt have time for noshing on the first flight it lasted only seconds but thats seconds longer than it takes to eat the nothing most airlines now serve or to reject the pseudo fine meals still offered in business and first class those hollow feasts flaunt napery crystal and real glass salt shakers to make you feel you havent wasted your employers bundle when i checked the price of a last minute flight leaving this weekend british airways was charging roughly &# for the five hours between jfk and heathrow airplanes are basically too cramped to operate true kitchens and the outsourced meals they often buy from airport caterers rarely rise above the level of the fare at a very large political fund raiser in addition the job of feeding cynically vile swill to the europe bound masses abaft does not likely inspire food assemblers in an industrial kitchen on the ground to reach for epicurean heights for an elite few they never meet is this a universal law i have proposed for years that airlines send their quartermasters to zabars or another great deli to learn about first class cold cuts and breads that any flight crew could serve but no one has listened recently i heard about a revolutionary pair of new single class luxury airlines silverjet and rival eos these are two of several new all business class airlines that now cosset small numbers of passengers in jets designed for hundreds more ferrying them between new york and the u k at prices routinely below business class fares on established carriers these gaudy upstarts would have to give good food a serious try wouldnt they to find out i flew silverjet overnight from newark liberty airport to scrappy luton airport outside london and returned to jfk on eos from busy stansted home of hundreds of budget flights to the continent both trans atlantic flights went off without a hitch both airlines lent me portable media centers loaded with movies and other entertainment options i slept in splendid flat bed isolation from other passengers in both directions eos however costs considerably more &# one way or &# round trip compared with silverjets respective fares of &# and &# for more money eos gave me more value fewer passengers compared with silverjets maximum of more completely isolated pods with more luxurious bedding and a friendlier atmosphere but the food was by far eoss biggest plus sophisticated and as close to a good meal on land as i have ever tasted aloft the champagne is taittinger red wines include a bordeaux from the select pauillac district white wines come from very reliable sources benziger in california sauvignon blanc and louis latour in france pouilly fuisse the menu matches them nicely i chose the prawns on eggplant salad with grilled artichokes and pesto as artistically arranged as you could wish well cooked hot fresh tasting the chops from the rack of lamb were big juicy and if not the ideal pink a still tasty medium rare served with a polenta ratatouille "tarte " i could have had a pasta "tris " the currently glamorous threefer of gorgonzola gnocchi spinach ricotta ravioli and penne arrabiata for dessert i chose the apricot crepes with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce i awoke from a hypoglycemia induced nap of several hours just in time to polish off the afternoon tea service a very ample mix of little sandwiches scones clotted cream jam and flaky apple strudel with cinnamon cream life on silverjet was simpler wines were acceptable if routine sangiovese red and chardonnay the entree choices skirted the banal penne helpfully identified as italian and pasta with meatballs in a tomato basil and parmesan sauce helpfully identified as piquant and chicken breast filled with ricotta and spinach with roasted vegetables and a "rich" jus i opted hopefully for the third choice a vegetable version of the great indian rice dish biryani it was eccentrically flavored not unpalatable but somewhere out there in the blue between a real biryani and a risotto with exotic spices the "warm" indian flat bread was a pale and lifeless facsimile of a paratha the cheesecake dessert was poor a dairy derived layer over a thin layer of cakey substance silverjet chief executive lawrence hunt says the airline gets "fantastic feedback" on its food and this summer will bring in a restaurant group from london to add more menu choices sleep came easy especially since overhead lights were off for virtually the entire flight including the meal and gooseneck individual lights defeated my best efforts to illuminate dinner or reading materials breakfast was with the exception of quite drinkable coffee a pathetic experience the so called egg and tomato croissant was the sort of outre concoction that would flop at a mcdonalds i deplaned into utilitarian luton well rested despite the constant temptation to push the massage button on my seat the several hundred dollars extra i paid to get first rate for an airplane food on eos and a marginally better cabin may seem like a lot considering you could easily improve on that silverjet meal for a fraction of that in london or new york but passengers who would normally pay almost double eoss fare to line up with economy passengers on a british airways flight using the same aircraft will not be counting the pennies they might save by choosing silverjets food purgatory and fuller cabin email me at eatingout wsj com
