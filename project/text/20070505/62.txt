pursuits sports golf journal a makeover for the pga to perk up fan interest the tour overhauls its event lineup redoes famed course ponte vedra beach fla the tournament formally known as the players championship played in march and viewed by the pros as a kind of warm up for the masters will henceforth be known simply as "the players" and anchor its own month on the calendar may the first one is next week any similarity between the new name and "the masters" is purely intentional and the pga tour which owns and runs the tournament will probably not object if in an undisciplined moment you happen to say something like "gee its almost like a fifth major " tim finchem the tours commissioner knows he cannot simply wave a wand and decree that the players is a major but he and his compadres are doing everything they can to give the tournament in his words "a masters like aura " they are reducing the number of commercial minutes on the high definition broadcast to four per hour the same as at the masters the new date slots nicely between the masters in april and the u s open in june and the tour has spent an enormous sum more than &# million on improvements to the tpc sawgrass course itself and to build an "iconic" new clubhouse that will loom st andrews like behind the th green "the old clubhouse looked like an upside down spaceship mr finchem told me on a tour of the property three weeks ago "we tried to come up with ways to renovate but finally decided we had to tear it down and start all over " the primary design goal of the new square foot mediterranean revival style structure one of mr finchems vice presidents explained was to create a sense of "instant tradition " during the tournament bagpipers will play at dusk every day from the two faux bell towers in case you havent noticed the pga tour has been doing a lot of reinventing itself this year or "rebranding " as mr finchem is wont to call it it has been a response to lackluster fan interest when tiger woods isnt playing and to the general competition for eyeballs across the entertainment spectrum the most pervasive new wrinkle is the season long fedex cup points race culminating in a four event competition for the fedex cup in august and september which the tour concocted to try to make the golf season more coherent and delay fan defection to football in the fall the tour also entered into an unprecedented year contract with the golf channel a deal tantamount to creating a pga tour television network and it rejiggered the tournament lineup to concentrate the most popular events in the prime golf months the latest addition is a second made for tiger tournament near washington d c just after july it like mr woodss other de facto event the deutsche bank championship over labor day benefits his foundation and thus ensures that he will play all of these innovations have attracted controversy critics tease the tour for its orwellian insistence on tagging everything it can with the fedex cup label and argue that mr woodss power over a trade organization that is supposed to represent all tour pros is excessive compared to all that reworking the players must seem like a refuge for mr finchem and his staff who are headquartered adjacent to tpc sawgrass "we basically ripped up everything and put down a to inch sand cap underneath the whole course " mr finchem said during a golf cart survey of the course a system of pipes was installed under all the greens to control moisture even if it rains next week the course will play firm and fast pete dye who built sawgrass in the late s oversaw the redo but he added only yards most of the work was tweaking a good example is the par five th where formerly about half the field attempted to reach the green on their second shot and only half of those who tried succeeded "we liked that ratio its fair competitively and it creates excitement for the fans " mr finchem said recently however the tours shotlink statistics keeping system revealed that nearly two thirds of the players went for the green in two often with six irons and five irons and of those succeeded so the new th will play yards longer and the tour will monitor where it puts the tees each day to try to revive that old ratio from the th tee we beheld the clubhouse almost complete just as television cameras will during sunday afternoon broadcasts for presumably decades to come those television sightlines are key in fact theres a disneyfied made for tv quality to every aspect of the project from the balustraded "presentation lawn" where the winner will receive his huge cardboard check to the knickered "master storytellers" who will be stationed in the clubhouse lobby during the other weeks of the year and regale visitors with tales of the tournaments legacy one foursome at the course each day will be allowed to pay extra for a "pga tour experience " its members can change shoes in the small locker room reserved augusta like for past players champions lunch in a pga tour members only dining room called pub and stride down the fairways alongside white bibbed caddies bearing the players names on their backs this isnt the way other tournaments became majors but thats the world we live in today and mr finchem and his recently beefed up corps of vice presidents are no slouches if the top pros in the world keep coming to the players it has traditionally attracted the best field in golf and fans get used to seeing high drama play out in front of the clubhouse edifice who knows maybe some other major such as the pga championship will begin to lose luster by comparison and our children or grandchildren will come to think of the players in the same hallowed way we think of the masters majors come and go remember the western open anyone email me at golfjournal wsj com
