how green was my garbage london as they campaigned for midterm regional elections on thursday the biggest issue that british politicians met on doorsteps was a load of rubbish specifically one load of rubbish where before there were two pressed to meet european union targets for reducing landfill volume many local councils now collect refuse only once every two weeks as flies and vermin gather while food scraps achieve a fine perfume residents have grown so enraged that bin men are under repeated physical attack the logic of fortnightly collections if you can follow it is to encourage recycling lest widespread consternation over garbage seem petty fortnightly collections now emblemize a broader source of indignation the u k governments self righteous "green" justifications for reduced services on the one hand and thievery on the other halving the frequency of waste removal conveniently saves money a host of other new "green" measures in the u k will make money &# fines for poorly separated recycling or microchips implanted in wheelie bins to weigh residential refuse dragging britains surveillance culture to a new low and facilitating charges for waste disposal by the kilo furious that they are already paying once for this service through local taxes some householders have ripped the microchips from their bins the premier example of having to pay twice for the same dispensation all under the guise of environmentalism is the british governments proposal to bring in "road pricing " unveiled last december this literal highway robbery would charge motorists up to &# per mile to drive on roads whose construction they had paid for to begin with announcement of the scheme stirred the complacent slow to anger british public to circulate an internet protest petition that secured million signatures and little wonder since the average british commuter travels miles each way a nine to fiver in a built up area would pay &# a day for the privilege of going to work the sunday telegraph calculates that even in moderately populated yorkshire where the first pilot programs are planned road pricing would cost the average family &# a year even more cheerfully decembers advisory report pooh poohed making appreciable investment in public transport nixing an unpleasantly expensive high speed north south rail link during rush hours commuter trains are already stuffed like links of sausage but because "smaller read cheaper projects offer the greatest returns " sir rod eddingtons transport report proposed only to improve signaling lengthen trains and extend railway platforms despite the "sir " this is clearly a man who repairs rips in his suits with duct tape rail travel in the u k is expected to rise another in the next decade presumably the millions of ordinary people priced off the roads will all huddle on those little extensions to their existing platforms environmentalism has become the fashionable fig leaf to cover for extortion if a tax is "green" it is "for the sake of the planet " and fairness doesnt come into it neither apparently does greed hence britains petrol duty the fourth highest in the world at over &# a gallon plus vat levied on both the fuel and the duty in the u k even taxes are taxed has nothing to do with sticky fingers its to confront the all purpose bogeyman of global warming mayor ken livingstone has installed a "congestion charge" for central london at &# per day at inception the charge has risen to &# in three years the area covered by the charge doubled in february mr livingstone further proposes that high carbon emission "band g" vehicles not only suvs but smaller sedans like the ford mondeo be charged instead gbp per day and be excluded from the residents discount thats fifty bucks every weekday if you live or work in the congestion zone or &# a year richmond council has followed suit tripling the cost of parking for band g cars to gbp meaning even outside of central london it will cost close to &# a year to park in front of your own house but thats ok its for the sake of the planet britain pursues monetarily punitive policies to advance environmental goals expediently punitive fiscal policies line treasury coffers they not only disproportionately penalize the less well off and stultify economic growth these fees fines duties and charges lurking on every corner also create a larger social climate of oppression resentment and paranoia lest we imagine that the british government never tries to manipulate its citizenry into being good green campers by perish the thought making something cheaper in his budget for chancellor gordon brown did dangle one carrot above the sticks "zero carbon homes" will henceforth be exempt from "stamp duty " a whopping tax of levied on property sales but mr gordon can afford the largesse journalists have searched out the "zero carbon homes" in the u k guess what there arent any ms shrivers new novel "the post birthday
