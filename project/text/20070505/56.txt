pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece tolstoys heir vasily grossmans life and fate is an unflinching chronicle of the battle of stalingrad anatomy of a classic no people have been put to the tests of suffering the way russians have they have never known anything approaching decent government czars or commissars their leaders have always treated them as if they were a conquered nation even now after the fall of communism things for them remain impressively dreary i not long ago asked a formidable expert on russia whom we were supposed to root for among those contending for power in the country with only thieves thugs and former kgb men seeking leadership he replied there is no one to root for business in other words as usual literature has been the only if of course vastly insufficient russian compensation the barbarity of the nations conditions has somehow produced a great literature studded with magnificent literary subjects from pushkin through solzhenitsyn with gogol turgenev tolstoy goncharov dostoyevsky chekhov mandelstam babel akhmatova pasternak and many others in between great russian novelists and poets have never been in short supply one russian writer who until only recently slipped through my own net is vasily grossman author of a novel called "life and fate " which was written under the direct influence of "war and peace " the first i had heard of this book was six or so months ago from my friend frederic raphael the english novelist and screenwriter a man never given to overstatement "its a masterpiece " he said and upon investigation this assessment turns out to be precisely correct grossman was born in berdichev in the ukraine near kiev and the scene of one of the first large massacres of jews before babi yar the infamous mass execution of jews outside kiev a chemist by training he worked as a mining engineer and then following his instincts and talent became a writer during world war ii he covered was "embedded with" we should say today the russian army on its eastern front his dispatches for the publication known in english as red army were widely read but nowhere more intensely than by stalin who knowing grossman had too much integrity to turn hack was said to have been extremely wary of his ardor for truth telling like isaac babel author of the "red cavalry" stories grossman was a jewish writer with more of a taste than a physique for the military life as a journalist he indulged this taste by educating himself on all aspects of weaponry strategy and tactics he wrote about the great battle of stalingrad and then followed the german army in its retreat reporting on the extermination camps of majdanek and treblinka arriving with the soviet army in berlin he was unblinking in his accounts of wars devastation and horror and turned in the most significant account of the bloodiest battle of the th century the attack upon and defense of stalingrad which cost million russian soldiers and civilians and four million troops of the wehrmacht that battle of stalingrad is at the center of "life and fate " grossman said that the only book he read which he read twice during his time as a journalist was "war and peace " the parallel between napoleons attack on russia through borodino and hitlers attack on russia through stalingrad is obvious in each the fate of europe was at stake in both battles the losses but especially those incurred by the russians were unprecedented on each occasion against all odds russia emerged victorious to attempt a novel modeled on "war and peace" is easy to write one that is unembarrassing by comparison is not far from embarrassing "life and fate" is one of the great novels of the th century the book has more than characters panoramically representing almost all strains of russian life during the nightmarish stalin years various plots and subplots are neatly interwoven with detailed descriptions of battles and penetrating excursuses on totalitarianism on the history of the persecution of the jews "anti semitism " grossman writes "is an expression of lack of talent an inability to win a contest on equal terms" on the evolution of morality and kindness the novel is rich in apercus viktor shtrum one of its central characters is an experimental physicist who claims that "the value of science is the happiness it brings to people " but he also holds that "science today should be entrusted to men of spiritual understanding to prophets and saints but instead its left to chessplayers and scientists " like almost all first order imaginative literature produced in the soviet union the book could not be published there mikhail suslov a powerful member of the politburo said that it was unlikely to be published for another or years history intervened to squash this prediction yet in sad fact grossman who died of stomach cancer did not live to see his great novel in print as tolstoy did in "war and peace " grossman in "life and fate" does not hesitate to bring in historical characters adolf eichmann josef stalin adolf hitler and actual german and russian generals appear in the novels pages an unforgettable two chapters in the middle of the book describe in an all but unbearable yet utterly persuasive way the experience of going to the gas chambers in this novel grossman is able to keep two large balls in the air at all times the conduct of the war and life under the two fascisms german and russian so that throughout the spiritual confrontation of the fragile soul of the individual and the colossus that is the state plays out this confrontation at the heart of "life and fate" is what gives the novel its grandeur "life and fate" is a novel of pages in its american edition translated by robert chandler new york review of books classics over the course of which there are many bitter smiles but no laughs whatsoever a chronicle of the past centurys two evil engines of destruction soviet communism and german fascism the novel is dark yet earns its right to depression but it depresses in the way that all genuinely great art does through an unflinching view of the truth which includes all the awfulness of which human beings are capable and also the splendor to which in crises they can attain a great book a masterpiece "life and fate" is a book only a russian could write mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis
