the week ahead our take on coming events politics as iraq dominates stage economy awaits its turn by gerald f seib barack obama delivers a big speech at the detroit economic club monday raising the question is economics about to join iraq as a big issue in the embryonic presidential campaign simple answer no more complicated answer just wait a while mr obamas speech wont be his big economics statement for the campaign thats likely to come later this year he may well address energy as much as pure economics in the monday address more broadly those involved in the campaign know that iraq is the dominant subject in the national debate and they dont really expect that to change between now and november in the initial republican debate in california on thursday night there were just two questions about taxes and one about the federal budget and seven on the war in iraq and this was a debate held in the presidential library of ronald reagan patron saint of supply side tax cutting so the iraq shadow for now is blotting out economic debate that however cant and wont last one democratic candidate john edwards is essentially building his candidacy on a populist economic platform and its a safe guess that by the end of summer his cohorts will feel compelled to flesh out their economic messages when that happens the most interesting aspect of the campaign dialogue figures to be the new and different form the economics debate takes it wont be the simple tax and spend agenda as in past campaigns this time the very definition of an "economic issue" will be different there will of course still be a debate about tax cuts though its contours may be fairly simple the big question will be whether to extend the bush tax cuts already enacted all republican candidates even sen john mccain who actually voted against those tax cuts when they were passed will favor extending them "the primaries will compel people to lock in on the high income tax cuts as they fight to be the heir of ronald reagan " predicts gene sperling former economic aide to president clinton democrats for their part will be for rolling back many of the bush tax cuts but not the ones that benefit the middle class the great question candidates on both sides will dance around is what they would do to ease the bite of the alternative minimum tax which is a popular idea but one that costs the federal government a huge dollop of lost revenue the more interesting economic questions wont be about taxes and spending though the biggest one may well be are trade and economic globalization helping or hurting america thats the question inevitably raised by mr edwardss populist campaign message the second biggest economic question how can the u s achieve "energy independence" and maybe ease global warming at the same time any democrat willing to endorse a gas tax and finally will there be a real plan to stop the fiscal drain of social security and medicare huge questions and yes the campaign will get to them technology plenty to lose for icahn zander in motorola battle by li yuan motorola inc chairman and chief executive ed zander will find out monday if investors trust him to turn around the telecommunications equipment company without activist investor carl icahn sitting on his board mr icahn who has accumulated a stake in motorola has made the company his latest focus arguing that the weak performance in its handset unit lately reflects poor management shareholders will vote at motorolas annual meeting on whether to grant his wish for a board seat the stakes are high on both sides mr icahn has promised if elected to the board to make sure management meets its benchmarks if not he has said he will ask "hard questions" and even call for mr zanders resignation mr zander has promised that the unprofitable handset division will show a profit for the year it has been hurt by declining margins and motorolas inability to follow up its highly successful razr phone with a popular next generation device even if motorola meets its goals having mr icahn on the motorola board would likely be a headache for mr zander tension between the two has increased in recent weeks mr icahn said in a letter to motorola shareholders that mr zanders reported comment that he "hates" his customers was something "straight out of alice in wonderland " mr zander called mr icahns bid for a board seat a "mere adjunct to his investing activity " as a board member mr icahn would likely take a close look at mr zanders annual compensation and severance plan mr icahn also has plenty to lose

if he fails to get on the board analysts have suggested motorolas stock price could fall to &# to &# from its closing price of &# on friday they say his investment in motorola is part of the reason that the price hasnt fallen further since mid april when the company issued a bleak forecast mr icahns campaign to get on the motorola board is also a test of whether he has succeeded in transforming his image from a feared corporate raider to an activist investor motorola repeatedly has suggested that mr icahn is more interested in short term return than motorolas long term growth in a letter to shareholders friday mr icahn promised "if elected i intend to remain a long term stockholder of motorola " media clear channel heads for vote by sarah mcbride after weeks of delay and a sweetened

financial capabilities or significant advertising or new media experience next some investors are looking for the company to consider strategic changes such as taking on more debt selling assets
