pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations on letting go happy fourth of july to mark this wednesdays holiday i share a small moment that happened a year ago in bay ridge brooklyn i was at a wake for an old family friend named anthony coppola a retired security guard whod been my uncle johnnys best friend from childhood all the old neighborhood people were there from clinton avenue and from other streets in brooklyn and anthonys sisters tessie and angie and gloria invited a priest in to say some prayers about a hundred of us sat in chairs in a little side chapel in the funeral home the priest a jolly young man with a full face and thick black hair said he was new in the parish from south america he made a humorous offhand reference to the fact that he was talking to longtime americans whod been here for ages this made the friends and family of anthony coppola look at each other and smile we were italian irish everything else our parents had been the first americans born here or our grandparents had we had all grown up with two things a burly conviction that we were american and an inner knowledge that we were also something else i think we experienced this as a plus a double gift though i dont remember anyone saying that when anthonys mother or her friend my grandmother talked about italy or ireland they called it "the old country " which suggested there was a new one and that we were new in it but this young priest this new immigrant he looked at us and thought we were from the mayflower as far as he was concerned as far as he could tell we were old yankee stock we were the establishment as the pitcher in "bang the drum slowly" says "this handed me a laugh " this is the way it goes in america you start as the outsider and wind up the insider or at least being viewed as such by the newest outsiders we are a nation of still startling social fluidity anyone can become "american " but they have to want to first it has had me thinking a lot about how people become american i dont know that when my grandfather patrick byrne and his sisters etta and mary jane who had lived on a hardscrabble little farm in donegal on the west coast of ireland felt about america when they got here i dont know if they were "loyal to america " i think they were loyal to their decision to come to america in for a penny in for a pound they had made their decision now they had to prove to themselves it was the right one i remember asking etta what shed heard about america before she got here she said "the streets were paved with gold " all the immigrants of the late th and early th century used that phrase when i was in college in the s i got a semester abroad my junior year and i took a boat from england to ireland and made my way back to donegal this was approximately years after my grandfather and his sisters had left there i met an old man whod been my grandfathers boyhood friend he lived by himself in a shack on a hill and was grateful the cousins id found had sent me to him he told me hed been there the day my grandfather then a young man left he said the lorry came down the lane and stopped for my grandfather and that his father said goodbye he said "go now and never come back to hungry ireland again " my grandfather had his struggles here but never again went home hed cast his lot thats an important point in the immigrant experience when you cast your lot when you make your decision it makes you let go of something and it makes you hold on to something the thing you hold on to is the new country in succeeding generations of your family the holding on becomes a habit and then a patriotism a love you realize america is more than the place where the streets were paved with gold it has history meaning tradition suddenly thats what you treasure a problem with newer immigrants now is that for some its no longer necessary to make the decision they dont always have to cast their lot there are so many ways not to let go of the old country now from choosing to believe that america is only about money to technology that encourages you to stay in constant touch with the land you left to tv stations that broadcast in the old language if youre an immigrant now you dont have to let go which means you dont have to fully join to enmesh your psychic investment in america doesnt have to be full it can be provisional temporary or underdeveloped or not developed at all and this may have implications down the road and i suspect people whose families have been here a long time are concerned about it its one of the reasons so many americans want a pause a stopping of the flow a time for the new ones to settle down and settle in its why they oppose the mischief of the masters of the universe as theyre being called in washington who make believe they cannot close our borders while they claim they can competently micromanage all other aspects of immigration it happens that i know how my grandfathers sister mary jane became an american she left a paper trail she kept a common place book a sort of diary with clippings and mementos she kept it throughout the s when she was still new here i found it after shed died its a big brown book with cardboard covers and delicate pages in the front in the first half there are newspaper clippings about events in ireland and sentimental poems "i am going back to glenties " but about halfway through the content changes there is a newspaper clipping about something called "thanksgiving " there are newspaper photos of parades down fifth avenue and suddenly near the end there are patriotic poems one had this refrain "so its home again and home again america for me my heart is turning home again and there i long to be in the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars " years later when i worked for ronald reagan those words found their way into one of his speeches a nod from me to someone whod made her decision cast her lot and changed my life i think i remember the last time i told that story i think it was to a young mexican american woman who was a speechwriter for bill clinton i think she completely understood god bless our beloved country on the st anniversary of its birth
