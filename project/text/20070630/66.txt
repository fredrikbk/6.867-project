u k bomb plot raises questions agencies failed to pick up any chatter beforehand suspect was held in past britains narrow escape from potentially deadly car bomb attacks underscores gaps in british intelligence nets and points to continued potential islamic terror threats the latest plot uncovered by accident after ambulance workers noticed smoke coming from a car packed with explosives outside a london nightclub comes less than a year after britains last terrorism scare british police launched a nationwide manhunt for an associate of imprisoned al qaeda terrorist dhiren barot according to british law enforcement officials the man whose name wasnt given was arrested at the same time as mr barot in yet released he is believed to have driven one of the cars involved in the plot around britain before arriving in london peter clarke the metropolitan police services top counterterrorism official said police hadnt detected advance tips that such a plot was being planned a concern of u s and european intelligence analysts was the apparent lack of terrorist "chatter " or activity that precedes an attack other british officials talked about a "total intelligence breakdown" that allowed the plot to get to the point where it could have killed and injured many people the car laden with gasoline nails and gas canisters was parked on the haymarket a street near piccadilly circus in londons west end theater and nightclub district later a second car with explosives was found in a police pound after being towed there because of a parking violation "if the device had detonated there could have been significant injury or loss of life " mr clarke said "it is too early to be clear and indeed too early to speculate as to who might be responsible and we are keeping an entirely open mind " the plot bears a striking similarity to "operation rhyme " which was hatched by mr barot also known as abu musa al hindi a leader of an al qaeda terrorist cell that cased new yorks financial district before the attacks his plan involved packing gas cylinders and explosives in limousines that could be detonated in car garages beneath hotels or offices in london and new york mr barot was imprisoned in the united kingdom last november after pleading guilty to conspiracy to murder he has links to al qaeda in pakistan according to law enforcement officials according to police the early suspect has close ties to mr barot the planned attacks came on the third day in office for britains new prime minister gordon brown london has been on high alert to the threat posed by home grown islamic radicals since four of them killed people including themselves during attacks on londons transportation system in july scotland yard has had recent success foiling plots including last summers plan to blow up trans atlantic flights the challenge facing british intelligence is immense because it is attempting to monitor home grown radicals who can link up with international terrorist networks or simply draw inspiration from them former director general of mi britains domestic intelligence operation dame eliza manningham buller said her agency and police must contend with networks with some identified individuals including extremists motivated by perceived grievances against the muslim world by the west in a rare public speech last november british nationals who took part in the plots in and showed minimal signs of radicalism fridays planned attacks left behind crime scenes with lots of evidence police were reviewing footage from the closed circuit video cameras that monitor traffic and pedestrians throughout london as well as potential fingerprint evidence on the car by the nightclub they have recovered a cellphone from one car a person familiar with the situation said the police work started with a lucky coincidence at a m friday in central london a few blocks from piccadilly circus a popular area for tourists an ambulance crew responding to a call happened to notice what looked like smoke coming from a metallic green mercedes parked near a club and restaurant called tiger tiger the crew called the police who found gasoline and nails inside the car and manually disabled the bomb mr clarke said the driver of the car hasnt been found a person familiar with the probe said a man drove recklessly down a street and parked his car at an angle near the club the driver then ran from the scene leaving the car door open later in the day police found similar nails and gasoline in a second car a blue mercedes the two cars "were clearly linked " mr clarke said since the terrorist bombings in london in british security forces have invested heavily in increasing domestic intelligence operations the british have stopped some terrorist plots since the terrorist attacks in the u s in september but security agencies are aware that a significant number of british radicals have traveled to iraq and more recently to somalia to fight and some probably have returned with expertise in conducting urban terror attacks in the u s homeland security secretary michael chertoff said there wasnt an immediate threat to the u s he added that there are no plans to change the u s s threat level the investigation will be run by mr clarke and by mr browns new administration david crawford in berlin and guy chazan and aaron o patrick in london
