pursuits food the best barbecue juicy brisket pulled straight from the pit in texas pulled pork shoulder with crispy browned bits in tennessee and versions rivaling both in boston and new york our food critic goes cross country for the pick of the pits true barbecue is a complex slow method of cooking meat in an enclosed space with low indirect heat and smoke true barbecue emerges from the "pit" still moist and very tender after as many as hours of cooking its flavor is a mix of the smoke the sublimation of fat the caramelization of meat juices spices rubbed on it soaked or injected into it and sauce basted "mopped" over it while it cooks within all this there are endless variations tennessee takes its pulled pork from the shoulder eastern north carolina uses the whole hog and flavors the smoky succulent meat with vinegar sauce and of course texas serves up beef from ribs to brisket to sausage but as i learned on an odyssey in search of americas best barbecue the cuisine is outgrowing its regional origins barbecue joints up north can hold their own against the best below the mason dixon the steamrolling migration of true q is obviously a good thing for diners but its also a radical change for a cuisine thats always been defined by its regional differences two barbecue restaurants miles apart in the south are likely to serve completely different styles sauces and cuts of meat the best northern barbecue restaurants take an anthropologists approach they scrupulously research the authentic methods for carolina pulled pork and texas brisket but then offer them on the same menu the sleeker sophisticated places up north may lack the romance of a trip to a shack in rural alabama or tennessee but they also dont threaten the originals a remarkable number of which show few signs of losing spirit or changing their methods at carls perfect pig bar b que in white bluff tenn i dined on an artful jumble of shoulder shreds punctuated with browned bits of the outside of the meat at kreuz in lockhart texas i devoured juicy beef brisket pulled from the smoker and sliced before my eyes in every region the mutual differences may inspire fierce loyalty but a fundamental essence and fundamental standards link all the multifarious versions of what is at bottom one places version of the same brilliant idea first a word on what barbecue is not barbecue the noun is not something that occurs over direct flame in the open air grilling steaks or chicken or burgers is basically harmless but it doesnt produce true barbecue in the strict sense applied on its native ground to this quintessentially american smokily superb form of meat cookery so those of us who will be barbecuing the verb on our grills on july will not be eating barbecue minutes later all barbecue ought to taste of the smoke given off by the fire it has cooked in and should be juicy despite the long hours of exposure to heat pork ribs should not "whitebone" if you pull two ribs apart with your hands meat should remain on both bones and no bone should show otherwise they are overdone maybe the most important sign of seriously smoked barbecue is that curious pink line that the process leaves behind at the edge of the meat you can easily taste the wood smoke in righteous cue in my first bite of brisket at smittys meat market a short drive from kreuz in lockhart texas that smokiness was so strong it changed my idea forever of what barbecue could be this style of heavily smoked beef may take some getting used to but for me it is the zenith of the q universe that doesnt mean i dont love the pork barbecue that other regions excel in but smittys is a temple of purity a dark brick cave of making with its stark black steel doored smokers and taciturn pitmen who stand in the heat of the post oak logs pull out a piece of brisket and ask you if you want it sliced from the lean or the fatty end i go for the fatty end more juice and dont mind that smittys is really just a specialized meat market for sauce and cutlery you go through a door from the darkness of the pit area to a bright lit concession the transition is something like the shock plato tells us his cave dwellers experienced when they emerged into the sun purists in lockhart eat with their hands and dont mess with sauce im on their side when it comes to sauce but if you cant do without it you cant go wrong in a world where top flight places serve anonymous brews ranging from sweetened ketchup to peppy vinegar and anything in between a book could be written about the cole slaws shredded chopped hot mild vinegar based or mayoed that q joints offer along with tangy baked beans and a half dozen other standbys we particularly loved firecracker corn a highly spiced corn on the cob the classic dessert beyond all others is a vanilla pudding full of banana slices and vanilla wafers see recipe these dishes attached themselves to barbecue late in its history which began before columbus landed arawak indians in the caribbean must have been slow cooking meat on a wood platform because their word for this grill moved into spanish as barbacoa for them as for early settlers smoking meat was a simple and it turned out delicious way to preserve it we owe our country hams and smoked bacon to this principle and in poor rural communities in the south white and black men adapted this into a style of preparing humble meats first in open pits in the ground and later in the enclosed metal "pits" or smokers of today the most fervid celebration of this cuisine occurs every year at the barbecue contests held in hundreds of locations teams of mostly amateur chefs compete against each other for blue ribbons in categories such as whole hog or rub so it seemed reasonable to start my quest at the countrys premiere competition a huge festival on the banks of the mississippi called memphis in may the odd thing about memphis in may is that you cant eat the barbecue the overwhelmingly male teams hang about in their colorful booths minding their techno pits the general public just mills around or pays to go into a special tent where they can ingest limited samples of the contestants output this elitist setup mirrors the larger barbecue world which is starkly divided between the mob and the cognoscenti a paradoxically snobbish rift in a subculture built on a myth of rural simplicity and yall come populism barbecuemania is split between the uninstructed millions who will eat a sparerib no matter where its been and the adepts who love to split bristles over where to find the best "dry" ribs or the tangiest vinegar based sauce at memphis in may i cadged enough meat to conclude that there was plenty of bad cue and some very fine stuff to be had but for those of us outside the contest circuit the real contest is in restaurants where pitmasters test their skills every day for the benefit of everydiner the most famous barbecue venues tend to be big souvenir sauce selling places coasting on their owners fame as contest winners or on raves from the small coterie of barbecue critics i trekked to decatur ala to big bob gibson bar b q a multiple first place winner at memphis in may and found the pulled pork mushy and the much touted sauce underwhelming i had a passable lunch at mike millss th street bar &amp grill in the cheerless southern illinois burg of murphysboro mr mills uses applewood in his smokers which is too mild for my lockhartian taste for post oak the most famous of all barbecue restaurants is arthur bryants in kansas city mo put on the map by calvin trillin who in the s called it "the single best restaurant in the world" in playboy bryants is now a minichain in kansas city i found the barbecue serviceable but unexciting tennessee may qualify as the capital of the most basic kind of barbecue pork shoulder "pulled" or shredded by hand shoulder like other barbecue cuts is not a luxury meat its tough but benefits from the slow braising of the pit at bozos bbq in mason east of memphis you dont need to sauce up the perfect squills of pork shoulder outside this unassuming family operation a lonely whistling freight train rumbles by the bright lights of the high security federal pen next door cast an ominous shadow on the humble former farmhouse within all is good cheer restrained by the confident reserve that comes from knowing you can pull pork so that each strand comes away long and perfect like hanks of moist beige yarn this is the memphis style at its apogee miles out from graceland and all the other sights and sounds of downtown bozos does not serve ribs dont ask for brisket either in this shrine of the shoulder of the sow aficionados know that "barbecue" signifies only one cut of meat from high on the hog for a serious challenge to this fare youd have to head to the raleigh durham airport and scoot down to wilbers in goldsboro n c you are now in whole hog territory vinegar is the basic condiment underlying the pulled pork which wilbers variegates with meat fragments from all up and down the succulent swine you could have this as a sandwich topped with chopped vinegary cole slaw but i prefer the unadorned piggy perfection the southern fried gizzards are also a one and offer a crunchy counterpoint to the silken mildly peppery main event at dillards bar b que in the city of durham they offer a similar if smokier pork in a dandy coleslaw sandwich texas is another state with a high q factor in particular i mean the woodsy hill country surrounding austin the states capital of politics and intellect beef is the main meat here beef ribs and brisket and piquant sausages that mix local german and mexican ideas lockhart is the vatican of this persuasion with its rehabbed turn of the th century downtown this was where we found smittys in a former shiners brewery and kreuz pronounced "krites" and referred to locally as the church of kreuz from there we drove north to oklahoma leos in oklahoma city and oklahoma style bar b q and wilsons in tulsa all offer hickory smoked sliced brisket of very high quality they also serve a regional specialty bar b q bologna segments of lunchmeat sausage smoked as if it were brisket or ribs and a side dish of pickled mixed vegetables then we headed home literally and figuratively to the three cities we have the closest ties to in each of them the menu represented with great fidelity barbecue styles originating elsewhere slows no apostrophe please in detroit where i was born is a treasure house of q eclecticism its ribs were about as good as any we encountered anywhere the east coast grill in cambridge mass is rightly famous for its scholarly re creation of pit barbecue although we think even the first rate eastern north carolina pulled pork relies too much on its excellent vinegary sauce probably because the kitchen thinks its customers wouldnt appreciate the meat on its own and in new york city the cue millennium came to town last month in the form of hill country a very skillful rendition of texas barbecue based directly on kreuz market in lockhart barbecue expert elizabeth karmel consulted on the operation which imports its sausages directly from kreuz and burns post oak in its three smokers the q evangelists behind this barn of a place should think about extending their mission to the barbecue wilderness of los angeles we ate in the local standbys woodys and phillips but found their meats overcooked and undersmoked what tinseltown most needs these days is authentic lockhart brisket followed by a rough and tumble banana pudding from carls perfect pig while we stuffed ourselves this spring with these splendid viands and wiped our hands with pieces of paper toweling torn from vertical rolls standing within convenient reach we kept trying to decide which restaurant would be our pick for champ of the pit barbecue nation in the end because of the dramatic variation of style and content from place to place we began thinking that any of the places weve mentioned favorably so far was tied for first with the rest but if i could only have one meal before being forced to turn vegan i would charter a plane to smittys for a piece of brisket pulled from the pit where have you found great barbecue email me at eatingout wsj com banana pudding  egg yolks  cup sugar  cup flour  cups whole milk  teaspoon
