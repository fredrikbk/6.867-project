pursuits travel asia hong kongs new groove ferraris hot chefs ipos ten years after the handover the city is thriving can it keep up with mainland china hong kong at the recent launch of a hip new japanese restaurant here called zuma the crowd sampled pink cocktails and teriyaki beef hors doeuvres american investment bankers mingled with the fashionable daughters of old hong kong money as well as new faces including the granddaughter of the former chairman of chinas national peoples congress its the very image of modern hong kong a legacy of international sophistication meshed with new monied china they are the reasons why nearly years after hong kongs hand over from british to chinese sovereignty the city is thriving on july many feared china would drag hong kong down more recently the pressing question has been whether hong kong could keep up even today the growing development of shanghai and beijing in particular still threaten to detract from hong kongs pull as a center for business and finance but the territorys ability to defy skeptics says much about the former colonys resilience as the journals bureau chief here and a longtime resident i moved to hong kong because i was attracted by the blend of chinese culture and western urbanity and its defiant cantonese character hong kong was exciting and full of energy but also apprehensive about chinas impending takeover later after the handover the asian financial crisis of the late s and then the sars epidemic of made for a long tough stretch now its a relief to get past the angst last year gdp grew one of the highest growth rates in the developed world and its expected to remain strong this year consumer spending is up and conspicuous consumption is in last year hong kongers bought ferraris up threefold in three years and luxury real estate prices are hitting global records again the london based zuma isnt the only restaurant to set up here celebrity chefs nobu matsuhisa joel robuchon and alain ducasse have all opened outposts theres a fabulous contrast especially on clear days in the sight of gleaming glass and steel office towers and high rise apartment blocks poking up in front of hong kong islands lush mountain backdrop the deep water harbor that originally attracted british attention here in the s today buzzes constantly with the movement of container ships ferries and hydrofoils making new yorks harbor look sleepy in comparison the city is remarkably easy to navigate its cool modern airport is in my experience the worlds most efficient the subway is clean and taxis are inexpensive and abundant its easy to explore the citys markets luxury boutiques and eating scene this place has long excelled at its native cantonese food great and humble since though food from elsewhere in china has grown fashionable as well unlicensed "speakeasy" restaurants serve combustible sichuan dishes spiced with authentic hua jiao peppercorns that numb your tastebuds hong kong does southeast asian food well too thanks in part to returnees from the chinese diaspora who have settled in places like malaysia indonesia and vietnam despite everything its had going for it hong kong has struggled at times to find its role in chinas historic economic transformation many here felt overshadowed by shanghais rebirth as a business and financial center today hong kong not shanghai has emerged as chinas premier financial center and profited by feeding the countrys voracious appetite for capital last year thanks to share sales by two of chinas biggest banks hong kongs stock exchange raised &# billion in ipos more money than new york london or tokyo but shanghai continues to come on strong even after a corruption scandal toppled the citys top official last year efforts this year to build up shanghais share market after a long moratorium on domestic ipos which ended last year is pulling business away from hong kong the financial action and hong kongs quality of life now attracts some of chinas best and brightest among them are year old neil shen an entrepreneur from shanghai who co founded one of chinas biggest online travel companies and a chinese hotel chain mr shen who now runs a venture capital firm keeps his primary home in an exclusive neighborhood on hong kong island mr shen recalls his days as an investment banker in hong kong years ago back then mainland chinese professionals like him were a rarity when he spoke mandarin not the local cantonese dialect he was immediately set apart today mandarin is more commonly used hong kong is "sophisticated compared with shanghai and beijing " he says only four years ago hong kong had hit what many feel was its rock bottom moment that was when the outbreak of the sars virus which killed almost people in the city brought life here to a near standstill "hong kong was really on its knees " says allan zeman a canadian born entrepreneur and long time hong kong resident whose early investments in bars and restaurants helped establish one of the citys main nightlife districts lan kwai fong "somebody needed to light the match to get the confidence burning " it was also a time of huge political unease in hong kong that summer half a million people marched in the streets to protest then chief executive tung chee hwas government and its policies including plans to enact an unpopular antitreason law the law wasnt passed china intervened to help hong kongs economy including loosening restrictions on individual travelers to hong kong from the rest of the country goosing the travel and retail industries walt disney co opened a disneyland here two years ago to tap the market for mainlanders visitors from china like charlotte zhao are now the key clientele for many of hong kongs swankest boutiques "i come to hong kong all the time whenever im bored at shopping in beijing " says the year old politically hong kong has calmed down a bit ten years ago china took over hong kong only after undoing britains last minute attempts to expand the vote and dividing many people here on the subject of democracy seven years later the unpopular mr tung ultimately stepped down after some more street protests and today his successor donald tsang runs the city the political system remains undemocratic mr tsangs toughest challenge may be mapping out a road toward a more open system as hes promised to do but long term hong kongs got a great track record at defying doomsayers if i had to bet id expect people will enjoy sampling the citys buzz another years from now too
