hot topic a cautious right turn a supreme court justice once told us never to underestimate the difference even a single new justice can have on the nine member body we certainly learned that lesson this year the courts first full term with associate justice samuel alito the court has moved notably back to the center but its alleged new "conservatism" is more in temperament than politics you wouldnt know this from the horror masks brandished on the political left which is reacting as if the court had laid waste to a generation of precedents during thursdays democratic debate hosted by black entertainment television hillary rodham clinton claimed the courts decision against using race as the sole basis for assigning slots in magnet schools "turned back the clock on civil rights " the always entertaining people for the american way declared that the courts rulings this year mean that "rights and freedoms americans take for granted stand in peril " sure and the secret roberts alito agenda is to revive plessy v ferguson and restore jim crow such hyperbole is best understood as democratic base mobilization for the election the truth is that the high court went out of its way not to overturn precedents this is in part due to the jump ball jurisprudence of anthony kennedy who found himself on the winning side of all decisions this term on cases involving the regulation of global warming and the death penalty he sided with the liberal bloc in outlawing a late term abortion procedure and on racial preferences he sided with the four conservatives justice kennedy is clearly the courts new swing vote and were not sure even he knows which way hell swing next but incrementalism was also the way of chief justice john roberts sometimes even when justice kennedy would have gone further in federal election commission v wisconsin right to life the chiefs majority opinion shied away from overturning the courts ruling on the constitutionality of campaign finance reform laws in mcconnell v fec that majority was hardly some "super duper precedent" of longstanding yet the chief justice courted the scorn of antonin scalia whose concurrence would have declared the entire rube goldberg structure of the mccain feingold statute to be an unconstitutional abridgement of political speech the chief justices caution we should add is markedly different from the liberal majoritys penchant for overturning precedents when it had the votes in recent years recall lawrence v texas which in overturned bowers v hardwick and created a potential legal framework for gay marriage and roper v simmons which in outlawed the juvenile death penalty and overturned state laws incrementalism has its virtues in that it avoids sharp legal turns but it can also suffer from a splitting of differences that fails to send clear directions to lower courts or public officials in the wake of this weeks race in schools decision for example state and local politicians across the country will now have to parse justice kennedys concurring opinion for guidance such as it provides when will race be too much of a factor in allocating school slots and when will it pass constitutional muster this is a recipe for more litigation and thus more power for judges especially for justice kennedy justice scalia seemed to be alluding to this in his criticism of the chief justices reasoning as "judicial obfuscation" in the campaign finance case the point is one that has long preoccupied him in he wrote a law review article on the importance of clear legal principles in a democracy "much better " he wrote " to have a clear previously enunciated rule that one can point to in explanation of the decision there are times when even a bad rule is better than no rule at all " the good news is that the court did set clearer rules this year on several notable business cases which united justices on both the right and left in solid majorities reining in class action lawsuits employment law and patents in credit suisse first boston v billing earlier this month a seven justice majority dismissed an antitrust claim against investment banks from the days of the hi tech bubble that would have been a tort lawyers dream and in the antitrust case of bell atlantic v twombly seven justices dismissed the idea that the mere suggestion of a conspiracy was enough to bring charges of anti consumer collusion the press is calling these "pro business" rulings but its more accurate to say they were about restoring business confidence in the rule of law and setting limits on the tort bar and activist judges president bush has had a rough second term but on their record so far he made the right choices in picking justices roberts and alito liberal interest groups and their media echoes may shout about a "radical" court and "resegregation " but the new justices ruled very much as they advertised in their confirmation hearings with chief justice roberts relatively more inclined to uphold precedent than justice alito they are precisely the kind of justices that mr bush promised to appoint as a presidential candidate and as such are a vindication of the election campaign if liberals prefer other sorts of justices they are going to have to win at the ballot box
