the weekend interview with rudy giuliani of tax cuts and terror i think the american people in november are going to select the person they think is strongest to defend america against islamic terrorism and it is not going to focus on as some of the media wants it just iraq i think americans are smarter than that " thus did rudy giuliani summarize the rationale for his presidential campaign at a meeting this week with the editorial board of the journal next years election will be about national security not about iraq narrowly defined in an hour long conversation in our offices in lower manhattan the former new york city mayor sat facing away from the view of ground zero below but was very much in the front of his mind a few minutes into the interview he paused midsentence gestured over his shoulder and looked down at his hands "coming down here just fills me with memories " he offered "i cant come here without thinking about what happened that day " mr giuliani has been accused of playing the card for political gain and he did not shy from discussing his role after the terrorist attacks on that day and its effect on his worldview but he defied the caricature of a man who intends to beat the drum all the way to the white house his views on foreign and domestic policy were cogent and delivered with the take it or leave it confidence that is as refreshing to his backers as it is infuriating to his opponents both now and when he was mayor "leadership " he told us "is first figuring out whats right and then explaining it to people as opposed to first having people explain to you whats right and then just saying what they want to hear " mr giuliani is often referred to as a "moderate" republican which is true if it means simply that he doesnt follow the party line on certain issues such as abortion but there is very little else about him that qualifies for the label "i am " he told us "by all objective measures the most fiscally conservative candidate in the race " on domestic policy he says he wants to shrink the governments share of the economy and increase the private sectors tax rates "should be lower" and our health care system ought to be "moved away from the paternalistic model" that we have now this is not big government conservatism george w bush he tells us "was not good on spending " although he adds that congress wasnt very good on spending either "i think that its one of the primary reasons the republicans lost congress in " when it comes to the war on terror "defending america" means "remaining on offense " more particularly it means "using the patriot act electronic surveillance and interrogation techniques that are legal but aggressive " of guantanamo bay he says "i dont think we should close guantanamo " these then are the talking points but in order to discover whether there was more to his national security credentials than merely being "americas mayor" on we pressed him on how a president giuliani would handle a current foreign policy crisis such as iran his answer revealed a discursive style that was on display throughout the meeting and which can only be demonstrated by quoting from his reply at some length he started by explaining how he understands the problem before getting around to how it ought to be handled "well i think that if weve learned any lessons from the history of the th century one of the lessons we should learn is to stop trying to psychoanalyze people and take them at their word "if we had taken hitler at his word stalin at his word i think we would have made much sounder decisions and saved a lot more lives i dont know why we have to think that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad doesnt mean what he says therefore the more cautious prudent way to react to it is he means what he says "the second thing is we shouldnt be surprised that hes emerged in iran iran has been like that since the ayatollah took over so they are an irresponsible regime " with that by way of preamble he answered the question "americas approach should begin with the clear statement that we will not allow him to become a nuclear power and everybody should know that including your allies that thats not a solution american will tolerate because it would be too dangerous for us to put nuclear weapons in the hands of people who say the things he says and have done the things theyve done " ok but its one thing to say we will "not allow" a nuclear iran its another to be prepared to do something about it does not allowing him to become a nuclear power include taking military action against iran if necessary the answer comes quickly "whatever is necessary " so what are the odds that we can avoid military confrontation with iran over its nuclear program "it all depends on their evaluation of the american president if they think that they have an american president thats going to be ambiguous and worry about this stuff kind of a john kerry type who is going to worry what europe thinks theyre going to be more likely to take advantage of it " call it peace through strength "if " on the other hand "they believe that an american president will utilize any steps necessary to stop them from becoming nuclear there is a much better chance that the sanctions will work because you have leverage and in a strange way i think that a much better chance the sanctions will work because our allies or semi allies like russia and china will have an incentive for making them work because they dont want that military action to happen " asked whether he thinks the bush administration is doing enough to address the iranian situation he says he "probably would prefer somewhat stronger language what i really want to know is whats the bottom line and i dont know the answer to that " he argues that in this case making the administrations bottom line public and explicit would help bring the iranians around because they could no longer delude themselves that they might get away with going nuclear without paying a high price so much for iran how does mr giuliani rate the current administrations handling of iraq "the plan for how to stabilize iraq certainly wasnt a good one and then there wasnt a quick enough reaction to the facts on the ground that showed you that it wasnt a good one so i kind of look at that as if you come into office and its still there youve got to try to straighten it out and you have to try to learn from it in the future " hes not a cut and run man in other words the current fashion in iraq war criticism is to say that america cant make any headway unless the iraqis come to a political accommodation with each other so america should step aside until that is accomplished mr giuliani looks at it through the lens of his time as mayor and believes that america has to provide security before anything like a functioning society or government can emerge "maybe having been a mayor i can see some of this better by that i mean if youve got to create a democracy democracy is only a theory that doesnt mean very much when people live in fear i used to say that about crime in new york that the most important civil right is being safe it doesnt matter if you have other civil rights if you cant go out at night so if youre going to create an election in iraq when the infrastructure of that society has crumbled which means people cant go to work people cant go out more people are being killed than used to be the case right in front of you then democracy is a theory down the road but your life has disintegrated i dont think we saw our responsibility clearly enough at the beginning to keep up the infrastructure of iraq " its too soon to ask any candidate what they would do about iraq if elected we know too little about what the state of play will be in january but when asked what his response is to those republicans who are concerned that continuing to support the war will cost them seats in the senate in november his answer is concise "id tell them that getting this right is much more important than winning senate seats " on the home front its no surprise that mr giuliani a law enforcement man for decades believes we need the patriot act the nsa wiretapping program and the rest of the war fighting architecture that has been built up under president bush but when you dig a little deeper mr giuliani a public servant nearly all of his adult life sounds a lot more like the ceo president that george bush was billed as than mr bush has proved to be he seems to think less in terms of "initiatives" than in terms of quantification analysis and information "id want an evaluation about how accurate are we in identifying threats are we accurate can we sit down and do we have on paper the leading groups do we have the primary actors are we evaluating whether our intelligence is improving how effective are we being in finding them " this focus on methods carries more weight coming from mr giuliani because of the results he achieved using it to bring down crime in new york city identify the problem quantify it isolate it and fight it he admits that as a private citizen he doesnt have enough information about how much of this were doing right now but its illustrative of his way of thinking about problems that what he thinks we need are metrics by which to measure all these things likewise on government reform he announced in a speech earlier this week that he would plan to replace only half of the civil servants due to retire over the next decade in his visit to the journals offices he said hed like to see every government agency try to identify ways to be more efficient every year "you task them with sort of like former ge ceo jack welchs approach to always get rid of the bottom you task them every year to find in savings or or its to save money but its also a discipline that has them going to their agency and figure out what is not efficient what isnt working we havent done that since reagan " mr giuliani likes to quantify in place of a platform he has "commitments " which he has printed up on a card they are also on his campaign web site he freely admits that political reality being what it is he would consider it a victory to "achieve seven or eight of them " mr giuliani invoked ronald reagans name repeatedly and always as a model there is an element of political calculation in that mr giuliani is trying to reassure the so called cultural conservatives that if they liked reagan theyll love rudy but can he overcome the perception that hes a culturally liberal pro choice new yorker whos to the left of his own party on a number of issues he says that his differences with the party on cultural issues are "sometimes exaggerated for political purposes " on roe v wade he says astutely "i dont answer that because i wouldnt want a judge to have to answer that i dont consider it a litmus test " but he may give the pro life crowd jitters when he adds "i think a conservative strict constructionist judge could come to either conclusion " he suggests that the real test should be intellectual honesty and to that end he cites d c circuit appeals court judge larry silbermans recent opinion on the second amendment affirming a constitutional right to bear arms this is a nice piece of political turnabout to respond to a question about his stance on abortion by citing favorably the most important pro gun rights decision in recent history to return to the subject at hand we ask him who on the supreme court now meets his standards for intellectual honesty "samuel alito john roberts i would have appointed either one of them " he offers hes said as much before but he continues "antonin scalia clearly does meet the standard and clarence thomas i would have appointed any one of the four of them " speaking of justice mr giuliani has been more circumspect than some of his rivals on whether he would pardon i lewis "scooter" libby and he repeated again that he wouldnt pardon mr libby "right now " on the other hand mr giuliani advanced a pretty good argument that he should never have been tried "perjury has to be material it has to relate to what youre investigating " he offered "if someone goes in front of a grand jury and tells a lie about an insignificant fact its a lie but it isnt perjury theres all kinds of lying that isnt criminal if the investigation is about a non crime when you know who did it how could anything be material to it " that sounds an awful lot like an argument for a pardon even if mr giuliani seems to think the time may not be right theres no denying that mr giulianis campaign is built around the war on terror or as he prefers to call it "the terrorists war on us " he views the election as a turning point in the conflict and naturally thinks hes the man to steer things in the right direction "i think that the president we elect in will determine how long it takes to prevail against the terrorists " mr giuliani says "if you select somebody that is going to go back on defense its going to take a much longer time and there are going to be more casualties if you select a president thats going to remain on offense and even improve on it it isnt going to be easy but its going to mean less casualties faster " its not an easy or comforting message but mr giuliani is not in the comforting business whether its a message the country wants to hear is something the voters will let us know mr carney is a member of the editorial board of the wall street journal a full transcript of the interview will be available on opinionjournal com
