offensive broadside against u n program while we welcome your continued interest in the united nations your june broadside against the u n development programs work in north korea "kims u n buddy " review &amp outlook is wrong and offensive on several counts the truth is that after six months of accusations and allegations no one has produced evidence that undps resources in north korea were used for anything other than legitimate development activities the preliminary external audit of our program confirmed that undps executive board had been informed of undps staffing practices which coincidentally are used by every other international organization and foreign embassy in north korea today on access to projects although very little in north korea is simple or straightforward the audit confirmed that undp did visit its project sites your contention that the auditors were "unable to follow the money trail" is misleading as you well know the may report covered only the first phase of the audit undp provided all documentation requested by the auditors for this first phase and made all relevant personnel available for interview the u n secretary general has called for a second audit phase include field work in pyongyang undp has supported this call if for any reason the auditors are unable to travel to north korea to continue their work undp will bring its remaining records out of the country and deliver them to the auditors when the u s came to undp with concerns about our program in north korea last december both kemal dervis and ad melkert responded immediately as they would with any u n member state they have continued to work constructively with the u s permanent representative to the u n zalmay khalilzad to address outstanding concerns at no time did mr melkert "threaten" any u s official in any way this simply did not occur and the assertion is absurd beyond the political slings and arrows in your editorial you dont even acknowledge that the "staggering &# billion" in u n assistance to north korea over the past years was used among other things to feed millions of starving north koreans the bulk of this went via our colleagues at wfp and unicef who worked to save lives under extremely difficult circumstances your readers might like to know that the same source you cite for u n assistance the u s congressional research service puts americas own spending on aid for north korea in the same period at &# billion a large part of which the u s chose to put through the u n system it seems the u n has not been alone in trying to help the people of north korea u n efforts in the country have kept millions of people alive and have enjoyed wide international support including from the u s david morrison director of communications united nations development program new york
