the beebs bias i experienced a sense of vindication recently when i read that the bbc was about to publish a document admitting a pervasive liberal left bias in its output as this was the theme of my recent book "can we trust the bbc " it seemed i would be able to indulge in a spectacular bout of i told you so ing alas that brief heady moment proved premature for while the report is a careful piece of research it pulls its punches when it comes to bias within its own news and current affairs department where it matters most richard tait chairman of the bbcs "impartiality steering group " point blank denied that there is any bias in its news output the beeb has never been distinguished by a culture of robust self criticism i know this from experience toward the end of my years as a bbc reporter i began writing a series of internal memos first to senior news executives and finally to the bbcs board of governors detailing an entrenched liberal left bias that seriously undermined the bbcs claim to be an impartial news provider referring to well documented incidents i posed several questions why did we keep hiring established left wing pundits but never any journalists with right wing credentials why did we use "right wing" as a yah boo term to mean "anything we dont like" why did we never give u s actions the benefit of the doubt in contrast to our strenuous efforts to be "fair" to britains avowed enemies the reaction was a studied indifference from everyone up the command chain in a way the bbcs attitude makes sense the most important asset for any news organization is credibility it is the mortal fear of "brand contamination" which in the past persuaded bbc executives to keep a lid on any discussion of the organizations failure to live up to its obligations to fairness and impartiality and there has been wide scale failure on every issue of public policy and political controversy the bbcs instincts are to side with the progressive liberal wing of politics the war in iraq opinion within the london newsrooms was overwhelmingly opposed to military action from the start and has never wavered since man made climate change the bbc has jettisoned all semblance of impartiality on the issue it now openly campaigns with a constant stream of scare stories the arab israeli conflict the bbcs sympathies are firmly on the side of the palestinians who having achieved the status of permanent victims escape skeptical examination of their actions and motives the same biases color attitudes on moral issues abortion bbc reportage invariably starts from the premise that it is an unquestioned social good and the company has close links with pro abortion groups like the international planned parenthood federation multiculturalism the bbc enthusiastically embraces a relativism that treats all cultures no matter how backward as equally valid and gives our own democratic traditions no special weight homosexuality the bbc has consistently pushed the agenda of gay rights activists on issues like same sex marriage and the adoption of children by gay couples the reverse of the coin is that the bbc has its own in house pariah groups the "christian right " neocons climate change skeptics "homophobes " george w bush these people will never get the soft interview or helpful publicity the bbc reserves special venom for its portrayal of the superpower little details betray underlying attitudes i once spotted a poster of president bush as hitler in the large shared radio current affairs newsroom no one else seemed to mind this sophomoric but revealing prank a much deeper anti americanism was at work in the reporting of the new orleans hurricane disaster bbc correspondents demonstrated unholy relish in dwelling on the failures in a way they would never have done had the event occurred elsewhere the murder spree at virginia tech this spring was an opportunity for moralizing reports about u s gun laws reporters conveniently forgot that such tragedies happen the world over all these biases arise naturally from the type of organization the bbc is and the sort of people who work there the bbc is a public sector entity paid for by what is essentially a universal poll tax levied on everyone with a television and thus has an instinctive suspicion of the private sector this colors its judgment in debates about for instance public health care and education the general view is that the public sector is always superior at least in intention to the private in terms of staffing bbc editorial people are overwhelmingly university graduates usually in the liberal arts and young the official retirement age is but the ranks of the over s are very thin not surprisingly there is a strong "group think" mechanism at work it is striking how quickly the "bbc position" on any news story emerges i know from personal experience that expressing dissent in bbc editorial meetings can be an intimidating and uncomfortable experience what can be done some argue that the bbc should be scrapped entirely that would be an overreaction and an act of cultural vandalism some of its radio documentaries are excellent its classical music station a national treasure british life would be immeasurably poorer without it in any case the u k needs more not less media competition a british fox news for example would be a welcome development yet the bbcs dominance means it can stifle the competition at birth and the liberal establishment would fight tooth and nail any government that contemplated licensing the likes of fox certainly there are many thinking individuals within the bbc including i believe director general mark thompson who know internal reform is needed the new report deserves at least one cheer from the companys critics as the pack ice may finally be cracking but producing meaningful change will not be easy its difficult to see how altering the bbcs ingrained bias can be achieved without getting rid of some people and hiring others of a different political stripe not the work of an afternoon meanwhile as continued denials of bias show the bbcs instinctive code of omerta keep the debate within the family at all costs is still largely intact the beebs reaction to my own book was telling not a single bbc outlet has seen fit to interview me even though the accusations it contains are serious detailed and sober as a publicly funded body the bbc has a duty to engage with its critics especially on the vitally important issue of impartiality and overall fairness until it does so it will not be prudent to trust the bbc mr aitkens "can we trust the bbc " was published by continuum this year see related letters "letters to the editor an obbligato of bias throbs in background of any bbc broadcast" wsj july
