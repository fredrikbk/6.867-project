pursuits sports golf journal the tours teenyboppers how the new youth movement in womens golf is changing the game as the father of a year old girl im struck how much the field at this weeks u s womens open looks like a gymnastics meet of the competitors in southern pines n c are teenagers and nearly a third are younger than that compares to only five players under in last months mens u s open and as you may have heard one participant is that would be alexis thompson the youngest ever to qualify for the event other competitors include kimberly kim who won last years u s womens amateur at and morgan pressel who earlier this year at became the youngest player to win a womans professional major part of me the crotchety old timer part of me wants to be flabbergasted and maybe even dismissive of all this youth but the truth is that high level golf seems to be something that teenage girls and sub teenage girls are capable of these days and presumably always would have been if theyd had the training self belief and role models that girls these days have the most famous prodigy in the field is michelle wie now who rose to white hot fame four years ago these days her game is a mess she shot in the opening round which raises the question of whether her prodigy ness was legitimate in hindsight perhaps her uniqueness lay more in being ahead of her time as a teenage standout than in her talent per se which based on the number of competitors younger than her at the open this week seems not to have been so exceptional in a sense ms wie along with ms pressel and paula creamer who won her first lpga tournament in the week before her high school graduation are collectively womens golfs version of runner roger bannister once he broke the four minute mile mark in long considered a difficult barrier the feat was quickly duplicated by many others annika sorenstam who ruled for years as the worlds top woman golfer until this spring laid the groundwork for the teenage revolution "annika is attractive and has her charm but her main influence was in how hard she trained above all she was a serious competitive athlete and that model seemed to resonate " says rhonda glenn a noted golf historian who works for the u s golf association "when she played against the men on the pga tour at the colonial in girls everywhere took notice " one of them was lorena ochoa of mexico ms sorenstams successor as the worlds top player who not only trains as hard but also competes in marathons and triathlons and does rock and mountain climbing you can call it the tiger woods effect for girls but the difference is that girls tend to mature physically sooner than boys many by their early or mid teens have attained their full adult stature and close to their full adult strength they are ready for prime time earlier the elite players who make it into events like the u s open often come from blue chip athletic backgrounds both of morgan pressels parents for instance were top college athletes and her uncle aaron krickstein was once the sixth ranked tennis player in the world among the top players in girls amateur golf these days are two of tennis great ivan lendls daughters they also start training hard at a young age ms creamers family moved from california to florida when she was so that she could get full time instruction at the david leadbetter academy ms thompson whose oldest brother nicholas ranks second on the nationwide tour money list is home schooled along with her middle brother so they can travel as needed to tournaments around the country and practice when they are home in coral gables fla on the golf course outside their back door ms thompson by the way shot a credible in the first round at the open but failed to make the cut for weekend play but non elite girls are also showing more interest in golf these days in a generally stagnant golf market the only category that has shown any significant growth in the last few years is under females a magazine called golfer girl has just debuted with features about top young players and golf fashion the competitive scene for girls in places like southern california and florida rivals that for boys all of which possibly bodes for a different type of adult female golfer in the future there is already something of a cultural divide women now in their s or older often think of golf primarily as a social endeavor younger women who are part of the title ix generation and who grew up thinking it was ok even desirable to be a jock are more likely to approach golf for the joy of athletic competition it seems likely that todays girl golfers will be even more like that when they get older email me at golfjournal wsj com
