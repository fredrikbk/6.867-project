green thumb homes going once going auctions are bustling for houses including some historic gems how to keep from getting burned with the real estate market cooling many homes are being hawked by auctioneers the selection of houses for sale often foreclosures or properties that can be tough to value can run the gamut from shotgun shacks to mcmansions and buyers need to do their homework or risk getting stuck with nasty surprises still there can be some deals hiding in the weeds consider damon malicoat years old who bought a bank owned house near warrensburg mo at auction in november after it had been vacant for nearly two years the front yard "grass" reached up to his knees and the basement contained a dead snake he feels like he got a good buy though paying &# for the property

association a trade group up since auctions have been used for years to sell trophy homes and other properties that can be tough to value as well as homes owned by people who are relocating and need to move quickly but much of the recent growth is coming from lenders seeking to unload foreclosed properties and builders and developers looking to move unsold inventory bidders need to do homework or risk overpaying for a property or being saddled with unexpected repairs "are there gems youll be able to pick up out of the dirt yes there are but not at every sale and not with great volume " says stephen martin president of gwent group inc a bloomington ind consulting firm that works with the auction industry unlike in a traditional real estate transaction auction buyers need to do all their due diligence before bidding thats because properties are sold at auction "as is " "there are no contingencies " says craig king of j p king auction co based in gadsden ala that means you cant back out of a deal if you later discover the roof leaks buyers with cold feet risk losing their deposit though some states allow them to back out of an agreement under limited circumstances among the details buyers need to focus on the condition of the property and whether the title is clear homes being sold because the owner is relocating are more likely to be in good condition properties that have been foreclosed on by contrast often need more work either because of vandalism or because the prior owner didnt have the funds to make needed repairs either way buyers need to take a close look "i would tell people to hire an inspector " says bill sheridan of the national auctioneers association homes sold at auction typically are available for inspection before the auction takes place the auction companys web site often includes details such as whether the property carries a home warranty consumers should also ask the auctioneer if theyve made sure the title to the property is clear and if the seller is paying for title insurance other things to ask include whether there are unpaid taxes on the property any easements that would restrict access to it and any deed restrictions that could make it tough to expand or remodel the home overpaying is another risk buyers need to determine ahead of time what similar homes in the area are selling for though that can be tricky in a cooling market where theres plenty of inventory and few sales "the best advice i can give buyers is to get a qualified real estate person who definitely understands market value and how to determine it " says mr martin the auction consultant he suggests bidders hire an agent who specializes in representing buyers some auction houses will pay a real estate agent a commission out of the proceeds of the sale bidders can also get information about recent sales from sources such as zillow com in some cases "auction fever" can produce a higher than expected sales price about of the bank owned
