bear hires lane in bid for credibility after losses at funds savvy risk manager will run marins unit bear stearns cos trying to shore up its reputation as one of wall streets savviest risk managers after massive losses at two of its hedge funds ousted the chief of its money management unit bear named jeffrey lane a veteran wall street executive who once ran money manager neuberger berman llc as chairman and chief executive of bear stearns asset management mr lane years old and a former top executive at lehman brothers holdings inc succeeds richard marin who joined bear in after a post at deutsche bank ag and who was tasked with building bears money management business mr marin had a productive run nearly tripling the units assets under management making some strategic hires and expanding into markets like the middle east he acquired a risk management firm that caters to institutional investors called measurisk but it was also on mr marins watch that a bear hedge fund took on far more borrowed capital than it could ultimately manage making overly shaky bets on risky mortgages in may and june the high grade structured credit enhanced leverage fund which once controlled more than &# billion in investments was forced to sell off billions of dollars worth of assets to pay off creditor debts after its bets on the market for risky or subprime mortgages went bad the funds struggles negatively affected a less leveraged sister entity the high grade structured credit fund which sold assets to raise cash for the enhanced fund at a time when it too was grappling with margin calls or lender requests for additional cash or collateral fund manager ralph cioffi has been relieved of his position as the funds day to day manager but is staying on as an adviser to help sort out how to pay off the leveraged funds remaining margin calls mr marin resigned his post late thursday but will stay on as a senior adviser to the company bear executives are hoping that mr lane will restore credibility to the wall street firms &# billion asset management business the two funds debts have been drastically reduced in recent weeks thanks in part to a &# billion loan from bear to the less leveraged fund but investors in the enhanced fund are almost certain to lose their money say people close to the situation and the damage done to the asset management units brand could take months or even years to repair meantime the firm is facing an informal securities and exchange commission probe and angry investors the bad bets by the bear funds have been particularly troublesome for bear because it viewed the money management business as important to the companys future growth although bears money management effort is dwarfed by those of goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley and credit suisse group the firm has of late been ramping up the year old division bear has invested in the unit by hiring several experienced money managers and pushing into markets such as israel and saudi arabia investment banks often find the relatively steady performance of money management units to be a helpful bulwark against the sharper ups and downs of businesses like banking and trading the rehabilitation effort will now fall to mr lane a wall street veteran who began his career as a securities analyst and later oversaw the money management business both at smith barney now a unit of citigroup inc and at neuberger an old line asset manager with a history of catering to wealthy individuals after lehman bought neuberger for &# billion late in mr lane ran that firms wealth and asset management division as well until being snapped up by bear he was a vice chairman at lehman in an interview friday mr lane said that turning around the money management unit would be a slow but steady process "its like painting the verrazano bridge " he said "you start painting and you keep going " mr lane was selected by bear co president warren spector who oversees the firms sales trading prime brokerage and asset management divisions mr spector called mr lane early in the week to discuss the possibility of coming on board to help turn around the firms asset management unit according to someone with knowledge of their conversation in a series of meetings over the past few days at bears madison avenue offices the two executives mapped out a set of objectives for fixing the business this person said bears executives have had mr lane on their radar for some time mr spector for one is a social acquaintance and occasional doubles tennis buddy and about five years ago bear approached neuberger about a possible acquisition that didnt go through paving the way for lehmans purchase in october in a gathering of about senior money management executives friday mr lane joked that bear stearns had saved billions of dollars by bringing on neubergers former chairman rather than the company itself "bear stearns just saved &# billion by hiring me " he told the crowd helping mr lane will be tom marano who heads bears mortgage business but has stepped in to personally oversee the stabilization of the high grade funds in mr cioffis place mr marano runs what is arguably bears most important business unit a leader in the world of bond trading bear has long been known for its large market share in the packaging of home loans into new securities and related products and the trading of those instruments both have been booming businesses in recent years mr marano called mr spector at home about a week ago and volunteered to help out says a person with knowledge of the call mr marano didnt return a call for comment
