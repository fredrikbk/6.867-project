cross country yankee ingenuity hartford conn new england is supposed to be liberal territory massachusetts recently elected a democratic governor democrats control both houses of the legislature in new hampshire for the first time in more than years overall in the region there is only one republican member of the u s house of representatives chris shays of connecticut so what chance does an anti tax ad campaign have in the nutmeg state it turns out quite a lot in april the yankee institute launched an ad campaign explaining that connecticut only enacted its income tax in but that job creation in the state has since been at a virtual standstill and that anyone interested in learning more should log onto our web site www yankeeinstitute org our ads went up in two places first we rented a digital billboard facing the state capitol we wanted legislators to see it second we put up posters in rail stations serving commuters headed to new york city we know a lot of displaced new yorkers move to connecticut because they want more house for their dollar and because they want to pay less in taxes and we suspected that many of these commuters have been quietly disgruntled over growing tax bills in their new home state this year moreover republican gov jodi rell has proposed hiking the states income tax by to from to raise money for hartford and other city school districts and one idea kicking around the legislature was to create a new higher tax bracket for "the wealthy " in this case a income tax on top income earners something those commuters to new york city would probably love the governments apparently limitless appetite for higher taxes comes at a time when the rainy day fund is topped out and the state is enjoying a &# million surplus we didnt expect what happened next our web site saw a significant jump in new viewers many of whom were apparently reading two studies we put up on the site one runs through the states anemic job growth from to over the same period the nation as a whole grew private sector jobs by the other chronicles all the rosy promises made by politicians as they pushed to create the states income tax many nutmegers may not remembers this but in those favoring an income tax hike promised that it would bring in sufficient money for public schools take the heat off of property taxes and not endanger the states position as the "switzerland of new england " none of that seems to have happened many towns seem to be more pinched for school funding now then they were before the income tax was imposed when factoring in inflation and population growth within days of our ads going up and they are still up the institute started receiving requests to take our message onto talk radio and television at the same time a very small minority of republicans in the state assembly led by rep lawrence f cafero from norwalk realized that now was their moment to make a run against the tax and spend politicians in the legislature they designed a no tax increase budget that polled better than either ms rells original tax hike or the democrat majoritys budget which included the tax hike on the "wealthy" republicans even began meeting in secret to express displeasure with ms rells leadership by the end of may two months into our campaign ms rell backed away from her own tax hike in early june the legislative session ended without an agreement on the states budget a special negotiating session between gov rell and legislators has just ended and it contains no increase in the states income tax something thought impossible just months ago our experience challenges a widely held belief that it is difficult to have a political impact by taking a serious complex argument to the general public by combining the old sound bite media of billboards and posters with a sophisticated web site the yankee institute did precisely that and for a fraction of what it would cost to buy broadcast time the most interesting assumption we tested with our campaign however is the notion that the northeast is hopelessly and with the exception of new hampshire solidly liberal what were finding is that even rank and file democrats arent happy to pay more to get less in government services given a choice between dumping more money into a failing public school system or enacting cost effective reforms like charter schools and merit pay for teachers voters arent likely to throw good money after bad perhaps thats one reason why the number of local taxpayer groups has doubled in connecticut over the past four years and in an increasing number of cities and towns voters are rejecting budgets when they come up for a vote the states advisory commission on intergovernmental relations found that the number of towns able to pass budgets by the beginning of the fiscal year was "the fewest number" since it started tracking such things this year the number of budgets failing town referenda is on track to set a new record luke finnestad who lives in milford conn spotted the yankee institute poster at the train station in bridgeport and immediately thought of the industry that city has lost its fitting he told us that he should spot the poster there bridgeport in fairfield county was once a part of connecticuts "gold coast " he said its not a gleaming city anymore however because the state as mr finnestad noted has one of the "highest tax rates in the country " hes not the only one who has noticed mr andrews is the executive director of the yankee institute mr gressel is a member of its board of directors
