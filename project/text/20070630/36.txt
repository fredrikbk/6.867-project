pursuits books melody makers a fans notes on the golden age of american songwriting the house that george built by wilfrid sheed random house pages &# so many opera stars and aging rockers are riffling through the great american songbook these days that its only a matter of time before renee fleming and rod stewart record a duet of "side by side " wilfrid sheeds more expert review of the popular music standards of the first half of the th century and the mostly men who composed them is thus especially welcome in "the house that george built with a little help from irving cole and a crew of about fifty " mr sheed shuffles anecdotes and opinions about songs and songwriters as if they were so many bubblegum cards alec wilders "american popular song " published years ago remains definitive but mr sheed offers an engaging addendum writing for fellow fans rather than for neophytes who might want to learn where harold arlen was born buffalo or when mr sheed likens his book to a "great bull session in the sky" and acknowledges that it has "overtones of the tall story and the overconfident assertion " some of mr sheeds assertions are whoppers when he writes that "mark twain was the first completely original american sound to reach foreign ears and ragtime was the second " hes forgetting blackface minstrelsy and stephen foster when he claims that the great american songbook "constitutes far and away our greatest contribution to the worlds art supply in the so called american century " hes ignoring jazz hollywood movies abstract expressionism and rock n roll mr sheed praises jerome kern and oscar hammersteins "all the things you are" a "singers song" confessing that he has "never heard a purely instrumental version of it " thats a pity renditions by dave brubeck erroll garner dizzie gillespie stephane grappelli art pepper oscar peterson and art tatum might have been a revelation and though he dismisses the plot and dialogue of kern and hammersteins "show boat" as old fashioned and unreal audiences at the opening might not have shared that view showcased only months after the devastating great mississippi flood "old man river" had a distinctly contemporary resonance moreover the subplot in which julie dozier and steve baker run afoul of mississippis miscegenation laws was all too timely the same year that the supreme court upheld the racial segregation of the states public schools but when mr sheed warms to his subjects "the house that george built" glows with insight and affection contrasting the voices and songs of hoagy carmichael and harold arlen he observes "unlike hoagy whose singing can be extremely artful and sly arlens is shatteringly direct and what it sounds like is something close to clinical depression warring with a stoical vitality and at times a curious impishness cant go on say the words everything i have is gone but the tune seems to add like samuel beckett himself ill go on " jimmy van heusen might have been famously devoted to "broads booze songs and sinatra " but mr sheed uncovers and celebrates not just the artistry but also the heroism behind the lounge lizard facade the composer of "darn that dream" with eddie delange and "high hopes" with sammy cahn risked his life test piloting lockheed aircraft four mornings a week during world war ii mr sheeds chapters are character sketches as well as musical appreciations when a songwriters personality leaves him cold his consideration of the music can be baffled or begrudging he doesnt cotton to the work of tightly wrapped "our crowd" german jews like kern and richard rodgers and he is contemptuous of hammerstein he lambastes the suburban sound of rodgers and hammersteins s musicals as a betrayal of broadways urbanity mr sheed greatly prefers the company of composers fresh off the boat from eastern europe irving berlin george gershwin arlen or the train from the american hinterland carmichael johnny mercer cole porter he delights in tracing the mutual admiration between the odd couple of berlin and porter both of whom achieved greatness by discovering "the other " for berlin who was rumored to hide "a little black boy" in his piano the other was african american syncopation for porter the preppie from peru ind it was "little jewish songs " gradually "the house that george built" shifts ground as broadway songwriters followed the money to hollywood mr sheed inveighs against the prejudice "that all the great songs began on broadway " he describes how fred astaire brought out the best in berlin "top hat" and kern "swing time" and devotes a fond chapter to harry warren likening the new york that warren nostalgically evoked in his songs for the film "nd street" to the dublin that james joyce depicted in exile there is pathos in his account of hollywoods diminishing returns as musicals dwindled and lavishly talented writers found themselves competing for a single title tune or theme song today of course the hollywood musical is extinct while the popularity of revivals and "jukebox musicals" has put the original broadway musical on the endangered genre list mr sheed casts much of the blame on the greasy kids stuff of rock n roll though after half a century carole king and gerry goffins "will you love me tomorrow" is as much a standard as rodgers and lorenz harts "my funny valentine " there are many volumes in the great american songbook but mr sheeds heart belongs to only one mr emerson is the author of "always magic in the air the bomp and brilliance of the brill building era "
