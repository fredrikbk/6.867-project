pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink as polynesian as nixon in the spring of major league knuckleballer jim bouton was struggling to get his pitches across the plate the knuckler is a tricky pitch it bobs at the mercy of the tiniest turbulence and weaves at a mere fillip of a breeze making it hard to hit and even harder to throw for an honest to goodness strike after walking a few too many batters for the short lived seattle pilots mr bouton found himself sent down to the minors he might have been discouraged if he hadnt spent one of his first weeks in aaa ball in hawaii playing the islanders and drinking mai tais "if a guys home team was hawaii and he was called up to the big leagues he might well decide he didnt want to go " mr bouton recalled in "ball four " his first volume of memoirs there was tasty saimin noodle soup in the bullpen and beaches for lounging on when not at the ballpark but best of all were the island beverages "ive been poisoned by mai tais twice and sunburned once in the past two days " for a week in hawaii he pitched relief day after day and got save after save mr bouton marveled that "im throwing the knuckleball for strikes im almost feeling sorry for the hitters " and then he wondered at his new found success "could all this be due to the sun and the mai tais " i suspect that if mr bouton had been in hawaii for longer than that one week stand a regular regime of mai tai poisoning would have proved less than salubrious for his career the pitcher himself seemed to recognize as much describing the mai tai as "a hawaiian drink brewed by the evil gods of the volcanoes and no fit potion for a clean cut american boy like me " mr boutons belief that the mai tai is a traditional hawaiian quaff is a common enough misconception a decade after "trader" vic bergeron invented the drink at his original oakland calif restaurant he was hired to spread his tiki drink gospel to hawaii putting together cocktail menus for the best hotels on waikiki including the royal hawaiian a generation of tourists first encountered the drink in honolulu and assumed it was native to the islands this aggrieved trader vic no end but it was his own fault a result of his effort to keep secret the recipes to his most successful drinks when he published his "bartenders guide" in pseudo polynesian concoctions were strangely underrepresented in its pages in there was the honi honi rum apricot brandy and lemon juice the huapala rum gin lemon juice and grenadine tahitian rum punch too many ingredients to list and even such franchise essentials as scorpion punch and the fog cutter but no mai tai no wonder the mai tai is so widely misconstrued and misconstructed given the drinks island association and its orangey color no few bartenders reverse engineering the mai tai have assumed that it is made of various tropical fruit juices mango pineapple papaya spiked with rum plenty of bartending books have repeated the error and many also include such mistaken ingredients as apricot brandy it wasnt until decades later that bergeron set the record straight annoyed that various pretenders continued to come forward with bogus claims of having invented the mai tai in trader vic penned a long and overdue documentation of the drinks origin he had whipped it up one night in in a fit of experimentation and tried it out on a couple of friends visiting from tahiti they tasted the concoction and according to bergeron one declared it "mai tai roa ae in tahitian this means out of this world the best " the drink that elicited such an enthusiastic reaction was made of aged rum fresh lime juice orange curacao and an almond flavored french syrup called orgeat pronounced or zhah oddly the mai tai was the favorite drink of richard nixon a man who though sorely lacking in beach bum credentials found solace in the traders tiki fantasy land the washington trader vics was in the basement of what was then the statler hilton just a couple of blocks from the white house the president took his wife there for valentines day in the vietnam war had been declared over and it would be a few months yet before the senate would begin its watergate hearings nixon took the opportunity to enjoy a mai tai or two and in a clumsy effort at bonhomie he backslapped his way out of the restaurant stopping at a crowded table where a fresh round of mai tais had just been served nixon laughingly delivered a warning "theyre lethal " the mai tai became something of the official drink of the nixon presidency much to the consternation of some when pat nixon would visit trader vics with her husband she stuck to jack daniels nor was daniel patrick moynihan a fan u s ambassador to the united nations moynihan would often fly down to washington to meet with the president and henry kissinger after a week jousting with the perfidious turtle bay crowd one such evening after being stuck on the laguardia tarmac for hours moynihan found himself in an endless kissinger confab after a while moynihan realized he could use a drink "i told henry id love a brandy " the ambassador recalled to a writer for the new york times magazine "he sent his girl out to look for something " it seems she went looking at trader vics "she came back in about minutes with some mai tai that awful chinese drink which i had" and you can just imagine the look on his face as he said it "in a plastic mug " i share moynihans aversion to the plastic mug but not his opinion of the drink itself the mai tai is one of the simplest and most sophisticated of the fruity
