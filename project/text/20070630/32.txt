on message china launches public response to safety outcry shift in tactics shows greater sophistication learning how to lobby china is showing the first signs of fighting back against an avalanche of criticism and new restrictions based on safety concerns about its exports but beijings task is made more difficult by both its awkwardness in the public relations game and the increasingly hostile political environment in washington beijings campaign illustrates how worried the chinese are that the "made in china" label not be tarnished further by the controversies over the safety of its products in the first four months of the year china shipped more than &# billion of goods or about of its total exports to the u s making the american export market a key plank in the countrys overall economic strategy now the uproar in the u s over tainted chinese imports which began earlier this year with a scare over pet food and has since involved toothpaste car tires toys and seafood has the potential to merge with tensions over the u s trade deficit with china and complicate attempts to resolve the countries differences in response the chinese government reacted at first with defiance and denial it charged that u s authorities were exaggerating the risks even suggesting that american authorities may be playing up the dangers to fan a backlash against chinas imports because of trade disputes between the two nations but this week china shifted course by acknowledging problems and cracking down on errant factories of which were shuttered at the same time the chinese government began to push back in more sophisticated and nuanced ways both in beijing and in washington in washington chinas team of diplomats bulked up in recent years has been making almost daily trips to capitol hill to try to tamp down growing food safety concerns and to push back against proposed legislation to pressure beijing over its trade surplus with the u s chinese diplomats also have begun briefing reporters and distributing fact sheets to try to argue that tainted chinese products represent only a tiny portion of the countrys sales to the u s and that the risks shouldnt be overblown "in certain quarters people are trying to create a panic about chinese products " a senior chinese official said thursday during an unusual discussion with a small group of reporters chinese officials used the occasion to pass around a three page fact sheet entitled "chinese food exports are safe " the paper stated that last year the food and drug administration turned away less than of the food shipments sent to the u s from china a figure it said was slightly less than the chinese refusal rate last year of food shipments from the u s "the quality rate of chinese food exports are above " the report said the paper also urged the u s and other countries to "treat chinese food exports in a scientific and fair manner" and not blow "certain isolated cases out of proportion to mislead the public into thinking that all food from china is unsafe " in beijing one of chinas early responses came from li yuanping a director general with the chinese agency that sets food safety standards for imports and exports but as the crisis has mounted china has increasingly acknowledged that its regulatory problems are systemic the head of chinas food and drug administration imprisoned for taking bribes that lead to faulty medicines was sentenced to death day after day chinas officials began to come out with pledges to overhaul its food safety system in closing food plants this week china said the facilities had been caught putting industrial additives into a range of food products after an investigation that found food safety infractions "these are not isolated cases " han yi director of the administrations quality control and inspection department said at a news conference according to a report in the state run china daily newspaper the uproar is particularly sensitive to the chinese because it is unfolding just a year before beijing is set to host the olympics and while china is spending billions of dollars on soaring stadiums it is irksome issues such as food safety that are proving harder to solve there are serious concerns about how to keep the food the athletes eat free from contamination scott kronick president of wpp group plcs ogilvy pr in china who has worked in china for years says the recent direct chinese responses are a significant departure from the past previously chinas government was notorious for closing itself off to the world major world events would pass without comment for days from the foreign ministry "ten years ago they would have never commented on these things " mr kronick said "and now in some cases they have even surprised people with their response " mr kronick has been brought in occasionally to give advice to chinese officials which observers say is the governments preferred way to seek advice from western firms he says china is much more responsive of criticisms than it has ever been "there is always this debate has china integrated into the world i think that has kind of passed the train has kind of left the station china cares more than ever about its reputation in the world today " still chinas ability to respond to the current wave of controversy is hampered by its overall inexperience at managing public perceptions in a world of instant communications as one example its embassy in washington actually had posted a document responding to the food safety questions on its web site earlier in the week but the missive went widely unnoted for two days until it was called to reporters attention on thursday chinese officials in washington have also passed along information first distributed to chinese reporters in beijing earlier this month that u s regulators now say was erroneous chinas main safety body the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine has claimed that an obscure fda regulation condoned the use of a poisonous ingredient diethylene glycol in toothpaste the citation ran in hundreds of chinese news stories but the cited rule actually approves the use of a widely used ingredient polyethylene glycol not the toxic additive found in some chinese toothpaste "they got the chemical wrong " said one fda official long regarded as one of washingtons most defensive and least sophisticated diplomatic teams the chinese have made strides in recent years on the lobbying front though they still lag far behind the savvier operations of other countries ambassador zhou wenzhong has crisscrossed the country often visiting rural parts of the u s to talk up china and its products chinas squad of congressional liaisons now numbers more than diplomats but beijing perhaps to its peril has largely avoided spending money on big lobbying and public relations firms and chinese officials say that practice isnt likely to change during the current furor its main contract with the washington law firm of patton boggs llc is for &# a month a tiny fraction of what countries such as israel or even chinas much smaller rival taiwan spend the current u s chinese tensions over export safety escalated significantly on thursday when the fda announced it would block five major types of chinese seafood at the border unless they are proven free of illegal antibiotics and chemicals the announcement came as both the fda and china already are under growing fire from congressional democrats on product safety last month the house energy and commerce committee started asking the agency about food safety problems posed by seafood imported from china democrats welcomed the fdas sweeping action on chinese seafood but were also quick to criticize it as too little too late "while i am pleased that the fda realizes the danger these asian and chinese seafood imports pose to the american people and the public health i am concerned that it requires congressional prodding of the fda to take the steps necessary to keep american consumers safe " said rep bart stupak the michigan democrat who heads the investigations subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee others also are demanding answers two of the fdas staunchest critics rep rosa l delauro of connecticut and sen richard durbin of illinois have been criticizing the fdas slow response for what they see as long running problems in food safety and chinese imports "todays announcement reaffirms that made in china is rapidly becoming a warning label for american consumers " mr durbin said thursday both democrats are pushing the bush administration to establish a legally binding agreement on food safety with china which would hold the chinese government and exporters accountable for contamination in april in the wake of a massive recall of pet food contaminated with the chemical melamine from china the two sought and were granted a meeting with ambassador zhou they later announced that they secured a commitment from the chinese government and the fda that they would "work toward a mutual agreement" to improve inspections and overall safety of food and drugs "significant work remains to address the deceptive labeling unsanitary conditions and the intentional contamination of food products that have become commonplace in china " ms delauro said at the time one of the dangers here is that the sniping over export safety could escalate into a mini trade war between the u s and china with tit for tat actions and retaliations in a particularly worrisome development for western companies that do business in china beijing has started rejecting certain u s goods that it says fail chinas own safety standards earlier this month chinas food safety agency turned away health supplements and raisins imported from the u s this week chinese inspectors said they seized shipments of orange pulp and dried apricots from the u s that contained "excessive bacteria mildew and sulfur dioxide " according to the state run xinhua news agency "the ultimate danger is that china will embark on an overt or understood trade war and close its markets and say these countries are unfairly criticizing us " says gene grabowski senior vice president of levick strategic communications which counsels food and consumer product companies on these issues "the danger is that we could force china into an island mentality " jane zhang and brody mullins contributed to this article
