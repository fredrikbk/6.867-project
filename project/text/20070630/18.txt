from the vietnam war a dire lesson for iraq in response to brendan miniters june editorial page essay "vietnams dark years" the objective history of u s participation in the vietnam war clearly states that our overt military presence hence our "military efforts to stop the communist takeover " ended in march as agreed by treaty for which the principal negotiators won the nobel peace prize over the course of the next two years south vietnam defended itself against repeated attempts by north vietnam to undermine its government and defeat its army of the republic of vietnam by late the north could see that piecemeal efforts would never defeat the south which was growing stronger with time even with ever diminishing u s supplies accordingly with the full support of the u s s r and the peoples republic of china the north planned and executed beginning in january a full scale three pronged invasion again violating the peace treaty as well as the neutrality of laos and cambodia at first the south stood its ground even as the u s congress refused assistance ammunition spare parts and as the treaty required full u s reinforcements however under intense pressure in the ii corps sector the south vietnamese began a planned "phased withdrawal under pressure" in order to get to more defensible terrain this maneuver perhaps the most difficult of all tactical military actions collapsed the north realizing that saigon was the center of gravity rushed past the arvn units to its west and accepted the surrender of the republic of vietnam government thus ending the war spring two full years after the u s military withdrawal why is this relevant well the facts are relevant for their own sake also the history lessons learned from the experience in vietnam should not be based on the false notion that we were militarily defeated they should acknowledge that we reneged further if we had stayed as we did in western europe japan and south korea then south vietnam would not have experienced its "dark years" and a million "boat people" would not have taken to sea and neither would we have experienced the cambodian killing fields regarding the testimony of john kerry he took an oath before congress to "tell the truth " instead he repeated secondhand "information" as though he had firsthand knowledge his testimony was replete with assertion opinion and exaggeration to say the least the kerry quote mr miniter cited "we found most people didnt even know the difference between communism and democracy" is particularly inane yet it was cleverly crafted for political sound bite effect other statements mr kerry made regarding criminal acts allegations without any personal knowledge or evidence are both infamous and contemptible i agree with mr miniter that we must not abandon iraq we can and must defeat the "insurgency" and help develop conditions under which the iraqi people can prosper in peace while it is deplorable that we abandoned the south vietnamese and cambodians the communist threat to our security was successfully deterred and eventually the u s s r unraveled today russia and the prc are economically interdependent with the rest of the world and there is the potential for continued peaceful interaction such is not the case with the current enemy in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere against these nihilistic forces we have no viable deterrent instead we are engaged in a global war on all fronts political economic and military the war will go on for many years unless we quit as we did in vietnam if we do in far less than years we may be haunted by much more than the "loss" of iraq patrick a toffler col ret u s army hewitt n j
