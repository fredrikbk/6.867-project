the week ahead our take on coming events film industry how transformers performs may show a changed paramount by merissa marr paramount pictures rolls out steven spielbergs latest movie "transformers" monday marking a milestone in the studios turnaround based on the hasbro inc toys of the same name the film has all the makings of a summer blockbuster dazzling special effects thundering action sequences and a rising male star that has teenage girls squealing in their seats costing &# million a trifle compared with the big summer sequels such as "spider man" and "pirates " at &# million plus apiece "transformers" has the potential to be a money spinner for viacom inc s paramount the movie stars a relatively cheap cast although producer mr spielberg and director michael bay will likely take a chunk of any profits scoring a hit with "transformers" would leave no doubt paramounts decision to pay &# billion for mr spielbergs dreamworks skg has had its own transformational effects dreamworks has become the engine driving the once ailing studio churning out hits like "blades of glory " "norbit" and "disturbia " this year alone still paramount chief executive brad grey has work left to do integrating dreamworks into the paramount empire has been a bigger headache than expected with the new team determined to keep autonomy mr grey believes "whatever hiccups and bumps" they experienced have passed and "dreamworks has performed brilliantly " mr grey bought dreamworks just over a year ago to help speed his turnaround it gave him breathing room to revive the studios specialty arm paramount vantage which scored early hits with "babel" and "an inconvenient truth " he also brought in a list filmmakers such as martin scorsese and brad pitt and set up a new international distribution network but while dreamworks and paramount vantage have been earning their supper the core paramount label is taking longer releases this year including "zodiac" and "freedom writers " were critically acclaimed but did modest business mr grey points to next years slate as the turning point the line up includes a new installment of "indiana jones " directed by mr spielberg and a new beginning for "star trek " indeed movie franchises are something paramount needs badly as sony corp has with "spider man" or warner bros has with "harry potter " "transformers" is likely to fall into that category says mr grey paramount has been careful to position "transformers" as not just for kids they may have done too good a job the studio got into hot water during the week with the campaign for a commercial free childhood which complained to the federal trade commission that ads and toys tied to the pg movie are being aimed at kids as young as two to make the most of the july th week paramount moved up the movies release two days giving it a clear run before "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " its main rivals will be walt disney co s "ratatouille" and twentieth century foxs "die hard" sequel "live free or die hard " still the summer has proved brutal and unpredictable movies like disneys "pirates" and "shrek " distributed by paramount found their domestic performance stunted by fierce competition politics fallouts just begun from immigration bills failure by john harwood john mccain heads to iraq next week to celebrate july by helping to swear in re enlisting soldiers after the political fire he endured in americas immigration debate that may feel like a backyard barbecue the arizona senator stands as the most obvious loser from washingtons botched attempt to overhaul the immigration laws once the front runner for the republican presidential nomination mr mccain has seen his poll numbers dwindle as conservative activists cried "amnesty" over the bipartisan legislation he co sponsored that offered a path to citizenship for people here illegally his campaign blames fallout over the issue for contributing to his lagging fund raising yet the measures defeat at least provides mr mccain some respite from the issue as he works the primary campaign trail over the next few months for the other immigration debate losers the problems have only begun one of them is president bush virtually every major domestic priority of his second term has now come to naught no new immigration policy no social security solution no tax system overhaul continued trade expansion remains highly vulnerable and defections within his own party on iraq reached new levels even before the immigration fight had ended of course mr bushs political clout has long been draining away and he will never be on the ballot again that isnt true however of democratic congressional leaders they represent the third big loser democrats won both houses of congress in the elections in part by arguing that republicans were incompetent to govern on immigration they enjoyed a comparatively united party and cooperation from a republican white house more than any other factor heat from the right killed the bill but voters elect congressional majorities to solve problems and democratic incumbents can expect to pay some price every time they fail but that fallout almost certainly will pale alongside the damage to future republican presidential candidates hispanics represent the fastest growing chunk of the u s electorate their choices help drive the rising swing states of presidential politics colorado nevada arizona and new mexico mr bush and adviser karl rove had built their long term political strategy around honoring hispanics aspirations and courting their support with notable success in and those voters have now heard loud expressions of alarm from the republican right about their presence in the u s that echoes what they heard from california gov pete wilson in which benefited mr wilson in the short term but has damaged the party in the golden state ever since the immigration debate also exacerbates the split between republican social and economic conservatives the former won the legislative debate the latter in industries such as agriculture construction and tourism that employ a lot of undocumented people are left to face the rising heat but no path toward legalization for workers the american economy plainly cant do without mr mccain may now get a break from the encounters that have lately haunted his campaign journey with residents of states such as iowa voicing fear about changes immigrants have brought to their small town culture but for whoever wins the republican nomination the path to the white house has almost certainly grown steeper health should insurance be mandatory by laurie mcginley with the debate over the nations health care system heating up and getting stoked by michael moores "sicko" a contentious question has emerged should everyone be required to have health insurance as drivers are compelled to have auto insurance massachusettss answer yes under the bay states sweeping health overhaul law pressed by republican former gov mitt romney most adults are required to have health insurance by tomorrow while massachusetts was the first state to pose an "individual mandate " its unlikely to be the last in california gov arnold schwarzenegger is pushing an individual insurance requirement as part of a health care overhaul democratic leaders are balking democratic gov edward rendell has proposed it in his "prescription for pennsylvania " and several other states are considering it "its very much on the table " says alan weil executive director of the national academy for state health policy a nonprofit based in portland maine "politically it has become a mainstream concept " still he says it gets a "funny mix" of reactions creating splits on left and right democratic presidential contender john edwards proposed it in his health plan sen hillary clinton is expected to as well illinois sen barack obamas proposal doesnt include it republican presidential contender rudolph giuliani opposes it the conservative heritage foundation a washington think tank supports it while across town the libertarian cato institute denounces it proponents say an individual mandate is essential to reaching the goal of universal or near universal coverage because without it many young and healthy people wouldnt bother to buy insurance the result an insurance pool dominated by older sicker people with steadily rising and ultimately unaffordable premiums "if you really believe in universal coverage you have to have an individual mandate " says jonathan gruber a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who has played a role in the massachusetts and california overhauls but some liberals and labor groups say the rule unfairly dumps financial responsibility for insurance on individuals when it should rest either with the government through a single payer system or with employers on the other end of the spectrum michael tanner the cato institutes director of health and welfare studies decries the mandate as "an unprecedented invasion of individual liberty " unlike the auto insurance requirement which can be avoided by not driving the health mandate cant be ducked he says massachusetts took steps to help uninsured residents comply with the new requirement it expanded medicaid the state federal program for the poor to cover more children and created a complex system of subsidies for other lower income people a new state agency called the commonwealth health insurance connector is helping the uninsured find affordable coverage even so it expects that about people or of the states uninsured ultimately will be exempted from the requirement because they wont be able to afford insurance without such steps to soften the impact of the requirement says mr weil "a mandate is either cruel or meaningless " so far despite the looming deadline about a third of massachusettss uninsured residents have signed up for coverage either through medicaid or the connector according to state officials the uninsured have some wiggle room they need only prove they had insurance by the end of the year not july those who dont comply will risk losing their personal tax exemption about &# in later years the penalty will be increased and will top more than &# for some people
