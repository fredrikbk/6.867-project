"doc" cohen owner of franchised locations including five mrs fields famous brands llc pretzel time outlets and a former chairman of the washington d c based international franchise association "its not a guarantee of success " heres a look at some of the most common mistakes that can befall franchisees and what they can do to avoid them undercapitalization insufficient funding is a prescription

undercapitalized franchise as a safety net minneapolis hair salon franchiser great clips suggests newcomers add as much as &# to their estimate of likely start up costs on top of the companys upfront franchise fee of &# great clips seeks prospects with at least &# in net worth and &# in available cash unrealistic optimism also can be a recipe for financial distress several years ago many fast food franchisees borrowed heavily to buy more restaurants during what turned out to be a frothy market some financed the expansion with easy money nonrecourse debt using the new properties as collateral when a downdraft led to hundreds of defaults lenders seized those properties and some franchisees were forced into bankruptcy bankers today are more cautious about the leverage a franchisee takes on insisting on more collateral upfront or simply being more hard nosed about who qualifies as a borrower weathering unexpected situations without a financial cushion can be problematic even for an established franchise ed moran an accountant in tucson ariz recalls a mcdonalds corp franchisee whose dominance of a small california community was suddenly challenged by the arrival of a competing burger restaurant the first year the rival knocked off the mcdonalds stores sales unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle the mcdonalds franchisee instead reduced his labor overhead and raised prices "he went into a spiral and never came out " mr moran says to avoid such events experts advise would be franchisees to assume they will lose money the first couple of years and have a nest egg they can tap in case of emergency poor management skills as with so many ventures a franchises success depends on the people involved "franchisers say the no reason for a franchisees failure is that they dont get the right managers " says dennis monroe a certified public accountant and franchising consultant in minneapolis if a franchisee is a poor manager he might want to choose a business that could be run by just one or two people or hire someone skilled at motivating others mr cohen is a big proponent of recruiting managers who use the word "we" rather than "i" when talking about their business experience "people who say i did this and my store did that are not as focused on team building " he says good managers create an environment where everyone can excel or at least be made to feel important aslam khan has become the largest operator of churchs chicken restaurants in the u s by acquiring distressed properties identifying their ailments and reviving them when he takes over a

well " says the year old mr khan whose company falcon holdings llc owns churchs chicken outlets in six states "if you can control the costs and give people an environment in which they can succeed then you make money " says mr khan who began his fast food career as a dishwasher at a churchs outlet in california passive franchisees who may or may not be on the premises every day also are asking for trouble industry experts say that person doesnt know if the help is showing up what customers are complaining about or whether employees are dipping into the till theft can be contagious and contaminate an entire organization if not stopped immediately follow the rules franchises arent designed for the independent minded they depend on a by the book execution of a business plan adherence to time tested systems and a willingness to follow directions "the worst thing a new franchisee can do is say to his franchiser you guys dont know what youre doing " says mr cohen he likens that to someone taking over a mcdonalds restaurant and deciding not to put sesame seeds on the big mac buns making sure employees are properly trained and executing according to the rules is vital after acquiring a struggling great american cookie outlet another brand of salt lake city based mrs fields mr cohen discovered why the store was ailing the baker was going home at a m leaving the store without fresh goods to sell the rest of the day at another store cleaning and maintenance had obviously been ignored following a thorough scrubbing the location previously in default for lack of business now does nearly &# in annual sales a suitable fit among the most common mistakes new franchisees make is signing on before adequately researching the business "in their excitement they forget about that " says mr khan only later do they realize the amount of time and elbow grease the job requires and they may be too embarrassed to admit it isnt for them when charlie simpson took over franchise development at great clips he studied why some franchisees were doing poorly and concluded they had been miscast in part he blamed the companys marketing materials which featured photos of a sailboat and a couple on a beach "it was attracting people primarily interested in almost immediate gratification " mr simpson says adding that owning a franchise is rarely a get rich quick scheme to find appropriate candidates mr simpson turned to a software program called franchise navigator which defined the attributes of ideal franchisees great clips changed its printed and internet marketing materials to appeal to prospects with more business experience and raised the financial requirements for potential franchisees the new approach is working mr simpson says producing better quality applicants and fewer washouts "you can have the best business model in the world but if you sell it to the wrong kind of person its not going to work " says craig slavin whose company franchise architects created the navigator software package experts meanwhile advise prospective franchisees to hire a consultant to analyze whether they are a good fit with the business opportunity they are considering they also should contact current and former franchisees to get their feedback names are listed in the uniform franchise offering circular the disclosure document that franchisers must give would be franchisees the wrong franchiser occasionally it is the franchiser who is largely to blame for a franchisees failure aggressive expansion can stretch a system and shortchange franchisees particularly when it comes to helping them address problems "the franchiser is always optimistic about what they can develop " says mr monroe the cpa experts also caution would be franchisees to avoid overzealous brokers or consultants selling concepts too often they are more interested in a sales commission than in making a good match between business and franchisee never make a commitment based solely on information provided on the internet or over the phone they say another potential hazard signing up with a franchiser who is inexperienced entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on what they believe is a great idea are sometimes tempted to franchise their concept before making sure it works in a variety of markets and economic environments franchisers with only a handful of their own stores probably need more seasoning experts agree "there should be wariness about new franchisers no matter how theyre set up " says scott shane who teaches economics and entrepreneurship at case western reserve university in cleveland immature franchisers have a high failure rate he says citing his own research "twenty years from their start less than of the franchisers will still be around "
