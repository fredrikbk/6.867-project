style &amp substance will boneparth meet his waterloo jones apparel ceo faces few choices to boost its stock price selling barneys is an option peter boneparth is running out of options the chief executive of jones apparel group inc a former investment banker and financial whiz has spent his five year tenure trying to boost the companys fortunes through acquisitions cost cutting and overhauling mature labels like anne klein and jones new york but now faced with a stagnant stock price department store consolidation and a downturn in the moderate apparel sector mr boneparth has an ace left to play selling the &# billion companys top performing asset the barneys new york chain of luxury department stores that he engineered the purchase of in jones is expected to pursue a sale though barneys isnt officially on the market yet people familiar with the process say joness outside spokeswoman joele frank declined to comment citing quiet period restrictions in advance of the companys first quarter earnings announcement wednesday at the time of the barneys acquisition industry watchers scratched their heads a luxury department store chain seemed completely out of place with joness portfolio of moderate and better department store brands such as nine west gloria vanderbilt and jones new york but amid a luxury goods boom barneys has thrived and in retrospect the acquisition has proven to be one of mr boneparths most astute moves still the growing barneys chain is a capital intensive business with lower margins than joness core wholesaling units in selling barneys after three years jones is behaving more like a private equity fund than an apparel wholesaler the company could use the cash infusion from selling barneys to buy back stock invest in other brands or even acquire new ones despite barneyss growth in recent years analysts have had a hard time valuing the stores because jones doesnt break out their results selling barneys however would leave jones even more exposed to problems plaguing suppliers of traditional department stores at a time when its executive suite is in turmoil two weeks ago mr boneparth fired heather pech who had been chief executive of the retail division for less than a year for not turning around the beleaguered unit fast enough and chief financial officer thimios sotos resigned in march after the board refused his request for a pay increase according to people familiar with the negotiations two board members former j c penney co and federated department stores inc chairman allen questrom and retired banking executive anthony scarpa have announced plans to leave the board when their terms end in june the year old mr boneparth himself is in a precarious position last month he and the company said they had both decided not to extend his contract when it expires in two years while the contract may be renegotiated if earnings improve one retail industry recruiter says board pressure may force mr boneparth to depart as soon as june mr boneparths relationship with the board is already tense he favored increasing mr sotoss pay and was angry when the board rejected his proposal the people familiar with the negotiations say reached over the phone mr sotos declined to comment and when jones reported a net loss of &# million for the boards compensation committee decided not to give mr boneparth a bonus mr boneparths boldest move to date attempting a sale of the entire company last year to a private equity firm in a red hot market for such deals didnt pan out after five months the company wound up pulling the plug on the auction because jones failed to generate sufficiently high bids from players like bain capital and tpg formerly texas pacific group jones was headed for trouble before mr boneparth became ceo in the company spent &# billion for its nine west shoe division which lost its footing amid competition from specialty apparel retailers that began introducing shoe lines the company also had inked a deal with polo ralph lauren corp to make apparel under the lauren ralph and polo jeans labels but the arrangement unraveled when polo invoked a clause allowing it to get out of the pact early following a court battle jones sold the licenses back to polo it was a severe blow the labels generated some &# million a year in revenue for jones "these were high margin high revenue businesses " says todd slater an analyst at lazard freres &amp co the shrinking of department store chains exacerbates joness situation when federated bought may department stores in jones moderately priced norton mcnaughton and l e i labels were especially hard hit at the same time middle market retailers like j c penney and kohls corp have been ramping up their own moderate brands and demanding that specific brands are sold exclusively at one chain mr boneparth has won applause from customers and analysts for efforts to turn around joness "better" department store brands such as jones new york and anne klein both have seen sales and margin improvements despite the fact that federated has closed stores since buying may barneys which jones purchased for &# million could probably fetch more than double that amount in todays private equity market according to merrill lynch analyst virginia genereux who has a "neutral" rating on the stock but a barneys sale would leave the company even more vulnerable to the sagging moderately priced apparel sector "the solution is to continue to execute on it not to sell it " says ted oconnor a portfolio manager at cooke &amp bieler lp a philadelphia based investment firm that owns million jones shares according to factset research systems inc corrections &amp amplifications todd slater is an analyst at lazard capital
