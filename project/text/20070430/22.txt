eyes on the road smarter cars fewer deaths latest crash data offer encouraging picture but will disappoint fuel economy advocates online edition drivers may not be getting any smarter but cars are and that appears to be driving down the risk of dying behind the wheel to further put the odds in your favor drive a big luxury car a large minivan or a car based crossover wagon equipped with electronic stability control these are a few conclusions drawn from a recent study of vehicle fatal crash data compiled by experts at the insurance institute for highway safety the vehicle safety research arm of the insurance industry the institutes status report on driver deaths published april also has some not so good news for detroits struggling brands and raises red flags for greens who wish americans would buy more fuel efficient smaller vehicles click here for a pdf of the study the big picture view of the fatality statistics is encouraging says anne mccartt the institutes senior vice president for research between and the average death rate for drivers of car and light truck models was deaths per million registered vehicle years thats down from deaths per million registered vehicle years for models during the period "its more the vehicles than drivers" that deserve credit for this trend ms mccartt says too many people drink and drive almost everyone drives too fast and a stubborn or so still refuse to wear seat belts regularly but newer vehicles particularly luxury vehicles are becoming more crash worthy she says and "some of the safety technology is really making a difference " the difference is not just the proliferation of airbags including side airbags electronic stability control known by various acronyms including esc appears to be a big factor behind an improvement in the rate of deaths in single vehicle rollover crashes for certain sport utility vehicles the two wheel drive lexus rx one of a growing number of crossover wagons that rides on a car like chassis recorded no rollover deaths in the study period this vehicle typically comes with stability control the iihs says stability control systems typically work by monitoring the motion of the vehicle and automatically applying the brakes to arrest a sideways skid the government has mandated installation of such technology by though many auto makers are moving more quickly the national highway traffic safety administration has estimated installation of stability control could save to lives a year in contrast nine vehicles all conventional suvs and pickup trucks that ride high on ladder frames had single vehicle rollover death rates of per million registered vehicle years among them versions of the ford explorer sport trac chevrolet blazer mitsubishi montero sport ford f pickup ford ranger pickup and the mechanically similar mazda b series pickup the rollover figures highlight another trend vehicles with old designs tend to have worse numbers than models redesigned more recently with the latest crash tests and safety engineering technology in mind the institutes report highlights the improvement in the fatality rate for the ford f pickup the f based on the previous generation design has a death rate of per million registered vehicle years the redesigned model has a death rate score of and it also did far better in the institutes crash tests this is another way in which the competitive handicaps of detroits three auto makers weigh down american brands of the passenger car segments covered in the institutes report that had three or more models measured seven of the top ranked vehicles came from european or asian brands among light truck categories with three or more vehicles measured eight of the no vehicles that is the vehicle with the lowest overall fatality rate came from asian or european brands "if you look at the worst performers some of those are older models " says ms mccartt "u s manufacturers dont redesign as quickly the new designs do better in our crash tests and are more likely to have the safety features" such as stability control one exception to this premise is the chevrolet astro van an aged and now discontinued design that ranked no among models with a death rate of just seven fatalities per million registered vehicle years but before you rush out to a used car lot to grab one keep in mind the demographics of the astros customer base skewed heavily toward people who were driving a company van on the job setting aside the astro of the best models based on overall fatality rates came from european or asian makes six were toyota models either lexuses or toyotas such as the lexus es sedan or the toyota runner suv two were bmws the best sedan was the infiniti g from nissan two honda models the odyssey minivan and pilot crossover wagon made the list as did the audi a sedan and the mercedes e and m class finally heres the bad news for greens the statistics reinforce again the argument that occupants of heavy passenger cars have a better chance of surviving a collision than drivers of small sedans or any kind of pickup truck or suv the overall fatality rate for cars weighing to pounds a mercedes s class or lincoln town car was on the iihs scale that compares to for a similar sized suv and for pickups of the same weight best of all were sedans weighing more than pounds such as the bmw series worst category of all suvs weighing to pounds with a death rate of the divergence in this class is stark the chevrolet tracker now discontinued had a death rate of compared to for a mazda tribute sedans weighing to pounds chevy cavalier ford focus had an average death rate of while small cars weighing under pounds hyundai accent honda civic had a death rate of my car the subaru impreza wrx wasnt listed the problem for advocates of better fuel economy is that big safe luxury cars generally consume more fuel than compact sedans at least until the european luxury car makers start bringing their high mileage euro diesel engines to this market a gasoline burning bmw li can be expected to average miles per gallon in combined city highway driving according to the governments measures www fueleconomy gov the best small sedan in the iihs study the volkswagen golf rechristened the rabbit for averages a combined mpg but the fatality rate in the big bimmer is compared to the little vws this point will come up again and again as politicians auto makers and consumers debate how best to burn less gasoline send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
