wild about harry to his comrades in the british army he is known as cornet wales camouflage clad gun slung commander of four scimitar light tanks to the british media however as to the worlds celebrity magazines and tabloid tv he is hard drinking prince harry year old nightclub cavorter and handsome second son of the late diana therein lies a problem for the british and u s governments for cornet wales or prince harry is about to be posted to iraq to take part in the british armys dangerous mission in basra the plan at present is for him to be subjected to the same risks as other young soldiers he may be a grandson of queen elizabeth ii but he will still go into battle with his regiment the blues and royals the imminent arrival in the iraqi war zone of this much photographed member of the british royal family has generated immense public interest the matter is being followed not only by londons infamously frisky newspapers and their generally royalist readers it has also we are told been noted with excitement in the inner shadowy recesses of the basra souk bearded men with a less genial view of the house of windsor have been feasting their eyes on those photographs of harry emerging from mayfair discotheques familiarizing themselves with harrys chiselled features iraqi insurgents are almost certainly preparing themselves for a delicious prospect just imagine to take this british prince hostage and parade him in front of the cameras what a propaganda bonus for the likes of al qaeda that could be a thousand vestal virgins be thine osama to have spawned this scurvy plot and delivered the "crusader prince" into the maw of the prophets defenders although it is surprising that the british media have indulged in prolonged speculation about prince harrys movements the discussion of military deployment plans and individuals postings is not normal even in countries with traditions of free speech it is too late to bolt that stable door the story is out and running at the top of the bulletins as a result there now seem to be only two courses of action the first is to let prince harry proceed to basra with his regiment and face the bullets and bombs the second is to prevent him fighting both these choices would damage the british electorates already wobbly commitment to the iraq adventure if harry is told to stay at home or is given a desk job in some sandbagged part of basra "flying a mahogany bomber" as the sardonic raf expression used to go there will be cries of protest about special treatment and official timidity people would argue "well if its too dangerous for harry why should any of our other brave boys have to fight in that godforsaken land " the prince himself cannot be accused of cowardice he is understood to be bursting with impatience determined to fight with the men he has commanded during months of training "friends of harry" which may be a euphemism for harry himself have asserted that if he is prevented from fulfilling his military role he will quit the army "harry im not afraid to die" cried the front page of fridays daily mail the murdoch owned sun had this "i fight or i quit frontline ultimatum by harry " wrapped up in all this is the image both of harry and the british royal family the prince has not always been given an easy time by the media he has been portrayed as a playboy and a fool not least when he was photographed at a fancy dress party wearing a nazi swastika the fighting he is so far best known for has been with greasy paparazzi who have snapped him late at night worse for drink he would be only human if he yearned to show his critics a different side of his character as for the "royal firm " the windsors have a long symbolic link with britains armed forces the british military swear their allegiance to the crown not to the state by sending its own young men to fight in those forces the royal family strengthens the bond and demonstrates commitment it happened last when the queens middle son prince andrew flew a naval helicopter during the falklands war it must be a comfort to the family of a young british soldier sent on a perilous posting to know that their monarch is in the same position nursing the same worries about whether or not her youngster will return in one piece but if harry does go and is seized by the enemy one need only consider the recent hostage taking of royal navy sailors by iran to see what a political crisis it would become britain today is a society prey to touchy feely sentimentality the stoicism of old has gone destroyed not least by harrys "emotionally literate" you could say gushy mother diana it is most unlikely we would see a repeat today of what happened in world war i when the prince of wales went off to fight and his aide was given the chilling instructions that the prince "was not to be taken prisoner no matter what this entailed " it may be no exaggeration to say that were prince harry taken hostage it could topple britains labor government and do irreparable damage to the u k u s alliance as with shakespeares prince hal at agincourt we must hope he enters the breach and survives the battle unscathed mr letts is
