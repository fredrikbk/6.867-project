small business a special report it seemed like a good idea guerrilla marketing is a great way for a small business to get attention but its a tactic that can easily backfire as an internet start up with only five employees thrillist com had no money to spend on an advertising campaign so the companys founder turned to what he thought would be a cheap way to get attention a guerrilla marketing stunt thrillist which bills itself as a free daily newsletter about whats trendy for the post frat boy set decided to throw a wild party in new york last october to celebrate its first anniversary with an eye toward generating positive buzz and attracting media attention founder ben lerer hired a professional knife thrower to perform and then recruited random partygoers to stand against a backdrop for minutes and have axes tossed at them nobody was hurt and the subsequent coverage of the stunt on some popular blogs and in new york magazine paid off subscriptions to the newsletter more than doubled in the month after and some big advertisers like procter &amp gamble co came calling says mr lerer but he says a dressing down from some investors made him realize the risks of the stunt "we could have lost everything" had somebody gotten hurt mr lerer says "well be more careful down the road but its hard when you are trying to spend zero dollars on marketing youre tempted to push it " an increasing number of small business owners are pursuing these kinds of off kilter campaigns which often consist of elaborate and intrusive stunts in an effort to get their message out loudly and cheaply and marketing experts say there are lots of proven guerrilla techniques but many small businesses dont realize how quickly such strategies can backfire resulting in fines or even brand damage that could put them out of business jonathan carson ceo of new york based nielsen buzzmetrics which analyzes internet chatter says steering clear of oddball guerrilla campaigns is an easy safeguard "otherwise " he says "you might get a temporary spike due to media coverage and a long term mess to clean up " some small businesses are getting inspiration from and copying big companies which in a bid to reach consumers amid an onslaught of advertising clutter also have taken to edgy word of mouth tactics in one famous case from sony ericsson mobile communications ltd a joint venture of sony corp and ericsson ab hired actresses and female models to frequent bars and show off their new cellphones the company hired another actors and actresses to visit tourist spots pose as visitors and ask strangers to take their pictures with their new camera cellphones sony ericsson spent about &# million on the exercise and credited the subsequent buzz and media coverage with selling tens of millions of dollars of phones but some big companies experiences also show how guerrilla marketing can attract the wrong kind of publicity in february cartoon network trying to promote an animated tv show surreptitiously distributed blinking boxes around downtown boston prompting a bomb scare that closed highways and subways the networks parent company time warner inc s turner broadcasting in new york ended up paying the massachusetts attorney general &# million to settle any potential civil or criminal claims a turner spokeswoman says the company regrets the incident and has been re evaluating its use of guerrilla stunts the fallout from the cartoon network promotion was unusual in its scope but its not uncommon for a guerrilla campaign to run afoul of a thicket of local laws whether it involves a large company or a small one for instance fines can range from &# for writing on a sidewalk without a permit as a seattle coffee shop which listed specials in colored chalk on sidewalks found out to &# for endangering a historic cemetery the amount paid by cadbury schweppes plc in february after it riled boston officials by hiding a dr pepper sweepstakes prize near the spot where paul revere is buried adding to the problem a crop of ethically questionable public relations and marketing agencies have sprouted on the local level promising to coordinate guerrilla stunts as a way to tap clients unable to pay for a full blown campaign so what should small businesses looking to profit from guerrilla marketing do experts say guerrilla campaigns succeed when a company keeps it simple one of the best options simply involves handing out samples because its relatively cheap and people tend to use or eat samples says allan steinmetz chief executive officer of inward strategic consulting inc in newton mass "some of the best ive seen are restaurants that deliver food to talk show radio hosts on the air " he says "the free food gets all sorts of accolades and the business gets free advertising " but many small businesses mistakenly think something small wont be enough says jonathan fields owner of vibe creative a boutique guerrilla marketing firm in new york if youre a yoga studio in los angeles dispatching people to sit in the lotus position through the city is a waste of time because it is unlikely to drive yoga enthusiasts to your studio but having people do so within blocks of your studio is a decent idea mr fields says some guerrilla tactics dont work because they fail to make a connection between the stunt itself and the product a company is trying to pitch joe holihan an atlanta entrepreneur learned that the hard way he launched a web site in february called on the map u s where visitors can "buy" real towns for about &# each the site displays a u s map with pins showing spots with virtual ownership and to promote the site around which mr holihan hopes to build a social networking business he tried a variety of guerrilla maneuvers one time mr holihan traveled to new york bought &# lottery tickets stapled them to fliers advertising the site and handed them out on the street even though lottery tickets had nothing to do with his site "i dont think we got a single sale out of it " he says next up the sidewalk outside nbcs "today" show in new york where crowds get on camera by cheering for hosts matt lauer and meredith vieira mr holihan had hired an actor to dress up as uncle sam and hold a sign for his web site thinking that the famous u s symbol would better connect his company with a stunt but that didnt work either and it didnt help that the actor didnt show up so one of the firms employees a petite woman donned the outfit at the last minute mr holihan says "lets just say it didnt go well at all " he adds but mr holihan still thinks it will be a viable option for him if he can execute it correctly experts say playing to your audience also is key to the success of a guerrilla campaign taos ski valley a family owned and operated ski resort outside santa fe n m had a positive experience using that approach in a guerrilla marketing campaign to try to appeal to younger skiers despite its old fashioned approach the resort is one of the few left in the nation that bans snowboarding mckee wallwork cleveland llc an albuquerque marketing agency hired by taos ski valley suggested changing the resorts logo to a cryptic symbol launching a web site around it scribbling the symbol and web address on starbucks napkins and post it notes and "littering public places" across the country "we all sat there thinking oh god they cant be serious " says marketing director adriana blake "it was hard for us to get over our initial shock and trust that these people knew what they were doing when youre paying for an ad campaign you want to see results " but ms blake says the agency won the pitch by arguing that younger skiers were internet savvy and would pick up on the chatter the stunt would generate online they were right ms blake says unique visitors to the resorts web site increased and she says there has been some sign of an increase in younger visitors to the resort itself "were extremely pleased with the outcome " she says mr barnes is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau he can be reached at brooks barnes wsj com
