clean books bolster traditional lenders the subprime meltdown has shown that few banks were able to resist the appeal of making unconventional home loans to riskier borrowers in exchange for charging higher fees this earnings season cracks began showing in the quality of many banks loan portfolios such as at countrywide financial corp others such as suntrust banks inc and m&amp t bank corp had trouble finding buyers for their riskier loans and were forced to sell them at a loss or mark down their value on their books still some regional and community banks steered clear of the subprime sector hudson city bancorp inc zions bancorp and ucbh holdings inc stayed away from making low documentation or no documentation home loans even to the most credit worthy borrowers when they wrote home mortgages they insisted borrowers put at least down and prove that they could pay them off they collected deposits and focused almost entirely on commercial lending as a result they have some of the cleanest loan books and balance sheets in the business still that hasnt stopped investors from penalizing their shares which are relatively cheap "the traditional commercial lenders will continue to do their thing and the traditional home lenders who lost share to those that got in trouble are getting it back " says david ellison chief investment officer of fbr funds which has about &# billion in assets hudson city based in paramus n j is one of the funds holdings the trade off for maintaining low risk conservative loan policies is slow earnings growth and sideways trading share prices and like most banks these smaller lenders have seen their net interest margins squeezed over the past year as interest rates have risen weighing on their earnings in p m composite trading friday on the nasdaq stock market shares of hudson city rose to &# about flat so far this year and up since the start of zions shares which also trade on nasdaq edged up to &# they are flat this year and up since the end of ucbhs nasdaq listed shares fell friday to &# up this year up just since early while they are low risk they arent all dirt cheap thats because such banks with clean balance sheets excess capital healthy commercial loans and strong deposit franchises have a certain "scarcity value" that buttress their share prices analysts say their shares trade higher due to speculation that they could be bought up by bigger banks for example hudson city shares trade at times its estimated earnings while the savings and loan sector trades at just times according to thomson financial by another valuation measure the shares trade at about a earnings yield based on estimates according to james abbott an analyst at brokerage friedman billings ramsey &amp co or roughly the same as holding a treasury bond "i cant think of another company that has as clean a loan book as hudson city " says mr abbott who has the equivalent of a "hold" rating on the stock he doesnt own any shares and his brokerage doesnt receive investment banking fees from hudson city "you can sleep comfortably but you just dont get paid very much " still these banks have more to offer than just the prospect of getting sold say some investors and analysts their commercial lending businesses funded by their stable deposit bases make them steady earners in a recent analysis of delinquency trends among regional and community banks and thrifts mr abbott concluded that commercial credit on average has "experienced continued gradual improvement over the past two years " the trend for to day delinquencies in the commercial loan sector has been declining with loans exhibiting lower delinquency ratios than the period to like hudson city zions and ucbh are mainly commercial lenders zions based in salt lake city has assets of about &# billion and a market value of about &# billion in the fourth quarter of its commercial loan growth was up about over the previous years quarter while consumer loans were up just commercial and industrial loans make up about of its lending book while consumer loans make up zions trades at about times estimated per share earnings for this year aside from being a potential buyout candidate because of its attractive deposit profile ucbh san francisco is extending its commercial lending expertise to china in march ucbh which has a market value of just over &# billion announced it had signed an agreement to buy business development bank ltd a small bank in china in an all cash deal to close at the end of analysts expect the deal will give ucbh four office locations and a banking license in china and opportunity to increase its exposure to trade finance ucbh is trading at about times estimated earnings while commercial lending remains relatively clean some see opportunities for these small banks to increase their residential portfolios as pricing for mortgages has improved with the subprime meltdown "its not that hard to take market share right now " fbrs mr ellison says "this is the first phase of things getting better "
