the evening wrap obvious importance online edition its as plain as the nose on your face in taking on the question of "obviousness" in patent law the supreme court has issued a decision that is certain to shift the ground under intellectual property disputes in a highly anticipated decision in a patent case with far reaching implications the justices unanimously reversed a test for when an invention is too "obvious" to warrant protection under federal law a claim of patent infringement can be deflected if a party can demonstrate that the patent that they stand accused of violating is just an obvious next leap in improving an existing technology but critics have complained that the federal u s circuit court of appeals a court that only hears patent disputes was tinkering with the "obviousness" standard within the rule to the detriment of ordinary innovation the appeals court fashioned a test that said the challenger of a patent must prove that existing "teaching suggestion or motivation would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art" to dream up the innovation when the matter was argued before the supreme court last fall the language of the test seemed to annoy some justices chief justice john roberts jr said it slathered a "layer of jargon on so that attorneys can barter back and forth" and was "worse than meaningless " justice antonin scalia deemed it "gobbledygook" and justice stephen breyer wondered if the appeals court was "leaning too far in the direction of never seeing a patent they didnt like " the case revolved around a dispute over gas pedal designs between ksr international and teleflex today the high court squashed the federal circuits test with authority "the results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws " justice anthony kennedy wrote in the courts opinion "were it otherwise patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts " some said that the decision stands to roil patent law leading to challenge upon challenge to all kinds of patents and potentially bogging courts down for years others celebrated the outcome but also said the ultimate impact of the decision would take some time to become well obvious lawyer solveig singleton who had filed an amicus brief in the case backing ksr wrote on akin gumps supreme court blog that the decision "is on the right track in paving the road for a more informed and somewhat higher standard of non obviousness but what exactly that will be will again be left to the lower courts in a long drawn out process that many observers think is broken " but if the final contours are still fuzzy they are no less large for being ambiguous also writing on akin gumps blog wilson sonsini lawyer michael barclay said "this is the most important patent case of the last years and perhaps since the passage of the patent act " the court has been hearing a broad array of patent matters lately a reflection of how crucial intellectual property matters have become in the economy among a series of key cases the justices sided with ebay in a battle over injunctions in patent cases last year and earlier this year made it easier to challenge patents in a case that gave medimmune a victory against genentech in another carefully watched case the supreme court today ruled that microsoft doesnt owe at&amp t patent royalties on software contained on computers that were produced and sold overseas justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote that u s patent statutes generally stop at the border "if at&amp t desires to prevent copying abroad its remedy today lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents " justice ginsburg wrote the ruling reverses a lower court holding that had favored at&amp t blue chips finally
