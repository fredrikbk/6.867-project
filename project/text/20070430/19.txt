companies shift more donations to democrats house leaders coffers swell as balance swings against republicans washington for the new democratic bosses in the house power has quickly translated into money as many big companies have shifted more of their campaign contributions to the new congressional majority and away from longtime republican allies the top four house leaders speaker nancy pelosi of california majority whip steny hoyer of maryland and their main lieutenants raised a combined &# million in the first quarter of according to filings with the federal election commission that was more than three times as much as the &# they raised in the first quarter of the comparable period in the previous two year election cycle with months to go until the election democratic committee chairmen have also seen their campaign coffers swell for ways and means chairman charles rangel of new york contributions surged to &# in the first quarter of from &# two years earlier sharp increases were also reported for energy and commerce chairman john dingell &# up from &# financial services chairman barney frank of massachusetts &# up from &# and house armed services chairman ike skelton &# up from &# some of the new money came from companies with a stake in the committees agendas the political action committee of allstate insurance co a unit of allstate corp gave &# to mr franks campaign this year after bypassing him completely in the previous election cycle defense contractor armor holdings inc s pac which didnt give to mr skelton at all in donated &# to his re election campaign earlier this year as chairman of the financial services panel mr frank has "a comprehensive agenda regarding insurance reforms " says allstate spokesman michael trevino he adds that allstate is concerned with natural disaster and terrorism insurance legislation in front of mr franks committee this session armor holdings couldnt be reached for comment companies "are going to give to the chairman theyre going to give to the gatekeepers no matter what " says sheila krumholz the executive director of the center for responsive politics a nonpartisan organization that analyzes campaign contributions thats especially the case this year because "they have to make up for lost time " ms krumholz says after years of giving primarily to republicans the big jump in donations to democrats comes as lawmakers begin their efforts to reshape policies that could have major repercussions for many companies and their executives mr rangels committee for example is considering whether to raise taxes on high earners or let investment tax breaks expire the current congress also is far likelier than the previous one to try to impose some kind of controls on emissions of greenhouse gases which most climate scientists believe contribute to global warming mr dingell is the houses point man on that issue big defense contractors meanwhile remain as dependent as ever on the federal budget for business and now have new power brokers to cultivate many corporate campaign donations come from political action committees or pacs pools of money raised from senior company employees donations by most pacs are capped at &# per candidate per election but company executives independently can give as much as &# per candidate in each election overall corporate pacs gave of their &# million in contributions to democrats in the first quarter of according to politicalmoneyline another nonpartisan tracker of political funds during the whole of the previous campaign cycle the two years that ended with the elections democrats got just of the &# million that corporate pacs gave to congressional candidates big companies that have shifted their funding in democrats favor so far this year include general dynamics corp whose pac gave of its &# in contributions to democrats in early compared with to republicans in the previous election cycle pacs for honeywell international inc home depot inc and insurer aflac inc have also greatly increased the proportion of their giving to democrats officials at those companies caution against drawing conclusions from one quarters worth of data in a two year campaign cycle saying the balance will swing back toward republicans in the coming months "over time we find that contributions even out that were pretty bipartisan " says aflac spokeswoman laura kane "expect it to get closer to " bernadette budde executive vice president for the business industry political action committee a group of companies dedicated to electing pro business candidates says the giving isnt aimed at democrats across the board but focused on democrats considered pro business the donations represent an effort to solidify the wing of the party in power viewed as the most moderate she says "business donors always believe what were giving in contributions are a very tangible way of saying were with you and we want more of you " the coalition of centrist pro business democratic lawmakers known as the blue dogs saw a huge increase in their donations the groups members raised a total of &# million in the five months after the last election from november through march up from &# million or from the comparable period two years earlier one stark example of the shift in corporate giving is at&amp t corp in sbc communications inc bought at&amp t long one of the nations most politically active companies and one with a strong republican bent and adopted the at&amp t name in the first quarter or giving from the companys federal pac still favored republicans though less so than in the previous election cycle the companys pac gave of its &# in donations to democrats up from during the whole of the cycle according to politicalmoneyline the telecommunications giant has a stake in several issues expected to come before congress including changes in the universal service fund a subsidy designed to ensure rural and poor americans affordable phone coverage also of concern is the issue of national video franchising which would allow companies to apply to the federal communications commission for the right to supply cable service nationwide instead of applying community by community at&amp t also faces a democratic backed measure that would block internet service providers like phone and cable companies from charging higher rates to web based firms in return for giving their content priority treatment it is common in washington for companies and their employees to make political donations to the political party in power before republicans took control of congress in democrats received most of the political money from companies and their employees but the balance swung quickly to republicans favor the new campaign finance reports show that this year too the shift away from the new minority party has been swift and stark illinois rep dennis hastert the former house speaker and republican minority leader john boehner of ohio havent received any donations from at&amp t for their re election efforts even though both republicans have been reliable supporters of the companys legislative efforts an at&amp t spokeswoman declined to comment on the companys contributions overall top republicans have seen contributions drop mr hastert who is no longer in the leadership and is expected to step down from congress at the end of the session raised &# in the first quarter of down from &# in the same period in contributions to missouri rep roy blunt the no ranking republican meanwhile fell to &# from &# two years earlier its harder to analyze contribution trends in the senate because the senates six year election cycle makes comparisons more difficult but relative contributions to the two main parties campaign arms show a trend similar to the houses the democratic senatorial campaign committee raised &# million from january to march almost &# million more than in the same period two years ago the national republican senatorial committee received &# million in the first quarter of down from &# million corrections &amp amplifications a bar chart with a page one article monday on corporate political donations illustrated the total contributions given to congressional campaigns by political action committees of honeywell international inc and aflac inc as of the end of the first quarter of the chart failed to make clear the time frame of the contributions because of a footnoting error and incorrectly said the contributions were combined funds for the national democratic and republican committees and the parties house and senate campaign committees wsj may
