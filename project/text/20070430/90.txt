whats better in accounting rules or feel european principles may get a place here yet trickery will remain earlier this year when accounting rule makers gave companies new standards for valuing some investments a securities firm saw an opportunity in a late march marketing pitch ftn financial the capital markets division of first horizon national corp of memphis tenn said that under the new standard companies could dump money losing investments without taking a hit to profits as would normally be the case the firm said that its gambit isnt "necessarily within the spirit" of the new accounting rule but that regulators arent "expected to object " because the maneuver wouldnt violate the letter of the new rule accounting standards setters have come under fire for producing hundreds of pages of rules that cover every conceivable situation a company could face the much discussed alternative is to adopt a principles based approach where broad brush standards are used to govern behavior relying on companies to reasonably apply the rules to their own situations but ftn financials interpretation of the new rules shows that when standards arent precise they can leave too much room for improvisation the flip side to that is also true when theres room for interpretation companies get nervous and ask for rules the push for principles got an added boost last week when the securities and exchange commission said it may soon consider allowing u s companies to begin choosing between two sets of accounting rules a move that could allow them to use an international system that is considered to be more reliant on principles instead of u s generally accepted accounting principles which are more rules based companies in europe and parts of asia follow international accounting standards even those who generally support a more principles based approach acknowledge that financial gimmickry is often behind the proliferation of rules "there appears still to be at least a few out there who are interested in engineering around accounting objectives or in asking questions like can you show me where it says that i cant do this " said sec deputy chief accountant james kroeker in a speech earlier this month ftn says the marketing piece wasnt an attempt to game the new rule mike heflin of the firms portfolio strategies group said he thought the approach was "allowable" based on the guidance he got from accounting experts the sec and an accounting group recently warned companies and auditors that such approaches werent in fact proper mr heflin said this is a case where someone applies "professional judgment " adding that reasonable minds might differ whether the approach is within the spirit of the new rule is "in the eye of the beholder " however he added in this case that "the accountants and the sec ended up being judge and jury " while financial engineering often results in rules mr kroeker in his speech delivered at a conference in new york examining the advantages of principles added that detailed rules often spring up because companies ask regulators for detailed interpretations even when guidance is based on a pretty clear cut principle a prime example mr kroeker said was an accounting standard dealing with complex financial instruments known as derivatives the standards objectives are "laid out in a few paragraphs and seem fairly straightforward " the problem he added lies in the " plus pages" of accompanying guidance one reason for these telephone book sized rules is that people ask for them said robert herz chairman of the financial accounting standards board which sets accounting rules in the u s companies are generally fond of saying "give us principles but tell us exactly what to do " he said of course companies more unsavory actions sometimes force the fasb and others to come up with rules accounting rules for leases are an example the principle behind these rules is pretty straightforward companies should treat most lease costs as debt that makes intuitive sense its as if a couple leases a car and knows theyll have to pay &# in the next three years they ought to treat that as debt that they will be on the hook for one day down the road but years ago companies began ignoring that principle in a bid to lower the amount of debt they reported so the fasb came up with detailed rules on leases companies then found ways to game these rules now the fasb is back trying to rewrite the lease standards backers of principles based accounting are fond of blaming the raft of accounting rules they must follow on a legal system that makes lawsuits easy and on overzealous regulators they argue that a principles based system would make it easier and cheaper for them to comply with regulations while at the same time limiting fraud but even groups that extol the use of broad brush principles seem to fall back on rules last fall the committee on capital markets regulation a group of business leaders and academics whose work was backed by treasury secretary henry paulson issued a report pushing a principles based approach to regulation and accounting in the u s the report also called on the sec to scrap an existing principles based standard governing what is important or material to a companys results instead the committee called for the sec to adopt a rule saying companies should only consider as important items that are greater than of pretax profit that raises the prospect that companies will engineer things so that issues fall below that number hal scott a harvard university law professor who helped found the committee countered that view saying that the call for a rule came about in response to accountants over auditing "because theyre afraid of litigation " and so include too many things when theres just a principle to guide them see related letter "letters to the editor principal principles" wsj may
