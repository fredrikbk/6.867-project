&# billion tax hike last week house ways and means chairman charlie rangel effectively declared the death of reaganomics in america by this i mean that if mr rangel and his democratic colleagues in the house have their way the quarter century era of falling tax rates in the u s may finally come to an end for those who understand the linkage between supply side tax cutting policies and americas near unprecedented prosperity over the past quarter century its time to be afraid in the last several days mr rangel and other key democrats on ways and means have come up with their plan to protect the middle class from the growing reach of the alternative minimum tax amt if nothing is done this year million workers will be liable to the amt when they pay their taxes next april so to defuse this political time bomb the house plans to exempt families with incomes below &# so far so good but the democrats dilemma is to figure out how to come up with the &# billion of revenue this stealth tax would have raised over the next years the dilemma is self imposed because house democrats adopted a "pay as you go" budget rule a few months ago promising that any tax cut be offset with an equally large tax increase it is no surprise that democrats want to go after high income earners whom they call "rich " what is surprising is how high rates must be raised to make their plans numbers add up the top amt rate would increase to from democratic tax experts also recommend eliminating the lower rate for capital gains and dividends for those subject to the amt this would raise the capital gains tax rate to about from its present rate the congressional budget office using its own assumptions calculates that the revenue maximizing tax rate on capital gains is and many economists believe it is a lot lower than that this implies that the tax hike contemplated by the house democrats would not only reduce economic growth and cost jobs it would lose revenue for the government the changes in the amt rate and the treatment of dividends and capital gains still leaves mr rangel at least &# billion short of paying for the amt fix house democrats have acknowledged that to close this final gap they will have to look to personal income taxes rep richard neal of massachusetts the head of the ways and means tax panel says this will require raising the top tax rate of by no more than three to five percentage points mr neal should check his math tax experts on capitol hill and in the treasury department calculate that to get &# billion a year from the top of income earners would more likely require rate hikes of to percentage points this would lift the top federal marginal income tax rate as high as "i cant think of a better way to throw the economy into recession and end the bull market expansion of recent years than to raise tax rates like this " warns michael darda chief economist for mkm partners its hard to argue with that assessment overnight the u s would go from being a nation with one of the lowest set of income tax rates to one of the highest in the developed world with germany and france looking to cut their tax rates mr rangels plans could leave the u s with a higher top marginal rate the top of earners today already shoulders of the overall income tax burden under the rangel plan the share of the top earners would rise closer to meanwhile a new study by the tax foundation indicates that more than half of americans get more money in checks from the government than they pay in income taxes it is not a healthy trend for a democracy when an ever larger share of the electorate comes to realize it can vote for more handouts with no liability or responsibility to pay for any of the governments upkeep these considerations arent likely to deter class warriors in the democratic party who have been assured by pollsters and pundits that their tax plans will be celebrated by middle class voters chris van hollen who runs the democratic congressional campaign committee told the washington post that million americans will get a tax cut and that only the richest one million many of whom sign their paychecks will pay more "it is a great message of fiscal responsibility and economic fairness " he says many americans who are supposed to see their taxes decline thanks to democratic promises may be skeptical the amt was after all supposed to apply to only americans who had escaped the income tax in now it threatens million taxpayers fortunately for now at least senate democrats say they are unlikely to enact such a large tax increase and president george bush would likely veto a bill that would effectively cancel the pro growth tax agenda he has implemented over the past six years but we do have a sense now where the liberal wing of the democratic party wants to take the country on tax policy and where we might end up if democrats sweep the elections in in countries as diverse as ireland china india japan russia and hong kong tax rates are flat or falling part of a world wide effort to reward growth and get more of it yet reaganomics alive nearly everywhere else is dead in the halls of the united states congress mr moore is
