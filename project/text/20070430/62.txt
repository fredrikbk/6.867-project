mass loses about of its customers each year but because so many of its clients tend to come from harvard university the massachusetts institute of technology and a high school across the street new ones appear just as quickly as the old ones vanish still with so many transient customers keeping track of addresses for promotional mailings and loyalty based reward programs a key part of the stores business became a hassle so year old co owner charlie bougas turned to a marketing tool that always moves with its owner the cellphone mobilelime inc a mobile marketing firm in quincy mass helped broadway marketplace realize the cellphones potential as the basis for a one on one connection with customers in summer mobilelime replaced the stores card based loyalty program with one that used cellphone numbers as a way to alert loyal customers about special events discounts and rewards by doing so mobilelime "streamlined the whole process and made it a lot more cost effective and more efficient for us to run the loyalty program " mr bougas says "they basically do all the work for us analyzing customer spending patterns and letting us know each month who the customers are and how much theyve spent " the stores sales which had been flat for the previous few years grew in the first year of mobile marketing and have risen again through the first quarter of mr bougas says he expects about &# million in sales this year cellphones are an increasingly popular marketing tool for companies large and small the world market for mobile marketing and advertising is expected to total about &# billion this year according to abi research a new york based market research firm abi doesnt break out numbers for the u s and users arent just small players like broadway marketplace

the trend about three out of four u s households now own at least one cellphone according to cambridge based forrester research inc which expects cellphone adoption by in addition more than one in three cellphone owners now send text messages an essential part of many mobile campaigns a lot of campaigns begin by using traditional media like radio or television to invite consumers to send a text message with a short numerical code for a special offer or for a chance to win sweepstakes and other contests other common strategies include offers of downloadable games ring tones and wallpaper for the screen all of which feature advertising so called short codes are like five to six digit phone numbers used by consumers to send text messages to commercial services to find the nearest starbucks

mobile marketing messages consumers first have to send a text message make a phone call register on a web site or sign a piece of paper indicating they want to receive the messages they also must be given a way to stop receiving the messages according to the mobile marketing associations code of conduct mobile marketers that dont abide by these rules can be denied service by cellphone carriers there are several upsides to using cellphones as a marketing medium text messaging is good for short and snappy communication it lets businesses see how a particular campaign such as a discount offer directly affects sales and its generally less expensive than television radio and print buys as with any new medium there are plenty of pitfalls too with a device as personal as a cellphone marketers need to proceed with caution indeed more than three quarters of consumers dislike the idea of ads on their phones forrester says so marketers must be wary about how many messages they send and make sure they are reaching the right demographic "theres this responsibility that every marketer bears when its so new and permeable " says christine overby principal analyst for forrester "the ad itself has to be clear simple and engaging so that the consumer engages with it and doesnt get turned off " when done right mobile campaigns yield high response rates and increase consumer engagement its an especially effective tool when a business like broadway marketplace is trying to compete for foot traffic in a highly competitive area for more than a decade broadway marketplace promoted itself with local cable tv spots direct mail campaigns in store fliers community outreach and an occasional ad in the harvard crimson these methods alone however failed to bring many customers into the store for scheduled food and cooking demonstrations "we couldnt get the word out " says mr bougas whose shop mainly competes with whole foods market inc but "now we can " he says thanks to mobile marketing mr bougas asks customers to sign up for the loyalty program and mobile alerts while theyre in the store then a few days before an in store event he sends an email to the roughly customers enrolled
