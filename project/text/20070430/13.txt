congress should kill the monster it created in in regard to stephen moores april editorial page commentary "those april blues" the flat tax is not the solution to the income tax problem the fairtax is the flat tax would take us back to congress would have a field day amending it to become the monster the irs is today the underlying problem is that members of congress use the irs to reward their special interest contributors with tax exemptions even worse they create tax deductions and tax cuts to seduce votes if congress eliminated all tax exemptions and deductions the government would soon be rolling in money then they could afford to lower taxes however if they legislated a consumption tax to take the place of the imbedded income tax and didnt tinker with it people could spend or save more of their hard earned dollars spending would increase revenue saving would give people the means to supplement health care college and retirement a consumption tax in place of our current imbedded income tax would lower the cost of exports by making them more competitive in foreign markets our trade deficit would shrink if politicians thought as much about their constituents and their country as they do about themselves they would rescind the th amendment and enact the fairtax richard f romfh nashville tenn the federal income tax code contains more than one million words and is probably not fully understood by anyone including congress or irs employees it is a national disgrace when even highly educated people must spend billions of unproductive hours and dollars seeking professional help trying to comply the code is a morass of confusion and an inefficient method of collecting revenue instead of simply raising funds to provide for our safety and security as our founders intended the collection of taxes has evolved into a giant wealth redistribution scheme congress has taken on the dubious responsibility of providing for the economic well being of a large portion of our citizens their attitude is that all americans have a "right" to everything and that the so called rich owe everyone else a living the top of federal taxpayers pay more taxes than the bottom about million people pay no tax at all the bottom of payers pay only of all taxes refuting the myth and cry that the bush tax cuts help only the rich the tax load for the upper has risen to almost of the total up from only of the burden in a targeted and punitive tax code might be expected in an overt socialist country but not here where equality is thought to prevail true equality refers to the starting line not the finish line realizing the american dream shouldnt require and compel being responsible for the livelihood of others john bailey nashville tenn stephen moore did a great job explaining how complicated our tax code is and how high taxes have gotten relative to what was originally promised in one other way to see the insidiousness of taxes is to realize that they are just as much the "noise" in the economy as prices are the "signals " the income you get paid is the price for your services and therefore signals the value of those services but taxes reduce the clarity of that signal hence they are noise by reducing how much of your pay you actually get to keep as taxes increase the noise to signal ratio in the economy increases even more meaning distortions and the misallocation of resources they cause increases disproportionately for example if the income tax rate is you keep of your income the noise to signal ratio is or but if the tax rate goes up by or to the noise to signal ratio goes up even more by to since you keep of your income the comes from equaling another increase in the tax rate increases the noise to signal ratio by from to then going from a tax rate to a tax rate makes it go up by from to every tax increase causes increasing damage to the economys ability to efficiently allocate resources cyril morong ph d associate professor of economics san antonio college san antonio texas
