at marathon a gamble on diesel demand projected to rise amid global warming concerns houston amid talk of cars powered by everything from ethanol to electricity to hydrogen one oil company is betting big on another alternative fuel diesel marathon oil corp is beginning construction of a &# billion addition to its largest refinery in garyville la the current facility like most u s refineries makes about twice as much gasoline as diesel the addition which marathon expects to begin production in the fourth quarter of will crank out roughly equal amounts of both the refinery expansion by houston based marathon wont materially affect u s fuel supply but it is significant for the long term gamble it represents broadly it reflects confidence that petroleum demand will keep growing but that the mix of fuels the industry makes from oil will shift in particular it demonstrates a growing sense within both the automobile and oil industries that increasing numbers of u s cars and light trucks will run on diesel because diesel powered vehicles get better fuel economy than those using gasoline both industries would welcome the shift many auto makers like diesel because they already make millions of light duty diesel engines in europe and they see exporting the technology as a relatively cheap way to answer calls for improved fuel economy in the u s the oil industry likes it for two reasons recently making diesel has become even more profitable and by about many in the industry predict u s gasoline demand will peak "as we look into the future we see a larger demand for diesel than we see for gasoline " says gary heminger marathons executive vice president thus far marathons bet is unusual among u s refiners some other companies are postponing planned refinery expansions altogether amid rising costs for materials such as steel those decisions are likely to further intensify tightness in the refining market tightness that is contributing to rising pump prices those that are expanding their u s refineries are doing so following the traditional u s pattern heavy on gasoline analysts say marathons move may be a harbinger of what is to come configuring a refinery to make additional diesel reflects "a strategic view " says doug leggate an oil analyst at citigroup inc "increasingly i think its something we need to be giving thought to " traditionally diesel has been seen as dirty burning it has emitted more of the pollutants that cause smog and respiratory problems than has burning gasoline but the oil industry has been cleaning up diesel fuel and the auto industry particularly in europe has been cleaning up the cars that burn it part of the impetus is that diesel is more desirable than gasoline in terms of a different environmental problem global warming largely because a gallon of diesel contains more energy than a gallon of gasoline does a vehicle burning diesel gets about better fuel economy than a comparable vehicle burning gasoline that means the diesel powered vehicle emits less carbon dioxide a global warming gas produced whenever fossil fuels are burned it also means a shift to diesel from gasoline helps curb oil demand generally addressing energy security concerns diesel still faces high hurdles though it has captured nearly half the light vehicle market in europe which long has stressed energy efficiency over clean air it accounts for only about of that market in the u s which historically hasnt cared as much about automotive fuel economy whether diesels u s penetration markedly increases depends on whether auto makers can produce diesel powered vehicles that are clean enough to meet toughening u s air pollution standards diesel also faces an image problem in the u s during the countrys last diesel push the one in the early s that followed the s energy crisis detroits smoke belching diesel cars gave the technology a bad name as a result mr heminger concedes diesel for cars and light trucks is "going to be a tough sell in the u s " but auto makers from detroits big three to japans honda motor co to europes major manufacturers are bullish on diesel auto industry consultant j d power &amp associates projects diesel vehicles will account for of u s light vehicle sales in as they do today u s sales of light duty diesel vehicles still will exceed sales of hybrid gasoline and electric models in j d power predicts the oil industry likes diesel because the fuel is increasingly profitable in march reflecting a long standing differential the spot price for a gallon of regular gasoline on the u s gulf coast was cents higher than for a gallon of diesel according to the u s energy information administration more recently with demand rising and tougher emissions rules limiting supply the prices switched last month the spot price for a gallon of diesel was six cents higher than for a gallon of gasoline globally robust economic growth has pushed up the demand for diesel which powers everything from trucks to construction equipment to farm machines demand growth has been particularly strong in china in europe refiners continue to shift to diesel reflecting the move within the light vehicle fleet in the u s diesel is becoming more profitable for refiners because of the toughening clean air rules those rules require refiners to drastically reduce sulfur a harmful pollutant they make diesel more expensive to produce but they also drive up the market price refiners "that can make a product that fits into the diesel market are going to get a premium " said doug macintyre senior oil market analyst at the eia marathon the sixth biggest u s refiner by total capacity according to the eia has yet another incentive to shift toward diesel in its louisiana refinery expansion a refinery that produces about diesel as the new part of the refinery will spins off extra slugs of another petroleum product known as gas oil that is needed to make gasoline marathon plans to funnel that excess gas oil back into its existing refinery which currently has to import large amounts of the substance the diesel from marathons refinery expansion is destined largely for the u s market though the facilitys location by the gulf coast means the company easily could export the fuel depending on where it gets the best price marathon has told wall street its louisiana refinery expansion should produce a return on capital of at least the companys mr heminger contends the actual margins will be "much higher" than that "world wide " he says "diesel is going to continue to be a tight commodity
