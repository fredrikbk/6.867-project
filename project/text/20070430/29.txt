goliaths gain momentum on davids profits spur large caps doubts linger the giants are finally staging a comeback the question is whether it will last for months wall street professionals have been recommending big company stocks as a safe bet in a slow growing economy only to be proven wrong as small stocks surged ahead now after the dow jones industrial averages run this month to records and its first close above gains for blue chip industrials this year are equal to those of the small stock russell index both are up but for just this month the industrial average is up compared with for the russell the gains for big household names like those in the industrial average were fueled by quarterly earnings gains that beat expectations for the likes of m microsoft and exxon mobil microsoft for instance posted a earnings surge and its stock jumped in one day on the nasdaq stock market for the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index that have reported first quarter earnings so far aggregate profits are up according to thomson financial which tracks corporate profits that is more than twice the gain that analysts were predicting earlier this month the common wisdom has been that large companies which often have more extensive overseas operations than small companies are better positioned to withstand a softer u s economy they also benefit from a weaker dollar because profits in foreign currencies look more impressive when translated into dollars the u s currency on friday touched its lowest point against the euro since the launch of the common currency in the dow jones industrials rose to a record friday closing at up for the week even as investors digested a surprisingly weak report regarding the u s economy in a preliminary estimate the commerce department said its yardstick of u s economic output the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of in the first quarter the slowest pace in four years the nasdaq composite index which includes many big technology names such as microsoft also rose for the week its fourth weekly gain in a row to close at it is now ahead for the year although still far from a record the s&amp p although it slipped on friday to rose for the week and is less than points from its record close reached in march by comparison the russell edged up or point to but large capitalization bulls seem to be ignoring the eye popping earnings gains among the smaller companies companies on the russell that have already reported first quarter results have seen their earnings grow nearly compared with the year earlier period according to russell indexes consumer spending is still strong and financial companies that are among the first to report results have benefited from relatively low interest rates says steve claiborne a spokesman for russell indexes yet small companies remain relatively pricey compared with big companies based on earnings for the past months "the fundamentals for the market are very positive right now especially as we get into the meat of the earnings season " says chris johnson chief executive and chief investment strategist at johnson research group "the expectations remain pretty low for the bread and butter companies so theres a lot of room for the market to respond to overperformance when the actual numbers come out " more than of the russell companies still have to report along with nearly of the s&amp p companies so the first quarter profit picture could still change considerably analysts are projecting that quarterly earnings will rise more than for s&amp p companies according to thomson projections for small companies are harder to come by because few of them are closely followed by analysts it is possible that across the board profit growth could slow in the second or third quarter although many on wall street are expecting a rebound in the fourth quarter on hopes that the federal reserve will cut its interest rate targets by then by lowering borrowing costs throughout the economy such a move by the fed would encourage various forms of investment and consumer spending boosting corporate profits there have been some signs of economic strength lately such as a relatively low unemployment rate which also boosts consumption still mike thompson research director at thomson financial concedes that he has been somewhat bewildered by the recent spate of strong profits "the danger for earnings season at this point is on the upside " meaning that earnings will come in so strong they may rekindle inflationary fears says mr thompson that could lead the fed to increase interest rates many wall street professionals consider the dow industrials recent run a reasonable response to strong profits and a relatively gradual therefore painless economic slowdown but there are some dissenters who see the rally as a sign that investors have finally gotten nervous enough about the economy to pile into the names they perceive as the safest if they are right the dow industrials and s&amp p may be due for a pullback bernie schaeffer chairman of schaeffers investment research says one sign of investors lingering jitters is the relatively high readings recently for the chicago board options exchanges volatility index a broad measure of the prices of options contracts that some investors use to guard against unexpected declines in shares they own the index known as the vix among traders soared following a headline grabbing one day market drop in late february that was prompted by overnight selling in asian stocks and amid worries over the u s housing market the index generally moves in the opposite direction of share prices because market declines tend to prompt options buying by investors the dow jones industrials the s&amp p and other market yardsticks have more than recouped their losses since the february declines but the vix remains nearly above its late february level mr schaeffer who favors small stocks thinks any jitters are misplaced at the moment in particular he thinks interest rates are low enough to prolong a spate of corporate acquisitions by private equity firms or large companies that want to snap up smaller competitors "i think theres a lot of room for the market to head higher across the board " including both large and small stocks says mr schaeffer "but i think its too soon for investors to effectively take themselves out of this wonderful world of buyouts which favors small stocks "
