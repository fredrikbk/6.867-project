politics &amp economics white house courts kyl to back immigration bill washington senate negotiations over an immigration overhaul bill have reached a tipping point as the white house tries to win over a border state hardliner while not driving off democrats heading in to the floor debate due to begin in two weeks the administrations legislative strategy is heavily keyed on sen jon kyl r ariz a conservative leader who criticized last years immigration bill for being too lax on enforcement and too forgiving of illegal aliens this year mr kyl has actively participated in talks led by homeland security secretary michael chertoff who is gambling that with mr kyls support the administration can win a majority of senate republicans and begin to make inroads in the house on what is become a legacy issue for president bush the house is waiting to see if the senate can complete action before the house takes up the issue this summer and democratic leaders want mr bush to provide a bloc of republican votes to ensure passage and provide political cover participants are reluctant to discuss details of the senate talks publicly but the heart of the white house strategy rests on pacifying conservative concerns over any "amnesty" in the bill by addressing a second concern on the right "chain migration " amnesty pertains to the legalization of undocumented workers in the u s chain migration speaks more to fears that new guest workers will gain permanent residency or each new immigrant citizen will be followed by a chain of relatives to break this chain the white house is proposing that current immigration rules that favor families would be replaced by more of a merit system making it harder to bring in siblings adult children and possibly even parents temporary foreign workers would be required to go home after three years or two if they had brought their families with them the core of the plan still promises millions of undocumented workers in the u s a path to citizenship which conservatives have criticized in the past as amnesty but the process would take longer to years and be more demanding than what was proposed last year mr kyl would have to swallow hard to accept legalization he could argue to his constituents that by accepting the presence of undocumented workers now in the u s he has won a greater measure of certainty about the future the proposed restrictions on temporary workers will anger labor allies in congress major immigrant groups especially asian americans will be upset with plans to tighten family immigration rules political tensions surfaced in drafting sessions last week and the white house no longer thinks there will be time to vet the bill by taking it through the senate judiciary committee mr kyl isnt completely won over yet but the administration is pressing to have a bill ready by may when senate majority leader harry reid d nev has set aside two weeks of floor debate commerce secretary carlos gutierrez also is taking part in the talks which represent a significant investment of time by two cabinet secretaries and by white house staff amid bitterness over iraq and an expected presidential veto of a war funding bill calling for troop withdrawals the appeals to bipartisanship on immigration stand out in a speech to graduating students at miami dade college on saturday and again in his weekend radio address mr bush pressed the need for some resolution the president said it should be done "without amnesty and without animosity " "we must address all elements of this problem together or none of them will be solved at all " he said the senate talks may represent mr bushs last best chance to do this but participants on both sides put the chances of success at sen edward kennedy d mass the lead democratic negotiator faces pressure from immigration rights groups and could yet bolt and take a bill to the floor without mr kyls support but the white house believes that the long process has forged enough loyalty among all the republicans in the talks that even moderates on immigration who supported last years bill will be reluctant to join mr kennedy for the massachusetts democrat the administrations credibility rests on its promise to deliver on a so called "eight and five" formulation for the legalization of undocumented workers now here eight refers to the number of years designated to clear the backlog of pending applications for permanent residency documents or "green cards " from persons abroad or living here with a legal work visa five refers to a five year period afterwards in which democrats have been promised that sufficient new green cards will be issued so that the undocumented workers who have come forward to be legalized and meet the criteria set can get permanent residency that represents a huge administrative challenge for mr chertoffs department to limit the numbers and ease conservative fears of too many green cards the application backlog would be confined to people who applied before may when major immigration legislation was introduced in the senate in the last congress there also is an unstated assumption that there will be significant attrition among the undocumented workers who actually apply early estimates were as low as six million or about half of the estimated million in the u s but administration officials say those predictions are outdated and the white house is committed to providing adequate green cards so that all who qualify will get on in the five year period even so an immigrant must have his green card for another five years before becoming a citizen that means the earliest undocumented workers could apply in years compared to about years under last years bill one outstanding question is how seasonal agriculture workers fit into the picture before the current immigration overhaul debate a strong bipartisan coalition representing growers and the united farm workers drafted "ag jobs" legislation that held open a faster path to a green card for farm workers and attempted to stabilize a seasonal work force for producers wage concessions were made then to growers and if conservatives demand a still lower pay scale now as part of the bargaining on the larger bill it could have explosive results not just in the senate but the house
