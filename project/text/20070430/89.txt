view from paris airplanes tracked globally frenchmans hobby grows into authoritative registry the chopped up tupolev paris nearly commercial airliners fly around the world and alexandre avrane tracks each of them through a telescope in his penthouse apartment mr avrane can spot planes miles beyond paris but his real intelligence lies in a global network of airplane fanatics from tehran to lima to shanghai the frenchman even has a pair of eyes in goma near war torn congos border with rwanda maximo j gainza a fellow enthusiast from buenos aires in february emailed mr avrane an interesting nugget a boeing that had been in the fleet of bolivian flag carrier lloyd aereo boliviano for years was still flying mr gainza wrote setting a record for the longest time served by a plane with a single airline "its like tracking missing sheep for a global shepherd " says mr gainza a year old travel agency manager who spends an afternoon a week checking out planes at the argentine capitals downtown jorge newbery airport documenting the genealogy of planes started a decade ago as a hobby for mr avrane a year old former software manager for oracle corp in france today his aerotransport data bank is a subscription based online catalog with detailed information on successive owners operating history and unusual features of nearly military and civilian jet and propeller planes including ones in the scrapheap serving the fascination of aviation fans around the world as aircraft play an increasingly vital role in shipping humanitarian aid transport and smuggling mr avranes compendium is a valuable tool for others as well used aircraft brokers aid organizations tour operators and even intelligence agencies which mr avrane declines to name are among the subscribers to the database information about planes has become such a valuable commodity that the field of plane cataloging is getting crowded in addition to the aerotransport data bank or atdb there are at least three other global databases so mr avrane seeks his competitive advantage in remote corners of the world "you dont learn about russian aircraft being in moscow its by being in kinshasa " and other isolated places where many of them fly says mr avrane who runs atdb from a corner of his glass walled living room he prefers to work at night spending hours verifying tidbits emailed by his world wide web of informants mr avrane began photographing airliners around the world for fun in when jet travel was largely for the rich and airports opened up their observation decks to the public by the time he was thanks to family connections in the travel business mr avrane had traveled on a shoestring to thailand india and australia to snap planes with his nikon camera on the road he would annotate a copy of jp airline fleets international a page annual publication first put out in the mid s which lists every commercial jetliner in the world based on what he saw and learned from other enthusiasts mr avrane would update entries in the book such as details on which airlines owned individual planes over the years he compiled separate lists of military aircraft developing a particular penchant for forgotten planes mr avrane wrote a history of the caravelle a french jetliner from the s that was notable for its triangular windows which was published in britain even when mr avrane got a job in the computer business in he kept at his hobby by traveling taking pictures of planes and updating lists of aircraft on an early apple computer as the internet advanced so did mr avranes idea of turning his hobby into the business that became atdb at first mr avrane posted his lists for fun and free of charge aviation enthusiasts discovered the site and started sending him information from around the world to flesh out missing data by atdb had grown enough that when the internet bubble burst and mr avrane was laid off as director of technology at oracle in france he wasnt worried thanks to a pile of oracle stock and options "i can afford not to be paid " says mr avrane who devoted his full attention to atdb and made it a paid site a year later mr avrane hasnt needed to pay his contributors either indeed as word spread that the frenchman was building up his database the ranks of his informants swelled the airline buffs provide information and voluntarily point out outdated information and items that need to be corrected atdb today holds more than entries on civilian and military transport planes any jet or propeller plane qualifies as long as it holds at least people mr avrane links the planes to more than operators ranging from major airlines to antarctic airways the saudi royal family and the u s central intelligence agency subscribers pay anywhere between about &# a year for access to limited data and about &# for a full one year subscription mr avrane doesnt disclose revenue or profit figures for atdb for mr gainza in argentina helping mr avrane means putting a lifelong hobby to good use the buenos aires travel manager is the son of an aviation journalist who flies world war ii vintage soviet yakovlev fighter planes chatting with an aircraft mechanic in mr gainza learned that a boeing parked at a buenos aires airport had completed flights in years making it one of the most traveled s in the world he quickly alerted mr avrane a source in germany recently emailed mr avrane another tidbit a year old boeing last flown by the government of togo had come out of storage near bucharest to fly for the government of mali mr avrane doesnt take all the information at face value when a source in russia emailed a photograph of a soviet built tupolev jetliner being chopped up in samara southern russia mr avrane turned to a tupolev expert to get more details before posting the entry the specialist confirmed the planes serial number based on traces of its paint in december when a u s subscriber to atdb emailed about a new carrier being established in eritrea in east africa mr avrane hesitated to post the news "it took a while to get a second confirmed sighting " he recalls for humanitarian organizations that often lease planes for aid flights being able to rely on airtight information on atdb is crucial says michel schaffner head of flight operations at the international committee of the red cross in geneva "if a plane was on the congolese registry for years we can say it would be in less good condition than if it were on the swiss registry " mr schaffner says
