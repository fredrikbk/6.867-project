hobbled by injuries this year making the win dallas mavericks anemic play against the golden state warriors the bigger surprise after last nights warriors victory dallas must win three straight to survive and advance in the final seconds dallas was trailing by three points a margin equal to the value of a successful remarkable half court heave by baron davis as the buzzer sounded on the first half the golden state crowd erupted and it was just getting warmed up for the games finale "the final moments were just about as sweet as a sports fan can know " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "davis dribbling out the clock in preparation for one last dagger took a step back and drilled one over devin harris andris biedrins slammed home a dunk got fouled and with the crowd noise at a deafening pitch i swear ive never heard anything louder in any sport there was a smiling stephen jackson lurching forward in exultation fists clenched as if his whole crazy life had been validated " fresh off their impressive sweep the bulls will next face the detroit pistons who swept the orlando magic after his teams final game of the season magic guard grant hill said hes considering retirement the orlando sentinels mike bianchi says he was rooting for mr hill "one of the most respected players to ever play the game " to end his career on a happier note "nobody in

the myriad medical maladies " meanwhile with the los angeles lakers one game from elimination against the phoenix suns guard lamar odom is contemplating what could be his final stand in l a mr odoms story "was about more than his second half points and second half rebounds " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times " it was even about more than how after great personal strife he has had an extraordinary season that should rank among the most heartfelt in lakers history " that great personal strife was the death of mr odoms infant son jayden last summer yet mr odom who has played hard through injury and grief is better suited elsewhere mr plaschke writes two stars with stanley cup finals experience led their teams to victory in sundays nhl conference semifinal games the new york rangers beat the sabres in the second overtime to narrow buffalos series lead to and jaromir jagr looked inspired and motivated as he scored new yorks first goal and screened the goaltender on the clincher the second play was the more notable one because mr jagr had ventured outside his comfort zone bucky gleason writes in the buffalo news "jagr has spent most of his career on the perimeter mixing a ton of skill with an ounce of passion at least thats always been the book on him the slot long ago was deemed too hazardous for his health " still mr gleason adds "the sabres arent anywhere near in trouble in this series " in the west the anaheim ducks took a lead in their series against the vancouver canucks behind stellar play from goalie jean sebastien giguere the hero of anaheims run to the finals "this was a year old dvd come to life " mark whicker writes in the orange county register he adds that giguere "spread his arms around the huddled masses and took them to shore for those

favorite to win next years super bowl according to mr steele and many other columnists today but how will mr moss who has admitted to loafing when hes not motivated gel with the supposedly team oriented pats and what about brandon meriweather drafted in the first round by the pats from the university of miami where he infamously stomped on a florida international player during a brawl "the patriots this weekend put their standards on the shelf in the quest for victory " dan shaughnessy writes in the boston globe the fix wonders if in two years mr shaughnessy will write columns similar
