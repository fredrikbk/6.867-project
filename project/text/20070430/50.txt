politics &amp economics unions pose trouble for democrats on trade pacts house leadership nears bipartisan agreement on white house deals washington a proposed compromise that seeks to secure congressional passage of several free trade deals by strengthening foreign workers rights has yet to win over a key constituency u s labor unions house democratic leaders and the white house are nearing agreement on a bipartisan pact that could pave the way for action later this spring on u s trade deals with panama and peru officials from both sides said proposed trade deals with colombia and south korea will likely face greater scrutiny but key u s labor unions say they are doubtful that the administration will agree to strong enforceable protections for foreign laborers they suggest they might oppose the pending deals when they come to the house floor a move that could throw a wrench into any democratic leadership efforts to rally rank and file members to approve the deals many unions oppose free trade agreements to begin with on the ground that increased foreign competition costs americans manufacturing jobs but u s labor unions acknowledging the importance of global trade have long focused on workers rights abroad partly in solidarity but also because they argue that low work standards overseas present unfair competition union officials remain apprehensive about the outcome of the democrat white house talks "theres an enormous amount of concern among a lot of union leaders and workers" over the talks said thea lee director of policy at the afl cio gary hubbard a spokesman for the united steel workers agreed "we are skeptical there isnt a lot of trust toward this administration " congressional democrats and the administration have been wrangling for weeks over a package put forward in march by rep charles rangel a new york democrat who chairs the house ways and means committee under his proposal the white house would draft u s trade deals to better reflect democratic priorities after which democratic leaders would help ensure the deals passage by congress the main sticking point in the talks now is how far to go in inserting labor rights into the forthcoming trade deals democrats want to incorporate the basic principles for workplace rights outlined by the geneva based international labor organization those include banning forced labor and child labor limiting workplace discrimination and protecting the rights of workers to organize and bargain with their employers democrats also want to include language on environmental protection in the deals and to give developing countries easier access to low cost medicines the administration and congressional republicans have pushed for assurance that including such language in trade deals wouldnt expose u s labor laws to legal challenge a limit that would likely concern the unions union leaders also want to ensure that the ilo standards would be enforced using the same rules and sanctions as used to enforce business commitments in trade deals such as patent protections for brand name drugs in the past the white house has only been willing to deal with labor rights issues in side agreements and opposed strong enforcement measures matthew beck a spokesman for mr rangel said talks are likely to extend into this week "theyre working to reach an agreeable solution on the outstanding issues " he said union opposition to a democrat white house compromise could pose a challenge for mr rangel and his boss house speaker nancy pelosi who hope to persuade a large bloc of house democrats to back the pending free trade deals the deals would mark the first trade legislation put before a democratic controlled house in more than years and would help ms pelosi shift her party back toward the center on trade deepening jitters over globalization among voters helped sweep democrats to power in congress in november many lawmakers have been reluctant to comment on the talks with the white house pending an outcome and it remains unclear how they would respond to union opposition but strong objections from labor groups could sap support for the deals at least among some members such as those who rely heavily on union support so far union officials have been monitoring the talks and meeting with lawmakers and congressional aides but havent made any high profile efforts to express their concerns mr rangel on thursday met with afl cio president john sweeney to brief him on the negotiations house democratic leaders said they are unsure that they could meet the afl cios range of concerns with the bush trade agenda but hope they can at least forge a deal that the influential labor group doesnt actively oppose even if it doesnt actively support it said individuals familiar with the discussions other unions including the united auto workers teamsters machinists and united steel workers are also growing increasingly anxious about the course of the rangel led discussions and could come out in opposition to any final deal when it hits the house floor said congressional aides and labor officials the stakes are also high for the bush administration it hopes to clear the way by the end of june for congressional approval of the pacts with panama peru and colombia as well as the just signed deal with south korea the reason for the self imposed deadline the presidents so called fast track authority which gives him the right to agree to deals that are subject to an up or down vote by congress expires at that time the panama and peru deals appear to have the least amount of political baggage the deal with south korea faces major opposition among lawmakers who want stronger commitments to open the korean market to u s beef and auto exports the colombia deal is also likely to face stiff scrutiny as many democrats remain concerned about the level of violence against labor organizers in that country last week a group of more than house democrats wrote mr rangel stressing the importance of democratic priorities on worker and environmental issues and underscoring how tight his maneuvering room is within the house democratic caucus "we strongly urge you not to back down from any of the goals you have proposed " said the letter which was signed by reps betty sutton of ohio and michael michaud of maine among others
