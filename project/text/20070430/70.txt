small business a special report start ups and spouses starting a business can strain a couples financial and marital life it pays to follow some simple rules when a married person embarks on an entrepreneurial endeavor its often the other spouse whos left holding up the familys finances take kim and ryan woodings after two years of marriage the young couple from boise idaho were relatively prosperous but things changed in june when they invested half their savings in metageek llc a company started by mr woodings the woodingses shelled out &# in hopes of selling by year end wi spys a hardware and software combo mr woodings developed to help users detect radio waves that interfere with the performance of their computers but demand was greater than expected so mr woodings years old quit his job as a systems engineer less than a year later to devote himself to metageek full time that left ms woodings an assistant registrar at boise state university as the familys sole breadwinner her take home pay was less than half the couples earlier combined income and just barely covered monthly bills "when he said he wanted to quit his job and go full time on the business thats when i got nervous " says ms woodings "i knew we would have to make big lifestyle changes to live on my salary " the couple cut back on luxuries and set a deadline for mr woodings to pull the plug and look for permanent employment if the business didnt work out luckily sales of wi spys have soared allowing mr woodings to hire staff and draw out lump sums of cash when necessary for family expenses besides guts and determination more often than not it takes the income of a working spouse like ms woodings to help start a business of self employed u s workers in were married according to the small business administrations office of advocacy but shifting from two paychecks to one isnt easy for two income couples often financial difficulties or the fear of them can cause tension "starting a business isnt an easy process in the first place " says doug wilder president and head coach of wilder business success inc a coaching firm in jacksonville fla "when you couple with that the emotional trials that go into a marriage and the business you have a recipe for danger " family problems can worsen if the entrepreneur spends every waking moment on building the new venture "when one spouse is putting to hours a day into the business and the other spouse is working to keep money coming in the big pitfall is family life " says john keener president of kelsey group inc a business advisory and coaching company in st louis "they dont have a lot of time together and if they dont have much cash the pressure on the breadwinner is strong " here are suggestions from business owners spouses and experts on how couples can cope with financial concerns that may arise make a plan and talk it over having a plan that both partners can discuss and agree to is crucial because it helps ease uncertainties and pressures later on the plan should include nonfinancial success milestones such as the number of new customers or needed certifications as well as financial ones mr wilder says that way when the business isnt making money partners can discuss the activities the entrepreneur has completed that will help generate revenue he says "you need to get away from looking at success as dollars and see it as activities that are required to bring in dollars eventually " he says "this helps when the entrepreneur comes home and says no money came in today and the other one asks well were you working " dylan ross didnt expect to make money immediately when he started swan financial planning a financial advisory firm in december with no money coming in initially having a business plan that showed concrete success milestones was critical says mr ross he and his wife helen worked on the plan for about a year before they were satisfied it was especially important for helen to sign off on it because as an operations vice president at merrill lynch &amp co she would be the familys primary breadwinner "we talked about how long it would take before i would generate income and the sacrifices we would or might have to make during this time " says mr ross who has an office in princeton n j "it was a year of talking about this and that " to complicate matters the couple was expecting twins when mr ross started his business the babies were due six months later and he wanted to be available to help so the plan for the business was based on his working no more than hours weekly "working harder might build the business faster " he says "but we would be stressed " mr ross says they have continued to modify their plan to meet continuing and developing needs and are happy with the progress of the business so far set limits on financial and time investments for many couples establishing how much to invest in a new venture is smart says mr wilder the spending limit sometimes is coupled with a timetable showing how long the entrepreneur has to devote to the new venture "they should decide on the limits for the cash outflow of the business and how long they should try " mr wilder says "that way when things get tough the entrepreneur can say we agreed i would have this much more time " the woodingses limited their initial investment to &# in savings which they have since replenished they also decided to give mr wilder nine months to devote to the venture "we knew that if the business wasnt making money by the end of that would be the end " mr woodings says line up other sources of income in case of emergencies the working partner may be able to cover monthly expenses such as food and housing but when the roof must be replaced or the car needs repairs it can play havoc on the familys financial equilibrium "be prepared to be creative with finances " says jill levinson director of marketing for communispace corp a marketing strategy firm in watertown mass after her husband rob hung out his shingle as a marketing consultant in boston five years ago the family experienced so many financial highs and lows "we were manic depressive " ms levinson says to make ends meet they sometimes turned to family members for short term loans even their dentist allowed them to delay payments she says the couple repaid every loan and now mr levinson earns more from his company brand blueprint llc than he did as an executive dont bring a spouse onboard immediately by working full time spouses usually provide the familys medical insurance and other important benefits not having to buy these is a significant advantage for fledgling entrepreneurs who dont have the cash flow to afford benefits large companies provide "small businesses get hammered on health care " says kelsey groups mr keener "with the spouse working this is one thing they dont have to absorb " but as small businesses grow and new employees are needed some couples believe it makes sense to put the working spouse on the payroll he says this requires the business to shell out needed cash for medical insurance and puts both partners at risk if it fails "they have a tendency to hire the breadwinner in the family so now they have all their eggs in one basket " mr keener says "if the company doesnt make it they are lost completely " take turns being the entrepreneur it isnt wise for both partners to be independent entrepreneurs in the beginning because their earnings can be unstable "one may have to put his or her dream on hold for a while " says mr wilder "they may say ill let you do this for a while and in x years i get a turn " one reason the levinsons were financially stressed when mr levinson started his company was that his wife was also an independent consultant at the time it was "nerve racking" for both partners to receive income sporadically ms levinson says when both had paying clients and checks arrived regularly life was good but when both were pitching business and had no receivables tensions would grow "its difficult for a single consultant " she says "but when two people were doing it the difficulties were exponential " communispace was one of her clients and when it offered her a full time job in she accepted she now provides the familys health benefits saving the couple about &# monthly mr ross says his flexible schedule is attractive to his wife and the couple has discussed ways she may be able to work independently if the business is successful "once i left a paying job with benefits " he says "it took away the option for her to do that at least until im established " ms capell is the careers q&amp a columnist for careerjournal com she can be reached at reports wsj com
