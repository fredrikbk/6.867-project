slatkins star shines at limited designer harry slatkin creates expensive candles for the likes of retailers saks and neiman marcus he likes to drop the names of pals such as sir elton john and rock musician lenny kravitz yet mr slatkin has had an unlikely success at bath &amp body works the middle america mall staple owned by limited brands inc of columbus ohio bath &amp body works bought mr slatkins high end company in and made him the retailers president of home design last year under his direction limiteds total sales of home fragrance everything from candles to room sprays to "scented rocks " an updated version of potpourri increased this fall limited plans to plaster mr slatkins name on more of its candles replacing the "white barn" label it has used for years and last week bath &amp body works launched a line of candles that mr slatkin designed with the help of another friend sarah ferguson duchess of york when he joined bath &amp body works the year old mr slatkin who lives on manhattans upper east side publicly criticized the candles that the store division was selling at the time calling their watermelon and cherry fragrances "insulting" to customers he was an odd match for a chain that limited created in and until about five years ago referred to as "the farmstand in the heartland " it was known for selling fruit scented body lotions beneath its gingham awnings but mr slatkin says the company encouraged him to spend money to upgrade its products as part of a broader effort to move bath &amp body works upscale that strategy has brought four straight years of improvements in both sales and operating income mr slatkin says limited spent generously on testing to work on what he calls his "recipe " developing a candle that burned evenly and didnt overheat on the outside with limiteds purchasing power the candle sells for &# in bath &amp body works and white barn candle co stores he still designs a separate high end candle line sold in department stores and boutiques under his name these slatkin &amp co candles of comparable size to the new line sell for &# to &# online at neiman marcus "i think the customer has become more sophisticated because i think magazines are more sophisticated " he says "they no longer shy away from lemon verbena because they dont understand it " today the stores candles have names like "water lily" and "golden mimosa " packages for recent holiday products used a technique called "gauffrage " or heat stamped velvet after studying the fur trims and rustic styles of fashion designers recent collections mr slatkin suggested that bath &amp body works create a holiday theme called "perfect christmas aspen " which was a success with customers but when he actually visited the ski resort town he wasnt impressed "the aspen i had dreamed of was much more romantic " he says mr slatkin who spent eight years working at u s investment bank bear stearns cos launched his business in when his brother an interior designer tired of making candles as a side project and turned the operation over to him working out of a storefront that they had used for a home decor shop mr slatkin tinkered with the formulas until he developed candles that kept their fragrance and burned slowly and evenly he got a break when rose marie bravo who had recently been named president of saks visited his store at saks inc she began stocking the candles on the same floor as couture dresses soon he added other upscale customers at bath &amp body works mr slatkin has recruited famous friends the chain has sold elton john candles for years with proceeds benefiting the singers aids foundation the duchess of york says she had doubts about putting her name on the product even though some of the proceeds will go to her favorite charity worried that people would think she was crassly trading on her position in the british royal family she says she nearly backed out several times "i was thinking who am i going to let down this time " the duchess says as a lure mr slatkin often uses the promise of philanthropy he helped found a school in new york for autistic children ultimately the duchess was won over by the idea that a portion of the profits could support her foundation which funds childrens charities from the start she says she knew that she wanted the candles to smell like tea her mother died in a car accident four years ago she says and "i remember that when i was little whenever i was having a problem shed say lets sit down and have a cup of tea and a biscuit " mr slatkin began the process by testing more than scents narrowing them down to his favorites after the duchess weighed in he tried to more eventually to the tea base perfumers at international flavors &amp fragrances inc added other scents she likes such as bergamot ginger and mint the candles have names like "royal ty " "digni ty" and "tranquili ty " a set of all five fragrances sells in a prim green hatbox when asked to bring some items from her home in for inspiration for the candles packaging the duchess and an assistant lugged in a trunk laden with notecards fabric lace old wedgwood china and a napkin with the queen mothers monogram still cautious she intervened when bath &amp body works designers wanted to incorporate a symbol of the royal family into the packaging they settled instead on a crown a honeybee and the letter "s " throughout design meetings the duchess would talk about "mavis " the name she gave the typical bath &amp body works customer whom she envisioned as an american housewife "shes going to be so pleased " the duchess says of the imaginary mavis "every time she lights this she will think maybe i can change my life " unlike some of his friends mr slatkin isnt a household name but he hopes that will change saying he wants to be known as "the oprah of the home " "the great thing about oprah is that shes never spoken down to her audience " he says
