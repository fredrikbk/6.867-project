small business a special report cause and effect linking a national franchiser to a charity can both unify an organization and help businesses stand out in their local markets many franchisers are adding a new ingredient to the formula they give independent operators a charitable cause the tactic known as "cause marketing " isnt new to large companies such as american express co general mills inc and home depot inc which for years have linked themselves to special charities or social causes and raised funds through promotions or merchandise sales one of the more visible recent examples was nike inc s pairing with the lance armstrong foundation to sell yellow "livestrong" wristbands which raised money for cancer research and created a brief yet memorable international fashion statement now many franchisers are picking a cause at the national level think breast cancer or needy children or world hunger in an effort to unite franchisees in various markets convey a consistent image and boost their profiles and bottom lines the technique is being used to help franchisees make a splash in the communities where they are based sometimes even before they open "its increasingly popular

proceeds to the cause "we didnt know what to expect " mr leonard says "we thought wed raise &# " instead the various gyms and their members raised more than &# which contours corporate office matched dollar for dollar while contours initially thought of the partnership as simply philanthropic "it certainly does have the potential to not only do good but trickle down to all our franchisees and give them a community feel to their marketing " he says making inroads in the local community is why rapid refill ink a chanhassen minn franchiser that refills ink and toner cartridges assigned a social issue environmentalism to its independent operators in locations "we tell the franchisees heres a marvelous opportunity to get involved " says steve hockett rapid refills president rapid refills franchisees receive large cardboard bins emblazoned with the rapid refill name that can be placed in offices at schools churches and charitable organizations for the collection of used ink and toner cartridges rapid refill which promises to pay as much as &# for each used cartridge collected picks up empties weekly and sends out checks monthly the stores can resell the cartridges and the nonprofits can use the money on any programs they see fit some franchisees place recycling bins in the community before they open their doors mr hockett says "it allows us to generate awareness of who we are even before we open " he says some franchisees say the cause is what drew them to the chain in the first place jack plomgren of norfolk va who had spent much of his career in the recycled paper
