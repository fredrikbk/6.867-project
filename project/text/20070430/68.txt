small business a special report inside jobs small business owners need to trust their employees up to a point diann cattani is the face of small business fraud ms cattani spent months in a federal prison in florida from to for stealing on the job a trusted employee at a small business owned by a husband and wife she spent &# of company money on personal items over four years before turning herself in to her boss now she speaks around the country in a fraud prevention program called "taking the harder right" a series of seminars conducted by oliver g halle &amp associates inc an atlanta based firm that specializes in corporate ethics and antifraud training theres a big audience out there for ms cattani small businesses are victimized by fraud more often and lose more money than other companies "its not just that the frauds are larger relative to the size of the companies theyre just larger in absolute terms " says dana hermanson an accounting professor at kennesaw state university in kennesaw ga "thats a profound result that speaks to the need for fraud prevention and internal controls at small companies " the reason small businesses make such inviting targets is that the same things that make a small business successful also open the door to trouble trust in the employees can become an invitation to steal entrepreneurial spirit may make it hard to delegate depriving a business of the middle management expertise that can be so useful in detecting fraudulent activity and a small work force may keep a business nimble but also vulnerable without staff to reconcile the books and exercise other controls "the entrepreneurial skills it takes to get a business off the ground arent the same that allow you to run it over the long haul " says wayne rivers co founder and president of family business institute inc a consulting firm based in raleigh n c but there are several steps small business owners can take to avoid being victimized including demanding accountability from their employees setting the right tone with their own behavior and instituting procedures that minimize the chances of fraud going undetected a report by the association of certified fraud examiners found that businesses with fewer than employees tend to suffer the biggest losses from fraud their median loss that year was &# higher than that in even the largest organizations median losses were &# at companies with more than employees and &# at companies with more than employees the most common frauds in small businesses involve employees writing company checks fraudulently skimming revenue and processing fraudulent invoices according to the acfe a trade organization based in austin texas a big part of the problem at small businesses is too much trust small business owners often extend so much trust to employees that they may even hold back from asking crucial questions for fear of destroying a relaxed atmosphere "when you communicate to people that youre really looking out for their welfare beyond your needs theres a real chance they may begin to believe they can do what they want " says joe astrachan director of the cox family enterprise center at kennesaw state university and editor of the family business review in the case of ms cattani trust worked against her bosses she was the first employee hired by the human relations consulting firm she later defrauded and was responsible for signing checks overseeing the payroll and communicating with attorneys and accountants among other duties "i had complete autonomy " says ms cattani trouble started when her travel agent mistakenly put a personal holiday trip by ms cattani and her family on the business account ms cattani spotted the mix up and intended to mention it but let the matter slip as holiday bills mounted "once it got gray for me i dont think i paid for another meal personally " ms cattani says "i was working out of the home and i expensed company furniture but i wasnt honest about it i got greedy " her bosses never questioned her "youve got to ask the questions " says ms cattani "say show me show me the receipt that proves you were at dinner with these clients " another problem comes down to size small businesses often dont have the staff to maintain important controls the most common fraud scheme perpetrated on small businesses is check tampering according to the acfe check tampering frequently occurs when a person with access to the companys checkbook also is responsible for recording payments and reconciling company bank statements "this scheme often arises when limited personnel make it difficult to segregate duties " the acfe wrote in its report small staffs also tend to lack a broad range of expertise business owners arent "bankers and chief financial officers theyre entrepreneurs and generally not very sophisticated on financial topics " says mr rivers of the family business institute "they learn through on the job training and usually only enough to minimize taxes its really easy to rip them off financially " experts tell small business owners to watch for something they call the fraud triangle the notion is that trouble arises when three elements are in play pressure or incentive opportunity and rationalization owners are advised to watch for the employee who might be under financial pressure have the opportunity to misappropriate funds and have a questionable frame of mind or character business owners should also look at their own behavior carefully and set an example mr astrachan says making expenses transparent and justifying them to the group should be part of this he adds for example an owner requisitioning a company car computer or bank account for personal use doesnt always hurt the firm if kept in check but it can hurt the financial position and morale of the company if it gets out of hand "in my experience if owners treat the business as a personal bank account buying things not relevant to the business they are encouraging employees to do so too " mr astrachan says keeping compensation clean is important too according to ira bryck director of the umass family business center in hadley mass mr bryck advises small businesses that its best for an owner to be paid separately for roles as owner and manager as a manager an owner "should be paid a salary that you would pay anyone for doing your job " says mr bryck separately he says the owner is entitled to a dividend based on the companys financial performance small business owners should also think about adopting formal controls to prevent fraud five common antifraud measures outlined by the acfe are a fraud hot line or anonymous reporting mechanism fraud awareness or ethics training for employees and managers an internal audit department surprise audits and external audits in addition a small business owner concerned about check tampering might take basic steps like insisting on signing all checks personally or having an unopened copy of the bank statement sent to the owners home so it can be reviewed independently and compared with the companys records proper accounting procedures also are critical joe kennedy who runs tsbom an accounting firm in los angeles says employees often know where the vulnerable spots are in a companys bookkeeping for instance taxes often are one of the biggest expenses for a business and small businesses often try to cut taxes by using the company credit card account for personal expenses mr kennedy says "a lot of owners just hand us their credit card bill and say just find a way to make them tax deductible " he says "they end up shooting themselves in the foot " he says because employees take advantage of this approach by using the company card for personal expenses above all business owners have one particularly powerful weapon against fraud according to jonny frank a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers where he is the fraud risk and controls national practice leader though they might not realize it the intimate knowledge most owners have of their business gives them an inner sense of where things can go wrong says mr frank "they need to unlock from their own minds the various ways the company could get in trouble or be defrauded " mr frank says if they dont someone like ms cattani might find the opportunity impossible to resist ms
