vanguard plans to set up active bond etf in a move that could be an important step for a new type of exchange traded fund indexing giant vanguard group inc plans an actively managed bond etf while there is at least one other proposal for an active bond etf before the securities and exchange commission the move is significant because of vanguards large presence in the etf industry it is the third largest player by assets and because of its reputation as a champion of index investing exchange traded funds resemble index oriented mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock a number of etf fund companies have expressed interest in creating an actively managed etf that would employ a fund manager to make investment decisions on behalf of fund holders so far however etfs complicated inner workings have kept that goal out of reach the proposed vanguard fund was outlined in a filing with the sec in february the filing represents a relatively early stage in the process of getting an etf cleared by the sec the proposed etf wouldnt be a completely new fund but like other vanguard etfs a separate share class of one of vanguards existing mutual funds in this case it would be a new share class of the vanguard inflation protected securities fund which invests primarily in inflation indexed bonds backed by the u s government the existing fund has &# billion in assets and posted a five year annualized total return of through thursday according to morningstar kenneth volpert co manager of the fund says vanguard decided to file for an etf share class because the firm wanted to expand its recently launched line of bond etfs and doesnt offer a treasury inflation protected securities or "tips " index fund mr volpert declined to say what the proposed etfs expense ratio would be however expenses for vanguards existing bond etfs would put expenses of the vanguard inflation protected securities etf around of assets bond funds remain a small corner of the etf world vanguard and barclays global investors are the only firms with bond etfs and vanguards funds appeared just a few weeks ago several other firms have plans for bond etfs one a fund that would resemble a money market fund would come from bear stearns cos and would be actively managed bear stearns is a newcomer to etfs because of the paucity of bond funds compared with stock etfs they may seem like an unlikely standard bearer for the first actively managed etf a development the industry has been anticipating for several years but while the price of a stock usually is directly tied to the financial prospects of the issuer those same prospects often have less impact on prices of fixed income securities than broader matters like interest rates this is especially true for treasury securities backed by the credit of the u s government and for short term securities whose principal will soon be repaid this means it may be easier for bond etfs to substitute one security for another without hurting the overall performance of the fund an advantage in creating an actively managed etf according to the recent sec filing the vanguard bond fund aims to give market makers a "sample" of the funds underlying portfolio without disclosing its exact contents in the filing vanguard says the basket of securities is expected to duplicate to of the funds or so actual holdings at any given time
