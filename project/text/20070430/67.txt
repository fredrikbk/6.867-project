having a web site isnt enough anymore to be successful online they must learn to harness one of the webs most powerful tools search engines after all search engines like google inc yahoo inc and microsoft corp s msn are often shoppers first stops when theyre looking for a product on the web so its crucial for small businesses to show up prominently in search engine results and thats a complicated job search engines dont disclose their ranking formulas making it tough for small companies to figure out how to boost their sites results even worse big competitors can afford to pour lots of resources into that same effort putting small companies at a bigger disadvantage the good news while the exact ranking formulas are a mystery there are plenty of clues about how to improve a sites position add lots of relevant descriptions to the sites text including the search phrases for which you want a high ranking have other sites link to it offer a blog or other informational content for customers and if these efforts prove too complicated for a business to handle not to worry a whole industry has sprung up to help companies improve their rankings small businesses are discovering other search strategies as well theyre getting smarter about ads for instance pay per click ads that pop up for general search terms such as "clothing" tend to be very expensive so companies are buying ads for much more specific terms to cut costs many businesses are also focusing their efforts on search engine pages devoted to their own geographic area instead of trying to compete against businesses world wide heres a guide to the best ways for small businesses to nab better search results describe yourself placing high in search results for common search phrases known as natural or organic results to differentiate them from paid ads is getting ever more crucial studies show that web users predominantly click on the top four results for any particular search and then move on says shar vanboskirk senior analyst for forrester research inc in cambridge mass very few dig more than three pages into results one basic way to secure a better search engine ranking is peppering a sites text with carefully chosen keywords the kinds of phrases people would use to find the site with a search engine the search engines like it best when the keywords appear naturally in the sites text such as product descriptions says aaron wall a search marketing consultant in oakland calif so a good strategy is to add a generous amount of useful content that uses the keywords frequently such as beefier descriptions or informational articles the keywords on each page should also appear in that pages title tag the blue bar that appears at the top of each page less important though still helpful the keywords should appear in the metatags the invisible text that gives information about the contents of a page some webmasters try to game the system by hiding keywords in text that blends into the background but many search engines now penalize such practices with lower rankings smarter use of keywords was one of the first strategies allan dick employed to boost business at vintage tub &amp bath a hazleton pa company that sells reproductions of old fashioned bathtubs online a few years ago mr dick who helps run the employee company with his brother found he could increase traffic by using certain words in the product descriptions on vintages web site for instance adding more content and product descriptions that used common search terms words like "tubs" and "vintage tubs" frequently seemed to boost its ranking on search engines "it was dawning on me that if you were wording things in a certain way people would find us " says mr dick "it was aha theres a certain method to this " but that was just a first step mr dick bolstered his efforts by attending search marketing conferences to learn about search rankings and new optimization techniques and the work seems to have paid off last year his company had sales of &# million up from about &# million in and well above its &# million or so of revenue in it recently surfaced as the no site in a google search on "tub " out of million results the big choice for small businesses is which search phrases to focus on some companies concentrate on just a few phrases while others tackle or more the best number depends on factors such as how many different products are sold on the site the number of pages on the site each page can usually hold only a few keywords and how much time or money a company is willing to spend redesigning its site to attract search engines attention its also important to weigh how competitive the search phrases are instead of focusing on generic search words such as "books" or "mortgages " that already have hundreds of businesses wrangling over them small businesses often fare better focusing on longer specific phrases says mr wall for instance he suggests that a used book dealer who has a book signed by mark twain might try optimizing its web site around terms like "rare used books" or "autographed mark twain " instead of just "books " another advantage of this approach is that more specific search terms generally elicit higher customer conversion rates turning visits into sales since shoppers are more likely to find what theyre looking for there are other wording tricks small businesses can use to get better results businesses aiming to attract a high end clientele might add the word "professional" to the search phrases highlighted on their site or a business might try to boost the search ranking for its top selling brand name instead of just the generic product type but "the focus should always be on coming up with terms that customers actually use to find your business online " mr wall says many online forums and free tools can help businesses learn to optimize their sites on their own yahoos keyword selector tool lets users see which terms are typed into search engines most often other free tools such as googles analytics software keep track of a web sites visitor numbers keywords used to find the site and customer conversion rates other free tools available online can track which other web sites link to a businesss site make content suggestions and scan the site for keyword density or the percentage of the text in which the keyword is used one final wording tip a businesss domain name also plays into search rankings if the domain is "couch com " the site will probably rank much better for the keyword "couch" than if the domain name is "tomsfurniturestore com " be the expert loading up on search terms isnt the only way to improve a sites search rankings search engines are getting more sophisticated experts say and increasingly theyre rewarding sites that offer high quality useful consumer content for instance becoming an "evangelist" on your industry and posting helpful consumer information on your site is likely to boost its popularity and ranking take ice com an online jewelry business based in montreal besides selling jewelry the site includes a diamond buying guide a checklist with steps that couples should take before their wedding a blog and a feature where readers can ask questions about jewelry the site recently showed up th in a search for "jewelry" on google and seventh for "diamond jewelry " get lots of links another big factor in search engine results is the number of web sites that link to a companys site that are highly ranked by the search engines the more such sites the better many web sites that do well in search rankings spend time "link building " or trying to coax related sites to post links to them sometimes companies contact webmasters directly and try to forge relationships or they get a link in an online search directory such as yahoo directory which costs &# a year having interesting or informative content such as a blog also boosts the chance of getting links from another site the words used by other sites in links also factor highly into search results lets say another site links to tomsfurniturestore com which specializes in couches if the other site uses the word "couch" in its link it can help boost "toms" ranking for the keyword "couch " keep in mind though that no two search engines are the same "googles algorithm tends to place more weight on the authority and trust of the site " such as the number of links mr wall says "yahoo and msn place more weight on the page content " vanessa fox a product manager for google says the search engines "all have different things that were looking for in our page results " get some help for many small business people optimizing and asking for links can get technical and time consuming so an industry has sprung up in recent years to help businesses with their search results these companies called search engine optimizers or seos come in many flavors some are full service handling everything from redesigning a web site to writing content to determining which keywords are best to persuading other web sites to post links others are more like consultants they provide web site audits with recommendations on how to better optimize the site but the clients webmaster must implement the changes some focus on specific aspects of search optimization such as writing "search friendly" text or link building but businesses should be careful when hiring an seo because not every company offers the same expertise says ryan allis chief executive of virante a durham n c search marketing consulting firm and the results can never be guaranteed given the changing and sometimes mysterious nature of search engine rankings so businesses should take bids from several seos and ask to see the work theyve done for previous clients mr allis suggests an seo should also be willing to give regular reports showing how its efforts have affected the businesss search rankings for various search phrases then there are fees the prices for seos can be bewildering to many small business owners costs can range from &# a month to several thousand for what often seem to be almost identical services submit express inc an oakland calif seo charges a "setup" fee of &# to &# which includes keyword research optimization and link building says chief executive pierre zarokian then clients can pay a monthly fee ranging from &# to &# for continuing optimization efforts mostly link building he says the fees vary depending on how much work a site needs and how competitive it is already says mr zarokian for instance propelling a site from no to no in the search rankings may be a lot easier than moving it from no to no buy ads ads are another consideration marketing experts advise that most businesses are best served by complementing optimization with some paid ads on search engines it also can be a faster route to getting good exposure in search engines most major search engines now offer paid ads such as pay per click ads where the web site pays a set fee every time someone clicks on its ad google and yahoo let businesses bid on their per click fee for particular search phrases to garner a better ranking for their ad paid results appear right next to natural search engine results usually under a "sponsored ads" heading as with search results businesses should try to end up in the top few paid ads for common search terms if the per click fee is too high for popular phrases they should focus on more specific search phrases which usually cost less and convert to business more for example the average suggested per click fee for ranking in the top three paid results for "tennis rackets" recently was &# according to googles adwords keyword tool but "graphite tennis rackets" cost only about cents for some small business owners paid ads arent a complement to an optimization strategy theyre an alternative to it they dont want the headache of learning about search engine optimization or hiring a firm to do it so they rely exclusively on ads thats the case with geoffrey searles owner of apollo piano co a piano refurbishing and tuning business in grafton mass last september he began running pay per click ads through googles adwords program he bid on about keywords such as "piano repair" and "antique player pianos " and capped his monthly expenditure at &# since then his site has had an average of hits a month compared with about five a month before he started using ad words the ads have cost him about &# total and he estimates he has received at least &# extra in work he likes the ability to control his monthly spending and stop the ads when he has enough business "its just been so successful that i havent gone any further " mr searles says think locally small businesses should also consider focusing their efforts on one corner of the web many small locally based businesses such as dry cleaners and restaurants dont need web traffic from around the globe instead they want people in their area to find them easily online the solution local search these listings pop up sometimes with a map or customer reviews when somebody searches online for a business type in a particular geographic region type in "olympia wa pet groomer " at google for instance and youll get the option to see "local search results " this calls up a map of olympia and a list of local pet businesses with their locations marked on the map google like other search engines draws these local listings from third party directories and other sources for companies that want to buy ads accompanying these local listings the competition is much more limited than with general searches so the price is lower local search also can be particularly useful to small businesses without web sites some specialized local search engines such as citysearch com yellowpages com and superpages com even provide a free basic page for businesses that can include basic information about the company like phone number hours of operation and address a good way to get started in local search is to make sure all the local search directories include a listing for the business and that all the information such as phone number and address is accurate most local search directories also let businesses embellish their local search listings googles local business center for one recently began letting businesses post photos and many local search directories let them post hours of operation services provided and coupons businesses can also buy pay per click ads in local search results another consideration if a local business has a web site the owners should be sure all the information there is clear and accurate search engines extract some of their local search listings from location information found on web sites so its important for a business to include its address prominently on its home page with the state name spelled out since many search users spell it out when searching businesspeople should also include the city and state in the sites title tag to increase the odds search engines will find it danny sullivan editor of searchengineland com an online forum on search engine marketing practices says focusing on local search is easy and can pay off for many businesses "local search is still kind of open and many businesses dont realize its an option " mr sullivan says "so theres a lot of opportunity for that right now " ms spors is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at kelly spors wsj com
