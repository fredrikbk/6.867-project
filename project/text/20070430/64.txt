small business a special report early options tech entrepreneurs looking for seed money have more places to turn these days the world of dot com financing is changing and entrepreneurs are reaping much of the benefit while the competition for deals remains stiff investors and researchers say tech entrepreneurs looking for seed money have more varied options these days indeed some investor groups and venture capital firms are giving companies that are still in the concept stage faster access to modest amounts of cash and asking for less equity in return seed money used to turn an idea into reality is among the toughest financing to secure for tech related start ups banks and professional investors are frequently reluctant to jump in at such an early stage the few entrepreneurs who manage to cut deals with venture capital firms tend to give up huge chunks of equity something a lot of founders want to avoid but with the new approach driven in part by the falling cost of launching internet start ups some venture capitalists and so called angel investors are writing smaller checks and issuing them faster in return for either relatively small stakes upfront or convertible notes that can be turned into equity under certain future conditions angel investors wealthy individuals who fund companies and tend to take a hands off approach to day to day management were the largest source of funding at the seed and start up stages last year backing roughly such ventures according to the university of new hampshires center for venture research jeffrey sohl director of the center estimates that roughly of the &# billion in angel investments last year went to early stage companies dr sohl says some of angel deals were at the seed or start up stage a proportion that the center expects could grow to as much as in the next several years venture capitalists meanwhile invested in more than seed and start up deals in up from such deals in the center says "theres tons of money around and if you cant find it youre not ready to start a company " says kenneth morse managing director of the massachusetts institute of technologys mit entrepreneurship center tech coast angels corp a network of angel investors started in irvine calif recently launched a "seed track" funding program to get earlier access to companies candidates who look good on paper are invited to a screening session and have minutes to sell their idea to about angels with half the time used to field questions if investors are impressed the entrepreneur can get a check the same night or a few days later in return for as much as or so of the company depending on valuation and check size the tech coast network also offers more traditional funding for entrepreneurs but that route because it usually involves bigger investments can require about hours of due diligence checks for &# to &# in seed track funding are common says tech coast angels founder luis villalobos in some cases the angels wont take equity upfront but will issue a convertible note which would be turned into stock if the company later provided equity stakes in a formal funding round on the venture capital side quickstart seed funding program at charles river ventures llc menlo park calif offers loans of as much as &# at interest and takes no equity upfront if the start up does well and sells to venture capitalists the debt plus interest converts to stock at a discount of as much as a &# loan with interest factored in would be worth up to &# in stock a year later entrepreneurs should note however that the firm wants to be an equal investor in any future funding round so it could ultimately end up with a more traditional venture capital size stake in a company say or more successful companies that never go for another round of funding but are bought out by another company say or go public are expected to pay charles river double the amount that they borrowed a seattle based start up buddytv com a discussion forum for television fans that also features original interviews with tv stars is one of the first companies to get funding under the charles river program buddytv corp chief executive andrew liu says the &# check came just five to seven weeks after his first meeting with charles river the program was a "great thing for us because we didnt spend much time on fund raising and could focus on the execution " mr liu says the debt is currently outstanding mr liu hopes to have positive cash flow before trying for more funding for his company seed funding provider y combinator llc mountain view calif takes a slightly different approach it gives out less cash than most seed money investors a company with two founders gets a check for &# one with three founders gets &# but y combinator devotes more time to teaching young engineers with interesting ideas how to be entrepreneurs about a dozen fledgling companies at a time attend week programs in mountain view or cambridge mass where experts speak at weekly dinners then at week the start ups make presentations to potential additional investors with the last session drawing about outsiders y combinator usually ends up with about a stake but the range can be from to depending on the companys initial valuation "its much easier to get seed money than it used to be " says paul graham a partner at y combinator "ten years ago a bunch of college kids starting a start up had to go on hands and knees " but seed funding is still by no means easy money mr graham says this years winter session in mountain view had to applicants with the program accepting charles river gets five to submissions a day for its quickstart program but plans to fund only start ups this year says george zachary a partner in the firm "if it takes us more than five minutes to understand what the product is we are not going to fund it " mr zachary advises start up hopefuls who dont get funding right away sometimes need to improvise until they do find capital some venture capital firms like highland capital partners llc in lexington mass will give free or reduced rate office space to start ups that they like but arent ready to fund this allows the start up to work side by side with other entrepreneurs and investors almost the entire first floor of highlands lexington office is devoted to highland backed start ups says highland managing general partner paul maeder alternatively entrepreneurs can recruit engineers and other experts to the team in an effort to do as much as possible without outside investment daniel marques couldnt get funding for his first internet business started as a freshman at babson college babson park mass so he and his partner brought in a third person to help with the technical aspect the trio kept expenses low and eventually gained positive cash flow and attracted an angel offer finding the first risk taker can be difficult says the year old mr marques "but a lot of people want to be the second " no matter how successful a start up is at attracting capital new hampshires mr sohl advises researching the investor before accepting any of the money venture capitalists or angels with even a small chunk of equity can become a problem if their plans for the company differ from the founders plans make sure your visions align dr sohl warns "due diligence is a two way street " ms badal is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at jaclyne badal wsj com
