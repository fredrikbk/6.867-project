shaeffer mortimer where he worked for years mr shaeffer would bring yoga teachers into the office to teach "during the annual ritual of interviewing for new associates the potential candidates really liked the idea of doing yoga at work later recruits would come in telling us that they heard we offered yoga they thought it was the greatest perk " his current firm doesnt have space for yoga but they are looking for new offices and yoga space is a consideration the workout mr shaeffer wakes up at a m three mornings a week and drives five minutes to the sports club la where he takes an ashtanga class the room is dim and silent except for the sound of class members breathing loudly while mr shaeffer is settling into lotus a cross legged seated position another class member may be balancing in a handstand mr shaeffer says the mental aspect of ashtanga is just as challenging as the physical "one of the most difficult things to learn is to clear your mind " he says but hes found that a clear mind can often help solve work dilemmas once he was behind on some preparatory work for an arbitration and couldnt figure out how to resolve something he was going to skip yoga to finish his work but instead ended up going to yoga class during practice the solution to his work dilemma came to him mr shaeffer says he is constantly making progress in class it took him three months to get wheel pose backbend he is currently working on "scorpion " so named because the body resembles a scorpion with its tail arched above its head while balancing on the forearms the legs are lifted up into the air and then extend down toward the head "my teacher wants my feet to touch my head " he says "my feet are six inches away and i dont know if my back will bend anymore " he has suffered some injuries once while practicing he heard a tear and later realized that he had strained his hamstring he says it was minor "i did not stop practicing just kind of hobbled around " he says it took about six months for the pain to go away about a year and a half ago while in trial in san diego and doing bikram a type of yoga practiced in a heated room for a glossary of yoga types click here his knee popped out of the socket and hurt it still pops out even when hes not practicing but he says it doesnt hurt on the weekends mr shaeffer goes to the gym either in the morning or afternoon and runs on the treadmill at miles per hour for minutes or until he gets bored he then spends about to minutes lifting weights "i lift weights so i have the strength to do the yoga poses " he says however weight lifting does make him a bit stiff mr shaeffer uses a combination of free weights and machines and has ten to exercises he completes to get a full body workout he tries to do two to three sets of ten repetitions for each exercise when he is able to do repetitions with relative ease he increases his weight "big burly guys at the gym will look at me funny when im lifting crazy amounts of weight " he says "yoga makes muscles very efficient people think its just stretching and dont realize the strength that is involved im ridiculously strong but i dont have big muscles " when hes traveling for work he tries to attend yoga classes at other studios sometimes hell do yoga in his hotel room but he prefers a class "i do not think that i would be able to work out alone in my room " he says "there is some strange bond you develop with the other crazy people who wake up way too early to exercise in a dark room " the diet mr shaeffer makes a concerted effort to consume a wide variety of fruits and vegetables "anything that looks like table decorations at the grocery store i buy " he jokes because he wakes so early for yoga he rarely eats breakfast and if he does eat something its a piece of dry toast he packs lunch usually a simple turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread and two pieces of fruit an indulgence is going out for sushi at lunch he sometimes cooks spicy indian food for dinner "there is a great buddhist diet philosophy i try to abide by " says mr shaeffer "before you take a bite of something ask yourself do i need this people think just because its morning or noon they have to eat breakfast or lunch we dont eat because were hungry anymore " he says there are two types of trial lawyers those who eat a lot because its a distraction and those who forget to take a break to eat he says hes the latter some friends call him a food snob because if he doesnt like his food choices he just wont eat when he wants to treat himself hell spend &# or &# on a persian pear he skips dessert instead choosing to indulge in wine the cost mr shaeffer says that his monthly fee for the sports club la just went up to &# the atmosphere at the club is far from zen like but he likes its convenience "people dress up and valet park their cars " he says "usually gyms offer a more eclectic style of yoga so its bizarre theyre offering this here but no one else in l a has a a m class " pat soley group exercise manager at the sports club la says "one of our goals is to provide our members with the same sort of yoga program that any stand alone studios would offer " the effort mr shaeffer used to attend a p m yoga class but he wasnt getting home until p m and he rarely saw his kids during the week when the a m class started being offered he switched mr shaeffer says his life does not revolve around yoga and he doesnt get into the spiritual side of the practice "a lot of people in l a take their yoga very seriously and have this im more into yoga than you attitude " he says "i like to think everything in moderation " the benefit mr shaeffer spent nearly five months as part of a team of lawyers trying a high profile class action antitrust lawsuit against an energy company two years ago the case which eventually settled had him in san diego most of the year but he continued to do yoga it "helped me get through what otherwise was a horrendously stressful experience " he says "in yoga you get in these compromising positions that stretch you but they are strength oriented poses youre being told to relax and once you can relax and breathe when you have your foot behind your head then anything anyone throws at you throughout the day you can internalize " he says mr shaeffer has noticed that in court he is able to keep his body physically relaxed he does not clench his jaw or fists "this provides my mind an alternative to what i do every day its an escape " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
