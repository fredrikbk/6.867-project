theory &amp practice tweaking the stock option grant firms rework terms to keep plans benefits and minimize problems even as many companies abandon stock options as a form of pay others are tweaking option plans in a bid to keep the plans benefits while minimizing potential problems some are tying options more tightly to corporate or share performance telecommunications company level communications inc is taking the "option" out of options by eliminating executives ability to decide when to exercise them "a lot of companies are looking at different varieties of options because of a greater desire to tie compensation to business performance " says joe farris a senior consultant at mercer human resource consulting who advises firms on compensation plans options give holders the right to buy shares at a predetermined price usually the share price on the grant date options became popular in the s as a way to link the interests of executives and shareholders since options are valuable only when the share price rises but the incentive often didnt work as advertised some executives manipulated grant dates to increase profits legal and regulatory changes have made that kind of manipulation more difficult other executives granted options just ahead of good corporate news that was likely to lift the share price later or just after bad news that had lowered the share price and therefore the exercise price more broadly critics say options dont reliably reward performance they can confer windfall gains for temporary price swings rather than reward steady share increases moreover many options last as long as years increasing the chances that even poorly performing shares will rise above the exercise price at some point letting option recipients cash in in response many companies are cutting back or eliminating options particularly after new accounting rules last year required companies to record options as an expense stock option grants constituted of chief executives long term incentive pay in versus in according to a mercer survey of u s listed companies other companies are keeping options but tweaking them some are shortening the options terms

options remain rare only about of the companies in the cook survey used them in but the consultancy expects them to gain in popularity level had adopted elements of these approaches in its options it granted options quarterly the options could be exercised only if level shares outperformed the standard &amp poors stock index and executives had a narrow two year window to exercise the options but members of level s compensation committee wanted additional changes says james e kim a cook consultant who advised the board in particular they wanted to further narrow the window in which executives could exercise the options so gains from the options would be more consistent with share performance mr kim says mr kim suggested an unusual fix require the option to be exercised on a single day three years after it was granted if the share price on that day is below the exercise price the option expires worthless the plan would rob level executives of any control over when to exercise their options which was risky "executives dont like to have their hands tied " says jesse fried a law professor at the university of california berkeley whose ideas influenced mr kim but level directors
