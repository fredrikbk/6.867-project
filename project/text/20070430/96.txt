why japan may raise rates even if prices fall tokyo faced with the rare combination of an expanding economy and weak consumer prices the bank of japan may consider a highly unusual monetary policy step later this year boosting interest rates even if prices are actually falling a central bank normally raises interest rates to prevent overheating of the economy or to rein in inflation when it cuts rates its aim is to stimulate spending by companies and individuals to boost the economy or to keep the economy from slipping into deflation a harmful downward spiraling in prices the japanese central bank finds itself in a challenging position of having to deal with two conflicting situations in the banks semiannual outlook report released friday it said it expects the economy to continue to grow at a healthy clip for the current fiscal year but it also slashed its inflation projection and said that prices which are usually expected to rise in a healthy economy will remain almost flat the bojs forecast is viewed by economists as an important indication of how the bank plans to conduct monetary policy in coming months at fridays meeting the bank voted to keep its target for short term interest rates at where it has stayed since february thats by far the lowest rate among major economies well below the u s s and the euro zones in the report the bank acknowledged consumer prices arent recovering as much as expected and sharply lowered its inflation forecast the bank said it expects the core consumer price index which includes energy but excludes volatile fresh foods would rise just in the fiscal year ending march in october it had forecast a rise the core cpi for march also announced friday was down from a year earlier the second monthly decline in a row in part the cause was energy prices falling from record highs of a year ago but even after discounting their impact the index was still down indicating that price falls were widespread economists say the cpi figure could keep falling for the next several months as energy prices continue to drop from year earlier levels though they say this is temporary and its unlikely that japan will go back to having persistent price declines still such weakness in prices would make it difficult for the bank of japan to raise interest rates raising interest rates too quickly could discourage consumers and businesses from spending depressing demand and putting more downward pressure on prices but another part of the bojs report said the japanese economy will stay on a sustained growth path this year more than five years after it started to emerge from a slump that lasted more than a decade the median forecast by the banks nine policy board members points to a growth rate of for the year ending march that is in line with their earlier projection released in october and matches the rate that the central bank estimates the japanese economy reached last fiscal year some economists interpreted this forecast as a sign that the bank will stick with its stated policy of raising interest rates gradually regardless of the price trends indeed bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui hinted that price declines may not preclude a rate increase if such action is deemed necessary "even if prices are falling on a year on year basis we must adjust interest rates if the economys expansion mechanism is in place and the long term trend of prices is solid " mr fukui told reporters friday he added though that interest rates will be "kept at very low levels for some time " there is a reason the bank is anxious to raise interest rates even though prices remain weak concerns about asset inflation in fridays report the bank explained in detail how low rates and expectations that rates would stay low for a long time could lead to overheating in financial and real estate markets land prices in some parts of tokyo surged more than last year prompting experts to warn about potential property bubbles the low rates have also been encouraging investors to borrow money at super low rates in japan to invest elsewhere in the world a strategy known as the carry trade that has led to concerns that the flow of capital could be distorted and has helped push down the yen against other major currencies triggering complaints from japans trading partners carry trade has also been blamed for recent rallies in everything from indian stocks to south african bonds some economists say they expect at least one more rate increase this year "the boj will try to push through as many rate increases as possible while the economy is in a growth cycle " says yasunari ueno chief market economist for mizuho securities
