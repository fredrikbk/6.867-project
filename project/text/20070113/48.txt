politics &amp economics democrats take on health care house passes drug pricing bill battle with insurers looms washington house passage friday of legislation taking a swipe at drug companies is just the first front in the new democratic congresss battle with the health care industry the next target insurers who will face demands for cuts in their medicare subsidies on a to vote the house passed legislation that would require the government to negotiate prescription prices with the pharmaceutical industry currently private insurers handle the negotiations for medicare and the government is barred from getting involved an arrangement that critics say leads to higher prices than if the government used its clout twenty four republicans joined the democratic majority in backing the measure but its prospects are less certain in the closely divided senate and president bush has threatened a veto the price negotiation bill is just the new congresss first maneuver on health care after many democrats promised on the campaign trail to lower drug costs in medicare the federal health program for the elderly and disabled beyond that key democrats are attacking another big change republicans brought to medicare while they controlled congress as part of medicare drug benefit legislation lawmakers seeking to inject more private sector involvement in the program dramatically increased federal payments to private insurance plans operating in the medicare advantage arm of the program in medicare advantage private insurers provide seniors a full range of medical benefits as an alternative to the government run program seniors automatically become eligible for medicare when they turn but then have the choice to sign up instead for coverage through a private medicare advantage plan democrats say the payment increases in the legislation projected to be worth as much as &# billion over the decade beginning in are a waste of taxpayer money and they view medicare advantage as an attempt by republicans to privatize the traditional program now some democrats want to reduce payments to the private plans and budgetary concerns are heightening the pressure on the payments to insurers the state childrens health insurance program a federal block grant will soon need to be reauthorized and many democrats would like to expand it congress is also likely to boost medicare payments to doctors at a time when democrats are aiming to be fiscally responsible such spending would likely have to be offset "there are precious few areas where we can save money medicare advantage is a prime target to pick up a few dollars " says rep pete stark the california democrat who heads the house ways and means panels health subcommittee in the senate a democratic aide predicts medicare advantage money will become "the standard pay for" in lawmakers legislative proposals following a lobbying and advertising blitz by drug companies to block the democratic attacks health insurers are preparing their own counterattack americas health insurance plans the industrys washington based trade group is telling lawmakers that cuts in insurer subsidies would be tantamount to cuts in benefits for constituents and it has readied maps to show the growth of medicare advantage plans throughout the country compared to relatively sparse numbers before government payments increased it will tap the coalition for medicare choices a group for medicare advantage beneficiaries that ahip started and funds to bring satisfied customers to congress and ahip will highlight research showing that a large portion of medicare advantage beneficiaries are minorities or have low incomes populations shown to suffer disproportionately from chronic health problems that plans say they can manage better than the government of about million medicare beneficiaries million or were in medicare advantage plans as of december that compares with about million or who were enrolled in the plans in december "this is the ultimate in constituency politics " says karen ignagni ahips president and chief executive beyond their philosophical complaints many democrats say medicare advantage wastes government money former house democratic aide brian biles has done a study concluding that on average the government is spending &# more each year for every beneficiary in medicare advantage compared to what would have been spent if the person had remained in regular medicare in the "overpayment " as democrats call it totaled &# billion according to a november report by mr biles and others for the commonwealth fund a private nonprofit foundation that supports health research an independent panel that advises congress on medicare also documented the payment differential "its a problem because it causes us to waste a lot of taxpayer money " mr stark says "i see no reason to do it " ahip disagrees with the methodology used in the study and it points to medicare data showing that medicare advantage beneficiaries save an average of &# a month in reduced out of pocket costs and extra benefits compared to people in the traditional program insurers say the program has also succeeded in extending and expanding medicare advantage to rural areas where it was lacking and that means they can count on rural state legislators to battle the democratic attacks "we wanted equity in those plans weve got it now " says iowa republican sen charles grassley "people in iowa ought to have the same choices as those in new york miami and los angeles "
