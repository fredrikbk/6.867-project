shacknai calls hundreds of physicians on their birthdays and sends cards to their wives the two companies competing dermal fillers juvederm and restylane are "the pepsi and coke in a product driven market that is shifting away from bellwether surgical procedures like face lifts " says mark l jewell a plastic surgeon in eugene ore bigger drug companies are nosing around too one reason they like

in eye care medicines in it reported sales of &# billion mediciss mr shacknai argues that allergans corporate culture is too staid for the business of prettifying faces and enlarging busts and that his rival chief executive mr pyott isnt comfortable with it allergan disagrees noting that it pioneered the aesthetic medicine marketplace with botox allergan acquired a breast implant line as part of the inamed acquisition to promote its new dermal filler allergan is marketing so aggressively that in one instance medicis has complained of unfair play in november and december allergan offered physicians who use lots of botox its "platinum" users free syringes of juvederm ultra and of juvederm ultra plus a thicker version for deeper folds to qualify for the freebies physicians had to use it in a so called experience trial on patients who had used mediciss competing product during the prior months medicis saw it as a ploy to steal customers it dashed off a letter to thousands of physicians lambasting the trial as a marketing gimmick "under the guise of science " allergan has defended the trial as a way to obtain more information about juvederm and patients reactions to it doctors who use botox say they want medicis to break allergans near monopoly on the cosmetic neurotoxin market many of them are irate about botox price increases the drug now costs &# per vial about more than it cost nine years ago "its upsetting " says joel schlessinger a dermatologist in omaha neb doctors say its difficult to pass on botox price increases because of mounting competition among doctors and medical spas allergan says the price increases have been modest given its investments in research and its increasing manufacturing costs mr pyott says allergan wont give botox discounts even to doctors who use lots of it because it worries that those doctors could resell it to doctors who use botox to correct medical problems such as eyelid muscle spasms which are covered by insurance last years nearly &# billion of botox sales was roughly evenly split between cosmetic and therapeutic uses the rivalry between allergan and medicis has been colored by a clash over an acquisition in the two companies discussed a marketing joint venture that would have paired allergans botox and mediciss restylane then a third drug maker inamed which held licensing rights for juvederm approached medicis about a merger medicis abruptly ended the joint venture talks with allergan without revealing why and in early unveiled a plan to merge with inamed by then however allergan also had its eye on juvederm as allergans mr pyott analyzed inamed he concluded that its other products including an obesity intervention device that is implanted surgically were also attractive allergan made a competing bid for all of inamed which was eventually accepted the deal closed in march allergan now had a dermal filler to compete with mediciss to gain regulatory approval for the acquisition allergen had to give up inameds rights to reloxin a neurotoxin similar to botox medicis scooped up the u s rights and began laying plans to mount a challenge to botox the competing product is now in human trials in the u s with a commercial launch at least a year away
