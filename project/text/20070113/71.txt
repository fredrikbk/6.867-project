the buzz marketwatch weekend investor if your friends jumped off a bridge would you its important for investors to challenge the herd confessions of a contrarian theres part of me that thinks i must be nuts to appear in print on tv or anywhere in public for that matter as one of the few skeptics or voices of reason as i prefer to spin regarding the euphoria following apples iphone introduction the announcement from apple this past week wasnt just a well orchestrated media event gone wild but a market moving experience based on a product that truly appears to be cool so cool in fact that everybody was tripping over one another to say how great it was after hearing me say on one show that somebody has to dilute the apple flavored kool aid with more water even my wife remarked "are you sure you should be writing so negatively about something so popular " well honey for a split second i was thinking the same thing myself sure its always easier to go with the crowd especially on something as popular as this but its more complicated than that this contrarian stuff isnt an act its how i think if you say white there is a good chance i will say black not because i want to challenge your choice of colors for the sake of challenging but because i will start wondering why black might not be the better choice ive often asked investors who have a predisposition to short selling a bet against the crowd why they toil in such a difficult line of work by constantly fighting the herd the answer is always the same its in their dna they cant help but wonder if the prevailing view is wrong many times of course it isnt "what most who aspire to be contrarians get wrong is that the crowd is right most of the time " says born contrarian barry ritholtz a money manager who runs the blog the big picture and who is as likely to be long stocks as he is short "however once something starts to shift contrarians are the ones who make giant scores " and while no contrarian is always right theres nothing wrong with challenging conventional wisdom in fact for investors you cant challenge enough that was the message from scottish journalist and poet charles mackays classic "extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds " enter apple what could i possibly have been thinking to challenge something so new exciting and instantly popular my gut told me that the whole thing was a little overcooked especially by analysts and other apple faithful emerging in a stepford like trance from steve jobss infomercial like presentation at macworld were talking the addition of &# billion in market value one day followed by around &# billion the next on news of something the new york times dubbed an "advanced prototype" thats still six months from rollout while the real mccoy may live up to already huge expectations imagine what would happen if the iphone was merely a modest success based on the initial thrust of the mania which has lost some of its steam in the wake of renewed apple related options backdating concerns apparently few people are sticking with a contrarian theme my what a difference a shift in oil prices can make suddenly people are talking rvs airlines and specialty chemicals nothing like an economy and stock market that appear to be hanging by the frayed thread of something as volatile as oil finally biotech blather several weeks ago i wrote about the risks of investing in small biotech stocks that have been bid up on the hope and hype surrounding late stage test results among the companies mentioned were northfield laboratories and telik following the article i heard from one broker bullish on northfield whose clients had become nervous "fortunately " he wrote "i was able to hold a few of my clients hands and keep them from joining the greenberg lemmings " two days later northfield reported disappointing results and its stock lost two thirds of its value the same thing happened a week later to telik yet another reminder of the realities of risk herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal
