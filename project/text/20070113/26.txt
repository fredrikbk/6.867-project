israel was forced into its constant defensive position in reaction to two commentaries on your dec editorial page "jimmy carters book an israeli view " by michael b oren and ali abunimahs " and a palestinian one" messrs oren and abunimah both miss one important point in the errors and apologist views expressed by former president carter israel did not seek to expel individual palestinians hamas and other organizations have forced the israeli government to adopt strictly defensive positions to guarantee its existence mr carter continues to look at palestinian suffering which obviously exists in great quantity without acknowledging the untenable dilemma the israeli government and people face year in and year out how to continue to exist while being bombed from three sides and having myriad factions of the palestinian government fight over whether to even acknowledge israels right to exist mr carter sees only the suffering on the palestinian side without seeing the root causes of that suffering to be the lies and deceit over the past plus years by a series of "leaders" who have made promises to israel the world and the palestinians and then broken those promises over and over david h glusman merion pa in regard to his description of palestinian suffering i would simply ask mr abunimah to provide a list of arab nations in which jews are welcomed and where they might live without fear of confiscation of property or the threat of death my suspicion is that the list would be very brief and laden with asterisks to explain the conditions under which jews may live mr abunimah knows that israel was created as a jewish state non jews who live there in peace are accorded more rights than non muslims for example in muslim states it seems the province of minorities everywhere to defame their hosts and express no gratitude for the security and opportunities afforded them richard klitzberg boca raton fla mr abunimah wipes away years of palestinian intransigence against the rights of the jewish state to live in peace with sophistic entreaties for the jews to make ever more suicidal concessions he shows his true side when he writes that "even if mr carters recommendations are implemented and israel withdraws from the territories occupied in the struggle over the legitimacy of a state that privileges one ethno religious group at the expense of another will not disappear " he blatantly repeats the hamas mantra that the state of israel has no legitimacy under any circumstances and should be pushed into the sea israel is a legitimate sovereign nation regardless of how privileged the arab citizens are or are not he bemoans the rigid system of passes and strict segregation between palestinian citizens and jewish settlers in his words the palestinians are "citizens" and the jews are mere "settlers" in the west bank yet in israel proper palestinians are free to patronize any establishment they choose he wails that jewish national fund land cannot be leased or sold to non jews yet no mention is ever made of the fact that the other palestinian country jordan prohibits jews from immigrating there at all the fact that palestinians have full rights knesset representation and better living conditions than arabs in practically any other middle eastern country without the sacrifice of having to serve in the army is apparently not a hamas concern ultimately he is bleating to the wrong audience let him serve humanity better by putting his commentaries in arab newspapers entreating his muslim brothers to adopt the ideal that "only equal rights and esteem for all the people in the diversity of their identities can bring lasting peace " rachel bodner brooklyn n y
