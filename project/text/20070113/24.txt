hot topic schwarzenkennedy california governor arnold schwarzenegger once extolled "the power of the market" in milton friedmans "free to choose" pbs series so its probably just as well that the late great economist wont see the regulated mess that his admirer is proposing to make of californias health insurance market as speaker of the state assembly fabian nunes remarked "this is a plan assembly democrats could have written " in fact they already have in when democrat gray davis was governor candidate schwarzenegger campaigned against that measure which was less onerous than his own new proposal mandating that business provide health insurance to all employees arnold even helped to gather signatures for a state referendum in which voters overturned that bill but now hes taking on a new political acting challenge this time playing gray davis as apparently channeled through his chief of staff susan kennedy who used to work for mr davis or perhaps the gop governor is trying to replicate the media hosannas that former massachusetts governor mitt romney garnered last year with his "universal" coverage law as with the romney plan governor schwarzenegger builds his proposal around an "individual mandate" that would require people to buy health insurance or face penalties such as garnishment of wages this compulsion is supposedly justified on grounds that treating "free riders" in emergency rooms is a significant driver of overall health costs but studies have shown that the cost of this problem is less than of overall health care spending far worse are mr schwarzeneggers proposals for californias employment and insurance markets the governor is proposing that businesses with or more employees be required to provide insurance or else pay of their taxable social security wages into a fund to subsidize insurance for the working uninsured the likely reaction of many california businesses to this new and costly mandate outsourcing to nevada or india mr schwarzenegger goes far beyond the romney plan in proposing to help pay for his scheme by taxing hospitals and doctors of their gross revenues thats right institutions operating at or near a loss would have to pay the tax so california doctors could soon be spending more time with their accountants than with patients assuming they can afford to keep their practices running at all yes we know the governor calls it a "fee" or "dividend " rather than a tax this is no doubt because the california constitution requires that any new "tax" pass both houses of the legislature with two thirds majorities so call the elephant in the room a hippo and hope the public buys it we trust this hollywood action stunt will be tested in court if not in another referendum like all such political schemes mr schwarzeneggers plan also works at cross purposes it includes new subsidies to help the uninsured obtain coverage but at the same time it would impose new coverage mandates that would make insurance a lot more expensive two rules in particular have all but ruined the market for individually owned coverage in every other state where theyve been tried the first is called "guaranteed issue " which means insurers are required to write you a policy even if you wait until youre sick to ask for it it is precisely this "guarantee" that many people use as an excuse to remain "uninsured " why not buy a new car rather than health insurance when youre healthy if you know you can always buy insurance if you get cancer the second rule is "community rating " which means insurance premiums cannot vary based on age or health status this is akin to telling auto insurers that they cant charge higher premiums to year old males with a history of speeding tickets than they do year old mothers both rules raise the cost of insurance for everyone this is all especially regrettable because california has had more market friendly insurance regulations than most other large states and this has meant lower insurance premiums according to ehealthinsurance com a single year old man in beverly hills can buy decent coverage for as little as &# a month but arnolds plan would move those rates in the direction of community rated new york where that same man would pay &# for any coverage at all like mr romney before him mr schwarzenegger is playing on the political appeal of allegedly "universal" coverage mr romney hopes to ride it to the gop presidential nomination and arnold is basking in new media admiration about the best we can say for their plans is that these state policy experiments will show other states what not to do but they are also providing cover for the proponents of greater government control of health care right on cue hillary rodham clinton endorsed "universal" coverage this week too the better alternative as milton friedman understood is to expand tax advantaged health savings accounts and to improve access and affordability by creating a national market for private health insurance consumers in california and massachusetts especially are going to need that safety valve when the bill comes due for their governors attention seeking but poorly considered plans see related letters "letters to the editor arnolds health care surprise" wsj jan
