the berger files the more we learn about sandy bergers brilliant career as a document thief the clearer it becomes that there is plenty we still dont know and may never learn on tuesday the house government reform committee released its report on mr bergers pilfering of classified documents from the national archives the committees page report makes it clear that mr berger knew exactly what he was doing and knew that what he was doing was wrong according to interviews with national archives staff mr berger repeatedly arranged to be left alone with highly classified documents by feigning the need to make personal phone calls and he used those moments alone with the files to stuff them in his pockets and briefcase one incident is particularly suggestive by his fourth and final visit to review documents and prepare for testimony before the commission the archives staff had grown suspicious of how mr berger was handling the documents so they numbered each one he was given in pencil on the back of the document when one of them no was apparently removed from the files by mr berger the staff reprinted a copy and replaced it for his review according to the report mr berger then proceeded to slip the second copy "under his portfolio also " in other words he stole the same document twice this gives the lie to mr bergers story that he was taking the documents for his own convenience to assist with his preparation for testimony to the commission if that were the whole story one copy of document would surely have been sufficient that document was an email pertaining to a draft of the millennium after action report on the attempted bombing of los angeles international airport the episode suggests that mr berger had some other motive for removing no even if he was ultimately unsuccessful in doing so but neither his april plea agreement nor the congressional report nor the report of the archives inspector general shed any light on what that motive might have been another telling revelation concerns mr bergers access to original uncopied and uninventoried documents from the files of former nsc antiterror official richard clarke among others at the time mr berger made his misdemeanor plea agreement we were assured by then federal prosecutor noel hillman that there was no evidence that mr berger destroyed or intended to destroy any original documents that was strictly speaking true but during three of mr bergers four visits to the archives in and the former national security adviser did have access to original documents of which no adequate inventory existed or exists this seems relevant given the concern that mr bergers breaches of national security might have denied evidence to history of the clinton administrations approach to al qaeda and the threat of terrorism and yet the justice department clearly gave the impression that there was no danger that mr berger abridged the historical record we now know that this was not true mr berger was in a position to remove documents from mr clarkes files and thanks to lax security breaches of protocol and undue deference on the part of archives staff we may never know whether mr berger took documents other than the five hes admitted to removing it is true that there is no affirmative evidence he did so but it is equally true that he had opportunity and a demonstrated willingness to breach security in his handling of the documents as for motive this remains shrouded in mystery in part because the documents mr berger has admitted to taking remain highly classified so the precise nature of his interest is unclear thanks to justices and the archives leniency or laxity or both mr bergers plea deal expires in just in time perhaps for the next clinton administration see related letter "letters to the editor no apology yet but hey no prob" wsj jan see related letters "letters to the editor catch and release" wsj jan
