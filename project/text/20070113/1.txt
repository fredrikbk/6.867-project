archbishop grey among the documents in the polish security services folder on covert informant "grey " a two page "note" dated oct and prepared by a col j mazurek gives a good idea of what collaborating with the communists entailed a catholic priest and philosophy professor "with moderate opposition views " grey only "partially carried out his tasks" during a recent trip to sweden reports his handler he discussed academic exchanges with an emigre medievalist the polish spooks wanted to know more about but failed to get "closer to the immigrant community " since a social club in stockholm popular with them was closed the following year col mazurek writes to his superiors grey will take a fellowship at the university of munich and is "ready to work for us in germany along the way he emphasized his commitment to us but declared that he didnt want to be treated as a dependable agent " in return grey asked for a passport but explicitly not money none of the other documents in the page folder suggest that greys spying for his country was anything but banal ineffective and as far as anyone can tell harmless thirty years on at st johns cathedral in warsaw this past sunday the new archbishop stanislaw wielgus was to celebrate mass to mark his promotion when he abruptly resigned until last month only a couple of ex secret policemen knew that archbishop wielgus was grey his "folder" was leaked to a polish newspaper soon after the vatican gave him the job he denied the charge then apologized for "weakness " but had to step down suddenly the catholic church the hero of the fight against communism and spiritual home of the late john paul ii finds itself under attack from the furies of historical reckoning another prelate resigned this week amid collaboration accusations and others are sure to follow the countrys bishops minus wielgus yesterday gathered for crisis talks the bishops were naive to believe that the church wouldnt be touched by the gathering inquisition if politicians artists and businessmen prominent or not were tarred by leaks from supposedly closed archives why not priests to the ruling communists the church posed with solidarity the gravest threat to its survival the enemy had to be infiltrated and was in agreeing to work with the secret police stanislaw wielguss vice wasnt drugs or sex but professional ambition to be able to work abroad but a man so tainted couldnt carry on in such a visible job next in line to lead europes most vibrant catholic community public opinion turned against him the church hierarchy was in danger of splitting now as the hunt gathers pace for others how many priests are "agents" more one almost forgets that in its epochal battle with communism the church won in a rout among former totalitarian states poland is a case apart except for a brutal dose of stalinism in the early s the country had been until its negotiated demise years ago a corrupt cynical largely benign communist regime the freest in the soviet bloc martial law in claimed about a dozen lives its past in other words is full of grays and after communisms fall no effort was deemed necessary by many of the victors to get south africa style "truth and reconciliation " only history refused to stay buried in hard fought electoral battles it turned out to be politically useful if presented in stark colors though some of the dissidents who suffered most adam michnik and jacek kuron to mention two fought against it the calls to "out" former collaborators were hard to ignore the kaczynski twins who hold the presidency and prime minister jobs won power in on promises of vengeance not truth much less reconciliation the unintended consequences are rich in irony some of the loudest voices in favor of "lustration " from the latin word for purification through sacrifice apparently didnt realize it would bring low not former regime hacks but people from their own ranks the communists didnt need informants about themselves the influential hard line catholic radio maryja championed lustration then fast changed its mind when its patron wielgus got into trouble making it all so much messier is that unlike in east germany polish archives are not open to the public incomplete and disorganized and possibly misleading secret policemen also could lie and embellish successes in recruiting agents to further their careers yet their scribblings have taken on near religious authority for people who otherwise detest them its also a good guess that the most important files were destroyed in the closing days of the old regime leaving thousands of people who made smaller compromises left to pay a higher public price than they might have expected to there is a special "vetting" court to screen public officials which at times uses neo stalinist methods in the cause of de stalinization but most are prosecuted in the newspapers through press leaks from the historical institute that manages the archives in an angry homily delivered last sunday at st johns polish primate jozef glemp said "today archbishop wielgus was judged based on what on scraps of paper thrice photocopied documents we dont want these kinds of courts " the year old primate is much criticized for his defense of bishop wielgus a day later a younger priest published an op ed article that said a fresh cadre of polish priests was ready to take over from the older generation and so lustration is a weapon for the young and only those born after can ever truly be beyond suspicion on this count among politicians the intensity of self righteous disdain for people who had to make their lives in the past era seems inversely proportional to their age to doubt the wisdom of cleansing by public lynching is not to endorse moral relativism poland could have but didnt exclude senior communists from power for a few years too little was done to prosecute real crimes or preserve and sort out the archives the past of anyone who runs for office in a democracy is fair game yet poland once a model in the region has long crossed the line from healthy historical examination to post communist mccarthyism mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
