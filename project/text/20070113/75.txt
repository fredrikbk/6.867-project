the twilight years of capn crunch silicon valley legend john draper made his name with brains and pranks before slipping to the margins three jail stints and the rave scene mountain view calif underneath a highway bisecting this silicon valley town home to google inc and other tech giants john draper crammed his bulky frame through the door of a friends home a battered chevy diesel bus radio parts a wrench set arthritis medication and a book on robotics cluttered the dashboard a padded bench for sleeping and a greasy stove filled the back "what do you want for lunch " asked dave bengel a self taught engineer "salmon " responded mr draper who has few teeth and wears the same clothes for days he is better known in silicon valley as "capn crunch " a legendary figure who years ago epitomized the freewheeling prank filled culture that gave birth to high tech "salmon all right " cried mr bengel he set about preparing the meal obtained free from a whole foods worker who leaves outdated products near a dumpster at a prearranged time in the decades since mr draper gained fame for his hacking skills as a "phone phreak" he once claimed to have gotten then president nixon on the phone silicon valley has aged and matured pioneers that mr draper worked with such as apples steve jobs have gone on to become wealthy members of the business establishment then there is "capn crunch " part of an aging community of high tech wunderkinds once tolerated even embraced for his eccentricities mr draper now lives on the margins of this affluent world still striving to carve out a role in the business mainstream although his appearance and hand to mouth existence belie it mr draper developed one of the first word processing programs as well as the technology that made possible voice activated telephone menus he receives invitations to speak to foreign governments and international conferences at a recent celebration of apple inc s th anniversary mr draper sporting a straggly beard stood to contribute a story causing the room to break into applause mr draper spent three stints in jail in the s for tampering with the phone system a court appointed psychiatrist once found him to be "psychotic " although another found nothing wrong with him until a fall at a conference in istanbul aggravated a back injury mr draper was a regular in the rave scene where people gather in remote locations and dance through the night to electronic music mr draper once did &# worth of web site design and other computer work for a bay area therapist in return for physical therapy on his back because he lacks health insurance "when i first met him he was toothless wearing ripped jeans and looked like a hippie " says tolga katas a music producer and computer programmer in las vegas who recently hired mr draper to do technical work for his new web entertainment company "then i learned what he has done and was blown away " mr draper calls aging veterans like himself part of an "off the grid" community steve inness helped develop touch screen cellphone technology and does programming work for startups in recent years hes lived on the floors and couches of employers he was last seen hitchhiking in the desert outside las vegas roy kaylor built one of the first electric cars in the early s and contributed to a government supported effort to develop the technology he lives in a trailer without electricity in the santa cruz mountains mr drapers recent lunch host mr bengel designed an electrohydraulic machine tool and says he has worked for several silicon valley companies mr draper is the best known "he was the king of the nerds " says allan lundell who runs an independent film company and has chronicled the evolution of silicon valley mr drapers father was a u s air force engineer and the family moved frequently his younger brother ron recalls john rummaging for electronic parts on military bases where the family lived on one occasion building a radio station in his bedroom john was not an easy child often bucking under the authority of his sometimes distant father who is now deceased john threw tantrums when his parents smoked says ron a piano teacher mr draper says he hated his parents smoking and felt aggrieved by their refusal to stop "our father didnt understand what john needed which was a constant supply of education and resources " says ron "he absorbed this stuff like a sponge " ron draper says his parents briefly sought psychiatric treatment for his brother when he was a child for what they said was a "chemical imbalance "i liked the sessions " says mr draper of the psychiatric counseling "at least someone was listening to me " he acknowledges he can become obsessive but denies the idea theres anything wrong with him in after taking some college courses mr draper joined the air force which his parents thought would provide much needed discipline he was sent to alaska and later maine where he served as a radar technician since the soldiers had only one phone line on which to call home mr draper began tinkering with the access codes and figured out how to make free calls through the local switchboard after an honorable discharge in he built gear for several companies in the san francisco bay area but his work much of which was military related was out of step with the counterculture blooming around him mr draper grew his hair and began spending more time on a pirate radio station which he operated from the back of his green volkswagen van to make it harder for authorities to track the signal he also turned his attention to the phone system an attraction for like minded techies before the arrival of personal computers mr draper learned how to make free calls by imitating the tones used by the phone company he learned from other "phone phreaks" as the hackers called themselves including blind teenagers with near perfect pitch mr draper learned that a toy whistle found in a cereal box would also imitate the required tones earning him the nickname capn crunch the point was not just to make free calls but to explore and learn from the phone companys rich and complicated system on one occasion mr draper says he learned the code word needed to speak with the president "olympus" and got through to someone on a secure line he thought was president nixon mr draper says he told the man about a toilet paper shortage in los angeles authorities began to take notice particularly after a lengthy article on phone phreaking appeared in the october edition of esquire magazine mr draper the groups ringleader was arrested for the first time several months later on charges of wire fraud and received a five year probation the esquire article also caught the attention of steve wozniak an eventual apple co founder who invited mr draper to his dorm room at the university of california at berkeley when mr draper appeared that evening mr wozniak then was taken aback by his guests appearance and odor mr wozniak wrote in his recent autobiography "are you capn crunch " mr wozniak asked in disbelief according to the book "i am he " mr draper responded as he strode into the room mr draper showed mr wozniak and a friend mr jobs how to build a device that could produce telephone tones the pair turned the knowledge into a small business on the berkeley campus their first collaboration before founding apple a few years later mr wozniak employed mr draper at apple where as a contractor in he designed a device that could immediately identify phone signals and lines such as ones that made free calls something modems were not able to do for a decade the technology would later be used for tone activated calling menus voice mail and other purposes apple dropped the device called a phone board anxious to avoid negative publicity from its association with illegal phoning according to former apple employees "it was a great board and others at apple didnt recognize that " says mr wozniak mr draper became closer to mr wozniak than to mr jobs who sometimes felt uncomfortable around mr draper former apple employees recall "john was a little strange and jobs felt better staying away from him " says mr wozniak who has remained in touch with mr draper over the years mr jobs in an email declines to comment just as the computer revolution was about to begin mr drapers legal problems steered him away from the action he was sentenced to prison for phone fraud in and again in and says he was attacked during that second stint by an inmate with a baseball bat permanently damaging his back the next year after his third bust for phone fraud he was berated for his behavior "you have to pay for your long distance phone calls " a san jose u s district court judge told mr draper at his sentencing according to an account in the san francisco chronicle "is that a very difficult moral concept to grasp " mr drapers lawyer replied "his entire reality has to do with the technology of computers and telephones when he gets involved with the technology aspect he loses all sense of morality " two court appointed psychiatrists examined mr draper one concluded he had an "underdeveloped sense of people" and was "psychotic" the other found nothing wrong with him according to the chronicle article in while serving a sentence of a year of nights in the alameda county jail it was later reduced to a few months mr draper wrote the easywriter word processing program at night he wrote code in longhand diligently preparing for the next day when he could spend time in the offices of a software company he founded with friends mr draper received permission from the sheriffs office to attend a computer fair in in san francisco where the program named after the cult film "easy rider " was a hit it became apples first word processing program when ibm launched its first pc it also chose easywriter over competition from other programmers including a young bill gates mr draper bought a mercedes and a home in hawaii but the company he founded capn software inc earned less than &# million in revenue over a six year period according to mr draper and matthew mcintosh who ran operations the real winner was bill baker who handled easywriters distribution and marketing through his own company without mr drapers knowledge mr baker hired his own programmers to create easywriter ii just as capn software was publishing easywriter capn software sued and the matter was settled in court with mr baker paying the pair an undisclosed amount mr baker now an internet entrepreneur in corona del mar calif says his version of easywriter was for the higher end corporate market and didnt conflict with mr drapers although he acknowledges the possibility for confusion mr baker says he helped mr draper get a start in business "there are people who see themselves as victims no matter how much money or how many opportunities you give them " says mr baker who sold his distribution company in for &# million mr draper worked for several years in the late s for autodesk inc a san rafael calif company that makes design software he was laid off along with others when new management arrived it would be his last corporate job through the s the story was the same mr draper was qualified for any number of openings but some companies didnt want to hire someone with a criminal record while others remained wary of his eccentricities promising opportunities with apple and nasa came and went he says as silicon valley was taking flight again this time with the internet boom mr draper turned to the rave scene he traveled as far as australia and india where he got by for months at a time earning money designing web sites and writing computer code mr draper several years ago developed some internet security equipment and started a company some clients were interested but the company foundered when one of its executives a fellow raver made off with much of the money from investors say mr draper and another executive john johnson mr johnson is still trying to make a go of the product with mr drapers help mr johnsons dilemma is whether to use mr drapers name or hide it "some companies say we dont want any contact with that guy " says mr johnson who says hes in advanced discussions with the u s department of defense about the product the pentagon declines to comment mr katas who recently hired mr draper to work for his online entertainment company engo com recently arranged to have mr draper meet a software executive in beverly hills as a possible source for more work before the meeting mr katas emailed the executive about the "legendary john draper " listing his achievements mr draper who was included in the email replied to the executive and mr katas that he had no money for parking and doubted that his car would make the trip across town "john just doesnt understand that if he seems unsuccessful then successful people wont understand how talented he really is " says christine marie ms marie does promotional work for mr katas and helps mr draper organize his business life handling invitations to speak at conferences and an online tv show he produces that deals with internet security she also occasionally cleans up his apartment and washes his clothes mr drapers friends from the easywriter days worry that time is running out work is getting harder to find now that tech companies are outsourcing programming work to inexpensive labor markets overseas contemporaries whove gone on to riches and fame say theyve tried to help mr draper over the years mr wozniak who now invests in high tech companies and is involved in computer education in schools recently gave mr draper a new apple powerbook computer he has also helped out with mr drapers legal bills mr wozniak says mr drapers problem is that his skills lie in technology rather in making business deals or starting a company "he didnt come from a business orientation " says mr wozniak mr drapers unusual behavior such as shouting at anyone smoking anywhere near him could wear on fellow workers and employers "he was not a self starter or associated with all the companies springing up back then " says mr wozniak "but actually john is one of the happiest guys i know no matter what his situation seems " on a recent morning at a bobs big boy restaurant in burbank calif where he goes when he has enough money mr draper ordered his usual breakfast eggs and bacon first to be followed five to seven minutes later by grilled pancakes loaded with butter and syrup the first course arrived "the bacons too greasy i cant accept these " he shouted at the waiter mr draper sends back his bacon about of the time he says that since he has no opposing teeth the bacon needs to be crisp enough to break off in his mouth he lost most of his teeth from infrequent dental care which he blames on his lack of health insurance after breakfast mr draper returned to his one room apartment beside a four lane expressway the apartment was in squalor with open cereal boxes clothes in trash bags computers and old newspapers strewn about mr draper left an angry voice message for a client who hadnt paid for some programming work he fretted that without the money he would have difficulty covering his electricity bill that month "im blacklisted man a permanent menace to society i guess " he said "its too bad because there are some things i think i could contribute "
