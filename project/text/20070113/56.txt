pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece an american classic eel spearing at setauket is a painting of formal beauty and cultural significance anatomy of a classic following a period of renovation and curatorial research "eel spearing at setauket" by the american genre painter william sidney mount has gone back on view at the fenimore art museum in cooperstown n y the star of the museums collection the work is also generally acknowledged to be one of the classics in the history of american art why because it is both a beautiful and a significant painting first is its formal beauty the serene clarity of its composition organized around its multiple pairings and reflections the two figures in the foreground dominate echoed by a second pair in a boat in the center distance the two evergreens at far left have their matched images in the water as does the lone tree at the right have its reflection below further minor notes are the two chimneys in the background the dogs ears and oarlock prongs silhouetted against the glassy water close to us the structure is classical consisting mainly of stable horizontals and verticals along with the dominant triangle formed by paddle boat and fishing spear reminiscent of a greek revival pediment dominant in american architecture at the time the boat is centered in the nearground parallel both to the picture plane and to the shoreline behind in its solid volume and monumental stance the standing figure recalls the spirit of greco roman statuary such as that of the spearbearer mount could have seen casts of ancient sculpture in his years of study in new york but the stillness harmony and sense of equipoise are also an expression of natures hold on the american imagination in the mid th century the countrys self confident spirit and mounts personal celebration of memory and meditation the scene is one of the artists youth and that of the pictures patron growing up on the north shore of eastern long island in his diaries mount recorded it as "recollections of early days fishing along shore with a view of the hon selah b strongs residence in the distance during a drought at setauket long island " a new york lawyer george washington strong commissioned the painting and mount depicts him as a youth the sitter was actually strongs nephew thomas while the towering black woman shown in the picture rachel holland hart worked during strongs childhood in the family household some historians have suggested that mount had a male pose for this figure for two years later he described a similar scene "an old negro by the name of hector gave me the first lesson in spearing flat fish &amp eels early one morning we were along shore according to appointment it was calm and the water was as clear as a mirror steady there at the stern said hector as he stood on the bow with his spear held ready " mount made several drawings to work out his pyramidal design and small oil studies that record the flat expanses of water and coastline under the warm yellow tonalities of morning sunlight in fact the feeling of the finished painting is more one of midday sun capturing america at a high noon of optimism and expansiveness mount was a democrat and a number of his paintings in this period comment on both democrat and whig politics "eel spearing" appears to be apolitical though its thoughtful mood and stable structure suit the sense of racial harmony mount achieves this by telling his story with characters marginalized in american society at the time the child the woman the black imagine how much more provocative his work would have been had the dominant figure been a black male new york was the locus of strong abolitionist antiabolitionist arguments in democrat james k polk was elected president and in the years that followed negotiations to annex texas soon led to the mexican american war with the wider conflicts of territory slavery and nationality culminating in the civil war over a decade later at the same time this was a period of growth prosperity and invention in america westward exploration and settlement would culminate with the california gold rush in new york was the center of dramatic commercial advance as a consequence of the erie canal and its opening up of the interior no wonder landscape paintings were filled with spacious skies and distant horizons quite possibly the recent invention and importation of daguerrean photography soon to be widely popularized by mathew brady in new york explains mounts frozen composition near cloudless sky and mirrored surface reflection itself had dual meanings the echoed image and the act of meditation both at work here by crystallizing a moment of the past mount was able to find a serenity in his own time at this midpoint of the s he saw order more than tension tranquility more than disequilibrium mount knew many of his black neighbors and farmhands living and working in the area and painted several as musicians or participants in local barn dancing scenes but few match the dignity and individuality we face in this image the depiction of the african american here is one of the most natural gravely sympathetic and unstereotypical rendered by a white artist in the antebellum years in coordination both she and the boy concentrate on their goal we see their shared physical as well as mental activity even a sense of interiority the ultimate paradox of this picture is that beneath its surface so still and mood so detached lie meanings so dynamic and engaged mr wilmerding teaches american studies and art at princeton university his many books cover historical and modern american art
