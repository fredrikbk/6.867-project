pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state sticky situation q i have a bottle of dom perignon champagne that i discovered while cleaning out my uncles apartment my uncle herbert was one of the most interesting people i have ever known he loved a party and the champagne would be perfect for raising a glass in his memory it is in the box and the foil is slightly sticky is there any possibility that it is still drinkable lem montgomery port gibson miss a "is this wine still good " that is one of the questions we are asked most often the simple answer is this its impossible to know for sure if any wine is sound most of the time that were asked this question its about a single bottle that has been sitting around at room temperature for years so the answer is probably that the wine is at best compromised in this case for instance the sticky foil is certainly not a good sign at the same time wine is tougher than you might think and we hear all the time from people who open a bottle that "should" have been spoiled that turns out to taste just fine youll simply never know until you open the bottle when you do taste the wine immediately its possible it has one last gasp in it before it goes completely over the hill but if it doesnt taste good then give it some time to try to pull itself together sometimes wines that arent irretrievably destroyed need a little air to bring them to life if only for a short time in other words open and drink if you cant stand to do this on your own remember that open that bottle night will take place on saturday feb thats when all of us world wide finally open that bottle weve been saving forever for a special occasion it would be a good opportunity for mr montgomery to open that dom perignon and celebrate uncle herbert under those circumstances the wine is sure to be delicious no matter how it tastes travel tip q well be in santiago chile for two days and i was wondering if you could recommend wineries near santiago that we might visit richard dulude georges mills n h a at least once a day we receive a similar question from someone going somewhere in the world our advice is always the same dont head out with a specific list go toward a cluster of wineries find them by going to google and typing in "santiago chile wine tourism " for instance without the quotation marks and drop into the small unpretentious places that youve never heard of your greatest chance of having an unforgettable experience will be a small family run winery that is flattered by your visit dont be shy just ask if you can taste and perhaps buy some of their wine dont let language be a problem a smile a "yum" and genuine enthusiasm are all you need wine itself is a universal language this is always how we travel in wine regions we dont identify ourselves as wine writers and we simply cant offer any more important advice than this
