pursuits books a literary masters happiness in an anxious age love life goethe by john armstrong farrar straus &amp giroux  pages &# in "finnegans wake " james joyce included johann wolfgang von goethe alongside dante and shakespeare in his playfully renamed literary trinity "daunty gouty and shopkeeper " the czech writer milan kundera who gave the german author a leading role alongside hemingway of all people in his novel "immortality " described goethe more conventionally as "the central point of european culture " in his native land goethe was already an institution in his lifetime plagued by visitors as an essential stop on any cultural grand tour when he died in as a very grand old man of he became a massive unassailable national monument all this has perhaps made him a figure more admired than read or at least more often analyzed and quoted than enjoyed or understood john armstrongs elegant and engaging "love life goethe" aims both to convey something of goethes multifarious achievements as a writer and as a man and to show why those achievements should still matter to us today while the germans spent much of the th century talking about literature it was only with goethe that they really began to write it born into prosperous circumstances in frankfurt he was only in his mid s when he first found literary fame with his historical drama "goetz von berlichingen" he produced one of the defining works of the sturm und drang storm and stress movement exulting in wild extremes of passion and freedom of form he also struck a decisive blow for a distinctly german theater its expressive authenticity unfettered by foreign models or arbitrary rules a year or two later in he published "die leiden des jungen werthers" "the sorrows of young werther" a short novel of intense emotion and unrequited love that not only became a keystone of german romanticism but remained to the end of his long life perhaps its authors most famous and popular work "werther" inspired europe wide fashions both in clothing and in death rebellious young men took to wearing the "werther costume" of dark blue coat yellow waistcoat and breeches while a wave of youthful suicides was said to have been prompted by the eponymous heros fate goethe would have endorsed neither trend in "werther" he wrote from personal experience of romantic unhappiness and by empathizing so strongly with his characters sufferings he undoubtedly acknowledged a melancholy streak of his own looking back on the book in later life he saw it as the story of a whole generation that had fatally weakened itself by misdirecting inward all its sensitivity and aspiration but he himself was much too solidly grounded in the world too engaged with life and with the practical business of turning it into art to wallow in alienation this is what fascinates mr armstrong directing sensitivity inward relishing alienation from the world these are things that artists have traditionally been expected to do at least since the days of the romantic movement that goethe helped to set in train as mr armstrong makes clear goethe himself took an opposite course producing great art through active positive involvement with the age in which he lived the success of "goetz" and "werther" brought goethe an invitation to the court of the young duke carl august at weimar he went not as a poet laureate or tutor as one might expect but as an administrator soon becoming responsible for the small duchys mining operations its army and its roads weimar was to remain goethes home for the rest of his life he eventually cut back his administrative duties but he devoted himself with the same dedication to everything else he undertook serious and detailed research into geology anatomy botany optics and the theory of color travels in italy to immerse himself in the culture of the ancient world and to see its monuments lessons in drawing that made him a competent amateur artist central to all this was goethes intense friendship with his fellow poet and playwright friedrich schiller an alliance that helped turn weimar into the center of a literary renaissance such as germans had dreamed of for a generation or more throughout it all goethe wrote in his troublingly modern examination of marital love "die wahlverwandschaften" "elective affinities" he more or less invented the german novel in plays such as "iphigenie auf tauris" "iphigenia in tauris" and "torquato tasso " he showed a nation of self proclaimed romantics just how powerful and versatile a home grown classical idiom could be in the lyric poems that are the enduring record of his life and loves and in the vast verse drama "faust " goethe developed a literary language and syntax that have marked all subsequent german usage as decisively as the language of shakespeare has marked english the edition of his collected works that he revised just before his death ran to volumes mr armstrong convincingly anchors goethes work in all its formal and thematic diversity in the distinctive character and personality of goethe the man that character and personality were no more easily won than the achievements of his art goethe himself wrote in that "in nature and in art the sole and supreme process is to create form and structure " his english admirer thomas carlyle years later observed that "he has cultivated himself and his art he has studied how to live and how to write with a fidelity an earnestness of which there is no other living instance " at times in some of his relations with women or in his apparent indifference to political upheaval goethe could seem complacent selfish or aloof the boswell of his last years johann peter eckermann describes the extraordinary detachment with which after receiving news of a bereavement that might have been expected to affect him deeply the great author "sat before us like a being of a higher order inaccessible to earthly woes " mr armstrong paints a nuanced picture firm of purpose impatient of anything he saw as inessential his goethe is yet supremely human the british edition of "love life goethe " published last year is subtitled "how to be happy in an imperfect world" as opposed to the u s version "lessons of the imagination from the great german poet" happiness is what mr armstrong considers most attractive and most unusual in his subject the happiness goethe sought and found in an age more given to anxiety and strife combined self confidence self knowledge and self control with an imaginative openness to all that the world has to offer carlyle saw in him the same quality and called it wisdom there is nothing smug about it mr armstrongs account of goethe is appealing precisely because it shows that happiness is complex and difficult and worth striving for "all we devise and do is exhausting " goethe wrote "happy the man who doesnt get weary " he never did mr brunskill is obituaries editor of the times of london
