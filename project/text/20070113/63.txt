pursuits sports golf journal the kid is alright she may yet go bust but the michelle wie problem is ours not hers michelle wies teenage years continue to be awkward for us if not for her by late friday it appeared all but certain that she would fail for the fourth time to make the cut at the mens pga tour sony open in hawaii but no matter on monday as usual ms wie will return to classes at her high school in honolulu she will giggle and shop at the mall with her girlfriends this spring will play in another dozen or so tournaments around the world through the summer and in september enroll for her freshman year at stanford where as a pro she will not play college golf typical teenage stuff except for the tournaments and the year old ms wie shows no signs of being stressed by it all only excited we on the other hand are stuck with the uncomfortable task of figuring out what to make of her not too long ago we could safely slot her into that most delicious of categories the child prodigy after winning the u s womens public links at making her the youngest person ever to win a national adult u s golf association championship her international celebrity eclipsed even that of tiger woods at the same age in part because she was tall and beautiful and in part because mr woods had proven what was possible and put the world on high alert for the next big thing but since then the trajectory of her career has been impetuous erratic fun daring and contradictory teenager y in other words leaving us golf fans as befuddled and occasionally angry as actual parents of teens instead of romping through the junior tournament ranks as mr woods did ms wie decided instead to play selectively in lpga usga and international events and hasnt won once next she insisted on playing three or four times a year against men and even had the temerity to announce that some day she hopes to qualify for the masters this rubbed a lot of people the wrong way some worried that losing badly to men might shatter her confidence but others simply seemed to think that girls had no business on the pga tour in mens events so far she has made only one cut adding more complexity to the situation is the confusing amount of money ms wie is raking in since turning pro months ago more than &# million annually according to the just published golf digest list of golfs top earners that makes her the highest paid woman athlete in the world beating out tennis star maria sharapovas take of &# million and inspiring untold jealousy among her fellow competitors i dont claim any special knowledge about ms wie but it does strike me that much of the criticism lobbed the wies way often at her professor father and caddie b j wie is based on some questionable assumptions first theres the matter of her having been a child prodigy apparently being fast out of the gate in life doesnt necessarily confer any long term advantages because by the time they reach their teens more ordinarily talented kids often catch up "just because a child at is considered a prodigy in golf does not predict that she will continue to excel above others she may have hit her height there is no way to know ahead of time " says ellen winner a professor of psychology at boston college and the author of "gifted children myths and realities " becoming a productive adult requires many traits such as self knowledge that go beyond the original skills that prodigies master when young but expectations for them remain high sometimes destructively so another strain of wie blasting contrasts her path through adolescence with that taken by mr woods who steadily gained confidence by beating up on his peers but ms wie matured early at she was already feet tall and so unlike mr woods who was still a stripling into his late teens she was fully capable of competing against the worlds best in her gender in eight womens majors since she has five top five finishes and she also seems to be learning from playing against the men if ms wies primary objective had been to win big as quickly as possible presumably she would have played in more tournaments the wie camp seems to be taking the long view especially given that now shes headed off to an elite college and has said she wants to graduate why then did she turn pro you try walking away from that much money while having to pay expenses and for transportation to top tournaments around the world for outsiders of course its impossible to know whats really going on in somebody elses life but i am impressed by the degree to which ms wies spirit remains feisty and enthusiastic and by her ability to shrug off criticism "how many people are going to have an opinion of me everyone " she said in a lighthearted but revealing interview with peter kessler on xm satellite radio this week "but i cant just be thinking like oh wow if shes going to think that way about me im ruined then you arent living your own life if people dont like it well they can raise their own daughter and have her do things the way they want " ms wies golf career might still go bust but im not going to trust any verdict delivered until say she will be then the same age that another former prodigy lorena ochoa was last year when she finally came into her own and took the lpga player of the year award away from its eight time winner annika soerenstam email me at
