the week ahead our take on coming events newspapers extra extra bids due tribune sale draws yawns by sarah ellison wednesday night as the final bid deadline for tribune co arrives the company could be throwing the first large cap media party that nobody shows up for while a few private equity firms could band together in a half hearted bid for the media group compared with the spirited competitions for such properties as clear channel communications inc and univision tribunes sale process has generated mostly shrugs from the private equity world and there isnt a mcclatchy like suitor either as there was with the sale of knight ridder last year instead most of the attention lavished on tribune has come from so called vanity buyers such as david geffen and ron burkle who are interested in the los angeles times but tribune like many other newspaper firms is saddled with tax issues that make selling itself in pieces prohibitively expensive tribunes last and best hopes may lie with its own major shareholders either a bid from the chandler family the companys largest shareholder and the one that ironically triggered the whole public auction process or a management led buyout aided by its own mccormick tribune foundation the management controlled charity that is the companys second largest shareholder if tribune ends up without a good bid for the entire company it will be back where it started over seven months ago with a lagging stock price disgruntled investors and no certain path for solving its strategic problems oddly that could be a partial vindication of tribune management dennis fitzsimons and his board had explored tribunes options in private a year ago before pursuing the modest route of a stock buyback it was then that the chandlers who have little faith in the newspaper business decided that a public fight had a better chance of boosting the stock price than any long term management strategy in the end tribune could decide to split up the company with tv stations and newspapers going their separate ways this too was an option that was on the table seven months ago and the rift between tribune management and the chandlers arose partly over its timing the auction process has helped buoy tribunes shares which have held up better than many of its peers whatever the outcome it is likely to be a sharp lesson to investors hoping to shake up the newspaper industry and save their investment if the tribune auction shows anything it is that there is no easy solution for public newspaper companies neither private equity firms nor wealthy individuals can undo the fundamentals of declining readership and advertising and tribune management might come out looking surprisingly smart one often heard complaint from private equity executives tribune has been too tightly run and there is little fat left to cut energy big oil in house sights hopes senate cools debate by john j fialka big oil is set to take a beating from house democrats on thursday when they are prepared to vote on a bill they say will "roll back" about &# billion worth of subsidies the executive branch and congress have given oil companies the move is part of the house democrats hour legislative blitz once the bill reaches the senate however the race will turn into more of a marathon george washington once said the difference between the two houses is that the senate provides a "cooling saucer" for the passions of the moment to die down the new senate majority leader harry reid reminded senators of president washingtons words earlier this month with a memo saying the senate could take "several months" to analyze the package the delay will give the nations independent oil producers a chance to make their argument which is that the house democrats are throwing a boomerang that could strike the wrong companies and then loop back and hit the nation in the form of higher fuel prices and even greater reliance on foreign oil the house democrats package includes three major items one will impose a "conservation fee" on about companies producing oil in the gulf of mexico that have leases from and and which failed to include a clause requiring royalty payments if oil prices rose which they have the omission was caused by an interior department error but if the companies dont pay the fee the proposal would bar them from getting new leases democrats will also reduce accelerated tax write offs for oil and gas exploration expenses and shrink a tax depreciation measure contained in a jobs bill that gives companies producing oil and gas in the u s the equivalent of a corporate tax reduction the senate will ponder the impact of the changes at a time when of the nations oil comes from overseas and when of the nations domestically produced gas and of its crude oil come from wells drilled by independent oil companies many of which are midsize or smaller "this will have a bigger effect on us and we have fewer places to raise and spend our revenue " says lee fuller vice president of the independent petroleum association of america referring to the exploration subsidies if gasoline prices rise in the spring though george washingtons proverbial saucer may not work the issue could heat up again medicine delivering a jolt to defibrillators by thomas m burton starting this coming week television viewers will be treated to smiling faces soothing narration and cheerful melodies in ads about sudden cardiac arrest medical device maker medtronic inc the worlds no manufacturer of surgically implanted heart defibrillators by market share will take its message about the cardiac electrical devices directly to the public in print and television ads such "direct to consumer" ads have been a staple of the pharmaceutical industry for years but they are unusual in the device business for big drug makers ads have ginned up billions of dollars in sales but they have caused big headaches as well for instance the public clamored for heavily promoted painkillers such as merck &amp co s vioxx and pfizer inc s celebrex millions of people demanded the new pills when aspirin would have been fine for most then alleged cardiac side effects appeared in vioxxs case potential liability from heart attacks was vast and merck pulled the drug off the market medtronic of minneapolis and the entire &# billion defibrillator business are beset with the opposite sort of problem the majority of the public doesnt exactly know what "sudden cardiac arrest" is frequently confusing the condition with a heart attack so hundreds of thousands of people dont know that a defibrillator might actually save their lives also highly publicized but rare malfunctions two years ago in defibrillators made by guidant now part of boston scientific corp predisposed many people against the devices sales growth ebbed throughout the industry yet an estimated americans die annually of sudden cardiac arrest in which the hearts electrical system goes haywire and the heart cant pump blood more than of sudden cardiac arrest cases are immediately fatal but an implanted defibrillator can dispatch an electrical jolt to correct the aberrant heartbeat survival rates are far better with heart attacks in which a coronary artery supplying the heart becomes blocked the message of medtronics ads is simple in thousands of patients who have congestive heart failure or who have suffered prior heart attacks the devices save lives because such people are at elevated risk of sudden cardiac arrest having an implanted cardiac defibrillator or icd the ads say can mean " more kisses more football wins an icd could give you many more bedtime stories tons of hugs and one more thing peace of mind " for medtronic the tv spots are an effort to jump start a business grown sluggish the defibrillator industry was riding a sales growth rate of and higher until now one analyst piper jaffrays thomas gunderson pegs likely u s industry sales growth for this year and next at no more than for medtronic defibrillators are expected to make up more than &# billion of the companys estimated &# billion in fiscal sales so will these ads lead to overprescribing too that seems unlikely because getting a defibrillator isnt like popping a pill no one in his right mind would volunteer for surgery to get a &# electrical device installed unless it was a medical necessity
