the weekend interview with tom lasorda plebeian prince detroit tom lasorda is under no illusions he is facing the toughest professional challenge of his life the turnaround at chrysler group which mr lasorda heads has come full circle since his taking the helm in september chrysler has gone from being a shining success story to just another ailing detroit car company facing yet another round of painful "restructuring" meaning factory closings and layoffs "ive had tough challenges before but i had less responsibility then " says the year old executive whose boyishly exuberant style on this side of the atlantic surprises german journalists who see a more reserved man on display when mr lasorda visits stuttgart the headquarters of daimlerchrysler "this one is bigger im the guy " meaning the guy on the spot mr lasorda aims to announce chryslers latest restructuring plan in mid february he wont disclose details of the plan which is still being developed but theres little question that chrysler will get smaller in its quest to regain profitability after posting operating losses of &# billion in the first nine months of last year "currently we have too much production capacity for what we see " mr lasorda says "the fundamental issue is how we see the market and where its headed we are reassessing our whole sizing situation " mr lasorda is sitting in an erector set room in the midst of cobo hall the cavernous site of this weeks detroit auto show surrounding the room are gleaming displays of chrysler vehicles dodge magnums and nitros jeep grand cherokees commanders and wranglers chrysler sebrings and cs with their hemi v engines most are high horsepower vehicles that powered chryslers comeback but then faded from favor as gasoline prices surged in late last year chrysler built far more cars and trucks than it could sell unsold inventories piled up the company pushed dealers to buy more cars even shipping cars to dealers who didnt order them dealers angrily pushed back last month mr lasorda sacked the companys top sales executive and took the role himself after this interview he is heading to a conclave of chrysler dealers the message hell deliver "first of all thank you for helping out last year " he says "second the focus this year will be on profitability and well maintain a good balance between inventory and market demand " assuaging the dealers is an unlikely role for a man who built his reputation as a manufacturing ace but then much about chryslers tom lasorda no relation to the tom lasorda who once managed baseballs l a dodgers is unlikely though hes a prince in detroits car kingdom mr lasordas roots are decidedly plebeian his maternal grandfather was a united auto workers union official in canada who once went to jail for his organizing activities in the unions early days his father frank was union president at a chrysler plant in windsor ontario the town across the river from detroit where mr lasorda grew up he was one of nine children including an identical twin brother tony to whom he remains especially close as children tom and tony sometimes checked coats at union functions frank lasorda clearly is proud of his son whose career he says is testament to the values tom learned in a union household "its easy for people in his position to push people around " frank says but he taught his son "if you want the respect of people you need to show them the same respect " in after being graduated from the university of windsor tom lasorda started working for general motors in labor relations at a factory near toronto a decade later he made the move that propelled his career gm built a joint venture factory with suzuki motors in canada mr lasorda volunteered and became steeped in the japanese techniques of "lean production " in contrast to traditional mass production lean production keeps minimal inventories of parts reducing waste and forcing the manufacturing process to be highly disciplined also workers are asked for ideas to boost factory efficiency and promised they wont be laid off as a result in mr lasorda volunteered again for a dilapidated factory gm had acquired in recently liberated eastern germany under mr lasorda the plant was refurbished and started building gm opel cars with outstanding efficiency and quality in he was lured to chrysler as a senior manufacturing executive chrysler having been acquired by germanys daimler benz in was reeling from multibillion dollar losses in came dieter zetsche as mr fixit he fired executives closed factories and revamped the model lineup by chrysler was churning out profits again the turnaround earned mr zetsche the ceos job at daimler chrysler in september mr lasorda took the helm as chryslers president and ceo his timing couldnt have been worse in the wake of hurricane katrina a month earlier gasoline prices were soaring sales of the high horsepower cars that had fueled chryslers turnaround plunged and then mr lasorda the manufacturing whiz lost basic manufacturing discipline "we built too much inventory last year " mr lasorda concedes as he tells it the problem crept up on the company mr lasorda cut production in july and august but he didnt cut it enough partly because chrysler overestimated how many cars and trucks it could sell last summer and fall chryslers &# million summer advertising push to reprise s "employee pricing" campaign fell flat as did the television commercials featuring mr zetsche as "dr z " chrysler posted a &# billion loss in last years third quarter ending consecutive quarters of profits "our strategy didnt work " says mr lasorda "we didnt deliver ever since then weve been taking production down balancing it with the market " meanwhile in the quest to add fuel efficient small cars to chryslers lineup mr lasorda is turning to china his deal to import cars from chery automobile co likely will make chrysler the first detroit company to import chinese cars to the u s its yet another irony for a man with deep union roots but mr lasorda says he has no choice "we cant compete in this segment with our cost structure in canada and the u s " he says "so what do we do just sit and wait " when he gets questions from friends he explains "ok why dont you put your consumer hat back on for a second and please tell me everything in your house that is chinese your ipods your computers your dvds and then go through your clothing racks and determine where thats all from and dont forget that the cars youre buying today already contain components from china " its all a far cry from the import bashing that chryslers most famous ceo lee iacocca was doing years ago as for concerns expressed by gm and toyota executives that chinese made cars arent good enough for the u s market mr lasorda disagrees "i walked through their plants " says the manufacturing expert "i walked through their engineering labs i walked through their suppliers plants and their design studios " he saw lots of western made high tech equipment he explains and "i was quite convinced " detroits car companies including chrysler cite health care costs for their employees and retirees as a big competitive burden not shared by auto makers based overseas at mr lasordas behest chryslers non union employees now pay a portion of their health insurance costs thats proportionate to their income and he himself pays his entire tab about &# a year "i looked in a mirror " he explains "and said i can afford to pay more than the administrative person who makes &# a year " but his egalitarian attitude which he attributes partly to his union upbringing hasnt won mr lasorda points with the uaw the union has made concessions on health care costs at general motors and ford but has refused at chrysler the only one with a rich corporate parent mr lasorda isnt happy "that has bothered us no doubt about it " he says "we hope to have a dialogue with the union on health care costs by the end of the month " mr lasorda sees a greater role for government in health care perhaps by providing catastrophic care insurance but hes wary of too much government involvement "i come from a country with universal health care " he says "it was fantastic now it has deteriorated " specifically he explains canadians often cant find urgent care when they need it when one of his sisters in windsor had a heart attack a couple years ago there was no local cardiologist available she was taken to a detroit hospital for care mr lasorda and his wife doreen his high school sweetheart will celebrate their th wedding anniversary this summer the two play golf together to relax though mr lasorda says there hasnt been much time for that lately the couple has two daughters both in their s last summer mr lasorda became a u s citizen and now holds dual citizenship he expects to retire in the u s one day he says so getting a u s passport made sense twin brother tony is a successful entrepreneur who sold his merchandising company three years ago and has retired the twins often find themselves dialing each others phone numbers just to chat at virtually the same moment "theres nothing closer in life than a twin " says mr lasorda tony lasorda says that given the challenges at chrysler tom "would like to be in my shoes " but he adds "given his determination id be betting a lot of money hell succeed" in righting chryslers ship mr lasordas german bosses are betting that way too at least for now "i am getting great support from dieter zetsche and the rest of daimlerchryslers board " he says "theyve told me to come out with your plan and deliver on it " but he adds "obviously if i dont deliver they have other choices " mr ingrassia vice president of news strategy for dow jones is a former detroit bureau chief for this newspaper mr stoll is bureau chief for dow jones newswires in detroit
