reach out to cubas people with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad visiting venezuela today it might be a good time to consider another "change in course" for u s policy the isolation of cuba a legacy of the cold war is pushing that country closer to americas most dangerous enemies in a recent open letter to president bush several major cuban dissident groups called for an end to u s restrictions on travel and remittances to cuba now joining their call is the miami based cuban consensus a coalition of pro democracy groups including the "hard line" cuban american national foundation the advocates for the current policy chiefly three intransigent cuban american representatives in congress are increasingly alone if we dont lift the travel and remittance restrictions now it is not just the cuban people who stand to suffer allowing cuba to slip further under the influence of venezuelas newly reelected hugo chavez the proud new ally of iran would be terrible for the u s these restrictions are regulatory which means that the president could eliminate them tomorrow but the helms burton law freezes the larger economic embargo in place until the communist regime dismantles its security apparatus and calls for free elections and until both raul and fidel castro are gone with the changing of the guard in havana there will be opportunities for incremental reform the new congress must amend helms burton to give the president the flexibility he will need to seize them any major opening such as diplomatic talks or relaxation of the embargo should be conditioned on cubas release of political prisoners economic reforms freedom of speech and a dismantling of the neighborhood spy system that has driven cuban society into such a heartbreaking state of paranoia but helms burtons rigid all or nothing approach creates no incentive for cubas communists to undertake even the most minor reform for many supporters of the current policy isolating cuba has become almost an end in itself nothing could be more perverse if cuban culture is exposed to globalization it will fuel yearning for the freedoms of modernity if we expand diplomatic contact we will begin to discover allies within the regime allowing cuba to join the international trade and finance system which u s law largely prevents will multiply the incentives to liberalize by isolating cuba and driving it into the arms of hugo chavez the only real beneficiaries are communist hard liners and their patrons cubas communist regime has two conflicting needs isolation and money ending isolation will rebuild the bridges between cubans and their most natural allies the american people it would also likely expose cubans to the political and commercial culture of one of the most spectacularly successful immigrant communities in the u s that of their exiled family members in miami relaxing the flow of funds from the u s would also turn a communist need to our advantage the more cuba depends financially on the u s the more leverage we will gain in pushing for economic and political reform cutting the regime off from sources of financing may have made sense after the fall of the soviet union when cuba had nowhere else to turn but now it has venezuela with fidel castros removal from power and imminent demise the key obstacle to reform within the regime has disappeared a new generation of bureaucrats now has a chance to gain influence many of todays younger "communists" are less interested in the revolution than in maintaining stability and much less interested in venezuelas patronage than in normalizing relations with the u s for cubas proud armed forces the prospect of becoming servants to mr chavez is not attractive unfortunately u s stubbornness leaves them little choice cubas increasing dependence on mr chavez is dangerous for the u s venezuela uses oil money to fuel a global campaign against america venezuelan intelligence services set up shop wherever they can in latin america to eradicate government officials educated in the u s or suspected of pro american sympathies bolivia ecuador and nicaragua are falling firmly into venezuelas orbit and throughout the non aligned movement mr chavez trades oil money for diplomatic support against the u s in a new kind of cold war worse after his recent election victory mr chavez seems to be claiming a mandate for an even more stridently castroist and anti american position all of which will influence the direction of the cuban regime looming on the horizon is an even greater threat irans intelligence services perhaps the most prolific and sophisticated terrorist organization in the world use diplomatic channels to build their network and there are clear indications of a renewed hezbollah effort in south america thus venezuelas new alliance with iran represents a grave danger to the whole hemisphere venezuela is already putting enormous pressure on cuba to expand its ties with iran an iranian foothold just miles from our own shores would be a catastrophic setback in the war on terror relaxing cubas isolation would help diminish a gathering threat to national security and bring hope to cubans everywhere that the long tragedy of communism and exile may finally be coming to an end mr loyola is a fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracies
