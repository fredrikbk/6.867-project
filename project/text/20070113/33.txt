memory abuse the california supreme court is expected to rule soon in a first amendment lawsuit that could seriously affect scientific research and investigative journalism the main defendant is dr elizabeth loftus an eminent psychologist who became famous as a critic of "repressed memory" the dubious theory at the center of the sensational child sex abuse cases that shattered so many lives in the s and s according to repressed memory theorists psychotherapy and other suggestive techniques can allow people to remember traumatic events of many years before that the mind has obscured one woman claimed to recover memories of parental abuse when she was six months old dr loftus rejects the theory beginning in the s she conducted groundbreaking studies showing that the mind is in her words "malleable selective and changing" and can "manufacture wholesale and out of pure nothingness whole events and past events that never occurred " then in psychiatrist david corwin published a case history that seemed to capture on videotape a young woman actually recovering repressed memories of sexual abuse by her mother "jane doe" granted dr corwin permission to discuss publicly and display the videotapes he did so repeatedly playing the videotapes on the national lecture circuit showing jane supposedly remembering the abuse and disclosing other intimate details of her life dr loftus and colleague dr melvin guyer investigated easily able to determine jane does identity and other information about her from publicly available court records and news clips they went on to interview close family members and confidantes as well as her biological mother who lost custody of her thanks to the sex abuse claims in jane doe lodged an ethics complaint against dr loftus with her then employer the university of washington the universitys two year investigation exonerated dr loftus after which she and dr guyer published "who abused jane doe the hazards of the single case history" in the skeptical inquirer questioning dr corwins claims about jane does recovered memories then the tort lawyers got involved jane doe filed a lawsuit in her own name nicole taus the first time her identity was disclosed publicly ms taus claims that dr loftus invaded her privacy by investigating and reporting on dr corwins study she seeks compensation for alleged emotional distress and punitive damages the california supreme court which heard arguments in december should dismiss this case and make clear that this kind of lawsuit will not be tolerated the controversy over repressed memory is a matter of great public interest and as the u s supreme court has repeatedly held "speech concerning matters of public affairs is more than self expression it is the essence of self government " occupying the "highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values " tort lawsuits especially those seeking punitive damages can have an especially unconstitutional chilling effect indeed the landmark decision new york times v sullivan declared that "the fear of damage awards may be markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute " dozens of renowned scholars and scientists declared in a friend of the court brief that "permitting personal lawsuits against scientists who investigate locate and expose errors or misconduct in controversial research publications would have damaging effects in all areas of science " such lawsuits could also threaten investigative journalism to gather and report news on controversial topics journalists employ many of the investigative techniques used by scientists like dr loftus they scour public records and reports and then interview friends family members business associates and adversaries of people who have become the focus of public attention and scrutiny and like dr loftus journalists also follow up on reports by other journalists and news organizations this frequently entails trying to determine the identity of anonymous sources for previous reports to test the validity and determine the significance of the information those sources have provided examples are legion covering everything from the watergate scandal of the s to the current cia leak controversy and the ongoing war in iraq this process of continually digging deeper into a news story is essential to discovering and reporting the truth so that the american people can make their own judgments about matters of politics and public policy ms taus claims that dr loftus intruded on her privacy by allegedly lying to ms tauss foster mother about who she was in order to get the woman to talk to her during the interview the foster mother told dr loftus that ms taus had engaged in self destructive behavior after her interview with dr corwin and the alleged recovery of her memories to be sure neither journalists nor scientists view misrepresentation as a routine information gathering technique and dr loftus denies making false statements to ms tauss foster mother but the factual dispute about who said what to whom before the interview with dr loftus is ultimately beside the point ms taus had no "right to privacy" regarding information known to a third party who was under no legal obligation to keep it secret and ms taus gave up any privacy with regard to the repressed memory issue when she voluntarily injected herself into this public controversy by repeatedly consenting to dr corwins public display of the videotapes and the disclosure of intimate private facts about her life any other holding would upend longstanding legal and constitutional principles courts have consistently ruled that the common law and the first amendment bar privacy claims based on disclosure of even private facts about a person under such circumstances as the supreme court has declared "privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of public importance the risk of this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places a primary value on freedom of speech and of press " dr loftus and her colleagues have already been embroiled in litigation for three years and if the california supreme court allows the case against them to go forward they will be forced to endure invasive discovery and a long and costly trial even if in the end they win the damage to them will be serious as will the threat to scientific research and a free press mr boutrous is a partner in the law firm of gibson dunn &amp crutcher see related letters "letters to the editor the
