politics &amp economics fed chairman may face heat at hearings when federal reserve chairman ben bernanke testifies on monetary policy next month he is likely to get far more scrutiny than usual by law the fed chairman must testify twice a year to congress in february and july ordinarily each installment lasts two days one before the senate banking committee the other before the house financial services committee there are no other witnesses in a break with that tradition barney frank the massachusetts democrat who took over the house panel this month said he plans to hold an additional day of hearings in which witnesses such as economists and labor experts will give their views on what mr bernanke said mr franks plans which he described in an interview friday with the wall street journal suggest mr bernanke who has held the job for just under a year and is to testify on monetary policy on feb and could face added political heat for unpopular steps such as raising interest rates it also raises the importance of his cultivating lawmakers to pursue potentially contentious initiatives such as a numerical inflation target mr frank said that while he opposes an inflation target the fed has the authority to implement one without congresss approval mr frank said the fed shouldnt allow a target to result in employment being subordinated to inflation and he wouldnt allow the federal reserve act to be amended to allow that to happen however mr bernanke has argued an inflation target doesnt require the act to be amended and in fact enhances the feds ability to boost employment the fomc is now in the midst of a lengthy internal discussion over how it communicates including whether it should adopt a target mr frank appeared open to that argument he also said he was "impressed" by mr bernankes performance as fed chairman while wall street often interprets rising wages as inflationary and bad he noted mr bernanke has said it isnt bad as long as the rise in wages is matched by productivity and doesnt result in businesses trying to raise prices political opposition is one of the greatest stumbling blocks to fed adoption of an inflation target and assuaging mr franks concerns would go a long way toward removing that obstacle senate banking committee chairman chris dodd d conn said in a statement friday that he is "open to examining ways to help further the feds efforts to achieve its dual mandate" of maximum employment and stable prices and "will view any proposals under the broader lens of their effect on keeping our economy strong and improving opportunity for all "
