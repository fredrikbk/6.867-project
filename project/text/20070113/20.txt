friend of court briefs in guantanamo case your dec editorial "the former magnificent seven" applauded a ruling by the d c circuit court of appeals that rejected a friend of the court brief we submitted on behalf of seven retired federal judges in a case relating to prisoners detained at guantanamo although you hinted broadly that the brief was a political ploy you neglected to mention that three of the seven retired judges were appointed by republican presidents including one who testified in support of justice alitos confirmation you also claimed that in violation of advisory opinion no the former judges "had appended the title judge before their names in the filings " actually the friends of the court merely mentioned their former service on the federal bench in identifying themselves and explaining their interest in the case as federal rule of appellate procedure c specifically required them to do you also discussed advisory opinion no without mentioning the fact that as judge judith rogers noted in dissent it has nothing to do with friend of the court briefs in fact the supreme court and federal appeals courts around the country routinely accept such briefs from former judges particularly in cases of significance to the constitution and the rule of law for example the supreme court in hamdan v rumsfeld the d c circuit in qassim v bush and judge easterbrook of the seventh circuit in lindh v murphy all accepted friend of the court briefs submitted by former judges patricia a bronte agnieszka m fryszman douglas a sondgeroth chicago
