honey i audited the children if tracking allowances is a problem for parents it says more about their own accounting system or lack of it than about their kids "allowance " pursuits jan my year old daughter must tabulate what comes in allowance plus job and what goes out expenditures on a spreadsheet monthly if she doesnt do it or it doesnt pass my audit then there is no allowance until she does pass double entry bookkeeping which goes back centuries marked a major financial advance and parents who dont teach their kids some variation of it are derelict its fun and gratifying to see my daughter struggle to get her tabulation to be consistent from one month to the next when she grasps what is involved it will scale up to her own household or even a business when she reaches adulthood samuel burkeen reston va
